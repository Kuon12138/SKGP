2018-10-23,"A strange thing is happening with utility stocks. Traditionally, when interest rates move higher - typically measured by the movement of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield - investors rotate away from utilities. But that hasn&apos;t been the case; in fact, the opposite is true. Instead, the sector&apos;s safety aspect is winning out, and jittery investors are piling into the space. &quot;In a market like this, in a dramatic selloff, the rotational effects will be higher than the interest rate effect,&quot; says Jay Hatfield, CEO and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Management. Broadly speaking, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates, independent power producers and electric utilities are best at handling the market adversity. Multi-utilities and water providers are losing ground, just like the rest of the market. But specifically, what are the best stock picks in this defensive sector - where investors can duck for cover?

## Chart indicators

Even though utilities outperformed broader markets in 2018, the recent weakness is a concern. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of top utilities in the country, fell almost 10% in the second half of December. Let’s see where top utility stocks might go in the short term.

NextEra Energy (NEE) is trading at $169.8—almost 4% below its 50-day simple moving average and marginally above its 200-day moving average level. The 200-day level close to $168.9 will likely be crucial support for NextEra Energy stock going forward. NextEra Energy’s RSI (relative strength index) is 33.

## Southern Company stock is oversold

Southern Company (SO) stock is trading in the “oversold” zone with its RSI below 30. RSI levels at extremes indicate an impending reversal in the stock’s direction. Southern Company is trading 5% and 4% below its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. The fair discount to both of these levels indicates weakness in the stock.

Recently, Duke Energy (DUK) and Dominion Energy (D) shares fell below the 50-day moving average, which suggests weakness in the stock. Duke Energy and Dominion Energy have an RSI close to 34, which indicates that they aren’t in the oversold or the overbought zone. Their respective 200-day moving average level might act as a support in the short term.

## A shaky start to 2019

Utilities, the defensives, underperformed broader markets last week. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of the top utility stocks in the country, closed marginally down. The S&P 500 gained almost 2% in the week ending January 4. The broader markets were still volatile. The better-than-expected jobs report for December and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on being patient about raising rates helped the sentiment late last week.

## Movers and shakers

NextEra Energy (NEE) fell marginally, while Duke Energy (DUK), the second-biggest utility by market cap, fell 0.8% last week. Duke Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9275 per share last week, which indicates a dividend yield of 4.4%. The ex-dividend date for the dividend is February 14. The dividend will be paid on March 18. Duke Energy has a long dividend payment history. Duke Energy has paid a cash dividend for 93 consecutive years.

According to Reuters, wildfire-stricken PG&E (PCG) is considering filing for bankruptcy. The company is facing a multi-billion dollar liability associated with wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Bankruptcy isn’t certain yet. However, the company reported in November that its existing insurance wouldn’t be enough. The wildfire-related liabilities could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition. PG&E fell 30% in after-hours trading on January 4 following the news, according to Reuters.

Top regulated utility stock Southern Company (SO) rose 1.7%, while Dominion Energy (D) fell 1.4% last week. Dominion Energy completed its much-awaited SCANA (SCG) acquisition last week.

Southern Company (SO) stock offers a potential upside of more than 7% over the next 12 months. Analysts gave the company a median target price of $46.9—compared to its current price of $43.7.

Dominion Energy (D) has a median target price of $76.6—compared to its current price of $71.2, which implies a potential upside of 7.6% over the next 12 months.

Utilities’ outperformance last year was mainly driven by market uncertainties. The recent weakness in utilities could be an opportunity given the fair valuation of many big names. Considering the estimated gain based on analysts’ target prices and the current dividend yield, top utility stocks present an attractive total return for 2019.

## Dividend growth

In this part, we’ll discuss the S&P 500 Utilities with the highest dividend growth over the last five years. Utilities at large managed to raise their dividends per share by an average of ~4% in the last five years compounded annually. Competitive utility AES (AES) increased its dividend per share by more than 26% compounded annually during the same period. However, AES has a shorter dividend payment history. The company started paying shareholders in 2012. AES offers a dividend yield of 3.8%, which is higher than utilities’ average of 3.3%.

## NextEra Energy

NextEra Energy (NEE), the biggest utility by market cap and the largest component of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), increased its dividend 11% in the last five years. NextEra Energy’s superior earnings growth has fueled its above-average dividend growth in the last few years. NextEra Energy yields 2.6%—one of the lowest yields among its peers.

Despite a lower yield, NextEra Energy outperformed broader utilities and even broader markets in the last several years. To learn how NextEra Energy achieved this feat, read These S&P 500 Utilities Have Delivered the Best Five-Year Returns.

In comparison, leading water utility American Water Works (AWK) has raised its dividend 10%, while California-based Edison International (EIX) reported a higher dividend growth of 12.4% in the last five years. American Water Works is trading at a yield of 2%, while Edison International offers a yield of 4.3%.

## Total returns

Xcel Energy (XEL) outperformed Consolidated Edison (ED) in terms of total returns in the last several years. We considered dividends paid in a particular period and capital appreciation to calculate the total returns. In the past year, Xcel Energy returned more than 6%, while Consolidated Edison returned -5%. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) returned more than 5% during the same period and beat broader markets. Investors turned to relatively safer utilities late last year amid market turmoil due to their higher dividend yields and stable stock movements.

## Xcel Energy outperformed

In the last five years, Consolidated Edison returned 70%, while Xcel Energy returned 107% and outperformed utilities at large. Xcel Energy’s relatively higher earnings growth compared to its peers during this period might have played out well. Consolidated Edison’s dividend yield was higher than Xcel Energy in the last five years. We’ll discuss the two utilities’ dividend profiles in the next part of the series. Utilities (XLU) at large returned 65% in the last five years.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the biggest utility by market cap, was the top performer regarding total returns. NextEra Energy’s consistent and above-average earnings growth influenced its stock performance and fueled its superior dividend growth in the last few years. NextEra Energy returned more than 150% in the last term. To learn more, read These S&P 500 Utilities Have Delivered the Best Five-Year Returns.

2019-01-16,"Wildfires caused by PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) appear to now consume PCG stock. This utility finds itself in trouble as its negligence led to numerous wildfires across northern California. As a result, PCG stock is now in freefall.

In its descent, PCG has exhibited the one trait one never wants to see in a utility stock -- instability.

### RIP PCG Stock

I usually think &quot;opportunity&quot; when I hear about instability in most stocks. I often see a scandal or a setback in an equity and think &quot;buying opportunity.&quot; Events such as a big earnings miss, an unexpected CEO departure, a sex scandal, or the like often hit companies. Stockholders often react overreact to such occurrences, selling off a stock much more than the ensuing event justifies.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The lows of the financial crisis serve as a great example. Investors who bought into the S&P 500 near its March 2009 low of 611 benefited from huge profits once the negative feelings abated.

Not this time.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens 



PCG stock lost more than 40% of its value on Monday. After Monday, the freefall continued. Since early October, Pacific Gas & Electric stock has lost more than 85% of its value.

Negligence by PG&E over poorly maintained power lines sparked wildfires causing billions in property damage. Sadly, many also perished in these fires. This will not go away with a few million in payoffs or a better earnings report in the next quarter. Given the magnitude of the financial damages PCG stock faces, bankruptcy remains its only viable option.

As of this writing, PCG trades in the single digits and continues to fall. Another shoe dropped as the S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Teleflex (NYSE:TFX) would replace PCG stock in the S&P 500 on Jan. 18.

### Utility Stocks Require a Different Investor Mindset

The issues go well beyond mere company negligence. The company also violated a rarely discussed assumption. PCG stock represents a utility. Nobody invests $5,000 in a utility in hopes of finding the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and getting rich. Investors buy a utility stock to benefit from a stable, slow-growth equity that yields dividend income.

More than that, investors expect these companies to define stability. These firms rarely face competition when they own the infrastructure. Their profit growth tends to mirror household formation increases and inflation. These firms often generate healthy dividends, but little else in the way of news. Peers such as NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Southern Company (NYSE:SO) quietly keep the power on, collect profits and pay dividends.

If anything displaces a utility, one expects it would entail a technological shift such as the solar roof from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Few expect widespread negligence to take such a company down. However, PCG has become the exception. Looking back, the 2000 film Erin Brockovich should have served as a clue of the chronic issues that persist with PG&E. The negligence that caused the lawsuit discussed in that movie did nothing to change the company. As a result, PG&E faces another bankruptcy. Now, investors have to rethink whether the Warren Buffett mantra of &quot;buy when there's blood in the streets&quot; (or in California's case, when there's fire) should apply to utilities.

  * Top 10 Global Stock Ideas for 2019 From RBC Capital 



### Final Thoughts on PCG Stock

Due to its negligence, Pacific Gas & Electric reminded us that the instability we might tolerate from most equities has no place in a utility stock like PCG. More often than not, mistakes or unexpected setbacks create buying opportunities in stocks. However, with the essential role utilities play, instability can easily destroy such a company. This has become the case with PCG stock. Now, bankruptcy has become the company's only option.

Bottom line, utilities should draw little attention. PCG stock broke that cardinal rule in the most outrageous manner imaginable. Now, bankruptcy courts will decide the fate of PG&E. It goes without saying that those who own this equity should get out before its lights out. More importantly, it reminds us that utility stocks should generate dividends, not attention.

2019-01-22,"Utility stocks had a great 2018 ... for the most part. Yes, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) broadly finished the year with a marginal gain. But mounting U.S. and global worries helped push the sector to a spectacular 20% run between the February lows and the mid-December highs.

Heading into 2019, it looks as though utility stocks could be among the better performers this year, too, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.

&quot;For equity investors, risk is high and the margin of safety is low because stock valuations are elevated compared with history,&quot; Goldman Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin and team wrote in a Nov. 19 note to clients. &quot;We forecast the S&P; 500 index will generate a modest single-digit absolute return in 2019.&quot;

Although the bank believes cash is an excellent place to allocate some of your capital in the year ahead, when it comes to actual stock picks, utilities are high on its list - so much so that it raised the sector to &quot;overweight.&quot; Why? Several analysts are predicting a slowdown in GDP growth in 2019, and historically, when that happens, utilities tend to outperform the markets as a whole, in part because the sector has traditionally had a low beta to the S&P; 500.

Goldman also suggests that investors need to buy quality companies with stable earnings and revenues to prepare for the year ahead. Utilities fit that to a T, and typically deliver better-than-average dividend yield to boot. So with all that in mind, here are the 10 best utility stocks to buy for 2019.

2019-02-13,"Investors are increasingly hyped up when it comes to earnings season. At least that's the hope and prayer for the folks over at CNBC that need all the excitement that they can get to lure viewers. And while some corporate chieftains, including JP Morgan's (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett are campaigning to end quarterly reporting, earnings season is really just a normal update on how business is going for companies.And earnings season comes, of course, every quarter -- quarter after quarter -- year after year. And for the last quarter of 2018, out of the 505 stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index, 358 have released their report cards for the quarter.And the news is pretty good. Sales overall were up on average by 6.88% and earnings were up on average by 14.20%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's no wonder that the S&P 500 is up by 10% year-to-date and we're only in February. And that's after last quarter's selloff on fears that the earnings were as good as they were going to get and that growth was only going to be just good, and not spectacular.But there are plenty of companies that aren't on the list of over-hyped stocks that jump and fall on every little morsel of opinions from talking heads on CNBC, particularly during quarterly reporting times. They tend to be dependable businesses and are focused on longer-term shareholders and not day traders. And they pay nice dividends.  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy Each of the following dividend stocks I'm going to explore below has already filed its quarterlies with continued good results without fanfare. Assets PayI'll start with one of my favorite industries -- fund management. Fund management is all about assets under management (AUM). The more AUM, the more fee income that a company will earn. The goal is to keep AUM stable to increasing and fee income will follow. You don't have to be spectacular in managing the assets (although it helps), but you do have to be good at keeping and raising more AUM.One of the best in this market is AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). It has ample AUM, which is up to $550 billion after AB gained $800 million in the last quarter. That is boosting fee income nicely and feeding an ample dividend.AllianceBernstein (AB) Assets Under ManagementSource: BloombergThe dividend distribution is currently 64 cents for a yield of 8.29%. And that distribution is rising over the past five years by an average annual gain of 12.62%.Shares have generated a return of 101.02% over the past five years -- amply outperforming the S&P 500 Index. It makes for one of the better dividend stocks to buy under $33. Powered UpUtilities make for one of the most reliable stock sectors for both longer-term growth and regular to rising income. They serve that function particularly well during times of market strife due to the reliability of demand for their core products and services.If you think that they underperform the general stock market, you'd be wrong. Over the past 20 years, U.S. utility stocks, as tracked by the S&P Utilities Total Return Index, have outperformed the general stock market as tracked by the S&P 500 Index.The market for utilities isn't about sacrificing return for just dividend income, rather, it can be a potent rival for the returns you expect from more growth-oriented stocks.What's more, utilities can be a great defensive counterweight in your portfolio.For example, during the market rout from October to year-end 2018, the S&P 500 was down, heavily, by 14.28%. But during that same time, utilities managed to outperform with a positive return of 1.66%This is all thanks to the combination of reliable core business assets and higher dividend payments that utilities represent.Of course, not all utilities are the same and neither are all dividend stocks. They can include a host of essential services including electricity, natural gas and water. And they are comprised of both regulated and unregulated businesses.Regulated business means that the companies have contracts set with specific rates for gas, electricity and water that are set by local public utility commissions (PUCs).This means that the companies with regulated markets must lobby local PUC officials for acceptable rates that take into consideration the cost of providing the services as well as the capital costs of the operations for the services.In addition, PUCs, along with other regulatory bodies, must approve any expansion of regulated services, including new plants and transmission or other conveyance lines. And they also need to gain approvals for payments for upkeep and repairs. All of this takes a wide array of skillsets by management to make the most for shareholders while keeping customers and their PUCs content. This includes negotiating and lobbying as well as budgeting and market supply-and-demand forecasting.Yet, at the same time, regulated business means that companies can conduct longer-term budgeting for capital expenditures as well as having better forecasting for revenues and profitability.This means that utilities can provide smoother performance for shareholders, especially in challenging times. That adds stability for investors over the long term.Then there is the unregulated part of the utility market. This can include wholesale provision of essential services for industries as well as for other local utility companies that will contract for gas, power or water.This is where some companies can provide larger-scale services across local markets and even across the country. The companies in this space can provide the opportunity for investors to cash in on their success in markets with less regulatory oversight on rates.One of the best utilities in the market is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). The company is primarily comprised of two operating units that take advantage of both the regulated and unregulated power utility market.Based in Florida, NextEra has its primarily regulated power company in Florida Power & Light. The operation provides power through a variety of generating sources, including natural gas, coal and oil, as well as nuclear power plants. Its customers number in the millions and are primarily residential customers, with some commercial customers.In addition to its own power generation, it also contracts with external power generators that transmit power via the power grid to supplement its own power generation.The other side of the company is Next Era Energy Resources. This division of NextEra provides unregulated wholesale power around the U.S. with some additional assets in Canada and Spain. Much of its power generation comes from traditional power plants, but increasingly wind and solar generation provide a large portion of its power. It has quickly become one of the largest renewable power generation companies.In addition, NEE also has some petroleum and natural gas pipeline assets that take advantage of the company's reach across the U.S. Revenues from the regulated FPL side of the company represent the larger sum of revenues, which continue to expand at a reliable three-year average of 1.58%. This makes for a steady cash flow for the company.The company continues to focus more on the NEER division, which provides the namesake for the overall company. The idea is that the next era in power generation will be ever more focused on renewable energy sources. This is supported in that the revenues for the NEER unit have expanded to become 28.55% of overall revenue of the company.The industry is benefiting from state and local legislation around the nation requiring that a portion of power be generated by renewable sources. In addition, NextEra's renewable power expansion is also benefitting from Federal tax credits for renewable energy facilities. These come based on capacity and not just the amount of power generated. This means that the company can operate wind and solar facilities around the nation and not just in areas that are particularly sunny or windy.NextEra Energy (NEE) Total ReturnSource: BloombergThe company is a stronger performer for investors. The return on its capital is running at 9.90%, while the return on investor's equity is a whopping 21.30%. And this is resulting in the market recognizing its performance now and for the future. The shares have delivered a total return over the past five years of 127.76%.Yielding 2.42%, it makes for a good buy under $185. Pumping ProfitsPetroleum has been one of the better markets for companies last quarter with sales gains for companies reporting of 12.14% (so far within the S&P 500) and earnings growth of 102.19%.  * 7 Reasons to Own Coca-Cola Stock One of the more reliable segments of the petroleum market is in the midstream segment of the toll-takers of the pipeline market. And one of my favorites dividend stocks in this space is Plains GP Holdings (NYSE:PAGP), which has a great network of pipes and related assets throughout North America including the vital Permian Basin in the U.S.Revenue continues to flow with gains over the trailing year of 29.90%. And the shares are valued at a huge bargain as they are trading currently at a 90% discount to the trailing sales of the company.As a passthrough, the distributions are shielded from current income tax liabilities making the dividends all the more valuable on a tax-equivalent basis. With the current distribution of 30 cents per year, it yields 5.03%.Plains GP Holdings (PAGP) Total Return Source: BloombergAnd the overall shares have been dependable for income and for an overall total return over the trailing twelve months of 12.29%. It makes for a good dividend paying toll-taker under $26.65.All My Best,Neil GeorgeNeil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

2019-04-29,"The utilities sector is one of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500, but it is still beloved by conservative investors seeking higher dividend yields and lower volatility. Fortunately, there are dozens of ETFs dedicated to this sector.For tactical traders and investors looking for entry points into utilities ETFs, this week is an interesting time for the sector. This week, over 43% of the S&P 500 Utilities Index reports first-quarter earnings, meaning this could be an eventful span for an array of utilities ETFs. The earnings spotlight dims somewhat next week for utilities, but more than 18% of the aforementioned utilities gauge reports earnings during the week of May 6.To this point in earnings seasons, &quot;six of the eleven sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Health Care and Utilities sectors,&quot; said FactSet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLU) is the largest utilities ETF and a fine option in its own right, but let's explore some other utilities ETFs here. Fidelity MSCI Utilities ETF (FUTY)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.084% per year, or $8.40 on a $10,000 investment.While the aforementioned XLU is the largest utilities ETF, the Fidelity MSCI Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:FUTY) is the cheapest fund dedicated to this sector. FUTY tracks the MSCI USA IMI Utilities Index and has nearly $635 million in assets under management. FUTY holds 67 stocks, giving it a deeper bench than some rival, large-cap utilities ETFs.This utilities ETF's top 10 holdings combine for nearly 53% of the fund's weight and include Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D). Fidelity clients can realize addition cost benefits with FUTY because this utilities ETF is part of the firm's expansive commission-free lineup.&quot;Utilities are usually considered a safe choice with stable returns, unlike the tech companies that have been driving most of the stock market's growth over the past decade,&quot; reports Evie Liu for Barron's. &quot;But as the market pulled back significantly last year, even steady gains can become top-notch performance.&quot;S&P Capital IQ has a Marketweight rating on the utilities sector while Ned Davis Research has an Overweight rating on the group. Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum ETF (PUI)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.60%Utilities ETFs are usually seen as low beta fare, but there are ways to bring some spice to the group. That includes the Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PUI), which eschews the cap-weighted methodology associated with many traditional utilities ETFs.PUI, which carries a four-star Morningstar rating, follows the Dorsey Wright Utilities Technical Leaders Index. That index &quot;is designed to identify companies that are showing relative strength (momentum), and is composed of at least 30 securities from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. Relative strength is the measurement of a security's performance in a given universe over time as compared to the performance of all other securities in that universe,&quot; according to Invesco.  * 8 Stocks to Buy Whose Products America Loves The average market value of PUI's 30 holdings is $16.88 billion, putting it at the lower end of utilities ETFs by that metric. Nearly 61% of this utilities ETF's holdings are classified as large- and mid-cap value stocks. None of the fund's holdings exceed weights of 3.90%, which is also low compared to traditional utilities ETFs. First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund (FXU)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.63%Somewhat quietly, the First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXU) is home to over $908 million in assets under management, making it the third-largest US-listed utilities ETF. Like the aforementioned PUI, FXU is a smart beta utilities ETF, not a cap-weighted fund. FXU, which soon turns 12 years old, tracks the StrataQuant Utilities Index.Components in FXU's underlying index are measured based &quot;on growth factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets,&quot; according to First Trust.Even with its unique methodology, this utilities ETF has a decent dividend yield of 2.35%. However, historical data indicate FXU has struggled to beat traditional utilities ETFs over long holding periods, indicating its high fee is hard to justify for long-term investors.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-02,"By any conventional measure Southern (NYSE:SO) is a hot utility stock. SO stock is up 20% since the start of the year, against a 16.5% gain for the average stock in the S&P 500. Yet the 60 cent per share dividend, which is covered by earnings, still yields a fat 4.7%.Source: Shutterstock While Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), which tied its future to renewable energy, has gone into bankruptcy, Southern continues to stand tall.What could possibly go wrong? To put it simply, the rise of wind and solar power.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Southern's Nuclear StrategySouthern is one of the largest operators of nuclear power plants in the country, with six in all.  It's building two more, an expansion of its Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Assuming the plants come on stream by 2022, Southern will have an additional 2.4 Million megawatt hours of capacity to sell, over 10% of the region's demand.Of course, that's a big if. A similar nuclear expansion across the river, in South Carolina, cost $9 billion, resulted in 9 rate hikes, and was eventually abandoned. The utility company behind it was sold to Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) for $13.4 billion in cash and assumed debt.For now Vogtle is the only nuclear power going up that qualifies under the Republican plans for &quot;green energy,&quot; and the project is being showered with largesse in the form of federal loan guarantees that now total $12 billion.  The expansion, originally slated to cost $14 billion, now has a budget of $28 billion. Changing WindsAs costs for solar and wind energy continue to fall -- they're now cheaper than maintaining coal-fired power plants -- the long-term fate of nuclear energy is increasingly precarious.Southern directors see which way the wind is blowing. They recently tied CEO Tom Fanning's pay to cuts in SO stock's carbon footprint.  But those plans are highly dependent on finishing Vogtle and getting that energy into the grid. The riskiest operating periods for a nuclear plant are when it's new, as the Vogtle plants will be, or when it's past its useful life.These are the long-term risks SO stock, and the southeastern U.S. economy, are running as construction on the plants continues. SO Stock EarningsSouthern reported earnings May 1. Earnings per share were in line with estimates at 70 cents. Meanwhile, revenue came in a bit low at $5.4 billion instead of the expected $5.8 billion. This isn't great, as revenues generally peak in the first quarter, which covers the winter, and the third quarter, which covers the summer.SO stock fell about 1.7% on the news.Analysts don't seem to know what to think of the risk-reward balance for so, with 13 of 21 just saying hold, against 2 buyers and 5 sellers. We'll see how that changes in light of Q1 earnings, however.The dividend is one of the highest in the utility sector, but most stock buyers today want risk and utilities, by their nature, are not risky investments.The red light flashing on Southern remains the debt, used to finance the nuclear power plants. It totaled $40.5 billion at the end of 2018. That debt load must be matched against the company's equity value, $54.3 billion. Its bonds currently yield about 4.6%, close to the stock's yield. The Bottom LineA recent analyst report on Southern said it offered &quot;short-term gain and long-term pain.&quot; That's about right.Southern stock has been the best-performing among the big southeastern utilities this year, outpacing NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Dominion and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). But the debt load is huge, and Southern has already sold $12 billion in assets to keep the bonds afloat, including its solar energy portfolio and Gulf Power, which serves Florida.For Southern stock and debt to pay off, the nuclear plants not only have to go online, but operate profitably, over decades, in an environment where solar and wind costs are continuing to decline.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away That's not a good bet for a risk-off investment.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-09,"Technology is the alchemy of the stock market. It is where companies turn worthless silicon into incredible new and expensive gizmos and devices. And it is where other companies conjure up applications and software out of the thin air of their employees' minds.So, no wonder investors love to find the latest companies as soon as they can to invest in the attempt to capture that sort of alchemy.And it shows in the performance of the technology sector of stocks. If you look at the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index over the past 10 years, it has generated a total return of 478.85% as compared to the general S&P 500 Index's return of 282.42%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsS&P Information Technology Index vs. S&P 500 Index Total Return Source BloombergBut there are many challenges in investing in technology. One of them is the vast uncertainty of ideas going from start to viable. And then, even with viability, the companies behind them still have to perform as profitable companies -- at least eventually. And along the way, they tend to share little of their wealth in dividend distributions to shareholders, as many tend to burn cash rather than piling it up. That's why you don't see so many of them among dividend stocks lists.This shows up in the average dividend of the S&P Technology Index which is a paltry 1.37% as compared to the S&P 500 Index at 1.92%.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips So, what about the idea of finding technology companies that are bringing new products to eager markets and that are profitable enough to pay better dividends? These companies do exist, and their shareholder are profiting from them with growth and income. Here are five from varied technology markets that are profitable and pay well. Hercules Capital (HTGC)Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) is based in the Palo Alto, California, which is home of many of the tech companies of the past and future. The company is set up as a Business Development Company (BDC) and really operates much like a merchant bank. It searches out technology companies from varied sectors and provides financing for development. And in turn, it also takes equity stakes via varied means, including warrants, which provides additional payouts when the companies come to the public market or are sold to other, larger companies.It has hundreds of companies in its portfolio and has had a series of major bold-faced names in its history of investments. And the returns to shareholders has been impressive. Over the past five years alone, the shares have generated a return of 52.6%And this return comes with a nice dividend currently yielding 9.4%. The company has been increasing revenues by 8.8% and has an impressive net interest margin (the difference in funding costs to investment earnings) at 9.3%. This drives an impressive return on equity of 14.5%.Yet the stock is still a bargain at only 1.34 times its book of asset. It makes for a great buy in a taxable account. Microsoft (MSFT)I know that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't an unknown company nor an undiscovered stock, even among dividend stocks. Yet it is a transforming company in the technology space. It has gone from a company that relied on unit sales of software packages and other products to services and products that are sold by subscription or on contract for recurring revenue.And it performs for shareholder. For the past five years, it has generated a return of 254.75%.It has done so with a big build-out of its cloud computing business and subscriptions for its software and other products. And this provides cash for its dividend yield of 1.5%. Revenues are up by 14.3% and its operating margin is fat at 33.1%, which in turn drives the return on shareholder's equity to 40.1%.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes The stock isn't cheap, but the company keeps building up its underlying assets and sales, so a price to book at 10.12 times and a price to sales at 7.9 times isn't that bad when both the book and the sales are climbing.It should be bought in a tax-free account. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) which owns and runs data centers around the U.S. and the globe. Data centers are vital to cloud computing and data processing for much to most of the technology world.The stock has delivered with a return over the past five years of 158.5%.The company pays an ample tax-advantaged dividend, yielding 3.7%. And it continues to perform with revenues gaining by 23.9% and its operating profit as measured from funds from operations (FFO) running at 16.4%.And yet, the REIT is a value at only 2.84 times its impressive book of assets.It should be bought in a taxable account. NextEra Energy (NEE)NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a utility company -- and while those are often dividend stocks, that might not strike you as a technology company until you learn more about the company. It has a base of regulated power businesses serving Florida which provides a dependable flow of profits. And in turn, those profits work to fund its massive unregulated, tech-focuses wind and solar power businesses around the U.S. and beyond.This has made the company into one of the largest wind and solar power companies in the world. And it has delivered profits to shareholders with the stock generating a return over the past five years of 120.4%.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio And it pays is shareholders with a dividend of 2.7%. Revenues have improved by 11.85 times in just the past three years. The return on equity is running at 8.7%. And the stock is a value at only 2.63 times its book. The stock should be bought in a tax-free account. FMC Corporation (FMC)FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) is a very old company with a history of technology innovation. It has invented and sold countless products and services in varied industries and turn have delivered to shareholders. The past five years has seen a return of 30.7%.Now, you'll note that the profits have been coming more recently. This is due to the history of the company transforming itself and its focus from varied technologies over time. But now after some business sales and acquisitions over the past years it is now fully focused on the technology of improving agricultural production. It is a global leader in pesticide and herbicide products and services with pin-point technology in the type of products and their applications.In a globe in vital need of more food and other agriculture products, FMC is the go-to Ag tech company. Revenue is soaring at 64.2% and its operating margins are at a fat 18.6% which helps to deliver a return on equity of 15.6%.And its dividend yields 2% -- not the cream of the dividend stocks crop, but still solid. The stock is also a value at only 3.73 times book and 2.2 times its rapidly rising sales. It should be bough in a tax-free account.For more of my technology dividend stocks, please take a look at my Profitable Investing, which is now in its 30th year of publication.Neil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

2019-05-23,"Investing to &quot;buy and hold&quot; is trickier than it looks. The increasing pace of technological change means even the most successful, dominant companies have to continually adapt to keep up. Industries like energy, real estate and even consumer products are facing potentially significant long-term changes going forward. In any era, amassing a collection of retirement stocks simply by buying the best companies and holding them for years can be a risky endeavor.General Motors (GM) was a classic &quot;widows and orphans&quot; stock until last decade, when GM wound up going bankrupt. United States Steel (X) once was a pillar of corporate America and a buy-and-hold stock. GM shares basically haven't moved in a quarter of a century. Polaroid and Eastman Kodak were once blue-chip stocks. Both went bankrupt as cameras changed from film to digital.But there still are stocks to buy and hold out there that can last forever, while offering dividend income along the way.Here are ten such retirement stocks to hold forever.

2019-05-23,"It's a question that has nagged at investors for as long as both asset categories have existed … are stocks the way to go, or bonds? If both, how much of either belong in a portfolio?The answer to the &quot;stocks vs bonds&quot; debate is, of course, one that depends on a myriad of factors unique to each and every investors. On a pound-for-pound, dollar-for-dollar basis though, stocks are the superior option for most investors, most of the time. They're not as safe or stable as bonds when you're talking about one specific equity. For a smart, long-term investor who knows how to build a diversified portfolio though, stocks just make more sense. Bulletproof? No, they're not. They can certainly take their lumps and keep on tickin' though.With that as the backdrop, here are five specific reasons stocks win the battle of stocks vs bonds. In no particular order…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Income GrowthYes, bonds offer hyper-reliable income flow. While bond issuers can and sometimes do default on their payouts, that's a rarity. Meanwhile, it's not terribly uncommon for a company to reduce or altogether cancel their dividend, even if on a temporary basis.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy There's a flipside to that risk/reward coin though. With a bond, the semi-annual payment is fixed for the duration of that debt. With a dividend-paying stock, the payout usually grows in time. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), for instance, has upped its dividend for 45 straight years now, while NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has done the same for 24 consecutive years. Different CycleFor veteran investors who've owned both stocks and bonds through at least a couple of different economic cycles, they'll know that bonds often do well in some environments that bode poorly for stocks, while bonds tend to do poorly while stocks are thriving. Namely, rising rates -- as we've seen of late -- have pressured the bond market lower, but the corresponding inflation has coincided with solid growth from equities, since economic growth itself is generally what fuels inflation.It might take a bit of timing intuition to make good on the nuance, but savvy investors know that sooner or later, every asset will face a headwind and enjoy a tailwind, but will do so at different times. Stocks Usually Beat InflationIt has been a mostly ignored secret of late, but not only have bonds lost value of late as interest rates have risen, most interest payments from bonds haven't kept up with inflation.This year's average annualized inflation rate stands at 2.8%, though effectively speaking, the cost of goods seems to have grown a bit more than that. Meanwhile, the average yield on 30-year Treasuries is barely a bit higher, at 2.97%… and that's a long commitment. Less-committal 5-year paper is only paying 2.75%, which means in the end, holders of that debt are only breaking even relative to inflation.Yes, inflation-protected instruments like the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund (NYSEARCA:TIP) can help fight the adverse impact of inflation on debt-based interest payments. Its upward adjustment is always backwards-looking though, and never quite seems to keep up with the full pace of price increases. More Price TransparencyTo be fair, technology has come a long way, bringing bond trading via the web on par with the amount of information that stock traders have enjoyed for years now. Yet, in that the bond market just isn't as brisk or as big as the equity market is, bond prices (or bond liquidity, for that matter) aren't always perfectly clear.It's still a far cry from days gone by, when it took a phone call and several minutes, as a brokerage firm had to literally contact someone at a trading desk to make a purchase or sale. Nevertheless, the bond market remains a bit slow, and frustrating, to navigate. Better Long-Term Bottom LineLast but not least -- and perhaps a culmination of all four of the other advantages of stocks compared to bonds -- they just to better in the long run.Ask ten different experts what the average annual performance for stocks is, and you'll likely get ten different answers. Almost all of the answers, though, will be somewhere between 8% and 11%. Not so with bonds. Their average annual return is more like 5% to 6%.Granted, it takes time and patience to secure those kinds of results … time not all investors are readily willing and able to give. For the truly long-term-minded investor, though, that can ride out the rough patches, stocks simply do better. The Last Word on Stocks vs. BondsNone of this is to suggest all investors should always and only own stocks. It's also not to say bonds are to be avoided at all costs. A balanced approach has been and continues to be the smart-money move in all cases.Do keep in mind, however, for some investors there's a tendency to seek out a little too much certainty and current reliability. Considering how long people are living now after they retire from their job -- 30 years in some cases -- the bigger risk these days is outliving your money due to not thinking enough about long-term growth that only stocks can offer.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-04,"Some investors focus on buying stocks whose per-share prices are under $10 or under $5. But when considering stocks to buy, the per-share prices don't fully reflect the actual value that the market is giving companies.In other words, a stock trading at $5 per share could have a total market capitalization of $2 billion, indicating that investors think the company is worth $2 billion. But a stock that's trading at $15 per share could have a market cap of $300 million, meaning that it's actually being valued way below the $5 stock.For that reason, when I'm looking for cheap stocks to buy, I tend to focus on market cap more than per-share price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Here are three small-cap stocks with exceptionally strong growth prospects. I believe that the market is meaningfully undervaluing these names, making them excellent stocks to buy.   Small-Cap Stocks to Buy: JinkoSolar (JKS)Source: Shutterstock It's hard to believe that the world's top seller of solar panels has a market cap of under $1 billion, but it's true. According to the market, JinkoSolar (NASDAQ:JKS) stock is worth less than $1 billion, even though solar energy is rapidly growing around the world, and despite the fact that it reported that its solar cells in January reached record high efficiency levels, while it has won multiple awards due to the high quality of its modules. Additionally, JKS has signed a huge module supply deal with one of the largest utilities in the world, America's NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). NEE is extremely gung-ho on solar energy.I think it's pretty unusual for a company with a market cap of less than $1 billion to sign a huge deal with a company that's valued at nearly $100 billion (NEE's market cap is $95 billion). Just the NEE deal alone, in combination with the tiny market cap of JKS stock, makes JKS stock a great small-cap stock to buy.Moreover, by most measures, the valuation of JKS stock is ridiculously low. Its forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average 2019 earnings per share estimate, is less than ten, and its price-sales ratio is a tiny 0.1.Those who are bearish on JKS stock tend to hang their hats on two issues: the slowdown of solar growth in Jinko's home market of China and the company's lack of free cash flow. But after dragging its feet on solar-energy policy for a year, Beijing approved almost 15 gigawatts of solar projects, and Reuters recently reported that the country's government will allocate $435 million of subsidies to the sector. Research firm Roth Capital has estimated that the country could install 30 gigawatts of solar energy in the second half of this year, versus 44 gigawatts in all of 2018.If that forecast is even close to accurate, JKS stock will definitely rally going forward.As for the free cash flow issue, the company's free cash flow has been weighed down by the construction of its Florida factory, completed this year. That factory will enable JKS to sell modules to Next Era Energy, and hopefully other major U.S. utilities,  without paying tariffs on them. The company  also plans to  spend $400 million-$450 million to increase its production of premium solar panels in order to meet higher demand for them. JKS' gross margins on those panels are much higher than on the less efficient modules.Clearly, the investments that JKS has made in its Florida factory and in expanding its premium module capacity will be highly profitable for it over the medium-term and the long-term.  In the medium-term, the company's deal with Next Era, greatly increased demand for solar energy around the world, and higher gross margins from its  premium panels will cause its FCF to turn positive, boosting JKS stock.   American SuperconductorSource: Marco Verch via Trending Topics under Creative CommonsAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) is another company with a small-cap stock (it has a market cap of less than $225 million) and world-class technology and customers. AMSC has sold its Wind Turbine electrical control systems to Inox Wind , which says that it is India's leading wind-energy company and has manufacturing capacity of 1,600 megawatts and three plants. AMSC has won two orders from the U.S. Navy for its highly energy-efficient degaussing system which protects vessels from mines &quot;while reducing the weight of the degaussing system by 90% and reducing energy consumption by more than half that of legacy degaussing systems,&quot; AMSC stated.And in a project partially funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, AMSC in October 2018 announced that Illinois electric utility ComEd would use its high-temperature superconductor technology to strengthen Chicago's electric grid.Finally, in March and April. AMSC announced a total of $20 million in orders for its  D-VAR STATCOM system, which regulate the supply of electricity based on demand and help connect wind power plants to the grid.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Going forward, AMSC stock should benefit from the Navy's  plan to add 25 new ships by 2024  and its efforts to shift to all-electric ships. Also likely to help American Superconductor is the growth of wind power around the world. AMSC's prestigious list of customers indicates that its technology is strong, and the company should benefit from its apparently close relationship with the U.S. government. All of these attributes, along with the very low market cap of AMSC stock, make it an excellent small-cap stock to buy. El Pollo LocoSource: Shutterstock El Pollo Loco(NASDAQ:LOCO), a fast-food chain that specializes in Mexican-style grilled chicken, has an opportunity to grab a great niche and benefit from several strong trends. The market cap of LOCO stock is around $400 million.Many, if not most, Kentucky Fried Chicken stores no longer sell grilled chicken, and most smaller restaurants and chains seem to specialize in fried chicken (think Church's and Popeye's). Among chains, only Chick-Fil-A and Boston Market specialize in healthier grilled and/or roasted chicken that's not part of a sandwich, taco or burrito. Boston Market is on the expensive side for fast food, and neither restaurant specializes in highly popular, Mexican-style fare.El Pollo Loco's chicken appears to be healthy, is definitely quite tasty (I've eaten there multiple times) and is rather affordable.  In addition to Mexican-style chicken, it offers Mexican-style side dishes, such as  beans, guacamole and pico de gallo. So El Pollo Loco can fill the apparently otherwise-unoccupied niche of a restaurant that specializes in affordable, Mexican-style, healthy,  chicken that's not served in a sandwich, taco, or burrito.The company's sales have risen meaningfully every year, and its gross income has also been on an upward trend, reaching $78.6 million last year. However, a large increase in its sales, general and administrative expenses hurt its profitability last year.The company's SG&A likely rose partly because it's looking to intensify its marketing efforts, in order to become more widely known in the U.S.  That makes sense, since it only owns and franchises less than 500 restaurants in six states, with 80% of its restaurants located in California.In Q1, the company's EPS, excluding some items, came in at 15 cents, and its comparable restaurant sales increased 2.4% YoY. while its revenue climbed 3% YoY.LOCO said that its comp sales increase was driven by a 4.6% increase in the average check as it hiked its prices by 3%. However, the company indicated that its traffic fell amid bad weather in California.Importantly for LOCO stock, the company is taking action on several fronts in an effort to communicate its value proposition and increase its traffic. The company launched a new ad campaign in March, including intensified TV ads, and hired Brian Wallunas as its new VP, Digital Marketing. Wallunas previously was Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Director of Marketing Technology, indicating that he is a tech marketing whiz who will be able to greatly improve the company's loyalty, digital and social media efforts.I believe that with these steps, El Pollo Loco will be able to communicate and widely disseminate its unique value proposition, thereby dramatically increasing its traffic and results  and greatly boosting LOCO stock. Therefore, El Pollo Loco is a very good small-cap stock to buy.As of this writing, the author owned shares of JKS and AMSC.

2019-07-25,"NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is a twofer. First, it is a strong regulated utility that powers 4.6 million customers in Florida, a state that has significant and consistent power needs. Also remember that Florida is one of the fastest growing states in the US, so more people and businesses mean a strong growth track. Second, it operates on the unregulated side with its subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources (NEER).Source: Shutterstock  NEE's Growing Renewable Energy DivisionThis division focuses on selling wholesale power that's primarily generated by wind and solar, with some natural gas operations thrown in. NEER is a big deal because Florida is a great place to generate both wind and solar. And renewable energy is becoming a very attractive wholesale resource, especially as coal-fired plants continue to fade across the nation.While there isn't as much incentive to convert because of environmental laws at this point, the fact is that renewables are actually reaching price parity with coal and not having to operate and maintain old power plants is an attractive option. From NEER's point of view, generating power from solar farms and wind farms is much cheaper to maintain (and that means higher margins) in the long term, than using power plants to sell excess energy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis wasn't always the case. But the initial costs of developing renewable energy resources are now coming to fruition. Growth Ahead for NEE StockOn the regulated utility side, NEE is also doing well. According to a recent study, Florida is the fifth fastest growing state in the U.S. That is a very bullish sign of the potential growth that NEE has ahead of itselGiven the fact that much of its service area is in the southern half of the state, where the population is densest, this also allows for better distribution efficiencies. It's easier to pump power into a big city than it is to send it into lightly populated rural areas where you don't get the bang for the buck in transmission and distribution operations.All these bullish trends are reinforced by NEE stock's performance.NEE stock is up 24% over the past year, and 20% year to date. Add to that a respectable and reliable nearly 2.4% dividend and you have a very attractive stock that is not only in a hot sector, but is well positioned for whatever the market throws its way.The Q2 earnings NEE released yesterday bear this out. Not only did NEE outperform analysts' expectations but it also had strong guidance for the rest of the year.Remember, the low interest rate environment is great for capital intensive stocks like utilities because it means their borrowing costs are lower. That means they can retire higher cost debt and replace it with lower cost debt. It also means that any more debt they take on is at a lower cost and this can help boost operating margins.  * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar And even if the market swoons, good utility stocks are one of the safest havens around.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-08-01,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lead the list of U.S. commercial solar installation, according to &quot;Solar Means Business,&quot; a newly released report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).Apple tops the list, with 393 megawatts (MW) installed in the last three years, and Amazon comes in second, with 330 MW installed. Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also in the top 10.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, according to the study, 2018 ranks as the second-largest year for commercial solar installations, with 1,144 MW installed. And the biggest news SEIA shared is that &quot;more than half of all corporate solar capacity has been installed in the last three years.&quot;Clearly, the solar industry is gaining momentum. And that momentum is building at the exact same moment that global demand for solar power is about to go parabolic.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August I've been studying and investing in the solar market for several years now. And as far as I see it, two catalysts are fueling the solar boom.First, I'll show you these three profit triggers -- and then I'll show you how to profit from them. Solar Profit Trigger No. 1: Falling Costs, Rising EfficiencyThe cost of solar-power installations has been plummeting -- in both the residential and utility-scale markets. In many parts of the world, solar power is still more expensive than conventional power-generation technologies, but the gap is closing very rapidly.According to the SEIA report, U.S. solar costs have fallen by 65% over the last decade. In 2009, on average, installing a solar panel cost $8.50 per watt. Now its costs just a little less than $3.Meanwhile, solar-panel efficiency has skyrocketed over the past decade or so.In 1954, when Bell Labs invented the first useful silicon solar panel, they were about 6% efficient. We didn't achieve 20% efficiency until the mid-2010s, less than five years ago. Today, manufacturers are making panels with 30% efficiency.And they've reached 45% efficiency in the lab. Solar Profit Trigger No. 2: The Big Boys Step InFurther, the true cost comparison between solar power and other technologies involves more than just dollars and cents. Clearly, the toxic emissions that spew from coal-fired plants impose a cost on the planet that solar panels do not.That's why India and China -- the two most populous, and two of the most polluted, countries on the planet -- are ramping up their solar-power capacity.Both of these countries have devoted themselves to solar power, like teenagers to tattoos, and both countries have laid out ambitious plans to expand their solar footprints.Of course, sinking costs, rising efficiency and the burgeoning demand for solar power from China and India are not the only reasons to expect global demand to soar over the next several years… Solar Profit Trigger No. 3: The X FactorA powerful new &quot;X factor&quot; has entered the solar energy market -- and it has the potential to supercharge demand.That X factor is energy storage (aka batteries).Until recently, solar-power installations lacked the ability to store energy. They were simply use-it-or-lose-it power generators. Energy storage technologies were too expensive to be viable additions to solar-power facilities.But this old story is changing rapidly. Energy storage has arrived - and its arrival could be a very big deal for the solar industry.In the &quot;olden days&quot; of 2015, a company like Target would contract with a solar company to install solar panels on the roofs of its superstores. Once installed, the panels would deliver daytime electricity to supplement the electricity Target pulled from the regional power grid.But now, when Target installs new rooftop panels, it often also installs a battery system to store the excess energy it doesn't use immediately.In 2017, Target kicked off its solar-storage project at its store in Kailua-Kona, on the big island of Hawaii's east coast. There it installed a 910-kilowatt solar system from SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) that included a 250-kilowatt energy storage component.This may have been the first time a Target store had added energy storage to solar -- but it won't be the last.By the end of this year, Target expects to install rooftop solar systems on more than 500 store locations. And by 2030, the company plans to meet 100% of its energy needs from renewable sources.Utilities are also embracing energy storage. Increasingly, they are opting to add new generating capacity by building energy-plus-storage facilities, rather than gas- or coal-fired power plants.Last year, for example, the Arizona Public Service committed to deploying 850 megawatts (MW) of energy storage over the next six years. Along the same lines, NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced plans to deploy a 409 MW solar-plus-storage solution at Florida Power & Light Co., replacing two gas-fired power plants.Looking globally, the deployment of battery-based energy storage solutions (BESS) is ramping up quickly. According to JPMorgan, the cumulative installed base of BESS will soar 100-fold between now and 2030.The bottom line: Solar is big - and getting bigger. A $4 Trillion OpportunityAt the end of 2018, the world's installed capacity of solar-power generation totaled nearly half a billion megawatts -- accounting for more than 7% of the globe's power capacity.But new capacity installations are on track to soar 25% this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and to nearly double by 2021.Many forecasts anticipate an equally spectacular growth trajectory. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) &quot;Sustainable Development Scenario,&quot; solar-power capacity will soar fivefold between now and 2025, accounting for a whopping 38% of global power generation.Looking further out, the IEA anticipates a 13-fold increase in solar-power capacity by 2040, at which point this renewable source would be providing two-thirds of the world's power needs.The IEA anticipates global spending on solar power to total $4 trillion over the next two decades -- or about $180 billion per year.If investment of this magnitude were to occur, solar power would become the world's primary electricity source by 2040.But you don't have to wait 20 years to profit on this trend.There are a lot of companies out there that are jumping on the solar bandwagon, and there is clearly a lot of investing potential here.But it's all about finding the right companies that offer significant long-term potential.That's why I've just released a special &quot;all solar&quot; edition of my brand-new newsletter - Fry's Investment Report.In it, I share two recommendations to get investors in on this technology's profit ground floor.To learn more, I strongly suggest you go here to find out how to join Fry's Investment Report.Eric Fry is thhttps://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT410381&eid=MKT419624&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=starte resident expert on global investment trends at InvestorPlace. And he and his members have been experiencing much success when it comes to solar over the past year or so. In late October 2018, Eric recommended buying some call options on a solar-focused exchange-traded fund. By late January, that ETF had soared more than 30%. (Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 Index advanced just 3%.) The way Eric played it, readers who followed his advice ended up making 203% on their entire position - in just a smidgeon over three months. And in early October 2018, Eric suggested they get in on a certain solar stock's call options. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed more than 75%. They've closed out the first third of that option trade for 168% gains… and the second third for gains of 282%. And they're still sitting on 200%+ gains with the final third of that trade.

2019-08-01,"The ability to buy it and forget it is the nirvana of investing for retirement. After all, most individual investors don't have abundant amounts of time and skill to do the homework needed on an ongoing basis when it comes to investing for retirement.Source: Shutterstock But by the very nature that you're reading this, you have made the time and the effort to invest beyond just the general stock market.So, while I cannot just give you a list of &quot;buy and forget&quot; stocks, I will steer you towards a collection of stocks in specific industries and markets that have a good track record of delivering growth and income for many years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Word On Income and the &quot;Buy and Hold&quot; MethodThe general advice from Wall Street is to just buy and own the S&P 500 Index through mutual funds or ETFs as stocks always go up over time. Most long-term investors don't care about dividends as much as growth. Their argument is that they don't need income, so why have a focus on it until they retire and start to withdraw payments from their accounts?Investors who think this way are missing the fact that dividend income is vital to building a better retirement portfolio. If not taken out, dividends pile up and can be reinvested to build up a portfolio. This brings a growth element to a portfolio when the general stock market is flat or slipping. And it also works to build up overall portfolio balances.Even my most favored stocks are not immune to changes in their businesses, markets or general economic changes. I suggest to my subscribers of Profitable Investing that they merely do a quick review of their own holdings once a month when statements are issued. The review should include a simple question of each holding: would you buy it again and why? If you can't easily answer yes and with a simple explanation of why - then it is time to sell and move on to something else.But now, on to my collection of longer-term buy and own stocks. 5 Stocks to Buy for the Longer HaulI have put together a collection of five stocks to buy that are in diverse markets and pay dividends that range from close to the average of the S&P 500 Index to many multiples more. They are in varied segments ranging from industrial and consumer products, technology, utilities, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and the energy market. And all of them are proven to well-serve their longer-term investors.First, Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:CODI) is a holding company that owns a collection of industrial and consumer products companies which it buys, owns, and sometimes sells. Along the way, the company collects lots of cashflows from its underlying companies. In turn, it pays a lion's share of the profits in the form of a big dividend, currently yielding 7.2%.Compass Diversified Holdings (CODI) Total Return Source BloombergCODI shares have delivered a total return since coming to the public market of 324.95% against the S&P 500 index's return of 200.49%Next is Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC). This is a Silicon Valley-headquartered company which seeks out new and developing technology companies in its area and beyond. It then works to finance their developments and takes equity participation. HTCG provides guidance in their development including eventual exit strategies through company sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). HTGC stock also pays a bigger dividend which currently yields 9.82%.And the company has delivered a return since coming to the market in 2005 of 292.69% against the return of the S&P 500 Index at 238.4%.Hercules Capital (HTGC) Total Return Source BloombergOn to the energy market in the reliable dividend-paying segment of oil and gas pipelines with Enterprise Product Partners (NYSE:EPD). Enterprise Products owns and operates a massive network of pipeline and related oil and gas infrastructure that is crucial to the growing petroleum industry in the U.S.Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) Total Return Source BloombergEPD generates an increasing amount of revenues and profits which in turn pays a portion in a dividend yielding 5.9%. Since coming to the market in 1998 the company has delivered a return to shareholders of 2,013.15% against the S&P 500 Index return of a mere 290.28%Next is one of the most impressive of U.S. power utility providers, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). This company provides regulated power to customers in Florida. NEE also provides unregulated wind and solar-generated power throughout North America. This combination of reliable cashflows from its regulated business and growth from the unregulated wind and solar generates ample growth in the stock price along with a modest dividend yielding 2.4%.NextEra Energy (NEE) Total Return Source BloombergAnd since 1980 to date, NextEra Energy has delivered a total return with stock price growth and dividend income amounting to 22,218.67% compared to the general return of the S&P 500 Index at 6,797.30%. That's a whole new era of a return for a retirement account.Last up is a favorite REIT that owns and manages college campus facilities and dorms around the U.S. American Campus Communities (NYSE:ACC) is the leading publicly traded college dorm REIT in the U.S. ACC continues to be a very reliable source for dividend income and growth in the underlying property values. It yields 4.02% with a dividend payment that continues to rise by an average of 4.85% per year over the past five years.And since coming to the public market in 2004 to date, the company has delivered a return of 411.11% which compares well against the S&P 500 Index return for the same period of 276.29%.American Campus Communities (ACC) Total Return Source BloombergNow that I have presented my way to invest in the solid long-term focused stocks for growth and income, you might like to see more of my market research and recommendations for further safer growth and bigger reliable income.

2019-08-09,"Editor's note: This story was previously published in June 2019. It has since been updated and republished.The 2020 Olympic Summer Games are to be held in Tokyo, Japan. The organizers are planning to power the events with 100% renewable energy, which is great news for renewable energy stocks.Not only will the facilities where the sporting events are to take place to be powered exclusively by solar and wind power, so, too, will the athletes' village, international broadcasting center and press facilities. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an unprecedented undertaking that will highlight the decarbonization of Japan, providing a view into a future fully powered without fossil fuels.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What The city of Tokyo plans to generate 30% of its annual power consumption needs through renewable energy sources that include solar roads -- already installed on highways in France -- across the city by 2030.  The following seven renewable energy stocks to buy will benefit from the publicity generated at the 2020 Olympic Games.However, that's nearly two years from now. Here's why each of them makes very compelling investments today:  NextEra Energy (NEE)Not only is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) the world's largest utility, it's also the largest producer of wind and solar energy anywhere on the planet, making it one of the best renewable energy stocks to buy for the long haul. Source: Shutterstock Many people probably know NextEra because of its Florida Power and Light subsidiary that serves more than five million Floridians and is one of the largest rate-regulated electric utilities in the U.S.However, it is the subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources that is paving the way for future shareholders gains. It owns 120 wind facilities in North America that generate 13,000 megawatts of energy annually. It also generates more than 2,000 megawatts of solar power from facilities in seven states and Canada, along with natural gas-fired and nuclear power plants that deliver additional power generation.However, it is the company's views on diversity that makes it an excellent long-term investment. I'm not much of a fan of investing in utilities, but NextEra Energy's definitely got me very intrigued.  Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) announced that it had increased its ownership (with partners) of TerraForm Power (NASDAQ:TERP) from 51% to 65% by purchasing an additional 61 million shares in a private placement. The investment will add $80 million annually to Brookfield Renewable's funds from operations, making it one of the really smart stocks to buy to get into solar. Source: Shutterstock TerraForm Power generates 3,634 megawatts of solar and wind power around the globe with 65% right here in the U.S., another 26% in Europe, and the remainder from facilities in Canada, Chile and Uruguay. Brookfield Renewable worldwide has 843 renewable power facilities in North America, Latin America and Europe capable of producing 16,300 megawatts of power annually.In North America alone, its renewable energy facilities generate enough electricity to power 2 million homes.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates If you want to own more than renewable energy assets, you might consider Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) which owns 61% of BEP and is one of the world's largest alternative asset managers. If I could only own one company's stock, Brookfield Asset Management would be at the top of my list.  TransAlta (TAC) Like Brookfield Renewable, it could be more attractive to U.S. investors to choose TransAlta Corporation (NYSE:TAC) as a one of the best renewable energy stocks to buy rather than its 64%-owned renewable energy subsidiary TransAlta Renewables (TSE:RNW), which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Source: russellstreet via FlickrTransAlta Renewables pays approximately CAD 150 million in dividends annually to its parent from the free cash flow generated from wind-power facilities in the U.S. and Canada. These facilities have the capacity to produce 1,248 megawatts of power and 49% of its annual cash flow along with natural gas-fired power generation that delivers 47% of its annual cash flow with hydroelectric facilities providing the rest. TransAlta Renewables is in the process of strengthening its balance sheet. Over the past two years, it has cut CAD$900 million of its debt, which should result in the company's free cash flow doubling over the next three years. The company currently pays a 1.95% monthly dividend, so by buying the parent, you're giving yourself a little more safety but a much lower dividend yield. Although there are risks to owning Canada's largest generator of wind power, if you're an aggressive investor, I'd go with RNW.   Enviva (EVA)This is probably the least sexy renewable energy stocks to buy in the sector, but Enviva Partners (NYSE:EVA) is a good one nonetheless.Source:  Alternative Heat via FlickrEviva is the world's largest producer of wood pellets, producing over three million metric tons each year from seven plants in the Southeastern part of the U.S. The pellets themselves are sold to utilities in the U.K. and Europe that use them in place of coal to produce a cleaner electricity source.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Thanks to wood pellet businesses in the south like Enviva, greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced (PDF), forests are growing and jobs have been created, providing a trio of benefits that are hard to beat.Enviva has long-term supply contracts that provide stable cash flows. If you're an income investor, Enviva is a very safe way to meet your annual income requirements.  Renewable Energy Group (REGI)Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) is another simple yet attractive business turning vegetable oils and animal fats into diesel fuel. Whenever you see one of those trucks sucking out the grease traps at a restaurant, it's going to one of Renewable Energy's 13 biomass refineries to be turned into diesel fuel. The company has the capacity to produce 575 million gallons of diesel fuel annually, 70% of which is sold to major travel centers and fuel marketers.The demand for biodiesel is tremendous. California, Texas, New York and seven other states bought 1.5 billion gallons of the stuff in 2018, up from 1.15 billion in 2016. To be clear, REGI has really struggled so far this year, losing more than 50%, but I believe it has got room to move into the $30s on rising demand.  TPI Composites (TPIC)What is one of the main ingredients needed for wind power? Wind, of course, but you also need turbine blades to generate that power. TPI Composites (NASDAQ:TPIC) is the largest independent manufacturer of composite wind blades for turbine manufacturers. It has facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and is one of those stocks to buy for an alternate position on renewables. Source: Susann Nilsson via FlickrAlthough its major business is providing wind blades for turbines, the company is working to diversify its revenue streams. Last year, it announced a joint development agreement with Navistar International (NYSE:NAV) to develop a composite tractor and frame rails for a Class 8 truck.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long The project brings the company's strategic development plans into a new area outside of its core market providing investors with promising future growth.For all of 2019, analysts on average expect TPI Composites' revenue to reach $1.5 billion for the first time in the company's history. With margins moving higher, the profits will follow.  Siemens (SIEGY)This last one gives you exposure to a global industrial player in Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) which, amongst its many ventures, owns 59% of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (OTCMKTS:GCTAF), the world's largest producer of wind turbines and one of the interesting renewable stocks to buy without going all in on renewables.  Source: FlickrSiemens Gamesa sells its turbines to both onshore and offshore wind farms around the world. In Norway alone, Siemens Gamesa's turbines provide more than 500 megawatts of power with another 390 megawatts under installation. It has a total installed base of 85 gigawatts of power generated from its wind turbines. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, if you want to be a disciplined investor, you need the &quot;boring&quot; sectors, too. This way, during bad market selloffs, your overall portfolio is protected.Source: FlickrThis is where utilities come in.Utility stocks certainly come to mind as a &quot;boring&quot; investment. But their high dividends are anything but. You can often make 2.5%, 5% or more in dividends from utilities … far more than from most other sectors. (And given the central banks' penchant for rate cuts, that goes for bonds, too. ) That's why utilities are usually favored by folks investing for their golden years, as these stocks provide extra income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou sure aren't going to hear much about utilities in the media for their ground-breaking products that are going to change the world. But sometimes boring is best, especially given the chaotic start to August.Case in point: The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which tracks tech stocks, is down 2.3% since August 1, while the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU), is up 1.2% since August 1. That's a pretty big difference! And if we look at Friday's broader market action, while tech stocks (along with the three major indices) sold off, utilities closed up again.Clearly, there's a lot of demand for utilities right now. Just take a look at the graph below.According to CNBC, at times when the S&P 500 Index fell at least 10% in one month during the market's 11-year bull run, the best-performing sector was the utilities sector.Better performance and great dividends. Utility stocks aren't looking so boring now, are they?The truth of the matter is that not only do utilities provide safe havens during bouts of market volatility, but the ultra-low interest rate environment is great for them, too. Borrowing costs are lower, and they can retire higher cost debt and replace it with lower cost debt. This means any more debt they take on is at a lower cost, which can help boost operating margins.But not all utilities are created equal, so you need to be careful when you decide to invest in one. As you know, I scour the stock market for the creme de la creme of stocks -- and in the utility sector, the one I like is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).NextEra Energy is currently the largest utility company in the world. Through its two electric companies in Florida, a renewable energy business and several subsidiaries, NextEra Energy provides electricity, wind and sun energy, battery storage and nuclear power. The company began operations back in 1925 as the Florida Power & Light Company and operated gas plants, power plants and water facilities, as well as laundry and ice cream businesses.Its subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), operates on the unregulated side. NEER primarily focuses on the wholesale value of wind and solar energy.Because Florida is an ideal place to generate wind and solar power, power generation from solar and wind farms is much cheaper to sustain in the long term.The service area is in the southern half of the state, which happens to be where the population is densest. This will allow for better distribution efficiencies, giving transmission and distribution operations more value.On July 24, NextEra Energy reported second-quarter earnings of $1.33 billion, or $2.35 per share, which represented 14.6% annual earnings growth. The analyst community was expecting earnings of $2.31 per share, so NEE posted a 1.7% earnings surprise. A Strong Second-Quarter ReportLooking forward, company management expects full-year fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $8 to $8.50 and 2020 earnings of $8.70 to $9.20. It also maintained its 2021 earnings forecast of $9.40 to $9.95. So, NEE should continue to grow nicely.This being the case, it's no surprise that NEE receives an A-rating in Portfolio Grader. As you can see below, NextEra Energy is achieving excellent earnings growth, as well as operating margin growth. Return on equity is also quite good.Though its Fundamentals hold a C-rating, what's really important is that its Quantitative Grade is an &quot;A.&quot; It's the most powerful variable in my grading stock formula, as it indicates the current level of buying pressure. And based on this week's past action, folks are still buying. Not only did the stock end the week up 4.1%, but it closed higher despite broader market's selling on Friday.This is what I consider a &quot;Bulletproof&quot; stock. It will do well no matter which way the market turns, thanks to its strong Fundamentals, earnings and sales growth. That's why I recommended it to my Growth Investor subscribers a few years ago, and why it's sitting pretty with over a 40% return right now. I'm such a fan of it that I've made it Top Five Stocks on my Growth Investor Buy List.It also doesn't hurt that it offers a 2.3% dividend yield. NEE has an ex-dividend date on August 28. The company will pay a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share on September 16 to all shareholders of record on August 29.Now, NEE isn't my only &quot;Bulletproof&quot; stock. There are many others across different sectors that meandered higher while the broader market stumbled, four of which popped more than 5% this week.

2019-08-15,"By now you've heard plenty of talking heads on television saying all sorts of scary things about the inverted yield curve for United States Treasury bonds. And if you missed the headlines, you'll be reading them popping up in news feeds and in the papers.Source: Shutterstock A yield curve is the plotting of bond maturities and their yields from shorter-to-longer-term. It shows how the market for any type of bond is being bought and traded. Normally, shorter-term bonds have lower yields than longer-term maturities.This is because the longer the maturity, the greater the risk of inflation baring its claws making for future interest payments. This also means that the eventual principal payment will be worth less in inflation-adjust terms. Longer-term yields tend to be lower because they must also price in credit risk. The longer the maturity, the greater time for credit in any given market sector to gyrate or deteriorate, putting future interest and principal payments at risk.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA normal yield curve should connect the dots of yield on the y-axis and maturities on the x-axis. It normally rises in yield as maturity dates stretch out. What Does Today's Yield Curve Mean?But an inverted yield curve is when shorter-term maturities are yielding more than longer-term maturities. And when it comes to the U.S. Treasury bond market, the generally accepted definition is when the 2-year Treasury yield is lower than the 10-year Treasury yield. * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall This kicked in early yesterday when the 2-year was at a little bit past 6:00 a.m. I was working to finish up my papers with my Bloomberg Terminal humming along. The 10-year dropped to 1.62% and the 2-year was sitting at 1.63%. This hasn't happened since 2007, when on Feb. 22 the spread was a negative 15.41 basis points, or 0.1541%.Today's Trading (In Yield%) for U.S. 2-and-10-Year TreasuriesHistory of Yield Spread between 2 and 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds Now since yesterday morning, the bond market has sent the spread back to positive, which is normal, for the 2-and-10-year maturity yields. Before I get into what this means, what is causing it, why you should care and what you need to do -- let's look at what the U.S. Treasury bond market has done over the trailing year.From Aug. 14, 2018 through to yesterday, Treasury yields outside of the 1-month bills have all dropped, and longer maturities have dropped even more.In the next graph I've plotted the curves for both dates and the resulting yield changes.U.S. Treasury Bonds (Actively Traded) Aug. 14, 2018 and YesterdayWhat has been causing this to occur? First up, the U.S. Treasury has been issuing more bonds with shorter maturities for some time as part of their funding for the U.S. government. This means more supply, which will influence market pricing. Second, inflation has been low and generally falling over the past many months.The Personal Consumption Expenditure Index, which is the prime gauge used by the the Federal Reserve and its Open Market Committee, has gone from bobbling around the 2% down to a current level of 1.6%. The PCE is a much better and more broad inflation gauge than the Consumer Price Index, as the PCE measures all consumption and not the contrived basket of goods and implied costs for other things including residential expenses.U.S. Core Personal Consumption Expenditure IndexAnd the core PCE, which is also calculated in quarterly Gross Domestic Product data, is running for the second-quarter data release at a rate of 1.4% in the deflator calculations of the GDP growth rate of 2.4%.So, inflation is low and down, and well below the stated target range of the FOMC of above 2% -- and even higher for what it deems as a healthy level for a growing economy.This means that while the FOMC has already reversed course with its target range for Fed funds at its July 31 meetings, I think it is likely that it will further ease in its meetings concluding on Sept. 18, Oct. 30 and Dec. 11 of this year. This reversal of target ranges for Fed funds is reminiscent of when it reversed in 1995-1996 and in 1998.This makes longer-term bonds all the more valuable to lock in yields for the longer term. Now normally, falling yields means falling GDP growth and a weakening economy. But that isn't as much the case right now. Growth in the U.S. economy remains good as just noted above for the most recent data, and there is good reason to see it continuing. U.S. consumer spending drives the vast majority of the economy. And my preferred gauge of consumers is the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, which I refer to as the &quot;Comfy Index.&quot;Bloomberg Comfy IndexSince late 2016, the Comfy Index has been climbing and is very well-positioned in the excellent range. This means that consumers should be eager to spend and have the ability to do so -- particularly as U.S. wage growth has continued to be multiples of core PCE inflation.And businesses continue to expect rising activity over the next six months, as I utilize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's survey data for projections.U.S. Business Leaders Expected Business Activity (Six Months Forward)So, rather than the sickening economy that many are worried about, the U.S. economy continues to show better conditions. What Is Happening With the U.S. EconomyBut what really is happening is that the U.S. is the haven economy in a world where Europe is in trouble and the leading economies of Asia are slowing. And as a result, yields for government bonds from the leading issuers in Europe and Asia are increasingly heading into negative yields.Negative yield come as coupon rates (stated interest rates) are issued at low or near-zero rates. The markets at auction as well as the secondary market bids the bonds to prices above par ($100), which brings the yields below zero. Take for example a German bund (government bond) with a coupon of 0.5% and a maturity of Feb. 15, 2025. It has recently been trading in the market for $106.75 which means that for each bund you'll pay $1,067.50 euros along with $2.19 euros in accrued interest for an effective yield to maturity of -0.69%. That's because the bund will mature at $100, or $1,000 euros, which prices in a loss of $67.50 euros and offsets the coupons.Negative yields and interest rates around the world beyond the U.S. are rapidly becoming a growing problem as the amount of bonds with negative yields keeps climbing by the day to a current level of $15.8 trillion.Negative Yield Debt Around the GlobeThis in turn is making the U.S. bond market all the more attractive with positive yield, and is driving more buying from investors in the U.S. and beyond. And with more buying of longer-term bonds, yields are down and prices are up. Why Investors Should Care About the Inverted Yield CurveYou should care, because this is good -- for now -- for the U.S. economy. Lower interest rates and yields means lower borrowing costs for everyone from the government to corporations and individuals. And this in turn should further aid the growth of the U.S. economy, along with lower inflation pressures over time with lower borrowing costs.And this shows up in how well U.S. bonds are performing in total return from all bonds to my preferred markets in higher-yielding corporate bonds and municipal bonds.Look at the performance year to date for all U.S. bonds (in aggregate), corporate high yield and municipal bonds as tracked by Bloomberg Barclays.U.S. Aggregate Bond (White), U.S. High Yield Corporates (Orange) and Municipal Bonds Total ReturnOverall, U.S. bonds in aggregate have returned 8% year to date. Corporate high-yielding bonds have returned almost 10% and municipal bonds generated 7%. Securities to Focus OnNow, stocks have been choppy recently -- with trade tariff concerns and global economic trouble outside the U.S. But not all stocks have been in the crosshairs of sellers. I continue to guide my Profitable Investing subscribers to hone in on U.S.-focused stocks. This list includes real estate investment trusts such as my favorite W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) and utilities such as my favorite NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). And these sectors have been and should continue to benefit from lower U.S. interest rates and yields.And with mortgage loans climbing with rising property market values and consumer confidence, U.S. mortgage investment companies such as my MFA Financial (NYSE:MFA) should continue to deliver.But for U.S. bonds -- focus on the BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE:BTZ) for corporate and other bonds trading at a discount to net asset value by 8.6% and yielding 5.9%. Investors should also focus on the Nuveen Municipal Credit Income Fund (NYSE:NZF) trading at a discount of 3.8% to net asset value and yielding a tax-equivalent yield of roughly 7.5%.The yield curve isn't a threat -- but simply a measure of market activities and developments as well as an indicator of expectations going forward. It is a tool for investors which should be used and not just feared.Now that I've presented my way to invest with an inverted yield curve, you might like to see more of my market research and recommendations.

2019-08-30,"Utility stocks and funds are in a fortuitous position right now. Investors tend to seek them out when recession fears creep (like they are right now), and they also tend to perform well when interest rates decline.Several countries have shown signs of economic weakness, sparking worries about a global recession. The U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't helped, blunting the growth of the planet's two largest economies. And Derek Horstmeyer, an assistant finance professor at George Mason University, points out what many experts have said about the yield curve's recent inversion. Namely, he calls it a &quot;strong signal that we are in the late stages of economic expansion and may indeed be headed for a recession within the next 18 months.&quot; That's a boon to safe-haven sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, as what they produce is always in demand, no matter what the economy is doing. Utility stocks, with their high returns on assets and high dividends, should be considered given that they &quot;tend to do well in late-cycle periods,&quot; Horstmeyer says.The utility sector also is attractive as interest rates fall, says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. &quot;The dividend yield on the utility sector is especially attractive in this abnormally low-interest-rate environment as the yields on utility stocks exceed the yields on long-term U.S. government debt by a substantial margin,&quot; he says.Here are 11 utility stocks and fund to buy for safety and income.

2019-08-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Dorian became a Category 4 storm it continues its slow progress toward Florida, with forecaster models indicating it has the potential to stall near the coast or even fail to make landfall in the state at all.The hurricane’s center was about 575 miles (925 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach, Florida, as of 8:30 p.m. New York time. Its maximum sustained winds reached near 130 miles per hour, making it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and “extremely dangerous,” according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm is now slowing down and forecast to make potential landfall north of Port St. Lucie, Florida on Tuesday morning, with a warning that some models now indicate the storm may turn before reaching the state. Rainfall in the Bahamas may reach as high as 20 inches in some place, with estimates of as much as 18 inches along the U.S. coast. “The models have not been very consistent from run to run in terms of the timing of the northward turn, but there are more models now indicating that the turn could occur near the east coast of Florida instead of well inland,” the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory Friday.The National Weather Service is launching extra weather balloons and scraping every extra piece of information it can grab to try to figure out what the weather patterns across North America and the Atlantic will be early next week. Those patterns will decide if Dorian is steered into Florida or just skirts the coastline.If Dorian turns at the last minute and runs parallel to the coast it will still pump flooding rains across the state and perhaps even further north into Georgia and South Carolina. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew veered away from Florida, leaving massive destruction throughout Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina from torrential rains.If it does come ashore in Florida, the storm may hit just north of Palm Beach County, home of the fourth-richest zip code in the U.S., based on Bloomberg data. Dorian could be about a $40 billion or $50 billion dollar storm, according to Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.‘Cone of Uncertainty’The center of the storm’s “cone of uncertainty” is north of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump canceled a planned trip to Poland this weekend because of the storm.Trump said they are “thinking about Florida evacuation but it’s a little bit too soon.” That decision will probably be made on Sunday, he told reporters as he prepared to leave for a weekend in Camp David. “Florida seems to be the main target,” the president said, giving the storm a 5% chance of missing the state.The storm may sit over the same area “for a couple of days,” bringing prolonged flooding, and it will produce a dangerous storm surge possibly in excess of 8 feet near its landfall and to the northeast of that point, said Steve Goldstein, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s liaison to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The storm may hold together next week as it tracks north, so southeastern Georgia and parts of South Carolina should beware, he said.Governor Ron DeSantis activated 2,500 Florida National Guard troops and 1,500 have been told to be prepared, according to a press release Friday. More than a dozen schools districts and colleges have announced they will close.The governor’s office also said that tolls will be lifted in relevant areas if and when evacuations are ordered, though that’s not currently the case. Meanwhile, Florida Highway Patrol is escorting fuel trucks to get supplies where they are needed.“This is a major event,” DeSantis said at a press conference Friday, noting that the track still remained highly uncertain. “We’ve just got to be prepared for all those circumstances.”Two high pressure systems could pin Dorian between them as it nears the coast or gets on shore and that could create a situation similar to what happened when Hurricane Harvey stalled over Texas bringing record rainfall, said Jim Rouiller, chief meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group outside Philadelphia.“At this point Monday it will slow down considerably, it will come to a crawl because we are getting the Bermuda high over the Atlantic and the high over the southern Plains,” Rouiller said. “They are basically going to be tugging at Dorian and it doesn’t know which way to go.”By the end of next week there could be two more hurricanes in the Atlantic, Rouiller said. “these will track similar to Dorian and I still think we are under the gun beyond that,” he said.To map assets in Hurricane Dorian’s path, click hereFlorida’s electric utility companies lined up personnel and equipment in anticipation of “significant” power failures. NextEra Energy Inc. subsidiary Florida Power & Light has 13,000 workers ready to respond and said it was reaching out to utilities in other states to secure additional crews and equipment.Some gasoline stations were starting to run empty as residents prepared for the storm and the city of Miami said it was removing dockless scooters from its streets to avoid them becoming projectiles in high winds. A few oil companies began to evacuate non-essential workers from platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, which shouldn’t affect production.&#92;--With assistance from Sharon Cho, Mark Chediak, David Baker, Will Wade, Todd Shields, Josh Wingrove and Alyza Sebenius.To contact the reporters on this story: Brian K.

2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Dorian is on the move once again, inching northwest and potentially up the U.S. East Coast after bashing the Bahamas for almost two days with high winds and driving rains that have inflicted huge damage, killing five on one island alone.The storm is now traveling 2 miles per hour with sustained winds of 110 miles (177 kilometers) per hour, dropping it to Category 2 status, the National Hurricane Center said at 11 a.m. New York time. Dangerous winds and a life-threatening storm surge continue to savage Grand Bahama Island.Meanwhile, Dorian is growing in size, with hurricane-force winds extending some 60 miles from the eye, compared with 45 miles previously, the center reported. It is forecast to move “dangerously close” to the Florida coastline as soon as Wednesday, inundating it with rain, rising sea levels and a storm surge as it travels north toward Georgia and the Carolinas.“Today is ‘moving day’ for Dorian as the northward turn has finally commenced,” said Todd Crawford, lead meteorologist at The Weather Co., an IBM business, in a telephone interview.As a result, storm surge and hurricane warnings have now been extended into South Carolina, and a hurricane watch has been issued for parts of North Carolina’s coast. In Florida, several surge warnings and hurricane watches have been canceled south of the Jupiter Inlet.“Florida will likely dodge the worst impacts,” Crawford said, “although coastal areas will have long stretches of tropical-storm force winds later today and tomorrow.”Shoreline residents and businesses in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas have already been ordered by their respective state governments to evacuate. Crawford said he hasn’t yet ruled out the chance of landfall north of Florida.“We know that these evacuations are inconvenient, difficult and sometimes costly,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a statement. “But we must realize the potential deadly cost of refusing to evacuate when told.”Meanwhile, the Bahamas continue to be under attack.“I don’t think there has been a populated area in the entire Atlantic basin in the climatological record that has experienced the severity and the intensity of impacts that Grand Bahama Island and Abaco have experienced in the past two days,” said Ryan Truchelut, president of Weather Tiger in Tallahassee, Florida.Dorian is weakening in part because it has exhausted its supply of warm ocean water by sitting over the same spot for days, Truchelut said. He doesn’t see the storm -- pulled along by a low pressure system -- moving much farther west, with the core of the hurricane likely staying about 75 miles off of Florida. But he said the eastern North and South Carolina are still very much at risk.“The story of Dorian will be written in two parts,” The Weather Co.’s Crawford said. “First, the utter devastation and humanitarian crisis in parts of the Bahamas and, second, the surprise major impacts in the Southeast and Northeast U.S.”Winds that occur in the coastal areas of the Carolinas, mid-Atlantic, and even Cape Cod, may end up being stronger than what Florida will get, he said.Dare County, North Carolina, which includes much of the tourist-friendly Outer Banks, issued a mandatory evacuation for visitors starting Tuesday and for residents beginning Wednesday. Other parts of the state’s coastline were also bracing for the storm. Ocean-going commercial vessels and barges greater than 500 gross tons should make plans for departing North Carolina ports, the U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement early Tuesday local time.While the current forecast keeps Dorian’s center offshore, forecasters are keeping a close eye for changes, according to Ken Graham, the hurricane center’s director. “It doesn’t take much, a little wobble, a little wiggle and you have hurricane-force winds on shore,” he said in a Facebook update.Grand Bahama, one of the island nation’s northernmost centers, remains near the center of the storm, which has caused widespread flooding in many of the islands of the northwest and central Bahamas, the National Emergency Management Agency has said. Parts of the northern Bahamas are in the “midst of a historic tragedy,” Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a post on Twitter.Based on reports out of Abaco, one of the first islands to be hit, “the devastation is unprecedented,” he said. On Tuesday, the Bahamas government sent out an “urgent plea” asking owners of boats and jet skis to help out with post-hurricane rescue operations for residents stranded by flood waters.The damage to some of the region’s large tourist hotels will likely hit revenue in a country where tourism accounts for about half of gross domestic product, said Andrew Stanners, investment director for Aberdeen Standard Investments, which owns the nation’s dollar bonds. The Bahamas has recently taken “strident steps” to improve government finances, which leave it better placed to repair the devastation, he said.There are also two major petroleum terminals in the Bahamas. Buckeye Partners LP, which operates a large crude and refined products terminal at Freeport, roughly 100 miles from the Florida coast, shut its facility, according to Robert Malecky, executive vice president of Buckeye GP. The terminal, which is able to handle oil supertankers, has a capacity of 26 million barrels of crude, gasoline and diesel.Equinor ASA has a terminal in nearby South Riding Point with a storage capacity of 6.75 million barrels of crude and condensate. The facility was in the process of shutting its terminal ahead of Dorian, according to the company said.Dorian will cause at least $25 billion of insurance losses, according to analysts at UBS Group AG, the costliest of any natural disaster since 2017. Depending on whether it hits the eastern coast of Florida in the next few days, the storm could cost as much as $40 billion, they said.NextEra Energy Inc.’s Florida Power & Light utility has restored electricity service to roughly 60,000 customers as Dorian neared the coast, chief communications officer Dave Reuter told a Monday morning press conference. Much of the damage, he said, had come from vegetation or wind-borne debris hitting power lines. “We are still not in the clear,” Reuter said.The FPL website showed 3,330 customers without power as of 11:17 a.m. Tuesday.To map assets in Hurricane Dorian’s path, click here.(Updates with wind and movement speeds in the second graf, forecaster’s comment in the fourth, sixth and 12th paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Serene Cheong, Sharon Cho, David R.

They aren't unicorns or in sexy, headline-grabbing industries. But they do make money slowly and steadily. And they are all investor-friendly.

It's a company that manages water resources for over 80 communities in California, particularly around Los Angeles.But it also has divisions that provide electricity and contracted services to over a million customers in nine states.Water is becoming an increasingly important resource. And water utilities are becoming key assets to manage these resources. As we have seen in Michigan and Georgia, as well as many other states, old infrastructure is endangering the lives of citizens.In agricultural states like California, wise management of resources for business and the citizenry is becoming ever more complex.AWR stock has had a run in the past year, up 46% in the past 12 months and 33% year to date. Given that move, its dividend has diminished, but it still delivers at almost 1.4%, which may not beat current CD rates, but they don't offer the growth potential of AWR stock, either.Source: Jakeblancaster via Flickr (Modified)York Water (NYSE:YORW) is the oldest investor-owned utility in the country. It started in 1816, when a group of local businessmen in York County, Pennsylvania got together and issued shares in a company that could mange water resources for the growing city of York.As the city grew, it needed a reliable source of water for the community, as well as water at the ready for any structure fires. Bucket brigades weren't going to be able to serve the growing city.In recent years, YORW has gone into the wastewater business as well. This is just managing the flow on a different set of pipes and adds value to the overall business.But YORW has stuck to its knitting. It has grown with the needs of the two counties it serves, but it isn't looking to take on risky expansion. Its sub-$500 million market cap means you're getting a small, focused utility with great relations with the utility regulators and a well-established infrastructure.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The stock is up 25% in the past 12 months, 17% year to date and delivers a trusty 1.9% dividend to boot. And I've got more where that came from.Source: Shutterstock ONE Gas (NYSE:OGS) is a natural gas utility that operates in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. It provides gas for commercial and residential customers.The nice thing about this company is that it's focused. There are plenty of big utilities that have natural gas as well as renewables along with their electric generation and distribution mix.OGS just does natural gas. And that's a good thing, especially if you already have a bigger utility or two in your portfolio. Its two million customers make it one of the largest natural gas utilities in the U.S.Natural gas is one of the great energy resources in the U.S. While coal is still around, much of its production is getting shipped overseas because it's not as efficient as natural gas.Fracking operations in Texas and Oklahoma as well as many other places in the U.S. have unearthed significant natural gas assets. This spells growth for years to come.Most of OGS stock's gains came in 2019 - it has return 16% year to date and 14% in the past year. It delivers a solid 2.2% dividend yield that's outpacing inflation.Source: Shutterstock Chesapeake Utilities (NYSE:CPK) can recall its roots back in 1859 as the Dover Gas Light Company. Remember, gas lights were all the rage in the late 19th century and early 20th century until reliable electricity would supplant them.CPK is from Delaware, the home of the powerful DuPont family, which means it had not only a consumer base but also a significant industrial base.CPK operates on the Delmarva peninsula, some of the most popular beach traffic on the East Coast, as well as in Florida, as Florida Public Utilities.Its operation has also expanded beyond natural gas and now encompasses propane, electricity, and even steam. It also has regulated and unregulated business divisions.The regulated business helps keep business steady and reliable and the unregulated side takes advantage of opportunities that pop up in the market to make bigger gains.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill With a market cap of $1.5 billion, it's not a big company, but it is rock-solid. It's up 19% year to date and delivers a 1.7% dividend. Nothing fancy, just a solid utility with a steady customer base in growing areas. It's a situation that's producing some of my favorite high-growth investments at Growth Investor.Source: Shutterstock NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the largest utility holding company by market cap.That's right, we're going to talk about a big-cap utility that operates in one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. and has a very strong market position in one of the hottest growth sectors in the utilities sector - renewable energy.This hardly sounds like a boring stock, right?Well, just remember all this is in the utility sector, so it's all relative. But NEE stock is getting a lot of attention, even from people who don't usually consider utilities.It has two divisions: regulated and unregulated. Its regulated division is FPL, formerly known as Florida Power and Light. FPL delivers electricity to about 10 million customers across nearly half of Florida (mostly the southern and western half) and is the third-largest utility in the U.S.Its unregulated division is the largest producer of wind and solar in the world. Other utilities looking for carbon futures make this a huge growth opportunity for NEE.NEE stock is up 29% in the past 12 months and delivers a near 2.3% dividend. And none of this is subject to trade wars, GDP or a strong dollar. In fact, I've declared it one of my Top 5 Stocks for Growth Investor.Source: Shutterstock Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has 7.7 million customers across six states: Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Indiana. It is a diversified monster that provides electricity generation and distribution as well as natural gas distribution services.The company started in 1904 when it took over the Catawba Hydro Station in South Carolina to help industrialize the south. The goal was to power the Victoria Cotton Mills and look for a way to diversify the economy of the agrarian south.Nowadays, DUK has continued to lead, but now is known for being one of the most proactive renewable energy utilities in the nation. This has been an effort of the company long before it was cool to look at renewables as a way to generate power for most big utilities.DUK has nine subsidiaries that operate across its territories, including an array of unregulated operations that help power the regulated side of the business as well as trade with other utilities and power customers.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall While DUK stock hasn't been on fire - up 5% year to date and 12% in the past year - its dividend is generous (4.1%) and about as reliable as they come. That means you'll get paid inflation beating returns come what may with the rest of the market.Source: Shutterstock TerraForm Power (NASDAQ:TERP) is certainly a 21st century energy company. Its single mandate is to operate, own, and acquire wind and solar assets in North America and Europe.Right now, that means nearly 30 U.S. states and territories as well as Canada, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Uruguay and the UK.It has more than 3,700 megawatts of capacity, that's split 64/36 wind and solar. The revenue split on its generation platforms is 51% solar, 49% wind.Bear in mind, this is all unregulated. TERP isn't a utility in the traditional sense since it doesn't have a regulated business. It sells it power to utilities and other power producers that want to add renewables to their energy mix.It also means that utilities don't have to buy or expand power generation operations, but they can simply power from TERP until the demand becomes significant enough to justify the larger expansion expense.Buying renewable energy also helps manage utilities' carbon credits. While the federal government has loosened its regulatory grip on clean energy, many states and other countries haven't.The company is just five years old, so it's still a baby in this sector, but it's growing fast. TERP stock is up 55% year to date as low interest rates mean it can continue to expand its operations and lower its operating costs. Its 4.8% dividend is also attractive, but bear in mind that it's not as secure as a utility like Duke or Dominion Energy (NYSE:D). Why High-Dividend Stocks Are So Firm Right NowThe &quot;smart money&quot; on Wall Street knows that dividends are crucial for their performance stats: The income ultimately smooths out a portfolio's returns overall.Speaking of &quot;juicing&quot; returns…There's another trick Wall Street money managers have up their sleeves. It's called &quot;window dressing.&quot; When we approach the end of a quarter, big money will often buy top-performing stocks to spruce up their returns when they report the performance of their current portfolio.The influx of cash gives those stocks even BETTER returns. That's what we're about to see as the third quarter closes at month-end.And we can go along for the ride - as long as we get positioned by, say, September 16.You won't want to let the clock run out on this. After September 16, the next buying window won't really open until next earnings season.Click here for all 3 steps you should take right now and learn more about this phenomenon.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2019-09-19,"These days, the news cycle is driving the show. It seems that every day, how the market finishes is 100% based on what's going on with the trade war, what the Federal Reserve is doing, or just how good or bad the data has been. For conservative or investors near or in retirement, it can be maddening. Which is why utility stocks could be the best thing for their portfolios.After all, utility stocks feature plenty of steady cash flows and high dividends. It doesn't matter so much what the economy is doing as people still need to heat their homes, keep the water flowing, and power the lights. This steadfastness makes utility stocks a prime choice for conservative investors. And now with the Fed decreasing rates, other investors tend to like them too.No wonder why the sector proxy -- the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEArca:XLU) -- has gained over 21% year-to-date. That's before dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession As you can see, there is power in owning the power producers. For conservative investors, the sector's strength and boring nature really do pay plenty of benefits in a market like this. With that, here are five utility stocks worth buying today. Utility Stocks Perfect For Conservative Investors: UGI (UGI)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.58%For conservative investors looking at utility stocks, they should focus on the number 33. That's the number of consecutive years that utility UGI (NYSE:UGI) has managed to increase its dividend for. And given its recent moves, it should be able to add 34, 35, and so on to that impressive streak.The key is that UGI has been smartly using the utility holding company model to its advantage.UGI owns plenty of boring electric and gas operations in the Northeast. These regulated assets provide the utility stock with plenty of steady cash flows. The firm has been using these cash flows to fund non-regulated and tangential assets. These assets provide higher profit margins and an extra boost to its bottom line.A prime example would its recent buyout of Columbia Midstream Group. UGI already owned several FERC regulated interstate natural gas trunk lines in the region. With the addition of Columbia, the utility now gained several gathering and processing assets that feed into its pipeline system. This allows UGI to instantly see scale and additional profits.This strategy seems to be working for UGI. Last year was one of its best on record and the gains have continued this year as well. Adjusted EPS for last quarter -- after accounting for the buyout of its MLP subsidiary AmeriGas -- jumped more than 44% year-over-year.With profit gains like that, UGI should have no problems hitting its 4% annual dividend growth targets. York Water (YORW)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.77%If you had to guess what stock has been paying dividends the longest, names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) may come to mind. But the title goes to a small and overlooked utility stock that may just be perfect for conservative investors. We're talking about humble York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) and its dividend streak of 203 consecutive years.York has been paying a dividend since its founding in 1816. The key comes from its operating niche. Water utilities are often monopolies in their operating regions. Moreover, they are heavily regulated. In this case, YORW provides water and treatment for 48 municipalities with York and Adams Counties in Pennsylvania. What's great about York is that it really has tried to grow massive like some water utilities. It just does what it does. Because of this, its results run like clockwork.And York has been pretty successful at winning rate increases from regulators. The latest one was approved at the start of the year. Given water's highly regulated nature, these rate increases provide just enough oomph to pay for rising costs, upgrades and boost profits. And York has handed those profits back via dividend increases. The latest one was a 4.4% jump.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale The reality is, YORW is not going to set your portfolio on fire and grow 1500%. But it what it can do is provide plenty of stability and income potential. Exactly what utility stocks should do. Consolidated Edison (ED)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.24%No list of stodgy utility stocks can be complete with Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). ConEd has been providing electricity, steam and natural gas for metropolitan New York for more than 180 years. And it turns out this niche of powering New York City, Westchester and parts of New Jersey is a very good one to be in. Thanks to their growing populations, steady economies and overall top-notch fundamentals, ConEd has become a profit and dividend champion.And the growth could keep coming. That's because ConEd has started to upgrade and make its system more high-tech.For starters, that includes plenty of renewable and solar energy projects in its operating region. Con Edison is actually the second-largest solar energy producer in North America. Secondly, ConEd has begun to roll-out new smart-meters and demand-response programs. This includes across its electric and natural gas operations. Here, consumers are rewarded for using less power at peak times. But for ConEd, this can be huge cost savings.Already, the utility has been struggling to meet the needs of New Yorker's when it comes to gas demand. It's simply having to buy more gas from third party players to meet the demand. Those costs are hurting its bottom line. With demand response, ED should be able to save a few dollars and reduce its outlays for gas. Even better is that regulators have allowed the utility to pass on the smart-meter costs to consumers. For ED stock, it's a win-win.It's a big win for investors as well and should help keep the dividends flowing at ED for years to come. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.22%Speaking of renewable energy, no utility stock is better at it than NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). That's because like previously mentioned UGI, NEE has managed to use the utility holding company model perfectly.To start with, NextEra owns plenty of regulated utility assets in the sunbelt. These more than 4.6 million customers provide plenty of stable cash flows into its coffers and used those cash flows to build-out its non-regulated assets. More specially, NextEra has become the largest producer of solar and wind power in the United States. The best part is that renewable energy has finally hit parity with traditional fossil fuels in many cases. And given the lower costs to maintain a solar or wind farm, margins are getting quite juicy at NEE.NextEra is able to sell excess power produced at these solar farms to other utilities looking to meet new regulations or fill their own power needs. At this point, it's just easier for them to buy power from NEE than build a renewable energy farm on their own.For NEE this has meant plenty of profit growth over the years. Since 2003, EPS has managed to grow at a CAGR of nearly 8% per year. For a utility stock, that's a very strong rate of growth. And NextEra hasn't been shy about handing out excess cash to investors. Dividends have grown by over 9% in that time.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy With its business model continuing to see benefits, NextEra represents one of the best utility stocks out there for investors. Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.73%As the saying goes, there's safety in numbers. To that end, a broader strategy may be best. Which is why investors may want to go with an ETF that covers the utility stocks. Surely, you could go with the previously mentioned XLU -- and it's a fine choice. But the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEArca:VPU) might be a better pick.The reason comes down to coverage. The XLU holds just 28 utility stocks. VPU, however, offers broader coverage given its inclusion of large-, mid- and small-cap firms. That wide-sweeping approach bumps its total number of holdings to 69 different utilities. This includes all of them on this list. Better still is that VPU also beats the SPDR on expenses -- 0.10% vs. 0.13% -- and in terms of current dividend yield.Those slight differences in holdings, yield, and expenses have made VPU the better fund for the long haul. Over the last decade, the Vanguard ETF has managed to return about 12.46% annually. That's just over a half a percent more per year than the SPDR. Investing is a game of inches and that slight difference compounded over time really adds up. And yet, asset and trading volumes for the VPU are equally as swift.As a result, VPU should get the nod from investors looking for a broader approach to utility stocks. Given the market's rising volatility, they may just want to do that.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-09-30,"(Bloomberg) -- One of America’s biggest renewable-energy companies is making a bet on natural gas.NextEra Energy Partners LP agreed to buy Meade Pipeline Co., an owner of a pipeline that provides gas from Pennsylvania, in a deal valued at about $1.37 billion, according to a statement Monday.While NextEra Energy Partners already owns pipelines in Texas, it’s viewed by many investors as a wind and solar company, owning 5 gigawatts of renewables as of mid-June. The move to buy a pipeline comes as utilities and cities across the U.S. are pushing to drastically cut back on burning fossil fuel.“It is slightly surprising that NEP doubled-down on gas exposure,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, said in an interview Monday. “This is not what the company has generally been focused on.”Shares of NextEra Energy Partners gained as much as 1.7% Monday.‘Clean Energy’NextEra Energy Partners expects the deal to yield a double-digit return. Plus, the pipeline will help balance any “potential resource volatility” in the company’s existing portfolio, Jim Robo, chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement.“Listen, when we did the original IPO, now I guess more than 5 years ago, we said the focus was going to be on clean-energy assets -- and I view gas pipelines as clean energy,” Robo said on a call with analysts. “Gas is an important bridge to a low- or zero-carbon future, 30 years out.”While gas-fired generators emit fewer emissions than coal plants, environmentalists and local governments are increasingly pushing to phase out fossil fuels altogether as part of their efforts to fight climate change. In July, Berkeley, California, became the first U.S. city to ban natural gas from most new buildings. Its Bay Area neighbor, San Jose, followed suit with a ban on gas in most residential buildings. Other cities -- including San Francisco and Seattle -- are considering the move.Even NextEra Energy Partners’s parent company -- which Robo also runs -- is pushing to cut greenhouse gases, saying it will reduce its carbon dioxide emissions 40% by 2025, while doubling electricity production. The company, NextEra Energy Inc., is already the biggest U.S. wind and solar owner.Meade owns a roughly 40% interest in the Central Penn Line, a 185-mile (298-kilometer) interstate pipeline that connects the Marcellus Shale basin in Pennsylvania to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal is expected to close within the next 60 days, and it includes a $90 million expansion project expected to be completed in mid-2022. The Marcellus is the biggest source of U.S. natural gas.NextEra’s existing seven gas pipelines include the NET Mexico system, which carries U.S. shale gas south of the border.“Those types of assets, combined with renewables, give you a very solid base,” Robo said on the call.&#92;--With assistance from Naureen S.

2019-11-14,Sector ETF report for FUTY,Should You Invest in the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY)?
2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Two decades ago, when coal ruled U.S. power generation, a Florida utility plowed some of its extra cash into a wind farm atop a desolate Oregon plateau.It was the start of an unimaginably successful bet.This year, that company -- now named NextEra Energy Inc. -- became the world’s first utility with a market capitalization of more than $100 billion, thanks largely to its clean-power business. It’s almost twice as valuable as the oil major ConocoPhillips and has developed enough wind and solar farms across the U.S. and Canada to power the entire nation of Greece. Shares have doubled in four years, outperforming virtually every other stock in the industry.“They made a bunch of strategic moves early and aggressively that have paid off very well for them,” said Andrew Weisel, an analyst at Scotia Howard Weil.Not that NextEra started down the clean-energy road with a master plan. The move into renewables happened pretty much by accident after the company began lending money to wind-farm developers. Some of them ran into financial troubles. NextEra forgave debts in exchange for majority stakes in the farms.As it would turn out, the wind farms weren’t duds.“Lo and behold, we did some projects that were quite profitable,”said Lewis Hay III, the company’s chief executive officer from 2001 to 2012.So Hay pulled together a renewable energy team of his own. One of his early moves was to recruit two of his former co-workers from a consulting firm: One was Moray Dewhurst, who eventually served as NextEra’s chief financial officer. The other was Jim Robo, who at the time was an executive for General Electric Co.Robo, a Harvard MBA, became NextEra’s CEO in 2012. He rarely grants media interviews and declined to comment for this story.“Things really took off when Lew, Moray and Jim got together,” Barclays Plc analyst Eric Beaumont said.When Robo came on board in 2002, wind power was a tiny slice of the U.S. power mix. But in another stroke of luck, Congress had just extended a tax credit that would prove to be the key to a wind generation boom across America that’s still going.It helped turn what was a once-sleepy utility -- established in 1925 as Florida Power & Light -- into a global powerhouse.NextEra, which changed its name in 2009 to reflect its growing focus on alternative energy, now has wind and solar farms in about two dozen U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. They total roughly 18 gigawatts, enough to power almost 13 million homes. Last year, its clean power business -- in addition to some natural gas and nuclear plants -- raked in $4.7 billion in profit, 70% of its net income.And the company isn’t done growing. It already has contracts to add another 12 gigawatts of renewables.Challenges remain. The federal tax credit for wind farms is set to start phasing out soon. And in Florida, a campaign is under way to pass a constitutional amendment that would break up monopolies held by NextEra’s utilities, Florida Power & Light Co. and Gulf Power. On an adjusted basis, the company’s utility business still made up the bulk of its earnings last year.Not all of NextEra’s bets have panned out. Its $18 billion attempt to buy Oncor Electric Delivery Co. in Texas crashed and burned. And its $2.6 billion attempt to buy Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. fell apart, too.And for all the company’s clean energy, NextEra unsuccessfully fought in support of a 2016 measure in its home state of Florida that critics said would have limited rooftop solar growth and, hence, protected utility revenue. The company has a plan to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030 and use batteries to replace fossil-fuel plants in its fleet.Long-Term ContractsNextEra’s strategy has hinged on building projects in states with deregulated power markets that required utilities to buy a certain amount of electricity from wind or solar farms, including Texas and California. It enables NextEra to line up long-term contracts, ensuring revenue for a decade or more.Early on, Robo negotiated a deal with his old company: GE. NextEra had a contract to buy natural gas turbines from the conglomerate. But the market for gas plants was in decline. So the utility convinced GE to rejigger the deal and allow it to buy wind turbines instead.“That’s a cause that led us to scale up our business much faster than maybe otherwise we would have done,” Hay said. The scale soon gave the company an advantage that made it hard for others to catch up.One of Robo’s adages is wind and solar are essentially big data operations. An early sign was in 2006, when NextEra bought WindLogics Inc., a high-tech forecaster. At the time, wind developers relied on WindLogics’s computer modeling techniques to predict wind patterns and pinpoint exactly where to site turbines. By acquiring the company, NextEra locked up that edge for itself.“That became a very powerful advantage,” Stephen Byrd, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in an interview.The company has said it will do just fine even after the federal tax credit for wind farm expires. The company’s size makes its well positioned to benefit from U.S.’s ongoing shift away from fossil fuels, said Timothy Winter, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds LLC.“They’re still in the very early innings of the ball game,” Winter said.(Updates with information on Florida solar project in 17th paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Gerson Freitas Jr. in New York at gfreitasjr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Joe RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",The World’s Only $100 Billion Utility Owes Its Rise To Wind Power

The dividend yield on the S&P; 500 started 2019 at more than 2% but finished the year at 1.8%.

S&P; Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell.

2020-01-08,"When investors think defense, they think utility stocks.The S&P; 500's utility sector behaved anything but defensively in 2019, however. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) delivered a 25.9% total return last year - better than more than half the index's sectors, including the revamped, &quot;growthier&quot; communications sector and consumer discretionary stocks.That's surely a pleasant surprise for utility-stock investors. Many enter the sector looking not for growth, but stability in down markets and the dependable dividends these companies can afford thanks to the often regulated nature of the utility business.Like most of the market, utility stocks did get stretched as a result of their 2019 run. &quot;The utility sector currently trades at a P/E of 19.3x, versus a 15-year historical average of 15.01x, which represents a 29% premium to the S&P; 500,&quot; Michael Sheldon, executive director and CIO of financial planner RDM Financial Group, told Kiplinger in a December email.While Sheldon is concerned about the sector's valuation, he's also quick to point out that many utility stocks have low beta - a measure of volatility. Thus, they're still providing more stability compared to the overall market.Here are 10 of the best utility stocks to buy for 2020. This isn't your usual group of utilities, either. While some of these names should be expected to provide a traditional combination of dividend income and lower volatility, a few are set up for potential growth thanks to their connection to green-energy initiatives.

2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Bonnie Rippingille looked out at the wisps of steam curling from the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant across Biscayne Bay with a sense of dread. In December federal regulators approved Florida Power & Light Co.’s request to let the facility’s twin nuclear reactors remain in operation for another 20 years beyond the end of their current licenses. By that point they’ll be 80, making them the oldest reactors in operation anywhere in the world.“That’s too old,” said Rippingille, a lawyer and retired Miami-Dade County judge who was wearing a blue print shirt with white sea turtles on it. “They weren’t designed for this purpose.”With backing from the Trump administration, utilities across the nation are preparing to follow suit, seeking permission to extend the life of reactors built in the 1970s to the 2050s as they run up against the end of their 60-year licenses.Read More: Nuclear Reactors Could Run as Long as 80 Years Under Trump Plan“We are talking about running machines that were designed in the 1960s, constructed in the 1970s and have been operating under the most extreme radioactive and thermal conditions imaginable,” said Damon Moglen, an official with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “There is no other country in the world that is thinking about operating reactors in the 60 to 80-year time frame.”Indeed, the move comes as other nations shift away from atomic power over safety concerns, despite its appeal as a carbon-free alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Japan, which used to get more than a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power, shut down all its plants in 2011 after a tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown at three reactors in Fukushima. Only a handful have restarted while others that can’t meet stringent new standards are slated to close permanently. Germany decided that year to shutter its entire fleet by 2022 and is now having trouble meeting its ambitious climate goals. Other nations such as France and Sweden are allowing reactors to retire while they diversify into solar and wind power.By contrast, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is poised to decide this year on requests by subsidiaries of Exelon Corp. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles from Washington, and Dominion Energy Inc. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at a power plant in Surry, Virginia.Dominion has notified the commission it intends to ask permission to extend the life of two more reactors north of Richmond, Virginia. Duke Energy Corp. has said it plans to seek license extensions for its entire fleet of 11 nuclear reactors, starting with three in Seneca, South Carolina.“There are economic benefits,” said Rounette Nader, Duke’s director of nuclear license renewal. “Continuing to operate our existing nuclear fleet is cheaper than replacing it.”The nuclear industry has been buffeted by a wave of early reactor retirements in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and subsidized renewable power. Constructing a new nuclear plant—the only one being built in the U.S. is years behind schedule and over budget—can cost billions of dollars. Retrofitting an existing one is more likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.Read More: America to Decide Whether a Nuke Can Outlive a Human “It just makes sense,” said Maria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington-based trade group that represents nuclear utilities. “I don’t think you should look at a plant just on calendar years, but rather the way that plant has been maintained, so many components have been replaced over the years. There is nothing magic about 80.”Critics such as Edwin Lyman, a nuclear energy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, argue that older plants contain “structures that can’t be replaced or repaired,” including the garage-sized steel reactor vessels that contain tons of nuclear fuel and can grow brittle after years of being bombarded by radioactive neutrons. “They just get older and older,” he said. If the vessel gets brittle, it becomes vulnerable to cracking or even catastrophic failure. That risk increases if it’s cooled down too rapidly—say in the case of a disaster, when cold water must be injected into the core to prevent a meltdown.Other concerns surround the durability of components such as concrete and electric cables, but an advisory board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent government agency that gave Turkey Point the green light to operate into the 2050s, said those risks could be managed safely “without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.”The commission’s decision doesn’t sit well with Philip Stoddard, a bespectacled biology professor who serves as the mayor of South Miami, a city of 13,000 on about 18 miles away from the Turkey Point plant. He keeps a store of potassium iodide, used to prevent thyroid cancer, large enough to provide for every child in his city should the need arise.“You’ve got hurricanes, you’ve got storm surge, you’ve got increasing risks of hurricanes and storm surge,” said Stoddard, 62, from the corner office in a biology building on Florida International University’s palm-tree lined campus. All of this not only increases the likelihood of a nuclear disaster, it also complicates a potential evacuation, which could put even more lives at risk. “Imagine being in a radiation cloud in your car and you’re sitting there running out of gas because you’re in a parking lot in the freeway,” he said.Gabriel Ignetti, a 72-year-old Miami resident and retired music teacher, views nuclear power as a lesser evil than climate change and welcomes extending the life of the plant. “We have a climate emergency,” he said, “and if you have a climate emergency you can’t say we are not going to use that tool.”That’s a point backers also highlight to make the case for extending the lives of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and about 55% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Climate change is also one of the main cases against extending the life of Turkey Point, said Kelly Cox, the general counsel for Miami Waterkeeper, a six-person environmental group that has joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth to challenge the NRC’s approval in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. New data show sea level rise in the area reach as high as 4.5 feet by 2070, but regulators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission didn’t take those updated figures into account, said Cox.“They are going to be flooded,” Cox said. “If we are relicensing a major utility we need to be preparing for the impacts of sea level rise.”Scott Burnell, a NRC spokesman, said the agency’s review process did take into account the most recent information available on sea level rise, but that “the projected rate of sea level rise and associated revisions in flood hazard are slow enough that the plants will have ample time to appropriately analyze and address possible future effects.”Read More: U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Weren’t Built for Climate ChangeOther concerns exist about the condition of the plant’s unlined earthen cooling canals, a unique system that sprawls over nearly six thousand acres. Salty water from the canals is leaking underground toward the Biscayne aquifer, the source of drinking water for about 3 million Floridians, at a rate of about a foot a day, Cox said.Peter Robbins, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc., said the utility is addressing that problem using a series of pumps to decrease the salinity in the cooling canals. The main power plant and its critical component are elevated 20 feet above sea level and are protected by concrete and reinforced buildings designed to withstand hurricanes and floods.“At the end of the day it’s a very clean, reliable source of electricity,” Robbins said. “More than anything we think this is a win for our customers. It helps keep their reliability high, it helps keep their bills low, and there are no greenhouse gases as part of nuclear.”In the city of Homestead, not far from the Turkey Point plant, Brian Goodwin, a burly 52-year-old farmer, said he didn’t believe in climate change, but supports the reactors’ extension nonetheless. “I hope they build another one,” said Goodwin. “It’s good clean power.”(Updates location of the challenge petition in the 17th paragraph; corrects Edwin Lyman’s name in the 11th paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Ari Natter in Washington at anatter5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanJillian GoodmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The U.S. May Soon Have the World's Oldest Nuclear Power Plants

Instead, I have been following and recommending a collection of companies which are doing well in the current leadership and that should continue to do well even with a changing of the guard next year.So, read on to see some of my tails-you-win, heads-you-win stocks for 2020 and 2021. Clean Energy Isn't Red or BlueThe past few years have been very good for clean energy. That's true even factoring in the support for the U.S. petroleum market -- which resulted in a surging of crude and natural gas exports. So, if things remain the same after the election, all will be fine. But if there is a change, look for a further push toward clean energy. That push would help a collection of companies I have inside my Profitable Investing.Renewable energy isn't just a fad, nor a political football game. The economics of working with wind, solar, hydropower and other renewables continues to work for the bottom line -- and not just for feel-good actions.And the proof is in one of our more successful utilities in the model portfolios, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). Since being added to the portfolio, it has generated a total return of 589% which is fantastic when compared to the S&P Utilities Index's return of 184.2% for the same period.It is even more impressive when compared to the S&P 500 which only managed to return 202.3% for the same time. Election-Proof Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Chart by Bloomberg NextEra Energy, S&P 500 and S&P Utilities Index Total ReturnNextEra Energy's base market is in Florida, where it focuses on its core regulated power operations. But it has grown in assets and revenue thanks to its broad push for wind and solar power, in the regulated and unregulated markets. In doing so, it has become one of the world's largest wind and solar companies.And it isn't alone in this market. According to data compiled by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), renewable energy is the fastest-expanding source for power in the U.S. from 2000 through 2018. That growth should continue through 2020.Yet in 2018, only 11% of the U.S. energy demand was fueled by renewable sources, according to the Energy Information Agency (EIA). This means while gains have been impressive, there is a lot of opportunity for further expansion.For U.S. electric power, renewables made up a bit more of the power pie. In 2018, renewable sources accounted for 17% of total electricity generation. That number is projected to increase to 24%, led primarily by wind and solar operations.Now, a great deal of this development comes from tax incentives. Back in 1992, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) enabled utilities to claim credits for each kilowatt of power generated. This gave a green light to several projects, starting the initial push into the clean energy market. But the end of 2019 marked a phasing out of this specific credit.Unfortunately, the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provided the next leg-up for the market, also began decreasing in 2019. The ITC gave credits not just for power produced, but for investments in equipment and facilities. Tax Credits and NEE StockThese credits have been behind much of NextEra Energy's economics. So, even if the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining, NextEra gets credit for investing in facilities.Although these federal programs are winding down, individual states -- especially those with high taxes like California -- provide credits for individual homeowners and companies. These state-wide initiatives add to the economics of power projects.And individual states also continue to expand mandates on regulated utility companies, requiring them to generate or acquire a set amount of renewable power. This means that renewable energy isn't just a matter of tax savings, but of requirement.This combination of tax credits and mandates is fueling major investments in renewable energy. According to EIA and C2ES, these investments came in at $2.2 trillion in 2017 and $2.4 trillion in 2018. And 2019 should show a further rise.Source: Chart by Bloomberg, U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Electricity Annual Wind GenerationSource: Chart by Bloomberg, U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Electricity Annual Solar GenerationAlthough there is a wide variety of renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, wind and solar are the key drivers of growth. Over the last two decades, U.S. solar power generation has gained just below 13,000%. In that same timeframe, wind power generation has gained close to 5,000%.All of this comes as popular demand for wind and solar remains buoyant. Want proof? Texas -- a fossil-fuel haven -- has the largest wind power production of any U.S. state. It generates more than 25% of the entire country's wind power-derived energy.When you picture the state's ranches and shale fields, add some wind turbines to that Lone Star landscape. Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI)NextEra Energy has, and should continue, to do well with its renewable energy assets. But I want to focus on a company that has a great behind-the-scenes business in the same market. Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (NYSE:HASI) is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT).It capitalizes on a few bits of significant legislation, including the Investment Companies Act of 1940, the Small Business Investment Incentives Act of 1980 and most importantly, the Cigar Excise Tax Extension Act of 1960.As a REIT it operates largely outside of federal corporate tax liability. And it invests in renewable energy projects that are built on real estate properties. Thanks to another piece of legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, 20% of all dividend distributions from HASI are tax deductible.Hannon Armstrong is based in the very pretty town of Annapolis, Maryland, and has been around since 1981. It adopted the REIT model in 2012 and went public in 2013.The REIT provides lending and debt financing, and it takes equity stakes in the clean energy market. It also has supported projects that primarily consist of U.S. government properties. Uncle Sam's backing gives it dependable credit, as he has the power of the U.S. Treasury behind his wallet.In addition, state and local governments tend to back Hannon's projects. All of this aids the company's credibility and the security of its underlying assets and cash flows.With $5.7 billion in assets, it is not the biggest business in the market. But, Hannon reports that it is investing an additional $1 billion each year to add assets.It's portfolio generates interest on financing, amounting to 55% of its revenue. Another 20% comes from rental income, and the remainder from equity participation and portfolio investments. Delivering Energy and RevenuesSource: Chart by Bloomberg Hannon Armstrong Total ReturnRevenues are up over the trailing year by 30.5%. And that revenue has climbed over the past five years by 198.8%.As a REIT-based financial company, its net interest margin (NIM) -- the difference between what it pays to finance itself and what it earns in interest -- is a fat 12.1%. And when comparing it to a traditional financial, its return on assets is well above average at 1.9%. In turn, it has a return on equity of 5.8%.It is a bit more expensive to run the company, which I argue because its efficiency ratio is 64.3%. I would like to see more scale and some cost controls by management, but that should be in the works already.As a REIT, debts are part of the capital structure, so the debt-assets ratio of 57.6% is reasonable and sustainable.The shares have returned 331.5% since coming to the public market in April 2013.You will note in the total return graph that the shares provided a good return in 2018 in line with the REIT segment, including during the turbulent fourth quarter. You will also note that for 2019 to date, the shares are getting more attention with a rising price and dividend income.Dividend distributions are running at 33.5 cents which yields 4.1% -- above the average for REIT dividend yields as measured by the Bloomberg U.S. REITs Index. And those distributions have been on the rise, increasing 7.7% per year over the past five years. Its price-book value of 2.4 is also below the index average, making HASI stock a relative value play. The Bottom Line on HASI StockAs I said above, this REIT is not just a clean energy play, but a hedge against the 2020 election. We are far away from November, but I will continue to evaluate the risks and rewards of potential outcomes. Regardless of who ends up in the White House in 2021, Hannon Armstrong will be on the front line to profit from the nonpartisan green energy market.I am recommending buying HASI stock in a taxable account now.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

2020-03-20,"[Editor's note: &quot;3 of the Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Now&quot; was previously published in December 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]As growth investors look for a good place to put their money, dividend stocks are beginning to look better and better. With the COVID-19 crisis sending stocks for a tumble, people are looking for a little security.Dividend yields have been plunging as lower interest rates are pushing income investors to drive up the price of these stocks. Since yields and stock price have an inverse relationship, it means that many solid dividend stocks appear not so appealing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA different approach is to focus on the payout. However, it's important not to simply invest in companies that offer the largest payout. That's because there are many instances where financially troubled companies offer a high payout to entice investors who would otherwise not put money into the stock.A better approach is to look for companies that are growing their dividend on a consistent basis. Companies with a history of raising their dividends are usually more financially stable, and more likely to maintain their dividend.  * 10 of the Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy in a Bear Market So, let's get right to it and look at three of the best dividend stocks you can buy right now.   Best Dividend Stocks: Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.11%Annual Dividend: $2.15It's not too simplistic to say that Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) is a well-run business. Since the end of 2010 -- two years after its initial public offering (IPO) -- BIP has raised its dividend every year. And forward guidance calls for an annual long-term distribution growth of between 5% and 9%. This supports the company's plan to deliver 12% to 15% annual total returns for investors.Additionally, several reasons make BIP's dividend among the safest and most secure. For starters, the company is one of the fastest growing and most-diversified utilities in the world.No individual business unit accounts for more than 20% of the company's cash flow. In the company's own words it essentially owns &quot;critical and diverse global infrastructure networks which facilitate the movement and storage of energy, water, freight, passengers and data.&quot;Because these assets are hard to replicate, the company can generate predictable returns and a stable cash flow. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.70%Annual Dividend: $1.25Since 2003, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has increased its dividend each year, including a stock split in early March 2015; But that's only part of the story.The company is a dividend aristocrat, having increased its divided every year for 25 consecutive years. That puts them in elite company. But when you combine the length of the dividend with the nearly 10% annualized increase you can see why investors are so excited. And, recently NEE has also given investors a healthy amount of growth. The stock is up nearly 35% in 2019.NEE is one of the largest renewable energy utilities in the country. In the past, renewables have needed to be propped up by government subsidies. But now the costs have come down to the point where in some areas, wind can be comparable to natural gas and coal.  * 7 Vacation Stocks to Leave at Port Now However, NextEra Energy also owns two utility companies in Florida. This predictable electric and gas business helps ensure the strength and growth of future dividends. Travelers Companies (TRV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.81%Annual Dividend: $3.08Travelers (NYSE:TRV) is one of the largest publicly traded insurance companies in the United States. The company has not been providing investors with much revenue growth. However, that's not why shareholders love this stock. Dividends per share, earnings per share and book value per share have all seen impressive growth over the years.In addition to paying a dividend that currently has a yield of over 2%, the company buys back 5-10% of its existing shares every year. And, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15, the share buybacks are very profitable for investors. That's not typically the case. The combination of buybacks and dividends gives shareholders a long-term rate of 7-12% before any growth.TRV has a trailing P/E ratio of 15.21 which is slightly lower than the average P/E of the S&P 500 with is 19.54%. And over the last five years, TRV stock has had an average P/E ratio of 13. But the current P/E ratio is below the stock's highs, suggesting that the stock may still have some room to grow.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-27,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utilities have lined up more than $15 billion in cash and credit as uncertainty over the coronavirus strains the short-term debt market.Electricity giants including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. have sold bonds, entered into new credit facilities or drawn on existing lines to boost liquidity. It follows a surge in costs in the commercial paper market, forcing companies to look for alternatives.“We expect to continue to see utilities drawing on credit lines,” Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in a research note, citing AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement announced Monday. The move is a conservative stance to shore up funds, he said. “We do not see it in any way a sign of overall liquidity risk.”Utilities have also benefited from their defensive nature to issue new debt as the corporate bond market has been open mostly to the highest-quality investment-grade issuers. Banks have enjoyed similar status in comprising much of the recent supply, as well as frequent telecom and media issuers including Verizon Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp.New York utility Consolidated Edison Inc was the latest to tap the credit market with two bond offerings Thursday totaling $1.6 billion. That’s pushed the total amount sold by power and gas suppliers this month to about $9.6 billion, adding to at least $6 billion in new credit lines with banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Xcel Energy Inc. is also seeking to sell $500 million in notes.It has come at a higher cost, as the coronavirus sell-off has sent bond prices down. NextEra Energy Inc.’s $1.1 billion sale of five-year notes Tuesday, through its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, priced at 237.5 basis points over comparable Treasuries. That’s more than twice as much as the company agreed to pay in a similar deal a year ago.NextEra declined to comment.Duke was still able to lock in record-low rates in a sale of $550 million in 30-year notes. Last week the company announced it had a new $1.5 billion term loan and borrowed $500 million from an existing line.“The majority of the funding will be used to reduce our commercial paper balances,” spokesman Neil Nissan said by email. “When the short-term funding markets return to a more stable environment, we may elect to rely on commercial paper like normal.”Other deals include AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement, which the company will use in part to pay down short-term debt. “We took these actions to fortify our liquidity in the challenging markets,” AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry said by email. The company earlier this month also raised almost $1.2 billion through bond offerings.Dominion tapped $1.2 billion in new bank lines while selling $750 million in notes last week, although the bonds were already part of its 2020 financing plans, spokesman Ryan Frazier said.“Yet given market volatility, Dominion Energy has taken prudent steps to increase liquidity via other financing transactions,” he said, noting that Dominion has no plans to drawn on its $6 billion master credit facility.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Utilities Line Up Over $15 Billion as Virus Roils Markets

I started by learning the basics of how companies issue stock, and how stocks are then bought and sold on the exchanges. And my learning commenced with building a model portfolio that I would paper trade. Each day I would check the stock prices -- which way back when were listed in the daily newspapers.I would go on to open a small brokerage account and work with my own money -- all supporting my learning experience. Of course, I would gain and lose along the way.Back then, commissions were a lot steeper than the discounted -- and even free -- rates of today. So, my choices were more about what to buy and own. I had to have a high level of confidence to overcome the costs of buying and selling, which meant I had more &quot;buy and own&quot; in my portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI would later learn and appreciate the power of dividends, which bolstered my portfolio as they were credited to my account. And this appreciation has continued through to today. I remain firmly in favor of focusing on stocks that pay you well through good and rising dividend distributions. Why Dividends MatterThis is an important lesson. Dividends continue to be one of the biggest sources of overall total return in the stock market. Take for example the performance of the S&P 500 over the trailing 20 years.The index gained in price by 104%, but with dividends the return swells to 201.4% which is nearly double the price movement alone.Source: Chart from Bloomberg S&P 500 Total Return That's a big premium over just investing for price growth.

2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Nuclear power plants can now implement longer shifts for workers and delay some inspections, raising concerns that as the coronavirus pandemic upends basic operations the industry may be bending the rules too far.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is already allowing six U.S. power plants to extend workers’ shifts, to as long as 12 hours a day for two weeks, and more may be coming. That’s up significantly from current standards that require people to get two-to-three days off a week when pulling shifts that long. Employees can also work as many as 86 hours in a week now, up from 72 hours.To curb transmission of the virus, utilities also say they want to delay inspections that require people to work in close proximity. Environmental groups, though, warn the changes could have disastrous results, and worry they could lead to further deviations from safety rules.“This is a step backward,” said Eric Epstein, chairman of Three Mile Island Alert, a Pennsylvania non-profit group. “It’s not a good idea to stretch workers and marginalize safety standards.”The new rules come as at least 42 construction workers have tested positive for the coronavirus at a nuclear plant in Georgia where Southern Co. is building two new reactors. Last week, the utility and its partners announced they would reduce the 9,000-person workforce by 20% to slow the spread of the virus. The government considers nuclear power plants to be essential, and reactors will supply almost 21% of the country’s electricity this year.Exelon Corp., operator of the biggest U.S. nuclear fleet, says it “can no longer meet the work-hour controls” at four of its reactors, including the Braidwood plant in Illinois. NextEra Energy Inc. said the same thing about its Seabrook power plant in New Hampshire. The companies say that the extended work hours won’t have an adverse impact on safety.“The work-hour rule exemption is an important contingency that may be implemented to allow healthy workers to remain on site for more hours, reducing the need to bring in outside travelers and vendors,” Exelon spokeswoman Linsey Wisniewski said by email.But watchdog groups are concerned that employees may be overworked, leading to fatigue and potentially errors. “You want an alert workforce,” said Paul Gunter, a director at Beyond Nuclear. “You don’t do this with bus drivers, but they’re saying it’s OK for nuclear power plant workers.”The NRC is also granting utilities utilities permission to defer some inspections as dozens of reactors go through the annual spring refueling cycle. These projects can involve more than 1,000 people converging on a power plant for a month or more of maintenance and testing.Postponed InspectionPinnacle West Capital Corp. also has approval for longer hours and is postponing an inspection of components on the bottom of the reactor vessel at the 3.9-gigawatt Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, the biggest U.S. nuclear plant. The company had initially planned to conduct the evaluation during its refueling outage this spring, but has now pushed that out until the next one, in late 2021. The utility owner determined that the task posed a potential risk of spreading the deadly virus, and could be safely delayed.“Only work that is absolutely required for refueling the unit to safely and reliably operate for the next 18 months is being conducted,” Jill Hanks, a spokeswoman, said by email. The plant has not imposed longer shifts, but now has the option to quickly do so if necessary.New RealityThe NRC is on board with the new reality of operating nuclear plants during a global pandemic and is developing guidance for deferring maintenance work. “There are some ancillary activities during an outage that can be deferred,” said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the agency.Entergy Corp. is planning to defer some leak tests at pipes at its Grand Gulf reactor in Mississippi. The tests typically are due every 11 1/2 years, but will now be rescheduled for the next refueling outage in 18 months. Pushing that period out to 13 years won’t affect safety, the company said by email. And at the Indian Point facility north of New York City, Entergy is also seeking permission to postpone annual physical evaluations for firefighters.Nuclear watchdogs are paying close attention to four sites that have requested permission to delay tests on steam generator piping, including Exelon’s Braidwood. The agency already approved NextEra’s request for its Turkey Point plant in Florida.The pipes carry water at high pressure, allowing it to stay liquid even as temperatures reach 600 degrees Fahrenheit (316 degrees Celsius). They are supposed to be inspected every three years, with the job requiring people working in close proximity. Because of the virus, the operators are seeking to delay this until the next refueling cycle in 18 months.Fraught HistoryThese components have a fraught history. In 1999, Consolidated Edison Inc. sought a similar delay to inspect the generator piping at Indian Point, which it owned at the time. The company was granted a 12-month deferral, but eight months later one of them started to leak. While a small amount of radioactive gas escaped into the air, the incident was quickly contained and the NRC concluded it didn’t pose a threat to health.A report by the NRC’s Office of the Inspector General later found that the agency’s original evaluation, approving the delay, was “not adequate.” The NRC’s Burnell said the agency has learned a lot about those systems in the past two decades and there’s little chance that kind of accident would be repeated now.Requests for delays must be accompanied by significant documentation, and “the NRC will only consider deferring the required inspections if that information clearly shows it’s reasonable to expect continued safe operation of the steam generators until the next inspection,” Burnell said by email.‘Speculative to Compare’NextEra said “it would be speculative to compare conditions at Turkey Point to conditions at other nuclear plants,” spokeswoman Lindsay Robertson said by email.Beyond Nuclear’s Gunter says the Indian Point leak may have been prevented if the inspection had taken place on schedule, and the incident points to the potential risks of extending maintenance reviews. As the coronavirus affects the entire global economy, he’s concerned that a wave of extension requests from utilities may lead to other incidents.“It’s a gamble,” Gunter said. ”Our concern is that they’re creating the conditions for a perfect storm. There could be a catastrophic incident that results from postponing inspections combined with fatigue from people that are overworked.”(Updates with EIA forecast in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",New Rules for Nuclear Plant Workers: 12-Hour Days for Two Weeks Straight

2020-04-30,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utilities are mostly shrugging off the coronavirus even as stay-at-home orders hamstring demand for electricity.The first power and natural gas suppliers to report quarterly earnings, including NextEra Energy Inc. and Southern Co., have maintained their forecasts and capital spending targets for the year, saying they remain well positioned to meet their goals.The results underscore how power companies are more insulated than most businesses from the downturn that’s ravaging the global economy. While demand for electricity from factories and offices has all-but dried up, residential customers, who pay higher rates, need more power than ever as people spend their days at home hunched over laptops and watching Netflix.“There’s an offsetting effect -- it’s still net negative, but our sense is it’s within the helm of our ability to adjust the expenses.” Southern Chief Executive Officer Thomas Fanning said in an interview.To be clear, the virus is impacting utilities. Overall power use is down in most regions, and that’s hurting revenue.Southern warned stay-at-home policies may drag down its annualized 2020 retail sales by up to 5%. Michigan-based DTE Energy Co. said it will have to trim operation and maintenance expenses to offset lower revenue. And CMS Energy Corp., which also serves Michigan, has seen industrial sales slump by as much as 25% and said it’s unclear when they’ll bounce back.“At this point there is just too many unknowns,” CMS CEO Patricia Poppe said during a call with analysts. “We don’t feel that we know enough right now.”By and large, however, utilities remain optimistic. Southern left its long-term outlook unchanged, saying it expected earnings per share to grow at a rate of 4% to 6%. DTE reaffirmed its 2020 operating earnings-per-share guidance of $6.47 to $6.75.NextEra even managed to increase its first-quarter revenue by 13%, to $4.61 billion. “I have confidence in our ability to meet our financial expectations, even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes related to the current pandemic,” CEO James Robo said in a statement.While soaring unemployment raises the specter that millions of residential customers may be left unable to pay their electric bills, many fully regulated utilities can recoup some of those losses from states. “I don’t see anything that I’m worried about taking this off track,” FirstEnergy Corp. CEO Charles Jones said during a call with analysts. “That’s why we’re comfortable with being able to not only reaffirm our guidance for this year, but reaffirm our” compound annual growth rate.Utilities are also bullish on their prospects to develop more clean energy projects.Avangrid Inc., a subsidiary of Spanish utility giant Iberdrola SA, said there’s no slowdown in demand for clean energy. NextEra’s Robo said he’s “never been more confident” in the ability of his company, the largest U.S. wind developer, to meet its renewable goals.“We believe the market opportunity for low-cost renewables has never been greater,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Utilities Shrug Off Virus With Help From Residential Sales

2020-06-05,"This market has been on a tear. If, as the old saying goes, bull markets climb a wall of worry, this one has leapt that wall in a single bound.Now, maybe with all the Federal Reserve support and the trillions of dollars in stimulus approved by Congress this will continue.But there are also 40 million people out of work and the economy is in a recession that goes far beyond America's shores.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're an investor looking for opportunity but would also like sleep-at-night safety, or would like to go on holiday without looking at your portfolio every few hours, then utilities are a good place to start.For many electric utilities, they have both regulated and unregulated operations. That means one part of the operation provides a solid foundation of conservative growth. And the other provides opportunity to sell energy at market prices, offering greater growth.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts Here are 7 utility stocks keeping the lights on below  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)  * Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP)  * Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN)  * Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA)  * Atlantica Sustainable Technologies (NYSE:AY)These are well-established companies with long records of growth and safety. Between that and their traditionally strong dividend yields, that makes high-quality utilities a must-have for my Growth Investor buy list. Utility Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com This company is a prime example of what I was talking about in the intro. It operates FPL (Florida Power & Light), which is a regulated utility that serves southern Florida.And it is also the largest producer of wind and solar energy in the world.Its regulated business operates in high-growth, densely populated sector of the state, which means solid, reliable returns.And its unregulated business sells renewable energy across the US to other utilities and industry. They can use the renewable energy to offset their carbon emissions and they don't have to get into the renewables business. It's a model that more and more utilities are adopting.Also, renewables are more resilient as climactic events rise.The stock is up 26% in the past year and 7% year to date. The latter figure is bullish given the drop in industrial and commercial demand due to COVID-19 lockdowns. NEE has a 2.2% dividend. You can see why this is among my favorite Elite Dividend Payer stocks for my Growth Investor recommendations. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. It is the main regulated utility in Virginia as well as parts of the Carolinas. Meanwhile, its natural gas business covers the aforementioned as well as West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Utah and Wyoming.D has a $72 billion market cap and a rock-solid business in Virginia, where there are significant corporate offices for defense contractors, telecommunications and internet firms. The point being, it has steady strong demand on both the consumer and commercial sides.Its unregulated business leans on its natural gas operations. It's one of a handful of companies that has both extensive natural gas distribution assets as well as an export facility.Exporting natural gas is a huge opportunity, since natural gas prices are triple (or higher) in European and Asian markets. D also has expanding renewable operations in and beyond its core service areas.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 12% in the past year, 3% year to date. But it has a generous and rock-solid 4.4% dividend. American Water Works (AWK)Source: Shutterstock AWK's roots go back to 1886 when it was operating as a utility in the US and Canada. And its journey to its current path has been somewhat circuitous but now it operates divisions in more than 46 states and serves 14 million customers.The story of the water business has changed over the years. It used to be that cities, towns or municipalities ran their own water companies. But over the past 3 decades that became increasingly expensive, since this isn't a core competency of many municipal governments.This was the precursor to the rise of water utilities that could operate these water systems for the governments at set rates, like any other utility. The utilities could do this because they could operate at scale and were focused on just one task. This has worked out very well for both AWK and the states it operates in.AWK also has contracts for military bases, which is a reliable source of income. Given the current challenges of water demand for commercial and consumer operations, AWK is in a growth market with a broad reach.The stock is up 13% in the past year and 8% year to date. It also has a 1.7% dividend. And I've got even better growth-and-income plays where that came from. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Source: Shutterstock Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is a Canada-based company with properties around the world. Those properties include utilities, transport, energy and data infrastructure businesses. BIP has been operating for 105 years and is still going strong.Just this year it was in a bidding war with Australia-based Macquarie Infrastructure (NYSE:MIC) for telecom Cincinnati Bell (NYSE:CBB). In the end it lost out to MIC.However, the company has a diverse portfolio of assets, which means it can take advantage of opportunities in a number of different industries, given their economic cycle.The company is structured as a limited partnership, which means stockholders are treated a direct owners, and net income is distributed as a generous dividend. That dividend currently sits at 4.6%.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 10% in the past year, despite being off nearly 7% year to date. Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN)Source: Shutterstock Canadian firm Alqgonquin Power holds an interesting mix of assets. And while its name might not be familiar to most south of the border, AQN has operations in 12 U.S. states under its subsidiary Liberty Utilities.Liberty's operations range from operating sewer companies to gas, water and electric operations in select cities and districts. Many of the properties were acquired from companies looking to spin off smaller operations and those that weren't matching the larger focus of the company.AQN can operate these at smaller scales and still remain profitable. That's the kind of business model I look for in making Growth Investor picks. The company also is very involved in renewable energy efforts in Canada, including hydroelectric projects.AQN delivers an attractive 4.2% dividend and the stock is up 20% in the past 12 months, and 3% year to date. Ormat Technologies (ORA)Source: Shutterstock This unique company started in Israel in the mid-1960s. It developed a proprietary turbine that could convert geothermal or recovered energy (the heat generated by other equipment) into electricity.By the oil crisis in the '70s, the value of self-sufficient, renewable energy resources became a very popular concept.In the decades that followed, ORA installed geothermal systems in Israel, New Zealand, Iceland, Guatemala, Kenya and the U.S. Today, the company is headquartered in Nevada.Most renewable energy headlines go to solar or wind these days, but there is a growing demand for geothermal as well. ORA has a solar division as well, plus a technology that can separate oil from oil sands more efficiently than traditional processes.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts While it is an energy company, it doesn't operate as a utility, so its dividend isn't spectacular, sitting at 0.6%. ORA is up 15% in the past year, and off 5% year to date. But its technology is at the heart of where energy generation, and thus utility consumption, is going. Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure (AY)Source: Shutterstock Atlantica Sustainable is a UK-based firm that owns a diversified portfolio of energy assets around the world.From solar farms in Spain, the US, South Africa and the Sahara, to wind turbines in Peru to electrical grids in Chile, AY has operations that span a variety of sectors in a range of countries.Almost all of its contracts are dollar or euro based, which helps stabilize its income stream. And most projects are under contract for the next decade or longer. This allows the company to look for new projects and show that it can sustain the new opportunity costs.Launched in 2013, the company is relatively new to the game, but its renewables focus certainly makes it a strong play on growth in the overall sector. It has a $2.8 billion market cap, so it's growing well.The stock is up 23% in the past 12 months and 3% in year to date. But it also has a 5.9% dividend, which is certainly a nice kicker.Speaking of income and growth plays…Currently, my Portfolio Grader I used to find Growth Investor stocks is picking up plenty of buys in all kinds of sectors. One that I'm particularly excited about now is helping enable a major upgrade across the telecom industry, across the world. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your wireless internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has good fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system now.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation. Louis Navellier may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2020-07-24,NextEra Energy's (NEE) second-quarter earnings surpass expectation on strong operational performance despite COVID-19 challenges.,"NextEra Energy (NEE) Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales Miss"
2020-07-24,"NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) saw a drop in both earnings and sales after Q2. Earnings dropped to $308.00 million, a 96.22% decrease from the previous quarter. Sales fell to $4.20 billion, down 8.87% from the previous quarter. In Q1, NextEra Energy earned $8.15 billion and total sales reached $4.61 billion.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, NextEra Energy posted an ROCE of -0.6%.View more earnings on NEEKeep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows NextEra Energy is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For NextEra Energy, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings NextEra Energy reported Q2 earnings per share at $2.61/share against analyst predictions of $2.49/share.See more from Benzinga  * NextEra Energy's Debt Overview  * Earnings Scheduled For July 24, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-24,"Shares of NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE) moved higher by 17.63% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt NextEra Energy has.NextEra Energy's Debt According to the NextEra Energy's most recent financial statement as reported on April 23, 2020, total debt is at $48.09 billion, with $41.12 billion in long-term debt and $6.98 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $3.33 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $44.76 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. NextEra Energy has $120.64 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.4. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 24, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-14,"Almost anywhere you look in the market, you can find stocks with price-earnings ratios in the triple digits. But no sector makes this reality more evident than renewables. With that in mind, where should investors be looking for solar stocks to buy?Small firms that have survived the boom-and-bust cycles of recent years are once again in fashion. And low interest rates means financing solar is a more compelling option for homeowners and businesses. Why? Solar creates more energy independence and helps property owners save money over the long term.What's more, if paired with a generator, solar becomes a way to lean less on the increasingly stressed, antiquated and unreliable energy grid.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut small companies are just one way to take advantage. As I mentioned last week, there are some big companies leading an eco-friendly shift in institutional investing.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Most of the best solar stocks to buy today are solid, large-cap stocks that have plenty going for them. And they help investors avoid the big premiums that typical solar plays command. Lastly, these six picks are all strong long-term investments.  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK)  * Xcel Energy (NYSE:XEL)  * Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (NYSE:HASI)  * Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Solar Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Its regulated business may be the leading utility in southern Florida, but its unregulated business is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy.And this is precisely the kind of stock I'm talking about here. It offers a steady, regulated utility business, so there's a solid dividend and nearly guaranteed returns, as well as a business with a massive growth kicker.Florida Power & Light (now FPL) was launched in 1928, and has been powering the second fastest-growing city and region in the United States.In 2009, it became the largest renewable energy producer in the U.S. And it has grown that lead ever since. That size and scale makes it very attractive to businesses and other utilities that want to add renewable energy to their energy mix but can't afford to build at scale.The stock is up 30% in the past 12 months, and still delivers a nearly 2% dividend. But there's plenty of upside left. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With a $66 billion market capitalization, Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. With 7 million customers, its prime service area includes the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area including the Pentagon, as well as Tidewater Virginia, where one of the biggest shipyards and a significant number of armed forces sit.In recent years, Dominion was focused on taking advantage of its natural gas properties in the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere. The industry was converting coal-fired plants to natural gas, and there were enormous export possibilities present.But it ran into significant headwinds building pipelines out of the Marcellus to distribution centers in Virginia and North Carolina. Even as it prevailed in court, it sold most of its gas pipeline and production business to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B).Now, it's plowing that cash into expanding its solar and wind operations. And Wall Street is loving it. It's up about 4% in the last year and has a 4.7% dividend as well. Solar Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com This North Carolina-based utility has been a leader in alternative energy resources for decades.DUK has about 7.8 million customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. In the old days, King Coal powered the plants that generated electricity for these markets, since most of its service area was in or very near coal country.But it started to realize that East Coast coal was a dwindling -- and dirty -- resource and saw the need to pivot to more efficient and cheaper resources. That transition has been underway for decades. And now, DUK is a leader in utility-scale renewable energy distribution and development.DUK stock is off about 8% for the year, but its 4.6% dividend gets you back close to breakeven. It's a great long-term pick for investors looking for stable, investor-friendly growth. Xcel Energy (XEL)Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com Usually, there's not a lot of news about upper-Midwest companies unless they're exploration and production companies, agriculture firms or mining companies.XEL is a Minnesota-based utility with 3.7 million electric and 2.1 million natural gas customers in its home state, as well as the Dakotas, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and New Mexico.In a region where there's plenty of coal and natural gas, XEL was the first major corporation to declare that its electricity generation was going 100% carbon-free by 2050, and 80% carbon-free by 2030. That's a big deal.It has significant plans to add solar and wind from now to then. And that will transform energy systems in the High Plains.XEL stock is up almost 13% in 2020, but it remains a bargain. That's why Xcel Energy is one of the best solar stocks to buy. Solar Stocks to Buy: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI)Source: Shutterstock Beyond the great long-term choices the utilities here offer, this is a hidden gem that has been overlooked by the broader market.And, it is a great play for two reasons. First, it is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT), which means it pays you its net profits in the form of dividends.Second, its primary focus is the financing, development and installation of renewable energy projects. And most of these projects have state or federal backing, so the financing is rock solid, as well as the rents.At this point, HASI sports a $2.8 billion market cap, and it's about as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock, even in this hot sector. Plus, it's up nearly 45% in the last year and still delivers a 3.4% dividend. Canadian Solar (CSIQ)Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com I'm sure some of you are hankering for a pure-play solar company, so I found one that avoids the triple-digit valuations that most firms have at this point.That other danger to avoid is buying companies that have a lot of potential, but don't have the established markets to make it work. If you remember SolarCity, a solar company that was bankrolled by billionaire Elon Musk, it could barely make it through the troughs and valleys and was finally absorbed into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It's not easy.But CSIQ doesn't have those problems because its main market, as its name suggests, is Canada. But it has subsidiaries in 20 countries on six continents including 17 manufacturing facilities in Asia and the Americas.It has shipped over 46 gigawatt modules and currently sits on a 15-GW production backlog, which means CSIQ has plenty of business to keep it going, even during a global pandemic.What's more, it has a U.S. division, Recurrent Energy, that has 2.4 GW of projects up and running in the U.S. and a 7-GW project pipeline.CSIQ stock's trailing P/E is still below 6 times and it's up 17% in the past year. It has a $1.5 billion market cap, so it's not huge, but it's big enough for institutions to buy in.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

But given where we are in the current 'recovery', with major market indexes hitting all-time highs despite unemployment over 10% and a raging pandemic, sometimes it's hard to reconcile the bullish market attitude.Case in point: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was trading at $222 last year at this time. It now trades around $2033. It has a four-digit price-to-earnings ratio and it's still rising.Having been through my share of &quot;different&quot; bull market tops that turned out not to be very different at all, I've learned to hedge my bets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now Investors hoping for the best while preparing for the worst should consider these 5 win-win stocks to buy:  * B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY)  * Centene (NYSE:CNC)  * Ritchie Brothers Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA)  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)I prefer to pick stocks that stand to benefit from every last ounce of upside, but are equally well positioned if everything sells off tomorrow. Win-Win Stocks To Buy Now: B. Riley (RILY)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com With a market cap of just $670 million, this diversified financial company has largely flown under the radar for two reasons.First, it's not a big name tech or biotech stock. Second, its business doesn't easily square into just one business sector. It has 6 divisions that are focused on various financial instruments, from investment management, financing solutions and auctions.The last of those is the most interesting, since this particular sector is very active under market circumstances like these. If a business owner is, say, struggling with a brick-and-mortar store, they may decide to sell the property and take the business online.RILY would be brought in to auction it off. Potential buyers are looking for bargains in a toppy market, and RILY could help both sides finance the deal. Maybe even offer different property solutions.The company also provides money management solutions for high net worth individuals and companies. But all of its traditional divisions are bolstered by its auction services, since that segment shines when times get tough and markets get unsteady.The stock is up 42% in the past 3 months, 27% over the past 12 months. It's price to sales (PS) and price to book (PB) are very low, as is its PE ratio. Plus, it has an impressive 4.5% dividend. Centene (CNC)Source: Shutterstock From humble beginnings operating out of the basement of Family Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, back in 1984, to serving all 50 states, the Department of Defense and 3 international markets with nearly 70,000 employees, managed healthcare solutions provider Centene has come a long way.With a market cap now sitting at $36 billion, CNC is a leader in managing government-sponsored healthcare solutions like Medicaid, Tri-Star and state programs.Given the current challenges to both the U.S. healthcare system and the economy, the spotlight will be on healthcare and healthcare reform this election cycle. And that means Centene will be a key player in its solution.If the economy is slow to recover, CNC's services will be in great demand as the unemployed and underemployed reach out for healthcare assistance during the pandemic.And any expansion of healthcare benefits for struggling Americans will be handled by Centene and others. Plus, since it manages other organizations' health plans, it has well-funded clients regardless of the economy.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now CNC stock remains an absolute bargain in a toppy market on PE, PB and PS bases. And that's after a near-40% run in the stock over the past year. Ritchie Bros Auctioneers (RBA)As its name implies, this company is built around its auction business. Started by David Ritchie in 1958 in Burnaby, Canada, RBA is now a multinational industrial asset disposition and management business.Basically, that means its auctions are mostly focused on industrial equipment -- agriculture, mining, transport, construction, drilling, etc.Today RBA is headquartered in Vancouver, with an American headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska. It has more than 40 auction sites across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, as well as a quickly growing online auction business.Its gross transactional value in 2019 was over $5 billion, a number which should continue to grow.In times of economic uncertainty, weaker players sell off assets to stay afloat and auctions allow them to do it piecemeal rather than sell off all their equipment. Stronger firms can slowly add to their equipment assets by picking and choosing optimal price points.As a market weakens, equipment auctions have become a popular strategy. Participation in online and app-based auctions is expanding rapidly, reflected in growing sales from these platforms.RBA also has a financial services arm to help with financing merchandise.RBA stock has been getting very popular recently -- up 60% over the past year -- but it has a nearly $7 billion market cap and is heading into a good economic environment for its services, so the premium is understandable. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com One way to hedge your bets in a strange market is to stick with predictable companies, like utilities. NextEra Energy stock definitely fits the bill.Whether people are working from home or at offices, they need electricity. And a quick glance around your home probably confirms the anecdotal wisdom: we have more devices, gadgets and gizmos than ever.Plus, utilities have a regulated side, which means they are allowed a certain operating profit from state regulators to provide a fundamentally monopoly service. Doesn't get much safer than that.NEE operates FPL, the utility that powers one of the fastest growing regions in the US, southern Florida.But many utilities have an unregulated side as well, where they can sell their wares at whatever prices the market will bear. This is where NEE has really come into its own.NEE is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy. This has two major advantages right now.First, many industries are looking to cut their carbon footprint to avoid carbon taxes. And as the antiquated American energy grid continues into disrepair, distributed energy from renewables makes for a smart alternative.Second, ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) investing is becoming a powerful force in the institutional investing world. This the market with the financial services firms, pension funds, hedge funds and major endowment funds dwell. It controls around 80% of market activity.And they're looking at ESG investing as the next big thing.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now That has NEE on the radar for a lot of investors. NEE stock is up 21% in the past 3 months and trades at a slight premium. But if the market slips, this stock will be able to keep on chugging along. It also pays a 2% dividend. BlackRock (BLK)Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com Imagine an investment management company so big, powerful and good at what it does that when the economy rolls over, the Federal Reserve calls you to manage its emergency assets.That's what happened to BLK in 2008 and again in 2020.When the Fed needed a company to help buy $750 billion in bonds to prop up the US economy earlier this year, it turned to BLK. That's no small deal.Remember, asset management companies make their money on assets under management (AUM). When you add $750 billion AUM in one day, that's a pretty good day. But BLK has about $7.4 trillion under management, so it wasn't exactly slacking before all this.It's no surprise that even before that happened, BLK was the world's largest money manager. It also runs iShares brand ETFs. But it isn't charging the Fed management fees on the ETF shares that it uses to disperse the Fed's money.But again, having those assets is a big deal, since the company can leverage its trading accounts and operations on having those assets.The crazy thing is, after rising 44% in the past year, BLK stock is still trading at 20 times PE. And it delivers a solid 2.5% dividend besides. This is one of the best in the business, come what may.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

2020-09-01,"NextEra Energy Resources, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NEE), has revealed plans to build nearly 700 MW of fully-contracted battery storage projects in California before the end of 2022- with a capital investment of nearly $800 million.This development could nearly double the total installed capacity of battery storage in the US available today (approximately 1,350 MWs).“California needs significant investment in battery storage to meet its aggressive clean energy goals,” said NextEra Energy Resources CEO John Ketchum, noting that the California Public Utility Commission has now approved all 523 MW of the projects.“Once these projects are operational by the end of 2022, Californians will benefit from more low-cost, emission-free solar energy during more hours of the day, as well as improved reliability across the regional electric grid” Ketchum added.The battery storage projects will be co-located at six existing NextEra Energy Resources solar projects and include the previously announced 63 MW at Blythe 110 Solar Energy Center, 115 MW at Blythe II Solar Energy Center and 230 MW at the McCoy Solar Energy Center.In addition, NextEra Energy Resources has a current pipeline of nearly 2,000 MW of shovel-ready or near shovel-ready battery energy storage projects in California.The company says the build out of this 2,000 MW energy storage pipeline is contingent on obtaining long-term power purchase agreements for the projects as well as the necessary regulatory approvals.Shares in NextEra are currently trading up 15% year-to-date, and the stock scores a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus.

2020-09-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Three power plants planned in New York, Virginia and Ohio will test whether hydrogen can one day replace natural gas in electric generation.Power producers Danskammer Energy LLC, Balico LLC and EmberClear are paying Mitsubishi Power Americas Inc. more than $3 billion for the facilities, which will collectively generate 3,284 megawatts of electricity. While the plants will initially run on natural gas alone, they’ll eventually shift to burning green hydrogen produced and stored on-site. They’re designed to make it easier to ramp up hydrogen use as production increases, said Chief Executive Officer Paul Browning.Green hydrogen -- produced by stripping the gas from water using electrolyzers powered by wind and solar -- is seen as key to eliminating carbon emissions from the industrial sector that now relies on natural gas as both a fuel source and a feedstock.Other electric generators are also exploring integrating green hydrogen into their power production in an effort to slash emissions as more states set renewable-energy mandates. Utility NextEra Energy Inc. in July announced it will run one of its Florida power plants, in part, on hydrogen, using solar power to strip the gas from water.“There is clearly an opportunity five to 10 years from now to displace the last 10% of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen with renewables,”Jim Robo, NextEra’s chief executive officer said during an earnings call in July.Mitsubishi earlier this year announced its first hydrogen storage and power project for $1.9 billion in Utah to serve the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and has created a standard power plant design that is being used in the new U.S. projects. While the L.A. project is being built for a municipal utility, the others will serve competitive power markets in the Midwest and East Coast including PJM Interconnection, which operates the country’s largest power, and the New York Independent System Operator.The first will be Danskammer’s 600-megawatt plant in Newburgh, New York. Danskammer Chief Executive Officer William Reid said in a statement the project would help the state meet its climate goals. The Balico plant in Virginia will generate 1,600 megawatts while EmberClear’s Ohio facility will have a capacity of 1,084 megawatts. EmberClear is in the early stages of developing another plant using Mitsubishi’s technology in eastern Pennsylvania, Chief Executive Officer Raj Suri said in a statement.The plants are expected to be in service between 2023 and 2025, and hydrogen will be used to substitute gas as it becomes available.“The timeline is going to be different for every project,” said Mitsubishi’s Browning. “It’s not going to be driven by technology -- it’s going to be driven by the needs of the local grid.” The company is in discussions with other utilities and developers to build more hydrogen-ready plants, he said.Mitsubishi Power, based in Lake Mary, Florida, is a fully-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in Tokyo.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",$3 Billion Planned for Next-Generation Hydrogen Power Plants
2020-09-02,"The utilities sector was enjoying a unanimous rally Wednesday, as downbeat jobs data helped push Treasury yields toward a fourth-straight decline. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  surged 3.0% in afternoon trading, enough to make it the strongest of the SPDR ETFs tracking the S&P 500's  11 key sectors.

In Q1, NextEra Energy earned $1.71 billion, and total sales reached $4.61 billion.What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in NextEra Energy's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, NextEra Energy posted an ROCE of 0.03%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on NEEReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For NextEra Energy, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Insight NextEra Energy reported Q2 earnings per share at $2.61/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.49/share.See more from Benzinga  * How Does NextEra Energy's Debt Look?  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 4, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-15,"Over the past three months, shares of NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) moved higher by 23.86%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt NextEra Energy has.NextEra Energy's Debt Based on NextEra Energy's financial statement as of July 24, 2020, long-term debt is at $42.67 billion and current debt is at $4.88 billion, amounting to $47.55 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.01 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $46.54 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering NextEra Energy's $121.96 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.39. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 4, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Just dirty, man. It's legal, but sounds really dirty to me. And everybody who bought on that stock split is burned,&quot; Dick said.Even though stock splits don't inherently increase the market cap of the stock or fund, stock splits are generally seen as a positive by the market.

However, Tesla critics called out the company for announcing a $5 billion stock offering the day after its stock split.Dick said stock splits do not actually contribute any fundamental value to a stock, but offerings are fundamentally dilutive, meaning they reduce investors' ownership of the company.He said the timing of the announcement is no coincidence, and the company certainly knew about the offering before announcing the split.&quot;There's underwriters and stuff involved. So they pumped it up with the split to try to get their offering done at a better price. And in my opinion, and obviously I haven't gone into the details of it all, but just looking at the headline, it sounds to me like it was a pump-and-dump,&quot; Dick said.Watch to the full discussion on NEE in the clip below, or listen to the podcast  herePreMarket Prep is a daily trading show hosted by prop trader Dennis Dick and former floor trader Joel Elconin.

2020-09-16,"Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley.

7 Airline Stocks to Buy on Pelosi Stimulus Hopes
Tech stocks have ruled the roost this year, but utility stocks’ importance in a well-rounded portfolio cannot be denied either. Therefore, let’s look at three utility stocks that remained resilient despite the effects of the pandemic.
American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)
AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)

American Water Works provides regulated water and wastewater services to homeowners and the military. It is currently the largest water and wastewater utility company in the U.S.
Additionally, it also makes money using specific market-based activities. It remained resilient in the face of the pandemic, as AWK stock grew 13.7% relative to the S&P 500.
It recently reported its solid second-quarter results. Earnings per share (EPS) for six months ended June 30 was at $1.65, roughly 5.8% compared to the prior-year period. Income from its regulated business was $177 million, compared to $156 million in the same period last year.
Additionally, income from market-based activities also increased by $2 million. Despite the slowdown in water usage in the country, the increase in prices has helped offset revenues’ impact.
Moreover, the directors announced a quarterly cash dividend payment of 55 cents per share. Hence, the dividend growth rate for the past year for the company is around 10%. American Water Works expects to grow its EPS and dividends at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7% to 10% from 2019 to 2024.

NextEra Energy (NEE)

NextEra Energy is the most valuable energy company in terms of market capitalization in the U.S. It runs regulated electric utilities in Florida and a nonregulated energy business operating natural gas and renewable energy projects.
Additionally, it boasts one of the most robust financial profiles in the sector, with the highest credit ratings among businesses of its kind. NEE stock’s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a healthy 19.3%.
The company reported its second-quarter results back in July, which was weighed down by the pandemic. The adjusted EPS for the quarter was at $2.61, surpassing expectations by 4.4%. However, revenues were down 15.4%. Revenues across all its segments lagged behind consensus estimates. Nevertheless, the company’s earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% to 8% per year through 2021.

Its financial strength continues to impress as cash and cash equivalents were up 268% crossing the $1 billion mark. Moreover, the company plans to increase its dividend by approximately 10% per year through 2022.

AES Corporation (AES)

AES is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S. operating in multiple nations. It has one of the most diversified portfolios of distribution and electricity generation businesses.
Additionally, it is among the top electric utility companies leading the charge towards renewable energy. AES stock’s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a solid 10.9%.
The pandemic weighed down the company’s second-quarter results. Adjusted EPS was down 3.8% to 25 cents while revenues dropped 11.3%. Despite the slowdown, the management feels that market demand is better than their expectations, and collections are in line with historical levels. The company expects a 7% to 9% average growth rate for its business through to 2022.
AES is betting heavily on the green revolution and hopes to generate less than 10% of its electricity from coal by 2030. It is aggressively retiring its coal plants and remains focused on increasing its renewable plants.

2020-10-27,"Shares of NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) increased by 7.97% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt NextEra Energy has.NextEra Energy's Debt According to the NextEra Energy's most recent balance sheet as reported on October 23, 2020, total debt is at $49.42 billion, with $42.79 billion in long-term debt and $6.63 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $1.96 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $47.46 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering NextEra Energy's $126.38 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.39. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

In Q2, NextEra Energy earned $1.17 billion and total sales reached $4.20 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in NextEra Energy's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, NextEra Energy posted an ROCE of 0.02%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on NEEROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows NextEra Energy is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In NextEra Energy's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Recap NextEra Energy reported Q3 earnings per share at $2.66/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.58/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Recap: NextEra Energy Q3 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For October 21, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Of course, it would be incredibly harsh to judge any energy-related company on its fiscal performance this year. Though the novel coronavirus pandemic has negatively affected every investment sector – with some rare exceptions, like telehealth – the crisis has been especially brutal for Energy Transfer stock and its ilk.
With this context included, there was fortunately some bright spots in the Q3 report. As the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Dallas-based company said it had a loss of 29 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for asset impairment costs, were 30 cents per share.
The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 23 cents per share.
Heading into the disclosure, Energy Transfer stock closed the session down 3%. But in the afterhours session, ET made a robust bounce back, gaining over 6%. Clearly, covering analysts were pleasantly surprised with the energy firm’s contextually solid performance.

Further, despite sharply rising new coronavirus infections, we have evidence that people have learned to manage the crisis.
By now, we’ve acclimated to the new normal, which involves social distancing and mask-wearing in public places where keeping safe distances is not practical.
Plus, travel demand has improved significantly from this year’s sentiment lows, suggesting that Americans are ready to move forward.
If that wasn’t enough evidence, President Trump garnered tremendous support for his pro-economy, anti-lockdown policies. Yet again, the polls were wrong, which in turn bodes well for Energy Transfer stock. After all, people sheltering in place isn’t exactly helpful for energy demand.
Still, you might want to avoid jumping in at this moment.
A Biden Win Doesn’t Help Energy Transfer Stock
Heading into election day, everyone knew that it was going to be a contentious event.
Though Trump’s base gained a well-earned reputation for enthusiasm and loyalty, millions of Americans were frustrated with the federal government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Sure, Trump has consistently deflected blame onto China. And I’m no fan of the communist regime over there. However, there’s a saying (an American one) that the buck stops here. It’s a principle that’s stuck in our psyche.
Frankly, responsible parents teach their children not to blame others for their own shortcomings. So, it was jarring when the President kept whining instead of grinding to help the American people.
But Trump supporters came out in full force, surprising the Democrats (which is another story in itself). In addition, the blue wave didn’t show up, with Democrats failing to make the ground they promised in the Senate race. Overall, it was incredibly disappointing for the left.
Still, former Vice President Joe Biden has the higher probability of winning the election from where I stand. If after all the drama he does become president, this in theory wouldn’t be helpful to Energy Transfer stock. However, I think this is an overhyped argument.
Don’t get me wrong – I’m not clamoring to buy Energy Transfer stock right now. But the idea that a Democratic administration will do away with fossil fuels and implement clean energy infrastructure is nonsense.
Yes, clean energy will come but probably not as a disruptive competitor, aAs I pointed out in my article for NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE):
“With time and technology, renewable energy sources could start eating into fossil fuels. But it will probably not be in time to meet Biden’s deadline [of net zero emissions by 2050] given the snail’s pace of the clean, green industry.”
If you’re worried about politics impacting Energy Transfer stock, it’s not the presidential race you should be concerned about but the Senate.
Four Years of Lame “Duckery”
As you know, if Biden becomes President-elect, Trump will become a lame duck president. He’ll be in power but with his successor already chosen, he doesn’t really have much incentive to do anything.
However, once Biden gets in (under this theoretical scenario – the vote counting is presently contested), he may have four years of being a lame duck.
That’s because it’s looking likely that the Republicans will hold the Senate. In this case, the right maintains significant influence and power. And they will have zero incentive to go along with any of Biden’s policies that have a hint of liberalism associated with it.
Remember, the Republicans were supposedly very unpopular. Yet they put on an outstanding performance, which means pushing liberal agendas will result in quick one-off terms for Biden and perhaps many other Democrats.
This also means that critical measures such as stimulus checks are off the table. Frankly, that may have been the lifeline that kept many American households from going over the edge sooner.
Essentially, due to hardline politics, the economy/markets could correct severely, with Democrats possibly on the hook for it.
Regardless of the politics, having a rough economy does no favors for energy demand. As a result, I’m staying away from Energy Transfer stock until at least we can get some clarity as to where the country is headed.

In the 2020 campaign, Biden emphasized that he would promote renewable energy. Moreover, the lion’s share of his voters very much want the government to strongly incentivize the growth of solar and wind energy in the U.S.
NextEra’s Energy Resources unit has 19 gigawatts of solar and wind in operation and 13 gigawatts of those renewable -energy sources in its backlog, along with 2.5 gigawatts of battery-storage projects either in use or in backlog. As a result, NextEra and NEE stock should benefit from Biden’s pro-renewable energy agenda.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Tariffs and Tax Breaks
I believe that one of the reasons that solar stocks haven’t rallied tremendously since the election is that Democrats lost seats in the House and will probably not take control of the Senate. Moreover,  centrist Democrats like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio will more or less have a veto on all legislation.
Also, in all likelihood, Congress will not implement a carbon tax or pass the Green New Deal.
7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season
But Biden has a commitment to increase the proliferation of solar energy and his lack of interest in confronting China in the past. He is expected to eliminate tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on solar panels from China. That, in turn, should dramatically lower the cost of the panels. This will meaningfully raising the bottom lines of solar-project owners, including NextEra.
Further, in 2021 Congress will more than likely pass much higher tax breaks for the owners of solar projects. These tax credits dropped sharply during Trump’s administration. Congress will probably restore the tax breaks because, historically, there was bipartisan support for them. Additionally, lawmakers tend to give presidents much of what they want, as long as what they’re seeking isn’t extremely controversial. Consequently, the tax bills of solar-project owners, including Next Era, should drop sharply starting in 2022.
Other Positive Catalysts
Since NextEra owns and operates one very large utility in Florida and an additional, medium one in the state, the company should benefit tremendously from the work-from-home trend. That’s because it will likely cause many to move from states with high taxes and very expensive living costs states with low taxes and low living costs, including Florida.
After all, if people can live wherever they want, regardless of where they work, many of them will choose to live in cheap states. As millions more Americans move to Florida, Next Era’s top and bottom lines should jump, boosting NEE stock in the process.
And as I mentioned in my previous column on Next Era, the shares should benefit from both “the proliferation of electric cars and data centers,” and the stock’s attractiveness to “environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investors.”

The Bottom Line on NEE Stock
NextEra should benefit from Biden’s presidency and multiple other trends. The company gets a great deal of its revenue from utilities, which are highly regulated. Thus, its shares are unlikely to soar five or 10 times in a year.
But conversely, the company is not going to lose a great deal of business to competitors or ever have trouble paying its bills. And, it can buy solar panels from any supplier. Consequently, conservative, risk-averse investors who want to benefit from the solar-energy boom should buy NEE stock.

Now before you get all excited that the country’s crumbling infrastructure is going to get a facelift, Donald Trump supposedly had a plan. He wanted to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure during his presidency. 
Unfortunately, for America, he was more concerned about giving billionaires tax breaks than fixing an infrastructure that once was the envy of the world. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

					The 7 ‘Deadly’ Sin Stocks to Buy Before the Holidays				

Therefore, if you’re looking for infrastructure stocks to buy, you might want to bet on those that will do well with or without an infrastructure plan. Here are seven stocks to buy that ought to win regardless of who’s in office over the next decade: 
American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B)

Infrastructure Stocks to Buy: American Water Works (AWK)

The water utility reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 4. They were better than analyst expectations, delivering earnings per share of $1.46, 8 cents higher than the consensus. It was also 13 cents higher than a year earlier.  
As a result of its strong Q3 2020 earnings, American Water Works’ management increased its 2020 earnings guidance to a midpoint of $3.90, 6 cents higher than its previous guidance for the year. 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the company invested $1.38 billion on its infrastructure and planned to spend an additional $520 million in the fourth quarter for a total of $1.9 billion in its fiscal year. 
InvestorPlace’s Muslim Farooque recently recommended AWK stock as one of three utilities investors could count on. He especially likes its 55-cent dividend that currently yields 1.4%. Year-to-date through Nov. 13, its stock is up 33% and 21.8% on an annualized basis over the past decade.

Although most investors probably think of Warren Buffett’s holding company as an owner of insurance companies, such as Geico and possessing a massive equity portfolio, it also owns one of America’s largest railroads — Burlington Northern — and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), a collection of energy-related businesses with more than $100 billion in assets under its control. 
For example, BHE Renewables operates in nine states with 1,536 megawatts of solar capacity, 1,665 MW of wind-generated power, 345 MW’s from geothermal facilities, and 138 MW from traditional hydroelectric facilities in Hawaii and the Philippines. 
Interestingly, one of the various businesses operated by BHE is HomeServices of America, the largest residential real estate brokerage in the U.S. It operates under several brand names, including Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, generating more than $135 billion in sales volume across the country. In the first nine months of 2020, Berkshire’s railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $30.5 billion, with net earnings of $6.3 billion.

If it were an S&P 500 company, its railroad, utilities and energy businesses would be right up there with some of America’s largest companies. 

CenterPoint Energy (CNP)

The company’s business dates all the way back to 1866 when the Houston Gas Light Company was formed to make and sell gas made from a combination of coal and seashells. More than 154 years later, it serves more than 7 million customers in the U.S., operating electric and natural gas utilities in eight states with assets totaling more than $33 billion.
On Nov. 5, CentrePoint reported its Q3 2020 results, including a 15-cent impairment for its midstream instruments. Excluding that, it earned 29 cents from its utility operations and 5 cents from its midstream investments for a total of 34 cents, down from 47 cents a year earlier. 
Due to its strong results from its utility operations, CentrePoint raised its 2020 guidance for the unit to between $1.12 and $1.20 a share. It’s confident that it can continue to grow its utility earnings by 5-7% annually based on a 10% rate base increase.
The jewel of its assets is Houston Electric, which has seen 33 years of consecutive growth from its customers in the Houston area. As a result of this success, it plans to increase its capital investment over the next five years (2021-2025) by $3 billion to a total of $16 billion. This investment will allow it to increase its earnings by 5-7% annually, as mentioned earlier. 
CentrePoint has an attractive 2.4% dividend yield. It’s definitely the underdog bet amongst these seven infrastructure stocks.

It’s situated itself at the center of the transition from dirty energy to clean energy. I recently stated that NextEra had passed Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) in market capitalization despite its still generating a significant portion of its power from coal and natural gas. 
The important thing is that it’s figured out that the world wants clean energy. I don’t believe XOM has come to grips with this reality just yet. 
As I said in my article, NextEra’s backlog for renewable energy projects was more than 15,000 megawatts, suggesting its capacity in this area will double over the next few years.

It just keeps delivering for shareholders. As infrastructure stocks go, it can’t be beaten.

I must admit that I don’t spend a lot of time analyzing publicly traded consultants such as NV5 Global. In fact, I had never heard of it until I saw its name on a list of holdings for an infrastructure-focused exchange-traded fund.
It turns out that NV5 operates more than 100 offices in the U.S. and elsewhere with a particular emphasis on infrastructure project consulting. It operates three segments: Infrastructure, Building, Technology & Sciences and Geospatial solutions. 
In the third quarter ended Oct. 3, 2020, its infrastructure segment accounted for 56% of its $170 million in revenue and 59% of its $33.4 million in pre-tax income. Thanks to acquisitions and an increase from its liquified natural gas consulting, its infrastructure segment’s sales and pre-tax income grew 9.0% and 40.7%, respectively, over the same period last year.
In the third quarter, NV5’s backlog grew by 9% over the second quarter and 23% over Q3 2019. It has a healthy roster of opportunities from all three operating segments in 2020’s final quarter and 2021.
It finished the third quarter with a $572 million backlog, up significantly from $151 million in Q3 2015. Its goal is to generate an annual run rate of $1 billion by 2020. 
If America goes on an infrastructure binge, you can bet it will.

I’m one of those weird people who sees a brand name and immediately wants to know who owns it and if it’s a public company. The other day, I walked by a restaurant I frequent a fair bit, and there was a Genie scissor lift outside the building. My brain immediately went into thinking mode, trying to remember its owner. 
Well, that would be Terex, a Connecticut-based company whose aerial work platforms (AWP) and materials processing machinery (MP) are used in infrastructure-related projects every day of the year on five different continents. 
Genie is part of the company’s AWP segment. It generates 60% of the company’s revenue. In the first nine months of fiscal 2020, AWP’s sales were $1.37 billion, 58% lower than a year earlier due to Covid-19. 
However, as stated in its Q3 2020 press release, it expects the fourth quarter to be its strongest from a free cash flow perspective. In the third quarter, it managed to generate $76.6 million in free cash flow despite a significant reduction in its net income and sales during the quarter. 
“Terex’s third quarter results demonstrate our ability to offset challenging macroeconomic conditions by focusing on levers within our control,” said Terex chief financial officer John Sheehan. “We mitigated these headwinds with disciplined cost and working capital management to generate $54 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter. Our free cash flow performance reflects steady improvement in our businesses and strong execution.”


					7 Micro-Cap Stocks To Buy And Hold For The Next 10 Years				

The company’s making lemonade after getting lemons for most of the year. I expect 2021 to pay dividends for shareholders.

Valmont Industries (VMI)

In August 2014, I recommended three agricultural stocks. 
Valmont Industries, AGCO (NYSE:AGCO), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). All three had suffered a bit of an agriculture backlash that year. I thought their recent weakness made them contrarian buys. 
In the six years since VMI is up 12%, AGCO is up 102% and Deere is up the most with a gain of 197%. By comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is up 88% over the same period. 
To say I’ve been disappointed by Valmont’s performance in recent years would be an understatement. That said, despite an annualized total return of 7.7% over the past five years, or half the U.S. markets as a whole, VMI has still managed to deliver a 15-year annualized total return of 11.4%, 160 basis points higher than the entire U.S. markets.
Long-term, the company’s focus is growing its revenues by 5-10% annually, its earnings per share by 10% or more each year, converting more than 100% of its net earnings into free cash flow, and delivering operating margins of 12% or more. 
Unfortunately, like most companies, Valmont’s year-to-date numbers aren’t very good.
However, in the third quarter ended Sept. 26, sales were up 6.3%, adjusted earnings per share rose 13.7%, free cash flow of $202 million (almost double its income) and an operating margin of 9.3%. 
While its latest quarter left some work to be done, its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months is $250 million for an FCF yield of 6.6%. That’s getting very close to value territory at 8%. 
Once the novel coronavirus subsides and business gets back to normal, I expect Valmont to deliver decent returns for infrastructure investors.

2020-11-21,Hydrogen stocks have mostly been bad investments over the past couple of decades. NextEra Energy's pivot to clean hydrogen could point to a profitable future for the industry.,Why Investors Shouldn't Ignore This High-Growth Utility Stock's Hydrogen Ambitions
2020-11-25,"NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is clearly on a warpath to acquire or merge with another utility as news emerged recently about a recent bid. If successful, one effect this will have will be to justify the high valuation of NEE stock.
Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com
	
Investors should take note of this situation, as I pointed out in my last article, where I showed how high the stock is trading in terms of valuation metrics.
Not only has NextEra Energy made a bid for Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and was turned down, but Reuters recently reported on Nov. 9 that NextEra made another bid. NextEra made an all-stock acquisition offer for Evergy, Inc (NYSE:EVRG) which has a market capitalization of about $12 billion today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
However, at the time NextEra’s bid was apparently for $15 billion, including a premium. Nevertheless, Evergy’s board reportedly turned down the offer.
This upset one of Evergy’s large institutional shareholders, Elliott Management Corp. On Nov. 10, they put out a statement that urged Evergy’s board to “immediately reengage with NextEra and fully explore” a deal.
NextEra’s Valuation Dilemma
As I pointed out in my last article, NEE stock trades at a significant premium to its peers. This is partly from its continuing earnings growth from its Florida Power & Light subsidiary as well as its considerable investments in renewable energy.
10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investors Under 30
For example, on Oct. 21, NextEra Energy reported that its Q3 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 11.3% to $66.5 cents per share. This is after a recent four-for-one-stock split that took effect on Oct. 27.
Moreover, the company gave forecasts for both its 2020 and 2021 adjusted EPS. These range from $2.18 to $2.30 for 2020 and $2.40 to $2.54 for 2021.
Therefore, using a midpoint for each of these forecasts, NEE stock at $74.64 (Nov. 23) trades at 33 times expected $2.24 for 2020. And for 2021 its trades at 30.2 times adjusted earnings.
This is a good deal higher than the typical utility stock, as I mentioned last time. As a result, the company is looking to use its highly-priced shares to purchase lower price-to-earnings (P/E) companies.
How Using a High P/E Stock In an Acquisition Increases EPS
We can illustrate why NextEra Energy is so keen to use its shares to acquire another company. The fundamental reason is that a high P/E stock purchase leads to higher EPS.
Let’s say there are two companies both making $1 million and both have 1 million shares outstanding. Therefore they both have an EPS of $1. But Company A is valued at 100 times earnings, so its stock is worth $100 million but Company B has a 10 times P/E, so its market value is $10 million.
Now if Company A buys B using its stock it only has to issue $10 million worth of shares. Therefore, it will issue 100,000 shares (i.e., 100K times $100 per share equals $10 million, the market value of Company B). Now there are $2 million in earnings from the combination, but the number of shares outstanding is only 1.1 million.
As a result, the earnings per share is now $1.818, or an increase of 81.8% from $1.00 EPS before the combination. So using the high P/E shares leads to a huge increase in earnings per share. It also lowers the P/E. Assuming the stock price stays the same, $100 divided by $1.818 lowers the P/E to about 55 times earnings from 100 times. That makes the stock more attractive and would likely push it up.
Compare that to the situation where Company A and B both had the same P/E and therefore the same market value. Now there are $2 million in earnings, but there are also 2 million shares outstanding to complete the merger. Therefore the EPS stays the same at $1.00.
What to Do With NEE Stock
This is why NextEra wants to use its higher than average P/E to acquire lower P/E energy companies. The problem is that its P/E is not substantially higher than its peers.
For example, I recently wrote about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its purchase of the semiconductor company ARM using its high P/E shares. Nvidia has a much higher P/E ratio stock, more than 50 times on a forward basis. This is because of the huge growth of the company. This makes it easier for sellers to acquiesce to the all-stock purchase.
Therefore, I suspect NextEra Energy is going to find it difficult to use NEE stock as an acquisition currency. It may have to start offering more cash in its deals.
Until then, most investors might want to wait to see what tricks the company has up its sleeve in its next purchase offer. That might make NEE stock have a lower P/E and a more worthwhile investment target.

In Q2, NextEra Energy earned $1.17 billion and total sales reached $4.20 billion.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE.

A relatively high ROCE shows NextEra Energy is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In NextEra Energy's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Insight NextEra Energy reported Q3 earnings per share at $2.66/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.58/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For November 19, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-03,"(Bloomberg) -- It spent millions to block homeowners from embracing solar panels, fought against hydropower, and pushed for an energy project next to a beloved national park. Its value competes with Exxon Mobil Corp.’s. Its longtime chief executive officer is a registered Republican.Yet NextEra Energy Inc., the world’s biggest investor-owned generator of wind and solar power, has emerged as an unlikely green giant with a knack for throwing its considerable weight behind initiatives and policies that are pushing the U.S. into a future of zero-emissions electricity. Few companies appear better poised to benefit from the Joe Biden era.Read More: The New Energy Giants Are Renewable CompaniesNextEra isn’t a cheerleader for climate action like cleantech stalwarts Sunrun Inc. or Tesla Inc., and its CEO, James Robo, doesn’t tweet about saving the world. Founded as an ordinary Florida utility almost a century ago, the company backed into renewables by taking a stake in early wind farms whose developers owed it money. Since then it has shrewdly used dealmaking, scale, tax credits, and aggressive lobbying to grow into a powerhouse—all while keeping such a low profile that most people have never heard of it.The market forces that drove down costs for renewable energy, backed by powerful incentives from state governments, have allowed NextEra to prosper even under President Trump. Despite tariffs on solar equipment from China and aggressive federal efforts to boost coal and gas, its profits rose from $2.9 billion in 2016 to $3.8 billion last year.Biden plans to revive the fight against global warming abandoned by Trump with an ambitious $2 trillion proposal focused on creating a nationwide emissions-free electricity grid in just 15 years. That will require cooperation from Congress and an unprecedented private-sector build-out of renewable power plants and large-scale batteries. Its implementation would be good news for NextEra, which has wind and solar farms in two dozen states and four Canadian provinces, producing enough power to light up Greece. “These guys are the dominant player,” says Kit Konolige, senior utilities analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re first on the list for anyone who wants to get renewables built.”NextEra’s strategy relies heavily on taking advantage of state and federal incentives and shunning publicity. The company has made use of state-level requirements for utilities to buy more renewable power, targeting building projects in those states before wind and solar became cheap enough to be profitable nationwide. This approach also involves mining federal tax credits—$3.1 billion over the last 10 years, according to filings—to help finance growth. It’s in the enviable position of taking credits aimed at a struggling new industry and using the lobbying and political muscle of a huge power company to bake those credits in. The fossil fuel industry, meanwhile, gets billions of dollars a year in tax subsidies, including a special deduction for the costs of drilling new domestic wells.NextEra spent $4.1 million last year lobbying federal lawmakers and the Trump administration, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. “That’s pretty high,” says Dan Auble, a senior researcher with the nonprofit group, which tracks the influence of money in politics. NextEra has become the seventh-biggest lobbyist among 156 utilities. “Both lobbying and campaign contributions are an investment in getting your issues in front of the people who need to see it.”The company uses its lobbying muscle even when the results don’t promote renewable energy. In Florida, for example, NextEra subsidiary Florida Power & Light joined other utilities to spend $20 million promoting an unsuccessful 2016 ballot initiative that would have curbed rooftop solar arrays, drawing criticism from Al Gore. “Over the last several years, NextEra has been very aggressive against customer-owned solar,” says Alissa Schafer, a researcher with the Energy and Policy Institute, a clean energy advocacy group.In Maine, the company tried to block a 145-mile hydropower transmission line sought by Avangrid Inc., challenging the project’s government approvals. In a complaint to federal regulators, the rival company said NextEra had “taken every opportunity, both in the open and behind the scenes, to oppose, delay, and derail” the project, including funding opposition groups, because it posed a threat to NextEra’s power plants in the region. “In doing so,” Avangrid wrote, “NextEra is purposely trying to thwart the goals of Maine and Massachusetts to obtain more renewable power.”Even some of the company’s renewable efforts end up angering environmentalists. In California, it spent more than $768,000 in the most recent legislative session pushing an unsuccessful bill that would have benefited a large-scale energy storage project on the edge of Joshua Tree National Park.NextEra spokesman David Reuter says that while it doesn’t comment on specific political contributions, all are funded by shareholders and employees rather than customers. The company makes all the proper disclosures and follows the applicable laws, he adds. “Since every aspect of our business is impacted by policy decisions at every level of government, it’s particularly important for us to be involved and be a leader,” Reuter says.NextEra’s route to renewables was decidedly roundabout. It started life in 1925 as electric utility Florida Power & Light. A pair of deals, starting in the 1990s, radically altered its course. First, the company loaned money to some wind farm developers; when they later ran into financial trouble, NextEra forgave their debts in exchange for a majority stake in the farms. Then, in 2002, it renegotiated an agreement with General Electric Co., which had signed a contract to supply it with natural gas turbines for power plants. Robo, who’d come to NextEra from GE to serve as vice president for corporate development and strategy, saw that the market for gas plants was in a lull. So he persuaded his former colleagues to substitute wind turbines instead.John Bartlett, president of Reaves Asset Management, compares the turbine swap to 3M’s fortuitous development of the Post-it Note—a simple idea that created an unanticipated windfall. “That’s one of the great strokes of industrial genius,” Bartlett says. Reaves owns about $170 million in NextEra shares.NextEra’s head start and scale worked in its favor throughout the 2000s, as states started requiring local utilities to use more renewable power. “We had advantages across the board,” Lewis Hay III, the company’s CEO from 2001 to 2012, told Bloomberg News last year. “We had the scale to buy the equipment cheaper than anybody else. Because we did more wind farms, we just got very, very good at constructing them and operating them.”Florida Power & Light still exists, serving more than 10 million people across the state, but it’s now part of a larger NextEra whose reach extends far beyond Florida. Robo was named CEO in 2012. A Harvard Business School graduate, he rarely gives interviews. Hay describes him as a quick thinker with an “incredible” memory for details. When presented with a project, Hay says, Robo can quickly go through it and “usually come up with half a thousand ideas on how to make it a better project very quickly.”NextEra is among the industry titans backing the formation of an American advocacy group to lobby for multiple renewables sectors, not just a single one like wind or solar. Biden’s victory makes the timing seem right.The next president may well have to use executive action if the Democrats fail to take control of the Senate in the pair of Georgia runoff elections in January. But Biden is still expected to accelerate renewable deployment, both to fight climate change and to generate jobs. NextEra’s renewable arm, NextEra Energy Resources, had about 5,000 employees by the end of 2019, not counting construction jobs for new projects—information the company doesn’t disclose. Spokesman Reuter will say that NextEra has enough projects in the pipeline to generate 15 gigawatts of electricity, enough for 11 million homes. That backlog is “larger than our current renewables portfolio, which gives you a sense of just how much work will be executed in the coming years,” he says.“Certainly, NextEra is going to be one of the—if not the—biggest player in the development of new renewables,” Konolige says. “It’d be hard for anybody to radically displace them.”—With Brian EckhouseRead More:The New Energy Giants Are Renewable Companies What Should Joe Biden Do First on Climate Change?

As I said, near-term demand remains an issue for big oil companies. The economic fallout of COVID-19 has caused problems for the energy sector as cars and planes are not moving like they were before the virus mess.
Stephen Leeb, a former business partner of mine, wrote The Oil Factor: Protect Yourself and Profit from the Coming Energy Crisis. It discusses the theme of “peak oil.” This concept theorized the world only had so much of the vital stuff and that producers had reached the peak of what was possible to bring to market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
We haven’t reached peak oil yet – at least not in the way Leeb described it. Instead, we’ve reached peak demand thanks to the pandemic.
But if we presume the supply levels will one day peak, what are the right plays?

Post Peak
Though natural gas, helium and CO2 will be needed for the foreseeable future for many industries, when it comes to energy, oil and natural gas will be eventually moving down in importance. This is why I’ve been looking at alternative energy companies for power and power storage.
Wind and solar energy are only getting bigger. For utilities, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEENYSE:NEE) and Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) are big pioneers that should be a part of your portfolio. And aiding the rollout of wind, solar and other green energy projects is Hannon Armstrong (NYSE:HASI), which is a primary financier of green energy projects.

Hannon Armstrong (HASI) Total Return—Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.
Hannon Armstrong is also moving to the next level of green power with battery storage backup. Wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine, so beyond natural gas, batteries are needed. It’s expanding backup with a co-op financing deal with the global energy company out of France, Engie (OTCMKTS:ENGIY), for US-based solar with backup systems as part of a major distributed generation (DG) rollout. DG sets up businesses and homes to operate off-grid.
Batteries are key for green power. And that’s why I continue to recommend the leaders in the current and next-generation batteries from Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and TDK Corp. (OTCMKTS:TTDKY).
Then there’s hydrogen. Green, non-natural gas made hydrogen is one of the best next technologies to get us past post-peak oil and gas. Two companies that I’m looking at right now are Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) and Air Products (NYSE:APD) as leaders in the hydrogen markets as well as other must-have gasses like CO2 (liquid oxygen for vaccine delivery).
And fuel cells using hydrogen make for some of the most compelling backup power systems for the future. TDK with its newer partner GenCell (TLV:GNCL) of Israel is the go-to for this post-peak power, making TDK the must-have tech stock right now.

If you’re a regular reader of this column, you know just how much I like TDK. In addition to its ties to battery technology for backup power systems aren’t the only reason to consider it a winning investment.
TDK provides batteries for everything from fifth-generation (5G) wireless to electric cars to the latest smartphones, wearables and pretty much every other new tech product.
Oil and energy stocks are an attractive short-term investment, but they may have risen too much because investors are buying up value stocks. If you’re looking to lay a base for your future, the next generation of alternative energy companies is a great place to start.
On the date of publication, Neil George did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Setting Your Portfolio Up for “Peak Oil” appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Setting Your Portfolio Up for “Peak Oil”
2020-12-11,"Oil used to be the stuff that the markets couldn’t do without. The then-regular Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meetings were met with traders, economists and governments around the world — and many energy stocks — trembling with fear. Even James Bond films referenced oil supplies as one of the great threats to her Majesty’s Kingdom.
One of my former business partners long ago wrote a very successful book titled: The Oil Factor, Protect Yourself and Profit from the Coming Energy Crisis in 2005. In the book, Stephen Leeb discussed the then biggie theme of peak oil. This concept was that the world only had so much of the vital stuff and that producers were or had reached the peak of what was possible to bring to the market.
But this was all before technology really ramped up in the oil patch. Fracking had been around for many decades, but eventually would really take hold, making the U.S. the largest producer of the stuff. But now, peak oil has another meaning. Demand, not supply, might be reaching a peak.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Of course, the economic fallout of Covid-19 has made this a near term argument as cars and planes are not moving in volumes seen prior to the virus mess.

Big oil companies are suffering right now. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been selling oil field interests, including in the North Sea, along with others — including Centrica (OTCMKTS:CPYYY). Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has also announced a series of field troubles around the globe and is cutting its capital expenditures (CAPEX) by 26% for 2021. Total (NYSE:TOT) is selling fields including in Kurdistan. These announcements garner lots of market attention, but really are just admittances that there is no need for expensive fields when US oil and gas is so cheap and plentiful if and when its needed.
In fact, XOM is working on a field that was the site of an ancient coral reef in La Barge, Wyoming which is rich in natural gas, helium and highly desirable carbon dioxide (CO2).
And peak demand, at least for now, is also impacting refineries around the world. Numerous shutdowns around the globe, including in Europe and Australia, have been announced or are underway. Petrol (gasoline) and jet fuel demand is way off, at least for now, making refineries less economically viable.
But while near-term demand from cars and planes might be a problem, there is the highly likely return post the Covid-19 crisis. And electric cars are there — there are many, many infrastructure challenges along with over a billion motor vehicles as calculated by Ward’s Communications that still need petrol.

Meanwhile, power supplies are still dominated by natural gas and other fossil fuels despite massive inroads by wind and solar. This means that petrol is still a necessity for now – but not forever.
This means that to get ahead of post-peak-petrol demand, you need to understand and invest in the leaders in the next energy solutions.

Post-Peak Profits and New Energy Stocks
Getting past oil and natural gas is going to take time. Natural gas is mission critical (for now) when it comes to the chemicals industry, including for plastics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and other necessary products. And yes, there are labs working on alternatives — but these are not proving out in practical fashion to make the jump or even major steps.
Oil, of course, is primarily about refined products. And this comes down to transportation. Cars can work on alternatives with some major infrastructure changes. And the same can be said of busses and trucks. And in a moment, I’ll present better alternatives now and in the works, and the companies behind them.
Planes, of course, are not going to make the jump soon. Jet fuel is how modern planes move safely and quickly around the globe. And there are some labs working on alternative fuels and technologies, but they are not going to be ready for a while.
But where post peak oil and gas is and will work more is in stationary power generation. Utilities feeding power grids and localized off grid distributed generation (DG) is where the biggest potential is happening right now and moving along quickly.
Overall, post-peak energy alternatives are gaining ground. And a privately held investment group called Cirdan Capital Management based in London has developed an index tracking green energy from an ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) perspective. The Cirdan ESG Green Energy Index shows a surge of 112.04% from late March to date.

Here are some of the post-peak-problem energy stocks and their underlying technologies that work now and should be bought.

Utilities
Utilities are the first-line companies in the shift away from fossil fuels. Wind and solar are known and proven technologies that, outside of trade tariffs and trade restriction costs, are increasingly cost competitive to cost advantageous for energy stocks and the markets that they serve.
Aiding the shift are two government entities. First are public utility commissions (PUCs) that come with various state and local names, but all comes down to the same mission. PUCs negotiate and set rates and plans for energy production and distribution as well as rates charged. This impacts utilities’ regulated markets whereby they negotiate capital budget for both new energy and maintenance of existing facilities and equipment. And PUCs can and are demanding shifts to more green energy away from oil, gas and other fossil fuels.
Then there are state and local governing authorities. Increasingly, state houses as well as governors and even city councils are passing or issuing edicts for utilities to use green power sources either directly or via contracts from wholesale markets and even off-setting credits in carbon dioxide (CO2) schemes.
This is also adding to the push to adopt or deploy green energy generation by both local regulated companies as well as unregulated wholesale companies.
NextEra Energy (NEE)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a company that I’ve followed and recommended for years inside Profitable Investing, and have mentioned in InvestorPlace numerous times. And there are plenty of good reasons. The company is the writer of the playbook of modern utilities in the U.S. as it moved from its regulated business in Florida to become one of the world’s largest wind and solar companies in the world by power generation capacity throughout North America.
Let’s start with the stock, which has returned 663.65% for Profitable Investor subscribers including this year’s year to date return of 24.35%.
Source: NextEra Energy (NEE) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock is not just going up, it reflects a building value in the underlying company. The underlying intrinsic value (book) of the company has been rising by an average of 9.72% on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis.
And with a yield of just shy of 2% it is a good total return buy in a tax-free account.
Excel Energy (XEL)
Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is another utility that has taken the playbook of NextEra and is running it successfully. With its base of regulated businesses in the central to western U.S., it is expanding its green energy capabilities and is expanding its unregulated wholesale market reach.
The stock is working — increasingly reflecting the green energy capabilities of the utility. It has returned 117.98% over the trailing five years — outpacing the S&P 500 Index.

The stock is cheaper than  its bigger peer, NextEra, but it has also been ramping up its value for shareholders in growing its intrinsic value (book) by a good annual average margin.


					7 Cyclical Stocks That Likely Won't Rise Again				

And with its yield of 2.64%, which has been rising in distribution by an average of 6.11% over the past five years, it makes for a good total return stock in a tax-free account.

Transportation
Next up in green energy solution companies involves the movement of cars, trucks, busses and other vehicles with batteries rather than petrol. The big challenge is moving away from lithium batteries that come with major environmental costs in mining and gathering. In addition, these batteries are also very heavy — negating some advantages of green energy in cars. And then there’s the whole explosion thing. Lithium batteries overheat and either ignites or explodes. And in crashes, lithium batteries can provide deathly challenges for passengers or first responders.
Solid state batteries are the next new-new thing for vehicles that moves vehicle technology to much more efficient, lighter and much safer batteries. There are two leaders in this technology.
Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, 005930 Korea)
Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF, 005930 Korea) is the global leader in so many technologies that are mission critical for everything from phones and other personal electronics to major industrial components. It has been working on and offering solid state batteries that are the next level for vehicles as well as for a myriad of other products.
Source: Samsung Electronics (SSNLF,005930 Korea) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock is one of the cheapest mega tech companies in the world. It is valued not far from its trailing sales and underlying intrinsic value (book) which are at massive discounts to its U.S. and European technology stock peers.
And the stock delivers to U.S. shareholders with just the past five years alone returning 250.30%.
It can be a pain to buy. Many U.S. brokerages make you call in the trade, which may incur additional fees. And you will have to agree that it is a foreign stock with foreign market risks. To make it easier, note the ISIN # of the shares which is KR700593003 and the SEDOL number of 6771720 KR. These are brokerage and stock exchange and stock trading platform identifiers to access the stock.
With a yield of just shy of 2%, it is a buy in a taxable account given its foreign status.
TDK (TTDKY)
TDK (OTCMKTS:TTDKY) is a Japanese company with a long history of varied product specialties, including its long-ago fame for cassette tapes. But now it is one of the go-to companies for electric vehicles.
Nearly every carmaker has electric cars now or in development. And what they all have in common as well as with hybrid cars and even mild-hybrid systems found in Porsche, Audi — both owned by Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and other cars are the common products of TDK.
Capacitors and inductors receive, store and transmit power that makes all of these products move and stop. And those voltage monitors noted that keep phones from exploding – yep – those are even more critical for cars.
What also makes cars move from electricity are magnets. TDK has developed the go-to magnets. And storing that power takes lots of batteries – again – TDK is a big leader here. And while lithium and still lead in some cases remain the go-to means for batteries – solid state batteries are what’s going to really solve for electric cars and trucks to power up more quickly, hold power more efficiently and not create massive environmental devastation that’s occurring now on a daily basis.
Yep, TDK is one of the leaders developing and already deploying them.
And there is more to TDK that I’ll get to in a moment for another major groundbreaking green energy solution.
Source: TDK (TTDKY) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock has been a great initial success for subscribers of Profitable Investing. And this continues the performance of the stock for U.S. investors with the trailing five-year return of 105.08%.
With its yield of 1.27%, it is a buy in a taxable account given the foreign status.

Batteries, More Than Vehicles
Batteries are also one of the prime solutions for green power beyond vehicles. Wind doesn’t always blow, and Mr. Sun isn’t always at his shiny best. This means that backup is a necessity. California is a prime example of what doesn’t work for backup either in slack wind or cloudy days — but also heavy load demand conditions.
It mandated more green power — but cut off a collection of traditional backup in natural-gas-fired power plants. The idea was that the utilities would just buy power from wholesale unregulated markets when needed. That hasn’t always been available, and blackouts and brownouts have ensued. Add in the grid cut-offs with fire risk in transmission lines and it is not a good green energy market.
There are solutions right now in distributed generation (DG) that I referenced earlier. DG is localized power that is off-grid and may well be part of the major solution for much of the US and global power demand.
And to make it work, you need solar and wind equipment with batteries and fuel-cell power capabilities. Fuel cells use chemical processes to make electric power. And there have been some companies that have been entering the market such as Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) — but its backup power relies on natural gas or natural gas derived fuel. This really isn’t any better than a natural gas-fired generator in homes and businesses when there is a power outage. And it is far from being really green.
Hannon Armstrong (HASI)
Hannon Armstrong (NYSE:HASI) is a green energy financial that is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT). It provides financing that tends to come with government financial guarantees that provide lots of cash for shareholders with credit protection. And since green-energy-producing assets are on foundations on the ground, it complies with basic REIT company structure standards. This enables the company to largely avoid traditional corporate income taxes — making for more cash for investors.
Source: Hannon Armstrong (HASI) — Source: Bloomberg

	
Hannon Armstrong has an impressive collection of green energy investments — but the one that I am focusing on is with Engie SA (OTCMKTS:ENGIY). Engie is a European utility company based in France that is partnering with Hannon to rollout DG systems throughout the U.S. and potentially beyond.
It will be deploying solar systems for business and residential customers that come with battery backup systems that are pure turnkey that takes the customer off-grid.
Hannon has a very successful history as a company and a stock. Since added to the Profitable Investing Portfolio late last year — it has returned 77.27% for subscribers. And it comes with a tax-advantaged yield of 2.48%. The tax advantage comes thanks to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which provides a 20% deduction of dividend income for individual investors.
With its very green portfolio, it makes for a great total return stock in a taxable account.
B. Riley (RILY)
B. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) is one of my tails-you-win-heads-you-win stocks inside Profitable Investing. This means that this financial company has various divisions that provide opportunities for downturns in the economy including bankruptcy workouts including retail store closings as well as other financial operations that cash in in boom times.
One of the boom time investment operations has been in the renewed market for special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs). SPACs are not my favored structure and they can be pig in a poke deals for shareholders. But in the case of RILY, it did a deal to bring EOS Energy Enterprises (NASDAQ:EOSE) to the market and holds a sizable chunk of the shares.
EOS is a prime alternative to Bloom Energy and its natural gas backup and it way better than Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) lithium battery backup system that requires lithium and major cooling systems for safety.
EOS has proprietary zinc-based batteries that utilize carbon in its power storage and delivery systems. Clean, and able to operate at high or low temperatures — it is a true green power battery solution for both backup and DG systems.
Source: B. Riley (RILY) — Source: Bloomberg

	
RILY has been a star for investors with the past trailing five-year return of 350.28%. And yet the stock is only valued at 1.40 times trailing (and rising sales) and barely more than 2 times intrinsic value.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

Revenue is soaring, with the past year alone gaining 54.2%. And it comes with a yield of 4.2%, making for a great total return stock in a tax-free account.

Hydrogen: Air Liquide (AIQUY) & Air Products (APD)
Hydrogen is a fuel that is perhaps one of the best green energy sources for the future. But it tends to be made using natural gas that makes it not much better than natural gas for the environment. But green hydrogen that is made without natural gas through electrolysis with water or other friendly chemicals is an older technology that is increasingly working on an economic scale.
Two of my favorite hydrogen producing companies are Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) and Air Products (NYSE:APD). Along with other industrial chemicals including frozen carbon dioxide (CO2) known as dry ice that is crucial for Covid-19 vaccine deployment for Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) — these are go to companies for now and going forward.
Source: Air Liquide (AIQUY) & Air Products (APD) — Source: Bloomberg

	
But what I want to circle back on it’s the hydrogen batter and fuel cell development of TDK. TDK has as one of its core operations its investment development division. And it recently made a ground-breaking deal with Gencell of Israel to take a major stake.
This will bring Gencell’s ammonia to hydrogen green energy fuel cells to the broader market. This is major for green hydrogen and will be a major source for further TDK revenue and profits as well as for solving for green energy needs post petrol peak for years to come. Again, but TDK now as this development is just coming along on top of the other major initiatives — including many, many more that I haven’t mentioned in this missive.

2020-12-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One way to think about the ESG thing is in religious terms: Proselytizers target heathens, not the saved.Environmental, social and governance investing today enjoys more hype than clarity. There is no agreement on exactly what counts as a compliant investment, and there is often a lack of clear economic signals tied to ESG-favored outcomes (elusive carbon pricing is a prime example). Does it make sense to invest in a company that’s already ticked a lot of ESG boxes or one that could yet do so? And how to be rewarded?U.S. utilities can thread this needle. Greenhouse-gas emissions from the power grid have fallen by more than a quarter since 2007, but much remains to be done. Moreover, utilities earn a regulated return on investment in new stuff, so there are quantifiable gains to be made on greening their asset base.Hugh Wynne and Eric Selmon, utilities analysts at Sector & Sovereign Research, have benchmarked this opportunity for 25 companies with a collective market cap of more than $600 billion. Their starting point is the carbon intensity of electricity generation in tonnes per megawatt-hours, both in 2019 and estimated for 2030, as implied by the companies’ decarbonization targets. In estimating that, they assume the utilities replace their highest-emitting plants (running on coal, oil or natural gas, in that order) with renewable generation at an average cost over the next decade of $1 per watt for solar power and $1.50 for wind.(1)One immediate observation is that the utilities that score better in terms of having low carbon intensity in 2019 also tend to be at the top of the table in 2030.You might think that makes them a shoo-in for ESG investors. But addressing climate change quickly means removing the highest-intensity sources of emissions first. Surely it makes at least as much sense to invest in companies that are big emitters now but have committed to fixing that — and need capital in order to do so. Bonus: As utilities, they have a chance of getting those investments into their regulated asset base.Rather than looking at absolute virtue signals, consider who is moving furthest and likely to spend big to get there.Utilities with nuclear plants — usually larger companies — or hydroelectric generation tend to score well on carbon-intensity already. Those that don’t, and which have more room for improvement, tend to be smaller utilities in the Midwest and West with significant coal-fired and other fossil-fuel generation capacity.As estimates built on objectives, these numbers aren’t set in stone. The added wrinkle is that regulators may not necessarily let utilities put investments in new capacity into the regulated asset base, but force them to contract power in competitive auctions. That would limit the overall opportunity versus the dollar amounts in the chart, although the environmental goal would still be met.Apart from ESG investors, the chart makes a useful screen for utilities themselves; ones looking to buy other utilities, anyway. Big investment requirements, particularly tied to a secular theme like renewables, make the best targets. PNM Resources Inc., the New Mexico utility that appears in that upper-right quadrant, is already the subject of a $7.6 billion agreed acquisition by Spanish renewables giant Iberdrola SA, due to close next fall. It is interesting to note Duke Energy Corp. and Evergy Inc. — both reportedly considered as targets at some point by NextEra Energy Inc. — screen low in terms of targeted cuts to emissions intensity. While that makes them potentially less interesting for an ESG portfolio, the potential to come in and execute a more ambitious decarbonization plan may make them interesting for NextEra.Regulators are another audience. By Wynne’s and Selmon’s calculations, the average cost of carbon abatement across the 25 utilities is just $19 per tonne, with a range of $13 to $37. Even if these costs do not reflect spending on associated wires and other infrastructure, they suggest further decarbonization is affordable across the states.The marginal cost rises as the highest-intensity sources are taken out; another reason to target these first. So as those costs rise, particularly as energy storage is incorporated to squeeze out gas-fired peaker plants, regulators should think more broadly. For example, with transportation now the biggest source of emissions in the U.S., it may make sense to steer utilities’ investment budgets toward lateral efforts like vehicle-charging infrastructure once their generation portfolios have decarbonized to a certain point. Either way, the ESG crowd should give their blessing.—With graphics assistance from Elaine He.(1) These are unsubsidized prices. The exact mix of solar and wind assets is determined either by published targets or the cheapest option depending on that utility's service territory. For the group, the analysis resulted in a split of 70% solar and 30% wind for the new generation capacity. The analysis does not include estimates for the spending required on new transmission or distribution infrastructure.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2021-01-22,"The political winds are shifting in Washington D.C., and investors should prepare themselves for significant changes. With President Biden now being officially inaugurated, it’s high time to prepare our portfolios for the new administration. 7 Mega-Cap Stocks With Solid Foundations To be clear, most good companies will continue to prosper regardless of what the government is up to. But for certain firms, Congress and the President’s actions will be a major tailwind. Here are seven top stocks to buy that should enjoy a boost as President Biden gets to work: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B) Visa (NYSE:V) Here’s a closer look at what makes the Biden administration a promising catalyst for each of these companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks to Buy: Facebook (FB) Source: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com The events in Washington D.C. earlier this month have certainly put social media companies in the spotlight. Social media executives will have to answer for their decisions around controversial speech. And there may be a hit to user numbers as well. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock, for example, tumbled immediately following its move to ban President Trump’s account as many users defected to rival platforms. That said, weakness in social media stocks could be an opportunity. None more so than with Facebook stock. There has been a great deal of speculation about how the company will look this decade. Regulators may target Facebook with severe anti-trust measures, perhaps even splitting up the company. It’s understandably why traders haven’t been rushing to buy FB stock in recent weeks. However, President Biden is likely to be good news for the social media giant. As far as we know, Biden has no personal animus toward Facebook or Zuckerberg, unlike various other politicians. And Biden didn’t prioritize regulating big tech either as part of his presidential campaign. Facebook should be able to navigate more freely in coming months than it has done in the past. Hopefully political tensions will cool after inauguration as well, giving Facebook more leeway on the moderation front. We’ve seen FB stock slide numerous times on previous political concerns. Who can forget the Cambridge Analytica scandal and all the ensuing drama there? Up until now, every dip in FB stock caused by politics has been a buy. I see little reason to think that will change under President Biden. The TJX Companies (TJX) Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com Also benefitting from stimulus, we have the TJX Companies. This is a retail outfit most known for its TJ Maxx brand of discount stores. This segment of apparel shopping tends to fare well in economic downturns. That could be doubly true this time thanks to the second round of economic relief checks. The government is sending folks money because it believes that this is one of the fastest ways to get that cash out and into the economy. If you cut corporate taxes, for example, it’s not clear how much of that will stimulate the economy in the near term. However, send people money directly and they’re largely going to go out and buy stuff immediately. As of this writing, Biden is proposing that the government will send out an additional $1,400 to individual taxpayers, and the idea appears to have bipartisan support. 7 Dividend Aristocrats That Will Outlive Us All TJ Maxx is exactly the right sort of business to take advantage of this extra cash. Expect the company to post several quarters of strong earnings in 2021 as a result. As it stands now, even before adding in a stimulus bump, TJX is going for 25x earnings. It has historically grown earnings per share at a double-digit rate. And it’s set to rake in a big chunk of the next round of stimulus. That makes TJX stock a bargain compared to other retail peers such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) at nearly 40x earnings. Emerson Electric (EMR) Source: Shutterstock Green energy is going to be a big theme in the Biden Administration. Unfortunately, it’s a bit late to get on board with many of the trendiest stocks in the sector. I’d be hard-pressed to buy a solar stock that’s already up 250% over the past 12 months, for example. That said, let’s think about the people that make stuff for the green energy companies. In an industry boom, the suppliers make a fortune as well. Think selling picks and shovels instead of actually mining for gold. Who will be producing that modern day gold? I like Emerson Electric. The industrial firm was founded more than 130 years ago in St. Louis, and has built up a wide array of nondescript yet essential goods for managing power and electricity services. The company has made a big push on renewable energy and looks set to cash in that bet in coming years. Emerson has its sights on a wide range of electrical grid and power generation services, including hydro, solar, waste-to-energy, geothermal and microgrids. It also sells software to help with managing these assets, as it aims to be an all-in-one provider to customers. That includes such things as cybersecurity for power assets and machine learning-powered AI to minimize energy loss at wind farms. If President Biden sends a huge chunk of green energy bucks out as part of an infrastructure bill, Emerson should capture a nice piece of it. And, unlike most green energy companies, EMR stock is a blue chip. It has paid an increasing dividend every year since the 1950s and currently yields 2.4%. NextEra Energy (NEE) Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com Playing on a similar theme, we have NextEra Energy. NextEra is the country’s largest utility company in size, and it has had a scorching run. NEE stock has more than tripled over the past five years. That’s very unusual for stocks in the utility industry. What makes NextEra stand out? Two things. It’s a growth-focused utility, which is a plus. Particularly since it is profitable growth; NextEra has some of the highest returns on investment in the energy industry. On top of that, NextEra is one of the most ambitious developers of solar and other renewable power projects in the country. It intends to build another 10 gigawatts of solar power this decade, for example. 7 Growth Stocks in The S&P's Hottest Sectors That Are Primed to Explode This combination sets up a winning result. According to Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof, NextEra offers investors: “[T]he best of both worlds: a secure dividend and industry-leading renewable energy growth potential.” With Biden taking office, the momentum behind solar power should continue to build. And since NextEra has been a leading operator in the space for many years, it is primed to take advantage if more federal funding comes into the space and incentivizes further new projects. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com On the flip side of Emerson, we have defense companies. There’s an interesting tendency that maligned sectors tend to do better than folks understand. Solar stocks did alright during the Trump Administration, for example. Similarly, oil did alright from 2009 to 2013 under President Obama, despite the scores of anti-fossil fuel headlines. And there’s plenty more examples along that trend historically. Thus, it’s worth asking if any of the sectors that are currently in the dumps thanks to the election results will recover. Defense seems like a logical one. Companies such as Lockheed Martin have been trading horribly since November. LMT stock is down around 15% in recent months, even as the stock market as a whole keeps making new all-time highs. Traders seem to be thinking that defense spending will plunge with Biden in charge. However, there’s little sign that this will actually happen. Biden’s record as a Senator was not particularly anti-war. He cast a controversial vote in favor of the Iraq War, for example, which isolated him from the more anti-war wing of the Democratic Party. There are certain Democrats that would eagerly slash military spending, but President Biden probably isn’t one of them. Besides, military projects tend to work on massive timelines; think decades. President Trump authorized a ton of new military spending, and it’d be hard to reverse all that within four years, even if Biden wished to. And besides, look at the world. Geopolitical tensions have been heated on multiple fronts. For better or worse, the military can make a strong case for more funding. In any case, as things stand now, LMT stock is selling for just 13x earnings and pays a 3% dividend. That’s a huge bargain in this frothy market. Brown-Forman (BF.A) (BF.B) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Brown-Forman is a family-run liquor business, primarily known for its Jack Daniels whiskey. In recent years, it has branched into tequila and other spirits as well. Due to its ownership structure, there are two classes of stock, the A shares which have voting rights, and the B shares which do not. All else equal, it generally makes sense to own whichever one is cheaper, which is currently the A shares. That said, what makes Brown-Forman stand out during a Biden presidency? For one, all the political angst is almost certainly good for alcohol consumption. Spirits sales are up 24% since the pandemic started. And there’s a much more specific reason to buy Brown-Forman stock in particular. The company’s earnings were dinged in recent years due to European tariffs against Brown-Forman’s whiskey. This was a result of the outgoing president’s trade war. Additionally, Brown-Forman has been seeking more of a foothold in China. Understandably, however, the political tensions with China over the past few years have been a headwind. 7 Dividend Aristocrats That Will Outlive Us All More easygoing international relations could be a boon for Brown-Forman’s exports, leading to a significant pop in earnings. And if things end up going badly under President Biden, people will still want to drink whiskey regardless. Visa (V) Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com Rounding out the list, we have a Biden favorite: Credit card companies. Throughout much of Biden’s career, his largest donor was bank MBNA, which is now part of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). But Visa is the name I want to focus on here. Biden’s home state of Delaware has favorable bankruptcy laws, thus making it the center of the nation’s credit card industry. As a Senator, Mr. Biden backed a controversial bill that made it harder for consumers to discharge debt in bankruptcy, which was a big benefit for the banks. Biden’s moves recently, such as selecting Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary, seem to indicate that he will continue treat the financial industry well. In addition to that, Biden’s stimulus efforts should give Visa and rival card companies a boost as well. All those $1,400 checks will turn into significant merchant fees in due time. From a valuation perspective, while V stock certainly isn’t cheap, it’s a better play than it used to be. Thanks to a slowdown in growth from the pandemic, V’s stock has been merely flat over the past year even as the market has powered higher. That could make for a decent entry point here.

2021-02-03,"On January 26, 2021, NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on February 12, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. NextEra Energy Partners, which has a current dividend per share of $0.61, has an ex-dividend date scheduled for February 4, 2021. That equates to a dividend yield of 2.93% at current price levels. What Are Ex-Dividend Dates? An ex-dividend date signals when a company's shares cease to trade with its current dividend payout. There is a small intermission period before the company announces a new dividend. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. NextEra Energy Partners's Dividend History Over the past year, NextEra Energy Partners has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on February 5, 2020 the company's payout was $0.54, which has since grown by $0.08. NextEra Energy Partners's dividend yield last year was 3.79%, which has since decreased by 0.86%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.

NextEra Energy (NEE) announced that the new dividend will be paid on March 15, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 26. Shares closed at $83.13 on Feb. 12, down nearly 1%.

NextEra Energy CEO Jim Robo commented, “The board’s approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our long-term expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a result of our success in executing on our industry-leading business strategy.” “With a 61% payout ratio at the end of 2020, well below the peer average of approximately 64%, and the continued strength of the earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, we remain well-positioned to continue to support the dividend policy going forward,” he added. (See NextEra Energy stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 27, Credit Suisse analyst Michael Weinstein W. increased the stock’s price target from $77 to $87 (4.7% upside potential) citing a higher EV/EBITDA multiple reflecting growth at a faster pace and a higher premium 2022 P/E multiple for the utilities.

Weinstein maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys and 2 Holds.

2021-02-19,"Many have been running out of gas. And some saw the proverbial plug came undone Thursday. I’m referring to alt energy stocks. It raises the question, is now a good opportunity for buyers? Let’s look at three names making the case for stocks to buy within this broad and emerging market, coupled with hedged strategies designed to put some green into your portfolio more safely. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). CIIG Merger Corp (NASDAQ:CIIC). Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK). SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR). Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). From exciting EV’s to green-powered commercial vehicles, new battery technology, charging stations, solar, hydrogen fuel cells and more, the alternative energy universe is both diverse and here to stay. What will it actually look like five, 10 or 25 years from now? That’s anybody’s guess. But in 2020 this eclectic space took off like wildfire on Wall Street. There were new stocks to buy everywhere. A wave of blank-check deals to deal with investors’ animal spirits certainly helped with that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But the huge increase in alt energy-related stocks is also supported by technological innovation, increasing cost competitiveness and knowledge that we’re past the point of arguing about climate change. Well, kinda sorta. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of To be sure, nothing is easy. And this critical movement is at odds with fossil fuel producers like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). This week’s wrongful finger pointing at renewables amid Texas’ energy grid problem is a testament to that friction. My advice for investors? Don’t sweat the political theater. Instead, use opportunities like today’s saber rattling to your advantage with the following three alt energy names now better positioned as stocks to buy: QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) Alt Energy Stocks to Buy: QuantumScape (QS) Source: Charts by TradingView Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com The first of our alt energy stocks to buy are shares of QuantumScape. QS is a Silicon Valley-based startup which maintains backers such as auto giant Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bill Gates. Enough, said? Not quite. QuantumScape’s solid-state quantum lithium-metal battery technology has many seeing a so-called Jesus battery. It remains to be seen if QS is the real deal. But this past December the company did provide a successful glimpse of its end game. If QS delivers, incredibly improved storage capacity, charging performance, reliability and safety, as well as cost efficiency could topple the EV market’s combustion engine competition. Technically, QS has turned the corner into the right side of a very deep corrective base after successfully testing the 76% retracement level tied to its October low. The observation is QuantumScape has a real shot at regaining favor with investors. Don’t expect a straight line higher in this ultra-volatile stock to buy. But don’t panic when conditions look less rosy. Rather, use those bouts of adverse price behavior to your advantage with a fully-hedged and flexible stock collar. Favored Strategy: “Adaptive” March $55/$85 Collar Workhorse Group (WKHS) Source: Charts by TradingView Source: Photo from WorkHorse.com Workhorse Group is the next of our alt energy stocks to buy. The EV commercial van upstart is one of three finalists waiting on a U.S. Postal Service contract order worth an estimated $6 billion. Unlike the competition and as InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier notes, WKHS is the only candidate looking to fill the government order of 180,000 delivery vans with electric vehicles. It’s a huge edge given the Biden administration’s aggressive push into renewables. Bears of this heavily-shorted outfit see a different and much uglier outcome for this stock to buy. And truthfully, the importance of the postal deal for Workhorse can’t be dismissed. If successful, brand name awareness, other deals and profitability will surely follow. If not? Sticking around in this alt energy stock looks like a bad idea. Technically, this stock to buy has retreated about 28% from its early February all-time-high after soaring out of a larger triangular base. The corrective pullback has put shares into a testing position of Fibonacci support, as well as its former pattern high from September. Without calling a bottom, the observation is this stock to buy is close enough to being in position for buying leveraged and well-positioned upside, while avoiding more significant and always possible downside risk. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of Favored Strategy: April $35/$50 Bull Call Spread NextEra Energy (NEE) Source: Charts by TradingView Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Nextera Energy is the last of our alt energy stocks to buy. Of the three, it’s the least contested, well outside of the political theater going on in Texas. NEE is a Florida-based utility company at the forefront of renewables-driven electricity generation using solar and wind. It’s the world’s largest. And bottom-line, it’s a business model that’s working and even pays investors an annual dividend approaching 2%. Technically, this stock to buy has pulled back within a sustainable-looking uptrend after hitting all-time-highs out of a cup-shaped breakout. The past few weeks have been spent consolidating around the pattern’s high. Today and with stochastics in a neutral position, but not yet signaling a low is in place, a tighter collar and getting a head start on NEE’s next quarterly payment of 38.50 cents looks about right.

We have successfully completed the enrollment in our Phase III balixafortide (FORTRESS) trial in 2020 and the expected data readout in 2021 will be an important milestone and key priority for our company,” says Gökhan Batur, CEO of Polyphor: “Beyond our Phase III program with balixafortide in advanced cancer, we are rapidly progressing our R&D efforts in oncology and antibiotics. These additional efforts in progressing our mid-term pipeline can bring substantial benefit to patients and high value to our company and our shareholders.” Balixafortide – FORTRESS Phase III trial enrollment closed with results expected for ORR and PFS in Q2 and Q4 2021 respectively Polyphor's FORTRESS study, a pivotal Phase III study evaluating balixafortide (POL6326) in combination with eribulin for the treatment of patients with HER2 negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, had randomized 432 patients in November 2020, when enrollment was closed. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has completed the first, second and third pre-specified interim analyses of safety outcomes for the 193, 284 and 401 randomized patients respectively, and recommended that the study should continue without any modifications. Data on the key primary endpoint, progression free survival (PFS), are expected in Q4 2021 to serve as basis for a regular submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) and Marketing Authorization Application in the U.S., where fast track review has been granted, and for a Marketing Authorization Application in the European Union (EU). Data on the first coprimary endpoint, objective response rate (ORR), is expected in Q2 2021, and could potentially lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S. Completion of the dossier for the NDA filing is on track to support potential breakthrough designation. In August 2020, Polyphor entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for balixafortide in China with Fosun Pharma, one of the leading Chinese healthcare companies with a global footprint. This agreement represents an important milestone for the development and commercialization of balixafortide in one of the largest markets in oncology. Under the terms of the agreement, Polyphor received a USD 15 million upfront payment, and is eligible for additional development milestone payments of up to USD 19 million, sales milestones of up to USD 148 million and royalties on net sales in the territory, which start in the low double digits and increase to the mid-teens based on net sales achieved. Polyphor is steadily conducting preclinical experiments for balixafortide in different combinations and tumors and plans to initiate a Phase Ib/II trial in earlier lines of metastatic breast cancer in combination with nab-paclitaxel. The start of the study is planned in Q3 2021, dependent on the COVID-19 situation. Beyond balixafortide, the company has identified another CXCR4 lead candidate to be explored in liquid cancers based on promising data in preclinical models. This lead candidate is a potent, specific, and highly selective antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Balixafortide - novel non-oncology indication In a research collaboration with the University of Basel, Department of Biomedicine, balixafortide has demonstrated in a pre-clinical experiment using a CPE (cytopathic effect) assay a strong and robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection at clinically relevant concentrations with no adverse cytotoxic effects. Based on this strong anti-viral effect in addition to the potential anticipated beneficial effects on disease progression of CXCR4 inhibitors (mitigation of cytokine storm, effects on vascular pathology, acute respiratory distress, and prevention of lung fibrosis), Polyphor plans to further investigate the profile of balixafortide against COVID-19 in non-clinical pharmacology studies. Given the non-clinical safety and toxicology program of balixafortide has been largely completed, Polyphor is currently evaluating the feasibility of a Phase II clinical proof of concept study in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Inhaled murepavadin – moved to Phase I clinical development In December 2020, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) to start the first-in-human Phase I study of Polyphor’s novel class antibiotic murepavadin, delivered via the oral inhalation route. The start of patient enrollment in the Phase I study, evaluating safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile by using eFlow® Technology nebulizer (PARI Pharma GmbH) to administer murepavadin Inhalation Solution (MIS) in healthy volunteers, is expected in Q3 2021, to further optimize primary packaging providing better stability for later stages of development. The Phase I study is part of the clinical development plan exploring the inhaled formulation of murepavadin to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), including resistant bacterial strains and is largely funded by the European Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). A Phase Ib/IIa trial in adults with CF, assessing safety and tolerability of ascending doses of inhaled murepavadin, is planned following completion of the Phase I study. In November 2020, Polyphor received an award of up to USD 3.3 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to help fund the planned Phase Ib/IIa study. CARB-X awards fuel early antibiotics pipeline Polyphor is pioneering a new class of antibiotics, OMPTAs (Outer Membrane Protein Targeting Antibiotic), that has the potential to offer new treatment options for patients with difficult-to-treat infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens, including resistant strains. The company’s two early-stage antibiotics programs, OMPTA-BamA and Thanatin Derivatives, focus exclusively on WHO Priority 1 pathogens and are planned to enter into clinical development over the next few years. In October 2020, Polyphor received an award from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), a global partnership led by Boston University, to support the development of its thanatin-derivative antibiotics program. CARB-X will provide Polyphor with initial funding of up to USD 2.62 million to complete the hit-to-lead stage and up to USD 15.82 million if certain project milestones are met. In December 2020, Polyphor extended an earlier funding agreement from 2019 with CARB-X to support the development of the company’s novel OMPTA-BamA program. CARB-X has committed to Polyphor additional funding of up to USD 2.3 million, bringing potential funding for this contractual stage to USD 5.1 million. The company may also receive up to USD 13 million in future option stages that could take the program through a first-in-human study if certain project milestones are met. New member of the Board proposed On its next Annual General Meeting, Polyphor will propose Hugh O’Dowd for election to the board of directors. Hugh O’Dowd currently serves as independent Non-executive Chairman on the Board of ONK Therapeutics, an innovative natural killer (NK) cell therapy company and as Non-executive Director on the Board of Puma Biotechnology, Inc (NASDAQ: PBYI), an oncology company. Until its acquisition by BioNTech SE in May 2020, he served for four years as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the Board of Directors of Neon Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company that developed neoantigen-based therapeutics. Prior to Neon Therapeutics, Hugh O’Dowd spent more than 20 years in a variety of senior leadership roles at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation including his role as Chief Commercial Officer of Novartis Oncology from 2011 to 2015. During this time, he was responsible for the oncology portfolio strategy for the world’s then second-largest oncology/hematology organization, including global brand leadership, business development/licensing, and commercialization. Financial Results Polyphor started 2020 with a solid financial position, a renewed strategy and organizational restructuring. This has allowed the company to allocate the majority of the cash position to the balixafortide program, while cystic fibrosis and antibiotics drug candidates have been largely externally funded. In the full year of 2020, the total loss was CHF 44.9 million. R&D costs were primarily driven by the balixafortide trial and amounted to CHF 52.3 million, resulting in a 14% decrease compared to the CHF 60.7 million spent in 2019. The R&D expenditures are expected to decrease in 2021 following the closure of patient enrollment in late 2020. The company has received a USD 15 million upfront payment as part of the partnering agreement with Fosun Pharma. This brings the total cash position to CHF 34.3 million (cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2020, which is expected to finance the operations into Q3 2021. On June 4, 2020, Polyphor’s shareholders approved all proposals of the Board of Directors at the 23rd Annual General Meeting with a significant majority. This includes approval of the renewal of authorized share capital and the creation of conditional share capital for bonds and similar debt instruments. Based on these resolutions, Polyphor has entered into an equity-linked financing arrangement with the French company IRIS to raise a gross amount of up to CHF 19.3 million until June 2022. The equity-linked financing arrangement with IRIS allows for additional flexibility to further extend the cash outlook if needed.

2021-03-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Startup Mainspring Energy Inc. has landed a $150 million deal with a unit of renewable giant NextEra Energy Inc. to deploy a little known power-generation technology that could help businesses avoid grid outages.Called a linear generator, it uses a non-combustion reaction of air and fuel to move magnets back and forth through copper coils, generating an electric current. In a video illustration on Mainspring’s website, it looks something like a constantly moving pogo stick lying on its side.Mainspring’s generators are the latest technology targeting businesses that want to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions and generate their own power at the same time, shielding themselves from the kind of blackouts that have recently struck Texas and California. Packed into box-like units the size of a parking space, they can ramp up to full power within seconds and run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen, which offers the possibility of lower-carbon or carbon-free electricity produced on-site.NextEra Energy Resources, a unit of the world’s largest investor-owned producer of wind and solar power, plans to install the generators at NextEra customer facilities. The chance to tap NextEra’s extensive customer network would boost any startup. But for Mainspring, the introduction could be doubly important, convincing potential customers to try a technology they’ve never heard of before.“It is a really new type of generation,” said founder and Chief Executive Officer Shannon Miller in an interview. “We often get lumped into being an engine or being a fuel cell. The characteristics are different. The value proposition is different.”Mainspring’s generators will likely appeal to the same customers currently buying fuel cells, but the technologies are quite different. Rather than the electrochemical reaction inside a fuel cell, the generator relies on a low-temperature reaction of pressurized fuel and air that drives linear shafts back and forth through copper coils. Two generators packaged together into a single 20 foot-long container can produce 250 kilowatts of electricity. They can power a building or be plugged directly into the grid.“Mainspring is able to integrate clean, onsite generation with both renewables and the grid, and we’re pleased to support bringing this innovative product to market,” said NextEra Energy Resources Chief Executive Officer John Ketchum, in a press release.The Silicon Valley company has raised more than $130 million from such investors as Bill Gates, Equinor Ventures, KCK, Khosla Ventures and utility company American Electric Power Co., Miller said. In addition to the NextEra deal, the company says a national supermarket chain has agreed to install the generators at as many as 30 stores. Miller estimates a typical grocery store could save 10% to 20% on electricity using the generator, when compared with the cost of relying solely on the grid.Pilot deployments with multiple Fortune 500 companies began last June, according to Mainspring.Mark McCullough, executive vice president for energy delivery at American Electric Power, said his company was impressed with the generator’s low costs, low emissions and “dispatchability,” the ability to supply power whenever needed. Solar and wind energy are famously dependent on the weather and time of day, while fuel cells, he said, take substantially longer than the generator to reach full power.“It all rises up to a very usable machine, in many ways,” McCullough said. “This offers us some elegant solutions for a number of use cases.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",NextEra Bets on New Power Generator That Runs Without Combustion

2021-04-19,"(Bloomberg) -- NextEra Energy Inc. agreed to acquire four wind farms from Brookfield Renewable Partners LP for $733 million in the energy giant’s biggest purchase since 2019.The wind turbines have combined output of almost 400 megawatts and have long-term sales contracts for their power, NextEra said in a statement on Monday. Three are in California and one is in New Hampshire. NextEra plans to fund the transaction with a combination of cash and debt.NextEra Energy Partners LP, the subsidiary that is purchasing the assets, is a publicly listed partnership formed by its parent to buy energy projects. The Brookfield deal is its largest since the acquisition of a natural gas pipeline operator about 18 months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“This deal is a bit unusual because NEP is buying assets from a third-party rather than the parent company,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “Other than that, this is a routine, modest-sized acquisition for NEP” that will increase NEP’s generation portfolio by about 7%.Florida-based NextEra is the world’s biggest provider of wind and solar energy and for a brief span in 2020 surpassed oil titans Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. in market value. The deal with Brookfield is its most recent move into renewables this year, with NextEra working on a plan to electrify school buses, building the world’s biggest solar-powered battery system as well as a solar farm in Iowa.NextEra was also one of the big U.S. utilities that last week told Texas lawmakers that proposals to mandate winterization of the power grid would unfairly burden wind and solar generators with extra costs.Units of NextEra Energy Partners fell 0.7% to $73.77 at 9:41 a.m. in New York.

The Florida-based company last month bought GridLiance, which owns about 700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, for about $660 million from Blackstone Group Inc.Executives said in the call that they’re encouraged by U.S. President Joe Biden’s focus on renewables, with NextEra backing a clean energy standard that accelerates a push away from fossil fuels for the U.S. electrical grid. The firm plans to add up to 30,000 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage by 2024, according to a presentation.Biden is aiming to fully green U.S. power grids by 2035 -- a lofty goal that’ll require building billions of dollars worth of new transmission lines. By one estimate, the country will need to expand its transmission grids by as much as 60% for wind and solar to make up half of U.S. electricity capacity by 2030.“The thing about the green economy is that it’s cleaner, it’s greener, but it’s also cheaper, and that is why it’s so powerful,” Chief Executive Officer James Robo said on the call.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",NextEra Aims to Buy More U.S. Power Lines to Fuel Renewable Push

During the storm, NextEra faced some of the biggest outages, losing more than 11.7 gigawatts of electricity generation, according to data from the grid operator.Read more: Kinder’s $1 Billion Texas Crisis Gain Foreshadows More WindfallsStill, financial losses from the storm appeared negligible, with NextEra posting $1.66 billion in net income in the first quarter.

2021-05-27,"(Bloomberg) -- A major new transmission line intended to pipe carbon-free hydropower from Canada into the U.S. Northeast has met a powerful opponent: the world’s largest provider of wind and solar energy.The 145-mile (233-kilometer), nearly $1 billion transmission line, known as New England Clean Energy Connect, broke ground in February after nearly three years of review by regulators. If completed, it would be able to import 1.2 gigawatts of electricity from the Canadian utility Hydro-Quebec. That’s enough to reduce carbon emissions in the region by 3.6 million metric tons a year, according to the project’s developer, Avangrid Inc., or about 12% compared to 2019 levels.To an unfamiliar observer, it might seem that renewables giant NextEra Energy Inc., which supplies 22 gigawatts of clean electricity to homes and businesses in North America, would have an interest in increasing the availability of green power. However the company is also heavily invested in non-renewable energy and has a history of acting for its own benefit at the expense of the environment. More than half of NextEra’s energy-generating capacity come from nuclear reactors and plants that run on natural gas and other fossil fuels.While the company has said little publicly about the transmission project, it’s been quietly financing a ballot initiative in Maine that could halt construction on conservation grounds. It also has yet to begin a mandatory upgrade at one of its facilities to support the surge of power onto the grid.“Of course NextEra doesn’t want it,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at advocacy group Public Citizen. “They’ve got lots of power in the region that’s threatened.”The project is an important part of President Joe Biden’s plan to eliminate carbon from the U.S. power system by 2035. That effort will require significantly boosting the use of clean energy, which will in turn require thousands of miles of new transmission lines to carry that energy around the country.Though the new link will go through Maine, the power will mostly serve Massachusetts customers, lowering their monthly energy bills by as much as 4%, the developers say. NextEra’s New England assets include a nuclear facility and an oil-burning power plant, both of which would face increased competition from the influx of power. NextEra’s allies in the fight against the project include Calpine Corp. and Vistra Corp., each of which operates multiple natural gas plants in the region.Vistra didn’t respond to requests for comment on the initiative to block the transmission line. Calpine spokesman Brett Kerr said that the company “supports the rights of Maine citizens to be heard and respects the fact that Maine voters have a constitutional right to decide on matters of statewide importance.”NextEra, Calpine, and Vistra are all members of the New England Power Generators Association, whose president, Dan Dolan, said the flood of cheap hydropower stands to “suppress prices for the rest of the market” and make it difficult for existing suppliers to compete. Some power plants may be forced to close, and the loss of those assets could pose a threat to reliability in the region, he said. “We have a lot of concerns,” Dolan added.To Paul Patterson, a utility analyst with the research company Glenrock Associates, that’s a polite way of saying they’re concerned with their bottom lines. “There’s no merchant generator in New England that wants to see low-cost Canadian hydro show up on their doorstep,” he said. “You don’t stand to benefit.” Read More: America’s Greenest Energy Giant Isn’t Trying to Save the PlanetNextEra spokesperson Steven Stengel said its dispute with Avangrid is solely because the companies have been unable to agree on terms for the upgrade, a circuit breaker at its Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire. The improvements must be completed by the time construction on the transmission line finishes in 2023. Federal regulators have said that while Avangrid must ultimately cover the cost, the work is NextEra’s responsibility. The developer has been complaining to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory commission since last year that NextEra has been dragging its feet, a charge the energy giant denies.“It’s incredibly frustrating,” said Thorn Dickinson, vice president of business development at Avangrid. “I wasn’t aware how good the fossil fuel industry has gotten at creating mistrust and disinformation to protect their bottom line.”NextEra has been criticized before for blocking clean power initiatives and supporting others with possibly detrimental impacts. It joined other utilities in spending $20 million to promote an unsuccessful 2016 ballot initiative in Florida that would have curbed rooftop solar. And in California, the company backed an unsuccessful bill that would have benefitted a big energy storage project on the edge of Joshua Tree National Park, drawing criticism from conservation groups.The existing power plants will be “disadvantaged” by the hydropower, said Sophie Brochu, Hydro-Quebec’s chief executive officer, at an event hosted by Columbia University on Tuesday. The business models of their owners are “completely threatened by the energy transition.”NextEra is the top donor to a political action committee called Mainers for Local Power, which in turn is the main sponsor of a PAC run by Say No to NECEC, the non-profit behind the upcoming ballot initiative. Calpine and Vistra round out the group’s top three contributors.Say No’s director, Sandra Howard, is a licensed Maine river guide and said she’s concerned about the project’s environmental impact. Construction would require cutting through 53 miles of pristine forest. Not only would this disrupt the habitat of deer and brook trout, it would also threaten the local outdoor recreation industry, she said.She also has some questions about whether it will be able to reduce emissions as much as the developers claim. A 2018 report commissioned by environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Council of Maine raised the possibility that Hydro-Quebec would divert clean energy from its other markets to New England, potentially supplying some of those existing customers with electricity generated from fossil fuels.“If you’re making one region cleaner, another region could be impacted negatively,” she said. “You’re not achieving the global benefit.”Her fight showcases the challenges faced by new transmission projects across the U.S. Building power lines that stretch for hundreds of miles and span public and private lands can be a complicated task that generates pushback from across the political divide. It’s one of the biggest barriers to efforts to decarbonize the U.S. energy system, and it’s why NextEra has found itself allied in Maine with environmental groups to oppose a clean-energy project.“We've agreed that we’ll partner on this issue,” Howard said, “but we may not partner with them on the next one.”(Corrects first paragraph to show that NextEra Energy Inc. is the world's largest provider of wind and solar energy, not all renewables.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",NextEra Is Blocking a Major New Clean Power Transmission Project
