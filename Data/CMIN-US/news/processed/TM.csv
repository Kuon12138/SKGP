Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) stock was trading on a strong positive note in the pre-market session on January 4. At 9:03 AM EST, the stock rose 4.3% from the closing price on January 3. In the previous session, Fiat Chrysler fell 1.5%, while other auto stocks (IYK) including Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Toyota (TM) fell 1.5%, 4.1%, and 1.45, respectively.

## Solid December sales

On January 3, Fiat Chrysler released its December US sales data just like Ford and Toyota. However, Fiat Chrysler was the only automaker that reported solid sales gains. The company’s December US sales rose 14% YoY (year-over-year) to 196,520 units. Ford and Toyota’s December US sales fell 8.8% and 0.9% YoY.

December was the fourth consecutive month that Ford’s sales fell in its home market. In contrast, Fiat Chrysler’s US sales gained for the eighth consecutive month in December.

2019-01-04,"Ford Stock Rallied over 4% Today despite Terrible December Sales

## Ford stock

Legacy automaker Ford Motor Company (F) has been disappointing investors for the last five years. The stock remained in negative territory in four of those five years, just not in 2017, when it yielded a still dismal 1.4% positive return. The company made big changes to its top leadership in May 2017, replacing its former CEO Mark Fields with Jim Hackett. But these efforts were in vain as it continued to yield a negative return, losing 38.3% in 2018.

## Terrible December sales

Today, Ford’s stock posted a day high of $8.12, up about 4.4% from its previous session’s closing price. Yesterday, the company reported an 8.8% year-over-year decline in its December sales to 220,774 units despite holiday season discounts. This was the fourth consecutive month when Ford’s home market sales continued to fall on a year-over-year basis. December 2018 was also the fourth sequential month when its trucks segment sales, especially F-Series units, fell year-over-year.

Last month, Ford’s passenger car sales fell 27.8% year-over-year to 34,950 units. But more worrisome was a decline in its SUV and truck segment sales. The company posted 4.4% and 3.8% year-over-year declines in SUV and truck US sales, respectively.

Plus, the company continues to struggle in China. Its sales in the country had tanked 34% in the first 11 months of 2018 while it’s yet to report its December Chinese sales.

## Then why did the stock go up?

Apart from today’s broader-market recovery, Ford’s consistency in F-Series US sales of over 70,000 units per month and solid F-Series pickup transaction prices could be the main reason for its stock rally today.

In 2018, other mainstream automakers (XLY) General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM), and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also lost 24.7%, 11.9%, 26.5%, respectively.

2019-01-09,"The latest Toyota recall for 2019 (NYSE:TM) is an expansion of the company's previous recalls caused by issues related to the air bags in some of its vehicles.

The carmaker announced that it is now recalling 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S. alone, bringing the recall total to at least 1.7 million cards around the globe. The recall came about due to the Takata air bags on the vehicles, which may have a flaw that causes the propellant in the front-passenger air bag of a number of Toyota and Lexus vehicles to corrode over time.

This means that the flaw could cause the air bag to rupture and shoot out metal shards when it is deployed, potentially resulting in the injury or death of its passengers. Here are the models included in the latest Toyota recall:

  * The 2010-2017 GX460
  * The 2010-2015 IS.



Toyota said it will inform the owners of the affected vehicles via first-class mail sometime this month. A report revealed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that roughly 16.7 million Takata air bags had already been replaced as of last October.

However, another 10 million were slated to be recalled in January 2019 from both Toyota vehicles and a number of other carmakers.

TM stock is up about 0.5% on Wednesday afternoon following the news.

2019-01-10,"Even in this deflated environment, I can appreciate investors' interest in Chinese automaker Nio (NYSE:NIO). Known colloquially as the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China, the upstart has made significant progress over its short lifespan. Considering how high Tesla ultimately flew, speculators are hoping for an encore performance with NIO stock.

In my last write-up for the electric-vehicle specialist, I praised the company's multiple strengths. Primarily, NIO's ambitious drive towards artificial intelligence and autonomous-vehicle technologies is impressive. Should their progress continue unimpeded, NIO stands a great chance of cementing its presence with the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Uber.

Of course, the big dogs like Toyota (NYSE:TM) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will not make things easy for the newcomer. Therefore, I concluded that buying NIO stock carried significant longer-term risks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * Morgan Stanley: 7 Risky Stocks to Sell Now 



### A Look at NIO

That said, one look at their lineup can quickly stir the heart. The company's flagship model is the NIO EP9. Simply put, the EP9 is drop-dead gorgeous. Honestly, it looks like something that came out of the movie Tron: Legacy.

Better yet, the electric supercar has the stats to justify its outrageous styling. From a standstill, it can accelerate to 60 mph in a blistering 2.7 seconds.

Moreover, it has a top speed of 195 mph, thanks to its massive engine that churns out 1,341 horsepower. Combined, these metrics make the EP9 the fastest electric car in the world.

If that wasn't enough, the stock price has a previously unexpected catalyst. The bitter trade war between the U.S. and China has worried global investors for obvious reasons.

However, the anti-American sentiment in China gives the automaker an opportunity to compete against Tesla with a significant advantage.

Plus, with NIO at its current lows, contrarians are licking their lips.

### NIO Is Innovative, but Unproven

So with these new talking points and developments, are they enough for me to change my mind on NIO stock? Actually, they further solidify my original argument. The Chinese automaker scores big on ambition and innovation. However, they fall short on credibility.

Now, NIO can certainly establish credibility. But the reality is that this is a very young company trying to break into a centuries-old industry. I can't heap praise on an organization whose products have yet to be eligible for long-term, real-world testing.

When I think about NIO stock, my mind meanders to the DMC DeLorean. Like the EP9 and its stable mates, the DeLorean was a stunner. Its signature gull-wing doors remain a motif in modern exotic cars such as the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.

But good looks alone doesn't build a viable enterprise. The DeLorean failed chiefly because the underlying company's financials became a mess. Admittedly, founder John DeLorean's arrest for smuggling cocaine didn't help. However, the poor financials drove him to cocaine, not the other way around.

Coincidentally, a major risk to NIO stock is that the automaker is a money pit.

Another similarity between Nio and DeLorean is pricing. Originally, DeLorean wanted his cars priced at $12,000; essentially, a supercar for the lay folk. Unfortunately, the ultimate asking price ballooned to between $20,000 and $25,000. In today's money, we're talking roughly $58,000 to $72,000.

Interestingly, that's around the range Nio's ES6 SUV model occupies. A base level ES6 starts at $52,000, and goes up to $65,000 with all the bells and whistles.

Already, the upstart car manufacturer has made a mistake. When you have no proven track record, you can't value your products in the stratosphere. This is what killed DeLorean, and it could damage the NIO stock price.

### NIO Stock Remains a Gamble

The counterargument is that this is a different time and a different place. For instance, Nio's lineup has garnered industry accolades. In contrast, the DeLorean was a heavy and underpowered lug.

Furthermore, Nio has far more financial credibility than the defunct automaker. The Chinese firm features strong revenue growth, which could help turn the organization into the black. Plus, its shares have stabilized since last October.

Still, I have one last parallel to bring to your attention. DeLorean also failed because it attempted to sell overpriced, unproven vehicles during a recession. Nio is doing the same under an international slowdown. History doesn't repeat exactly, but ignoring it altogether is a treacherous move.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

I'm talking about the industrial batteries that are going to power things like electric and autonomous vehicles, smartphones and more -- solid state batteries.

The lithium-ion batteries that are currently being used are passable for making today's technology work. However, they're not adequate for the next generation of devices, machines and automobiles.

The 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is taking place in Las Vegas this week. More than 4,500 companies and 180,000 attendees have gathered to learn about some of the market's newest and hottest innovations.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

You can be sure I'm keeping a very close eye on the headlines. This is where I get the inside scoop on all of the different emerging technologies that will change our lives today, tomorrow and years into the future.

If there's one thing I have learned from this year's show, it's that the gadgets of the future will require longer battery life. Not only will the next generation of batteries need to go further on a single charge, their overall lifespan will need to increase dramatically as well.

  * Morgan Stanley: 7 Risky Stocks to Sell Now 



Good thing solid state batteries are slated to be the next big battery breakthrough.

The greatest development with these new batteries is that they use solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones. This alone will improve nearly every aspect of today's battery technology and be a boon to any battery stocks that get in on the ground floor.

Because of their composition, solid state batteries are smaller, lighter and can store a lot more energy than what is currently available. They have less impact on the environment. And the icing on the cake? They are much less likely to catch fire or explode.

### The Train Is Leaving the Station

The big names in the electronics and auto industries have invested in solid state battery technology for years. Everyone from Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) to Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) to Hitachi (OTCMKTS:HTHIY) and even Dyson -- yes, the company known for its vacuum cleaners -- have dug into it.

There's good reason for this. The upside potential in this early stage industry is enormous! Just look at some of the projections:

  * According to MarketsandMarkets, the solid state battery industry is expected to reach $1.1 billion by 2020. That would result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72% between 2015 and 2020.
  * Inkwood Research expects the global solid state battery market to grow with a CAGR of 67% between 2018 and 2026.
  * And research firm Arthur D. Little sees the entire battery market growing to be worth $90 billion by 2025, up from $60 billion in 2015.



That last figure is especially important because it shows how overall demand for batteries is on the verge of exploding. (Again, not the batteries … just the demand!)

Don't expect solid-state battery technology to be in the headlines for a few years still. But there is no question that now is the time to position your portfolio for what could be the biggest energy breakthrough in decades.

2019-01-11,"Why General Motors Is Up Over 9% Today

## General Motors

The stock of General Motors (GM), the largest US automaker, is raging today. At 10:12 AM, GM was at $37.83, up 8.9% from the previous session’s closing price. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPY) (QQQ) was down 0.5%, while Ford (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Tesla (TSLA), and Toyota (TM) were up 2.0%, up 2.5%, down 1.0%, and up 0.5%, respectively. Let’s find out what’s driving GM’s gains today.

## GM updates earnings expectations

In October 2018, GM guided full-year 2018 adjusted EPS to be between $5.80 and $6.20. Today, the company said in a press release that it now expects its 2018 adjusted earnings to exceed this guidance.

In addition, General Motors also gave a solid outlook for 2019 with adjusted earnings expected to be between $6.50 and $7.00 per share. The company expects its 2019 free cash flow to be between $4.5 billion and $6 billion in 2019. In October 2018, the company gave guidance of $4 billion in free cash flow for fiscal 2018, which it expects to exceed now.

On the negative side, in its outlook report for 2019, GM warned investors saying, “GM China will remain agile in responding to shifting market dynamics, as it launches more than 20 all-new or refreshed vehicles in 2019.” Due to steep auto tariffs, US automakers including GM, Ford, and Tesla faced challenges in the Chinese market last year, especially in the second half of the year.

The company said car sales might fall in the US auto market (VLUE) (IVV) in 2019, but it also expects “the overall U.S. market to remain strong” with continued strong demand for its pickup trucks.

This update drove optimism among GM investors, resulting in the stock price rally today. GM will release fourth-quarter 2018 earnings on February 6, 2019.",Why General Motors Is Up Over 9% Today

Ford just merely lowered expectations to just below prior estimates. It's not like they changed all assumptions. It sounds like they realized that they are falling behind, but not only from a strategic sense. F stock is down 37% in one year, while General Motors (NYSE:GM) was only down less than half of that.

The first step to recovery is to admit the problem and it did this week. The good news is that they have plans to get it back on track. This is a proven company as it survived the financial crash 10 years ago better than GM did.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Why Ford Stock Is Still Worth a Look

Now it has enough cash on hand to right the ship, so it deserves the benefit of the doubt. The company will come out better from this, and therein lies the opportunity. Buying Ford stock now is not intended to be a short-term trade. Those who catch this falling knife now may temporarily see lower prices, but they are in it for the long term.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



To state it simply, Ford's warning is good news. Management realizes it has problems, but they have plans to fix them.

To that point, Ford stock is cheap in absolute terms: It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 6 for the trailing 12 months. This is not counting any upside forecasts -- it's based on actual past data.

Technically, F stock is falling back into recent lows. But there is good news to come out from the December crash in the stock markets. The Christmas correction had enough panic selling that it can serve as a worst case scenario for months. The sharp drop scared most investors out of stocks, including Ford.

So the lows that we set then should provide solid support for months to come. As a result, I am confident that owning shares here has much more upside opportunity than downside risk. In the long term, this is not likely to be a major financial debacle.

Ford has to fix its auto line up, but luckily it has a great truck line up that has dominated sales for decades. This is a good base from which to build a better future in other areas.

Furthermore, there are clear trends in the automobile market so it will be easy for management to chase the right ones. Ford will clearly have winners with the Expedition and Navigator in the SUV market.

And then there is the electric vehicle area.

Much like Toyota (NYSE:TM) did for the hybrids, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) did the hard work of making EVs mainstream. It laid the path for the major brands to follow. This should be an easy addition for a seasoned company like Ford.

The experts on Wall Street are wary of F stock. Almost all of them have a hold rating on it. This comes as it hovers just below their average price target, which means it's more likely that once the repercussions from this week's announcement are gone, a surprise headline would lead to an eventual wave of upgrades.

  * 7 Best ETFs for Novice Investors 



Meanwhile, they don't ring bells at bottoms, especially not ahead of earnings. Ford will report earnings in about a week and they may be delivering more bad news. So investors may not yet be done selling it.

So I don't suggest taking a full position all at once. This allows you to leave room to add-in at lower prices if they come. Furthermore, my thesis for the equity markets for the next two weeks is that we may have another dip coming. If that happens, F stock will also suffer.

This is not the same as saying that I am bearish on the markets. Even if a dip comes, it would be an opportunity to buy for another rally into the next six months.

Germans like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY), Japanese like Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Chinese -- even Indians. In America, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has produced an electric Cadillac and Ford (NYSE:F) is now offering an an electric pick-up.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

What they all have in common is a desire to grab both Tesla's market -- and its mojo. At its Jan. 18 opening price of $325 per share, investors are still paying over three times sales for Tesla shares, while they can have General Motors for less than one-third sales.

The market cap of Tesla -- about $58 billion after a 6.5% overnight drop -- remains $4 billion ahead of GM, $25 billion ahead of Ford Motor, and is more than double that of Fiat Chrysler (NASDAQ:FCAU), all of whom dwarf it in sales, profits, and numbers of employees.

The posse is on to Tesla

How is Tesla going to compete? By cutting employees, cutting costs and raising profits, according to CEO Elon Musk.

In his e-mail to employees announcing the job cuts, Musk cited the end of U.S. tax breaks on electrics and said the Model 3 needs to be priced closer to its $35,000 base price promise to compete and admitted that &quot;the road ahead is very difficult.&quot;

Tesla is now facing a host of competitors, with more coming all the time. Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) is just the latest big car company promising an all-electric line and a &quot;complete reinterpretation&quot; of what such cars can do.

Tesla also faces a host of competitors in the area of autonomous vehicles, starting with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo, which is already running driverless Fiat Chrysler Pacificas in Phoenix.  General Motors plans to start tests of self-driving cars in San Francisco this year.  Fiat Chrysler's Jeep unit is experimenting with rentals and car-sharing.

### Tesla's Not-So-Secret Weapon

Given the reality of other car makers' low valuations, Tesla's high valuation, and Musk's admission of trouble ahead, is there anything that might still attract an investor to the stock?

Yes.

Tesla's battery factory in Nevada is churning out two battery packs per minute, 24 hours each day, at a cost of $116 per kilowatt hour (kwh).  The cheapest competitor pays $146 per kwh -- and Tesla is making more such battery packs than the rest of the world combined.

Tesla has plans to build two more battery plants, in Shanghai and in Europe, and to continually redesign its batteries so they both cost less and last longer. Tesla executives say the Nevada plant is profitable and cash flow positive.

The problem is that batteries remain a very small part of the Tesla story, at just over 10% of revenue, even when its solar cells are added in. Also, even here there are competitors, promising to do even better. 

### The Bottom Line on TSLA Stock

Tesla has succeeded in shifting the direction of the auto industry, away from gas guzzlers, toward electrics and toward vehicles that drive themselves.

But its valuation has attracted enormous competition, and expectations for its own financial performance keep rising.

Tesla is next due to report earnings Feb. 6 and the consensus is for net income of $2.12 per share, while the &quot;whisper number&quot; (what analysts are telling their top clients to expect) is $2.41, on revenue of $6.36 billion. Compare that to earnings of $1.75 per share, fully diluted, reported for third quarter, on $6.8 billion in sales.

Even if Tesla beats these estimates, it's becoming less unique, as all its competitors are now focused on making the same kind of all-electric, autonomous vehicles it has been promising. Its relative valuation today is based entirely on its lead in batteries, and battery technology.

Elon Musk wants investors to think beyond the good news or bad news that's contained within the report and look to the future. How well Musk can do the second part will play a significant role in the future trajectory of Tesla stock. 

Most of the news regarding Tesla's profits and deliveries in the fourth quarter have already been sliced and diced by analysts, media pundits, auto geeks, etc. There shouldn't be too many surprises when they report Wednesday after the close. 

It's 2019 where things get a bit murky. I'll get to that. But first, let's talk expectations for earnings.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Q4 By the Numbers

The fourth quarter is going to be light years better from the year before. 

In Q4 2018, analysts expect revenues of $7.12 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $2.19 and total deliveries of 90,000. Last year, revenues were $3.29 billion, Tesla lost $3.35 a share on a non-GAAP basis, and a total of 30,000 vehicles were delivered in the quarter. 

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



So, that's 116% year-over-year revenue growth, 165% earnings growth and a 200% increase in deliveries. Almost any business would love to have this kind of growth -- but we are talking about Tesla, and nothing's ever this easy with the electric car maker.  

We already know that barring some a miracle, the profit in the fourth quarter won't be as high as it was in the third quarter. Elon Musk already told us that in his January email to employees about the future job cuts. 

&quot;In Q3 last year, we were able to make a 4% profit. While small by most standards, I would still consider this our first meaningful profit in the 15 years since we created Tesla. However, that was in part the result of preferentially selling higher-priced Model 3 variants in North America,&quot; Musk wrote. &quot;In Q4, preliminary, unaudited results indicate that we again made a GAAP profit, but less than Q3. This quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher-priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit.&quot;

It's a rare event to see Musk being so humble and conservative in his thoughts. Perhaps the changes to the company's corporate governance are helping to reign in his worst impulses. 

Nonetheless, Musk was laying the groundwork for more tough decisions at the company. Imagine if Elon Musk ran a company that had no problems to speak of? He would go stir crazy. 

No matter what Tesla delivers in the fourth quarter, 2018 has to be considered a significant success, despite Tesla stock delivering a meager 7% return. 

### The Dreaded Future for TSLA  


As I said, this is where it gets murky. Musk is already on record stating Tesla has got a tough road ahead of it. 

&quot;While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,&quot; Musk stated in his email to employees. &quot;Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors. The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.&quot;

Translation: The business is going to worse before it gets better.

Analysts expect Tesla's Q1 2019 guidance to include a projected loss. The consensus estimate is a small loss of $2.5 million, worse than the previous estimate (before Musk's job cuts announcement) of a $63 million profit. 

How Musk frames Tesla's future losses could affect Tesla's stock price, which has already lost about 14% of its value since the job cuts were announced.

### Good Things Are Happening

So, I think it's likely that Tesla will focus on some of the good things happening currently and in the future. 

In February, Tesla starts delivering Model 3s to China and Europe, providing a major growth runway for the company. According to Electrek, the Model 3 is taking business from Toyota (NYSE:TM); estimates suggest that the Model 3 is responsible for approximately 50% of the Prius's loss in North American market share. As the Model 3 makes its way to the rest of the world, investors can expect more of the same, which is a good thing for Tesla stock. 

Another major talking point will likely be future products such as the pickup and Model Y crossover and where they're at from a development perspective. 

&quot;We would not be surprised to see Tesla provide an update on its product road map in part to help support the stock,&quot; said Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch recently. 

The important thing is that investors get a confident Musk in Wednesday's report, conference call, etc. Job cuts aren't easy, so it's understandable that his tone was subdued and conservative by nature. To give a repeat performance would be a killer to Tesla stock.

### The Bottom Line on Tesla Stock

TSLA was wise to do the tough part (job cuts) before it announced fourth-quarter earnings. Now, the smaller profit won't have nearly the same effect on its stock price. 

An honest but confident Musk could do wonders for its share price. We'll see what Tesla's CEO has in store for investors come Wednesday after the close. 

As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-31,"Shares of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell on Thursday following mixed quarterly results posted after Wednesday's close. Tesla, often buoyed by revenue growth that isn't as profitable as hoped, repeated that pattern for its fourth fiscal quarter ending in December.

Sales of $7.23 billion were better than the $7.08 billion analysts were modeling, while adjusted per-share earnings of $1.93 fell short of the projected figure of $2.20. Yet, it marks Tesla's second consecutive quarterly profit … defying more than a few doubters who felt the spendthrift company led by often brash CEO Elon Musk would never achieve sustained viability.

Still, there's still cause for concern. Why? Because this may be as good as it gets for Tesla stock holders.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Recapping Tesla's Earnings

For the three month stretch ending in December, Tesla's top line grew from $3.29 billion a year earlier to $7.23 billion om Q4. Profits fell short of analyst expectations but were well up from the year-ago loss of $3.04 (due to heavy spending on production capacity for the Model 3).

The Model 3, in fact, accounted for the bulk of the previous quarter's business. Tesla announced in early January that of the 90,700 vehicles it had delivered during the fourth quarter, as many as 63,150 were Model 3s.

Musk commented in the official quarterly letter to shareholders:

&quot;Model 3's success has carried over to our financial performance in Q3 and Q4 of 2018. Operating income in Q4 remained stable at $414 million despite a sequential decline in revenue from the sale of regulatory credits, higher import duties on components from China, a price reduction for Model S and Model X in China, and the introduction of a lower-priced mid-range version of Model 3.&quot;

### Drilling Down Into Tesla's Numbers

Although a success by most fiscal measures, current and would-be owners of Tesla stock have good reason to be concerned.

&quot;This is a strong indication that demand in the U.S. for both the mid-range and long-range Model 3 versions has largely been exhausted, and the company is still working through the estimated ~6.8k of unsold Model 3 inventory,&quot; analysts from Cowen commented in response to clues that the company is only manufacturing cars for China and Europe at this time.

Other anecdotal evidence suggests the same. Even as it's planning to build enough capacity in China to manufacture at a pace of 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year, it's laying off U.S. workers. In mid-January the company announced it would be reducing its headcount by 7%, mostly as a means of driving down the average cost to make the Model 3 in the wake of an end to the federal government's $7500 EV subsidy that was cut in half as of January 1st, and will end altogether later this year.

&quot;We have to be relentless about costs in order to make affordable cars and not go bankrupt,&quot; Musk said during the call.

Even then though, it may not be enough to log actual fiscal progress.

&quot;Things really aren't going to get any better for Tesla in the U.S. than they did at the end of 2018,&quot; commented Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis Jessica Caldwell. She added: &quot;Turning a profit, creatively addressing production challenges and getting the Model 3 to the masses were huge milestones, but keeping up this momentum is going to be virtually impossible.&quot;

Meanwhile, EV competition within the U.S. is finally becoming palpable. Sales of the Prius Prime from Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) grew slowly but steadily over the course of last year, as did BMW. Hyundai, Kia, Audi and Jaguar all have EV debuts planned for the United States this year, falling across the price spectrum; Ford (NYSE:F) is moving ahead with an $11 billion investment that will bring 40 electrified vehicles to the market by 2022.

Things may not be any easier overseas either. New rival Nio (NYSE:NIO) is starting to turn heads in China, prompting UBS analyst Paul Gong to note this week, &quot;We still think NIO is well positioned in China's EV megatrend from a top-down view.&quot;

And, Nio isn't the only electric vehicle maker taking aim at China.

### Looking Ahead for Tesla Stock

For the year now underway, Musk believes the company will produce between 360,000 and 400,000 cars. Unofficially, he suggested Tesla might be able to produce more. As of the most recent look, analysts are calling for a full-year profit of $6.16 per share of Tesla stock on revenue of $28.7 billion. The company lost $1.33 per share last year on sales of $17.6 billion last year, though it swung to a profit mid-year.

Scaling up production should help drive the production cost of the Model 3 down from its current figure of $44,000 -- at the low end -- and help maintain and even widen profit margins.

2019-02-14,"Ford's (NYSE:F) fourth-quarter earnings report was as mixed as the company's overall outlook. The automaker's earnings came in below analysts' consensus estimate, but its revenue beat their average forecast.Ford stock rose more than 3% following the report. However, it fell back after the excitement faded, and F stock is again trading near its pre-announcement levels.Source: Wikipedia<br />Click to EnlargeInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNonetheless, F stock has recovered from the $7.41 low it reached at the end of December. Given that recovery, it may have found a floor. Although the stock faces formidable challenges, its valuation metrics and possible upcoming events could make Ford stock tradeable. The Good and the Bad of Ford StockPut simply, Ford stock is a mixed bag. The U.S.-China trade war has hurt the company's sales, and it has struggled outside of North America. During the fourth quarter, the EBIT of Ford's Middle East/Africa region increased, and Ford maintained its market share in Europe. However, every other metric of all of its markets outside of North America fell. Ford also faces the ongoing concerns of pension costs, labor issues, and interest rates.  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks? Fortunately, it has found one compelling silver lining: North American truck sales. Continuing a trend that has been in place for years, the Ford F-150 truck is continuing to outsell the competition. In 2018, the company sold more than 909,000 F-150 pickup trucks.That exceeded the combined 806,000 Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks that General Motors (NYSE:GM) sold. It's also close to double the sales of the Dodge Ram built by Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU). Also, U.S. companies continue to dominate the domestic truck market, as Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) combined only sold one-sixth as many trucks as Ford.These numbers reinforce the wisdom of Ford's decision to largely exit the passenger-car business. According to J.D. Power, the average cost of new pickup trucks now exceeds $44,000, well over the $32,500 average price of all new vehicles. The high margins of trucks help Ford compensate for its lagging overseas sales, particularly in China. Ford Stock Is a Buy, Just Not a Long-Term HoldThe current dividend yield of F stock is just above 7%. Moreover, the stock's forward price-earnings ratio of 6.2 might also lure investors. Although every major car company other than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long held a single-digit multiple, Ford's forward PE is well below the average multiple of 9.8 that Ford stock has maintained for the last five years.A few tailwinds could return Ford stock to that multiple. Negotiators seem optimistic that the trade war with China could end sooner rather than later. After the conflict ends, Ford's car sales in the world's most populous country should increase. Furthermore, the Fed also looks set to stop its interest-rate hikes. That should keep the more rate-sensitive consumers in the auto market.At around $8.45 per share, the Ford stock price stands at less than half of its 2014 peak. Even if it just returns to the $10 range over the next year, that, combined with the 7% dividend, amounts to a return of about 25%.Despite the strengths of Ford, I only recommend trading Ford stock. Over the longer term, the outlook of Ford stock seems more uncertain. The 60-cent per share annual payout represents a drop from the 83 cents-per-share dividend that F stock paid in 2018. Since the payout tends to fluctuate, I would not consider the dividend as secure as that of high-yield, dividend-aristocrat stocks such as AT&T (NYSE:T) or AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).Moreover, even if the trade war with China ends, Wall Street expects Ford's profit growth to be meager as the company's pension and labor issues will probably continue to weigh on its bottom line. Analysts predict that the company's profits will shrink in fiscal 2019. They also estimate that its profit will increase by an average of just 3.8% per year over the next five years.However, given the 6.2 forward PE ratio of Ford stock, these issues are probably baked into Ford stock price. If one is looking for a play on a U.S.-China trade deal, Ford stock could fill that role for awhile. The Bottom Line on Ford StockAlthough the long-term outlook of F stock appears to be bleak, the equity looks well-positioned for a short-term trade. The company faces challenges that will probably dampen enthusiasm for F stock for years to come.However, with a forward P/E ratio of 6.2 and a dividend yield above 7%, any tailwind could result in a significant return over the short-term or medium-term. A trade agreement with China and/or interest rates that stay low enough to entice U.S. buyers could provide the necessary catalyst.I do not recommend taking a long road trip with Ford. However, for a short trek, F stock could provide a nice ride.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV stock. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

Because of the large number of vehicles on the road, Tesla is continuously building a valuable database -- and its computer systems are getting smarter and smarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the meantime, the company continues to post profits and has $3.7 billion in the bank. While all this is great, Tesla stock still faces considerable risks. According to Elon Musk, the company came close to imploding last year; and such dire circumstances seem like a quarterly occurrence for the often-beleaguered automaker.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market So for investors looking at Tesla stock, it's a good idea to think about the potential landmines. (And yes, there are many.) Some of these landminds are especially treacherous. See for yourself: Risks to Tesla Stock: Musk DramaMusk has one of the best track records in tech. In the mid-1990s, he founded Zip2 and sold it for more than $300 million. Then he launched PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which revolutionized digital payments. And yes, he would eventually put together SpaceX.While Musk is certainly brilliant, he can also be unpredictable. Last year's ill-fated attempt to take his company private is an example of this. It resulted in penalties from the SEC, which included revamping the board.Musk's mercurial personality could ultimately lead to even worse consequences, though. Keep in mind that there has been significant turnover in the executive suite, which could hamper growth. Some of the latest departures include Tesla's in-house counsel and chief accounting officer. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than 50 executives have left the company during the past two years. Risks to Tesla Stock: Quality and ScaleProduction has been one of the biggest issues for TSLA stock. Let's face it, the company's cars are highly complex and require sophisticated processes. The company has also been hamstrung because of a lack of sizeable production capacity.True, Musk has done a tremendous job in improving things. But it seems like a good bet there will be ongoing challenges as volumes ramp up.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Note that Consumer Reports recently nixed its recommendation of the Tesla Model 3 because of reliability and quality problems. Of course, Musk quickly responded, indicating that the problems have been resolved. Yet he has certainly been prone to making statements that have proven to be overly optimistic. Risks to Tesla Stock: CompetitionGoing mainstream is a herculean task in the auto industry. It has meant the destruction of many startups. Tesla has beaten the odds.But as time goes by, it will get tougher as the competition grows more intense. In the next couple years, the market will see a flood of EV offerings from operators like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY), Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) and Nio (NYSE:NIO). Oh, and tech operators like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo will certainly continue to gain traction with autonomous vehicles.In fact, there are already signs that TSLA is getting antsy about the competition. For instance, Tesla plans to provide an option for consumers to lease its vehicles, and the company has also reduced the price of the Model 3. Price cuts aside, Tesla's Model 3 is still above the $35,000 mark Musk promised (and really, needs) to win over the mass-market consumer.Considering that it's about to find itself outclassed in everything from cash to brand loyalty, Tesla stock is currently stuck between a rock and a hard place.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk forgot that rule this past week, up-ending a budding, much-needed rally from Tesla stock in the process.Source:  JD Lasica via Wikimedia Commons The news in question, of course, was Tesla's announcement that it would finally begin selling the long-touted $35,000 version of its Model 3 electric vehicle.Mission accomplished. Unfortunately, the company has been forced to hatchet off more pieces of itself to make it happen, resulting in a not-entirely-surprising dial-back of this year's profit outlook.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It Is, In Fact, a $35,000 Model 3It's here. Thursday's big announcement was the unveiling of the often discussed but not yet available $35,000 Model 3.As far as vehicles go, it's not exactly a head-turner. It's got a smaller battery -- and therefore less range -- than earlier versions of the Model 3, and it doesn't come with power seats. It's also only available in black (though to his credit, Musk didn't borrow the &quot;any color so long as it is black&quot; line from Henry Ford). And, you won't be able to buy it from an actual person. The company is culling most of its stores, and will send you online to make all future purchases of Tesla's vehicles.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks for Young Investors But it is a $35,000 Model 3.It just may not be worth it to the company's investors. Not Necessarily Worth ItFans and followers of Tesla stock cheered back on Jan. 30 when, on the heels of a fourth-quarter earnings miss, Musk wrote in his quarterly letter to shareholders &quot;we are expecting to have positive GAAP net income and to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capex) in every quarter beyond Q1 2019.&quot;Now, not so much. Musk conceded the current quarter wouldn't be a profitable one, and was only willing to say profits were &quot;likely&quot; for the second quarter. There's no clarity beyond that.Chipping away at profits is a $35,000 Model 3 that probably costs around $35,000 to make and market, given the planned axing of salespeople that add an estimated 6% to the total cost of a Tesla vehicle.To that end, it's not even clear a watered-down version of the EV and extreme cost-cutting will be enough. Goldman Sachs commented on the announcement &quot;While we believe the introduction of the $35k Model 3 may be positive for overall program demand … we also think this will drive a downward mix impact for Model 3 margins.&quot;Goldman's stance echoed some notes from Bank of America's analysts, who commented &quot;In our view, the result of what appears to be an earlier push of lower range/price Model 3s will likely be an increase in volume in the near term, rather than an increase in profits, as the cost structure for mass-market electric vehicles (specifically those priced around $35k) is not yet breakeven.&quot;When asked about it at the event, Musk refused to answer questions about the lower-cost Model 3's profit margins.The aggressive move into the low(er) end market may cost Tesla more than money though. Morgan Stanley explained, &quot;We're concerned it's a sign of a brand that may be, at the margin, losing its halo of exclusivity.&quot;Most analysts were struggling to find the net-positive in the news. Bottom Line for Tesla StockIt's a tough pill for diehard fans of TSLA stock -- and everything it has done for the EV evolution -- to swallow. But, Thursday's strangely anticlimactic news is yet another layer of evidence that a game-changing idea alone inherently makes for a consistently profitable business. The fact that TSLA stock was lower to the tune of 6% on Friday in the wake of the highly anticipated news says investors are increasingly understanding that reality.And matters may get worse before they get better, if they get better at all. The new Polestar from Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) is yet another looming direct competitor to the Model 3 from a longer-established, higher profile manufacturer, pitting one against the other at least partially on price.  * 7 Reasons Kraft Heinz Stock Is a Contrarian Buy And, for the record, while the Model 3 was the best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. last year, neither the Model X nor the Model S were the second-best sellers. That honor belongs to the Prius Prime, from Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), underscoring the idea that price and functionality rather than a logo are key drivers at the value end of the EV scale.It's a problem, simply because Tesla wasn't exactly built from the ground up and established as a brand name to fight a price war … a war that will only heat up by 2022, when Ford Motor (NYSE:F) says it will be manufacturing 40 different all-electric and hybrid vehicles.The last thing Tesla wants is to get into a price war with Ford and its peers. It's struggling just remain in the black right now with fighting a price war with no one in particular.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-06,"We've had electric automobiles since the 1870s. Yet they only recently caught on globally. Now every major auto manufacturer is in the process of launching their own line of electric vehicles. But there are also newcomers like Nio (NYSE:NIO). Last night, the electric-vehicle maker reported earnings and Nio stock is down 16% on the headline.Source: Shutterstock While Nio earnings sound like a complete disaster, we have to keep in mind that year-to-date NIO was up 50%. And NIO was up 3.9% on the afternoon leading into the event. So this over exuberance made it difficult to avoid a dip after earnings. In fact, this dip merely brings NIO back to levels seen less than two weeks ago.The NIO selloff is not because they delivered a complete disaster quarter. This is more likely that the expectations rose too fast into it. They did miss on the bottom-line target but this is a growing company so I don't worry about that as much as sales for now. I am also sure that the tariff war is also causing undue pressure on their sales flow and deliveries. So this is clearly not the time to short NIO stock and perhaps it's an opportunity to start building a bullish position in it for the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Underrated Stocks to Buy for 2019 Emphasis here would be on the long term. Clearly Nio is far from being a company of scale but the potential is definitely there. First, they supply a massive market in China where perhaps they are ahead of the world for EVs. Second, they are already a household name thanks to the television bit that recently aired on mainstream TV.This sudden exposure was mostly responsible for the recent sharp price squeeze and that is a classic scenario of too much exposure coming too fast. Yet, even with the spike, Nio stock still didn't hit the all-time high. It would be safe to say that the sector and especially this stock is prone to hype. But eventually there should be enough meat to wrap around the bones.This is a risky speculative stock so I don't make it a large portion of my portfolio. I never risk an amount that would break my heart or my piggy bank on uncertain trades like this. Also it would be a good idea to enter the position in tranches. Trading NIO StockAs early as tomorrow, I could start a small position if I see positive signs that there are buyers towards the end of the day. Then if it falls again in a few days I can average down to a more attractive net price. I don't do that too closely to the original entry or else I would be making my problem bigger and without reason.So let's find some specific levels that could be important on this dip.On February 26th, after 60 Minutes aired a special on the company, the bulls spiked NIO stock to $10.64 per share. Still this fell short of its all-time high so the sky remain the limit on the upside. It it important to note that it also double topped yesterday at $10.63 per share.Since then, the bulls successfully defended the $9 per share level. So that remains the support level to lose here. But there is room for NIO stock to fall further to $8 and still be on a positive up-slope.Last year was tough for stocks, but it is important to note that NIO stock held a constant floor near $6 per share. While the S&P 500 was setting lower lows before they bottomed on Christmas, NIO held almost the same lows from inception. This is to say that the bulls have a firm footing to remount the rally effort.There is far more upside than downside risk given the wide world of EVs. Nio is even into autonomous vehicles with artificial intelligence so they are on the right track. If long, then I stay long the stock and this dip won't phase me. Most of analysts that cover it are still waiting to see proof as most have it as a HOLD. So it's more likely to get a surprise upgrade than a downgrade once they figure out the potential. The Bottom Line on NIO StockPersonally, I'd ignore the fears that are baked into in this quarter's earnings report.  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News The tariffs that are already in place messed with Nio's demand curve so the forward guidance by default had to be less than enthusiastic. This is especially true since apparently the U.S .and China are close to a trade deal. So the caution this quarter from management is immaterial to the long-term future of Nio stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-11,"Elon Musk is undoubtedly one of the greatest innovators of our time; his ability to transfer fantasy into reality catalyzed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). He's the reason why, in prior years, I've supported the bull case for Tesla stock despite headwinds -- such as the ubiquitous cash burn -- recommending a cautious approach.Source: Shutterstock But recently, Elon Musk is the reason why I've turned skeptical on TSLA stock.Of course, he remains a brilliant mind, accomplishing scientific feats of which mere mortals can only dream. But as I argued last month, Tesla doesn't need more science; they have plenty of that! Instead, they need business smarts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsObviously, Musk has to stop shooting himself in the foot. Making legally questionable comments on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that later aroused the Securities and Exchange Commission is an unforced error. So is smoking pot for a public interview, especially if it jeopardizes a vital security clearance.Enough challenges already stymie Tesla stock. Stakeholders don't need the CEO to add to their problems.Fortunately, the tech firm has a viable opportunity to positively change the narrative. Scheduled for a world debut on Mar. 14, management will unveil the Tesla Model Y. In order to generate buzz before the launch, the company released a teaser photo. From the looks of it, the Model Y is a stunner.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners A crossover based off the ultra-popular Model 3 sedan, management hopes the new vehicle can right TSLA stock. On paper, it should.For starters, the Tesla Model Y will almost surely carry the same sleek design as previous models. Moreover, Musk disclosed that the Model Y will have 76% of the same parts as the Model 3. Plus, it should hit a pricing sweet spot.But will it be enough to save Tesla stock? Tesla Model Y Fires on All CylindersWhen you look at the Tesla Model Y as purely an automotive asset, you can't help but think this is the gamechanger that TSLA stock needs. It hits all the right notes you're looking for as a car manufacturer.Looks are subjective, but I'm likely not a contrarian when I say their cars are drop-dead gorgeous. Not only that, Tesla, in its short lifespan, has a distinctive image. Just like the layperson recognizes BMW's kidney grilles or Mercedes-Benz's three-pointed emblem, a Tesla commands our attention.Furthermore, on a relative scale, the Model Y wins the design department by a wide margin. Toyota (NYSE:TM) has its Prius, and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) has its Leaf. However, the former is painfully boring, while the latter is an automotive atrocity.Performance-wise, drivers will enjoy the immediate torque native to electric vehicles (EVs). According to Car And Driver, the Model X can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds. A hotrod-version of the Model 3 does it in a blistering 3.5 seconds. You can probably expect the base Model Y to hit close to these numbers, perhaps around 5 seconds.Finally, sales trends indicate that the sedan is a dying platform. A painful example is Ford Motor (NYSE:F), which essentially gave up on its sedans. Today, they're largely focusing on their trucks, the still-popular Mustang and the international market.But with an SUV and a crossover under its belt, Tesla can jumpstart its revenue stream. If all goes well, we should see a correlating bump up in TSLA stock. Model Y Is Not a Fix-All for Tesla stockAs much as I'm a fan of Tesla EVs, I've distanced myself from Tesla stock. While the automotive experience tugs at my heartstrings, I can't let emotions dictate my investments.One of the things that I worry about is the core product: these are of course EVs, and that's the problem. Only 56% of Americans have access to electrical charging, which dramatically limits this automotive platform's potential.Not only that, EVs take a while to charge. Even a Tesla car using a 150-kilowatt rapid charger will require sitting at a charging station for at least half-an-hour. I'm sorry but that's a big killjoy, especially for multiple generations growing up in fill-'er-up culture.  * 7 Best Fidelity Funds for 2019 Another surprising headwind for Tesla stock is that the underlying vehicles don't have the greatest quality. Car And Driver's Kevin A. Wilson had this to say about the performance-version Model 3:&quot;Whatever you think of the Model 3's exterior design (some among us have called it &quot;not pretty&quot; while those with the warmest regard for the shape get no more impassioned than to suggest it's &quot;not bad&quot;), we've also noted that Teslas in general are not assembled to the high standards of the luxury automakers with which they compete.&quot;That's hardly what I call a glowing review. It also opens the door to the competition. At the price range at which the Tesla Model Y will fit in, multiple options exist. We're talking vaunted names like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, Audi and even Porsche.While the Model Y will make things interesting for gearheads, it doesn't do anything for TSLA stock. Simply put, there's no compelling reason to own one.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-25,"When it comes to the Uber and Lyft IPOs, I'm sure the financial media will be full of talking heads with opinions on both. That's fine. But lost in all of it will be an even more promising future. Over the long term, these two companies point us to one major trend (and investment theme) -- the growth of autonomous vehicles and the emergence of &quot;robo-taxis.&quot;Unless you truly love driving, there will be no need to own a car in the future. Auto sharing will be the next-generation way to &quot;own&quot; cars. You will use an app to request that a car come pick you up and take you to your desired destination.That's no different than what Uber and Lyft already do today. The difference is that the cars will arrive without a human driver. The autonomous vehicles will take you to where you need to be, and they will come back to take you home when you are ready.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the future, taxis will be these &quot;robo-taxis.&quot; And a study conducted by UBS shows that their cost per mile will be about 80% less than that of a traditional taxi.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend You can see why Lyft and Uber are both in prime position to benefit from the massive and life-changing shift to what I call Transportation 2.0.In fact, the two ride-sharing giants are already embracing the future -- though they have very different models when it comes to implementing the new technologies. Two Approaches to the Same RaceUber is set on developing its own self-driving technology that it will use in its fleet of vehicles. As a matter of fact, the company is close to accepting a $1 billion investment from Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and its largest shareholder, Japanese telecom business SoftBank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). The huge infusion of cash would be put to work in Uber's autonomous vehicles unit (which is currently losing money).Assuming Uber continues along that path, Lyft will likely be first in bringing an AV ride-hailing service to market. It has said it wants to act as an &quot;open platform&quot; for self-driving providers.Lyft partnered with the world leader in automotive software -- which my Investment Opportunities subscribers have a stake in -- and began offering self-driving public rides in the test market of Las Vegas in May 2018. The cars provide rides to more than 1,600 entertainment venues, restaurants and destinations throughout the city. They drive themselves until entering a property, at which point the driver then takes control until it is back out on public streets.So far, the numbers are encouraging. The companies say they have provided more than 30,000 rides with an average rating of 4.95 out of five stars.Lyft's partnerships don't stop there. General Motors (NYSE:GM) invested $500 million in the ride-sharing company in 2016 and today owns more than 18.6 million shares.General Motors owns self-driving car company Cruise Automation, one of more than 50 businesses with a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in California. Together, Cruise and General Motors are ramping up to launch Cruise Anywhere, their own version of a ride-hailing app.CEO Kyle Vogt has also said he is open to working with other companies &quot;if that's the best way to release this technology and achieve the societal benefits of driverless cars sooner.&quot; Considering General Motors' ownership stake in Lyft, that seems like a very logical possibility. The company's goal is to launch autonomous vehicles for ride-sharing services as early as this year. The Right Early Investments for Autonomous VehiclesWe're seeing the very beginnings of the trillion-dollar shift to Transportation 2.0 -- and this trend could easily be headlined by the likes of Lyft and Uber.Lyft, which launched its pre-IPO &quot;road show&quot; this week, is scheduled to start trading on the NASDAQ next Friday, March 29, under the symbol &quot;LYFT.&quot;Assuming all goes according to plan, Lyft will become the first-ever U.S. ride-hailing company to go public. Then Uber -- the biggest name in the industry today -- plans to make its initial public offering (IPO) in April.Even with all of the attention surrounding these long-awaited market debuts, these are the not the companies you want to invest in to stake your claim in the self-driving mega-trend. At least, not yet.Both Lyft and Uber are not currently profitable. Now, that isn't the end of the world. Most early-stage companies take years to turn their first profit as they reinvest in growing their businesses. However, it does make things trickier when analyzing an IPO.Lyft wants to fetch a valuation of up to $23 billion when it enters the stock market. And Uber will be seeking much, much more… a valuation upwards of $120 billion!Despite their obvious similarities, the two companies do have their differences. Uber has expanded internationally and diversified itself into other areas of the market, like food delivery. Lyft, on the other hand, is all about ride sharing - which actually makes it a simpler bet.That being said -- I'm staying away from both IPOs for now. I rarely buy any right away. For instance, right now I am focusing a lot on recently public marijuana companies, which I typically watch for a period of time, then identify the right time to buy. (And timing really is everything: Our first recommendation gained 95% in less than four months.)That doesn't mean there will never be a time to buy Lyft, Uber or both. I hated Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in its early years -- I want to see a company start making money. Now it's in much better shape, and I expect it to remain a technology giant for years and years to come.As we watch Lyft and Uber, we are much better off investing in companies that will supply the next-generation robo-taxis. Rather than trying to pick the winner of the industry, we can make money off the companies that will benefit no matter what.I've recommended several such companies to my Investment Opportunities subscribers. The most recent came just two weeks ago, so I can't give you all of the details here. I can say it is a big player in supplying computer chips for autonomous vehicles, and it is already up about 20%!The disruption of this industry is just now beginning. It will lead to trillions of dollars moving from the old to the new. Smart investors will make the right moves now and ride as much of the coming wave as possible.As autonomous vehicles go mainstream, I'm absolutely convinced their adoption will pay off for early investors at incredible rates of speed. If you can claim a small stake in the companies developing this technology now, you could benefit from one of the rarest, most powerful economic forces in history.I've spent hundreds of hours analyzing the industry, and you can get all my research on this mega-trend -- including the absolute best AV stocks to own today for big profits tomorrow -- by clicking here to learn more.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-04-02,"The beaten-up and out-of-favor automobile sector is one of the main sectors that is currently being overlooked by value investors. But passing on automobile stocks here could prove to be a mistake.Despite extremely compelling valuations (price-to-earnings multiples in the single digits), attractive dividend yields and numerous turnaround business plans in place, many car stocks are at such big discounts now that any catalyst -- small or big -- could lead to massive rewards for investors.The selloff in automobile stocks accelerated in the summer of 2018 and reached peak selling by November 2018. Although these stocks eventually regained buying momentum, they pulled back again in March as macro worries returned to markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: A Close Race at the Front The lack of a trade deal between the U.S. and China did not scare markets as a whole, as the S&P 500 rose by 14% in the first quarter. But automobile stocks were left behind. With that in mind, here are five car stocks to buy now: Ford (F)Source: Shutterstock Ford (NYSE:F) rallied over 5.5% on the week, despite lacking any noteworthy headlines. But if you take a closer look at F stock, you'll notice some promising opportunities.The recent rally took F stock's P/E back to 10X for the first time in months and income investors will like F stock for its 6.7% dividend yield.Investors have largely ignored its partnership with Volkswagon (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) which may prove a big mistake. VW plans to spend $11 billion restructuring its business and $50 billion for developing electric vehicles and self-driving cars by 2023. By partnering with VW, Ford becomes an EV play, but its stock is not as expensive as some of its competitors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has a forward P/E of 32X. Ford shares trade at a forward P/E of 6.7X.Investors who pay more attention to F stock again will enjoy the company's $160 billion in annual sales, $3.55 billion in income and book value of $9.06 a share.However, there are a few risks to owning this well-known car stock. Ford has historically underperformed other big automobile stocks and it has consistently traded at valuations below that of its peers. The stock needs sentiment to change before multiples expand and the stock price increases. General Motors (GM)Source: Shutterstock General Motors (NYSE:GM) is another standout among automobile stocks. Specifically, GM stock has risen 23.6% from its 52-week low, and offers a 4% dividend yield and at a P/E of 6.6X.GM stock took a hit on the chin after the company made headlines for its decision to cut costs in a massive layoff that ended the production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its assembly plant in Ohio.GM has to close several of its American plants because many of its plants are running with only one shift but need two shifts to be profitable. But as gloomy as this may seem, after years of competition, GM may no longer run its production at a loss.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business Furthermore, on the global expansion front, GM will introduce 20 new and refreshed models in China. The company knows that to compete effectively in the region, it needs an optimal product mix that includes new product designs and technology offerings. GM may introduce new technologies to its vehicles, such as vehicle-to-everything communications and Super Cruise. If its competitors offer nothing close to that, GM has a chance to grow market share. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU)Source: Shutterstock Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) might seem like the weakest company on this list of car stocks to buy, but much of the perceived weakness in FCAU stock is because shares have unwinded from a takeover premium.FCAU stock is down 37.6% from its 52-week highs, bringing its dividend yield to an attractive 4.9% and granting the company a P/E of 6.6X.Similar to GM, Fiat is also cutting factory jobs.On March 28, the company said it would cut 1,500 jobs at a plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The decision will reduce its minivan output, which is likely a response to lackluster sales performance in this area.On the bright side, the company added 6,500 jobs to expand its Jeep production. Strong demand for SUVs could be a tailwind for Fiat. Its next-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee and an all-new, full-size SUV with three rows could offset falling Fiat, Chrysler and Dodge sales. In February, Jeep sales actually fell 4%, while Chrysler sales fell 36%. Meanwhile, Ram sales rose 24%. Toyota (TM)Source: Shutterstock Hovering near its 52-week low, Toyota (NYSE:TM) trades at a similar P/E multiple to that of F stock at 10.3X.TM stock is in a bit of a downtrend because its U.S. sales are weak. In February, unit sales fell overall, led by Camry sales falling 21% and Prius sales down 48%. Mind you, the Prius is a smaller part of total sales. Corolla, Land Cruiser and Highlander sales grew in February.In a move that may please the U.S. President, Toyota increased the value of its 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years in the U.S. It will now commit around $13 billion in that time to make the RAV4 and Lexus ES 300h hybrids in Kentucky.Increasing production in the U.S. instead of in Mexico will help diminish tariff risks for Toyota. And its joint venture with Mazda (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) to build another plant in the U.S. will add $1.4 billion in investments and create 4,000 jobs in Huntsville, Alabama.  * 7 China ETFs to Consider Right Now Another potential catalyst for TM stock is that Toyota said it would bring back the Supra. This move may signal the company's confidence in winning market share in the two-door sports car market. While sales of Lexus and Toyota automobiles grow steadily, adding a nostalgic sports car back into the mix is a symbol of confidence for the company. In this business, it's a bold move to bring back a previously retired model, but also one that can pay off handsomely. Honda (HMC)Source: Shutterstock Honda (NYSE:HMC) is deeply discounted with a P/E of 7.5X and a dividend yield of 3.6%. Although it recently announced it will recall around 1 million vehicles with dangerous airbags, the last quarterly earnings report showed many areas of strength.Honda reported a historical record for sales of light trucks in 2018. Likewise, Acura RDX, Pilot and CR-V sales set a new calendar year record. It has an all-new Passport release for this year. And in the EV front, its Everus VE-1 is a mass-production EV that also holds great promise.Although Honda expects its operating profits to fall by 5.2%, the company did not indicate any change to its dividend policy in its forecast. The company forecast that most weakness will come from the North American market. For investors looking to diversify outside of the U.S. market, HMC stock provides geographically diverse exposure to Japan and other Asian markets.With strong profit growth in Asia and profits expected to go up in North America despite lower sales, investors should consider HMC stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau held shares of Ford.

2019-04-03,"The era of car ownership is over. For the past fifty years, the American dream has included putting a car in every garage, with the goal of equipping every individual with modern transportation. But, modern transportation is rapidly evolving, and that means the American dream is rapidly changing, too.The goal is still to equip everyone with modern transportation. But, personal car ownership isn't the only means of achieving that goal anymore. Now, thanks to technological advancements, smartphone proliferation and the rapid rise of ride-hailing (or ride-booking) services, Americans don't need a car to get around anymore. Instead, they can rely on ride-hailing and car-booking services for nearly all of their transportation demands.That is largely why car ownership rates have plateaued around 91% of American households for the past decade, versus a trend of consistent car ownership rate increases over the prior half-century.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis shift in trend is still in its early stages. Ride-hailing is only growing in popularity and access. Technology is only getting better at improving consumer outcomes in the ride-hailing space. The need to own a car is becoming smaller and smaller. Populations are becoming increasingly urban-centric. Personal car ownership costs are only rising, as are the traffic delay problems associated with having too many cars on the road.Consequently, it increasingly appears like we are in the early stages of a secular decline in car ownership rates. That's a big deal. For the past fifty-plus years, the trend in car ownership rates has been up. For the next fifty-plus years, the trend will be down. The financial implications of this unprecedented pivot are huge.  * 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally How can investors best play this trend? Let's take a closer look at three potential trades to play the huge car ownership rate reversal trend over the next several years: Trades to Play the End of Car Ownership: Long Ride-Hailing CompaniesSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER)The most obvious way to play a secular decline in car ownership rates is to buy the stocks of the companies directly responsible for this trend shift. That includes freshly public ride-hailing company Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), and its larger, soon-to-be-public peer Uber.Broadly speaking, these two companies are pioneering what is known as the TaaS, or Transportation-as-a-Service, market in North America. At scale, the TaaS market is supposed to make owning a car antiquated, much like the SaaS market made owning on-premise software antiquated, through providing a wide variety of transportation services via an army of drivers to the masses. Importantly, Uber and Lyft are the only two relevant players in this market, and together control 98% of the U.S. ride-hailing market.Right now, this market comprises providing car transportation services for humans trying to get from point A to point B. Naturally, as car ownership rates fall, reliance upon and usage of these services will grow by leaps and bounds. But, that's just the tip of the iceberg with respect to what Uber and Lyft can do with an army of drivers and programmers. They can tap into logistics (delivering packages from point A to point B) and last mile transportation (scooters and bikes), among other things.Thus, the aggregate opportunity for Lyft and Uber over the next several years as car ownership rates drop is immense, and competition outside of these two giants is essentially zero. That's why buying LYFT and Uber stocks for the long run makes sense. Short Traditional Auto GiantsSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Sell: General Motors (GM), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU)Another obvious way to play a secular decline in car ownership rates over the next several years is to short the traditional automotive manufacturing sector, since the biggest tailwind which has supported robust growth across this industry over the past half-century (rising car ownership rates) is about to turn into a headwind (falling car ownership rates).Over the past half century, the percentage of no car households in the U.S. has dropped from above 20% to below 10%. But, over the past decade or so, the percentage of no car households has plateaued around 9%, and is actually showing signs of starting to move higher. The implication of lower household car ownership rates means lower total vehicle sales in the U.S. We are already seeing this. Although car sales have bounced back from the Recession, total vehicle sales per capita remain well off where they were for most of the 2000s.Further, traditional auto giants like General Motors (NYSE:GM), Honda (NYSE:HMC), Toyota (NYSE:TM), and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) are facing stiff competition from new electric vehicle entrants like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As the EV trend continues to gain traction over the next several years, this competition will only get stiffer, and traditional auto giants will lose more market share.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises   Click to EnlargeAll in all, the outlook for traditional auto giants isn't great. For the most part, these are companies that are losing market share in a shrinking auto market. That's a bad combination, meaning that short traditional auto stocks could be a good trade over the next several years as car ownership rates drop. Long Ride-Booking Related CompaniesSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: GrubHub (GRUB), Postmates (POSTM), Doordash (DOORD)A less obvious way to play a forthcoming car ownership rate reversal trend is to buy the group of stocks that provide ride-booking related services that will see higher demand in a world with lower car ownership rates.Broadly, this is the class of stocks that provide ride-hailing services in logistics and includes GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and soon-to-be-public companies like Postmates and DoorDash. As car ownership rates drop, and less and less consumers own a car, they will rely more heavily not just on Uber and Lyft's ride-booking services, but also on GrubHub and DoorDash's delivery services, too. Consequently, a drop in car ownership rates provides a healthy usage tailwind for these delivery-focused stocks.Further, much like ride sharing, delivery is in the first inning of a massive growth narrative. According to Morgan Stanley numbers, gross food sales in the U.S. restaurant industry measured around $220 billion in 2017, and the digital delivery penetration rate was just 7%. That's very low. In the home goods sector, the online sales penetration rate is 13%. In apparel and consumer electronics, it's right around 30%. Thus, the runway for growth through further gains in digital penetration is quite long.Overall, online delivery stocks are big winners if/when car ownership rates start dropping over the next several years.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TSLA and GRUB and may initiate a long position in LYFT within the next 72 hours.

If you're still keen on trading Nio stock, however, I'll show you how to use the options market to squeeze profits from NIO.Source: Shutterstock It even took bids away from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock.Nio's epic rally lasted only six days, marking an epic double top on Nio's stock chart. Soon, shares collapsed by 50%, setting a new all-time low below $5 per share …InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt was a perfect storm of a disappointing earnings report and an overzealous bunch of retail investors. What made it worse is that this also coincided with a lockup expiration. The setting was perfect to transfer the risk from original investors into the retail hands.I came into 2019 long NIO stock by selling the July $5 put. In essence, I had committed to buying the shares at that level if the price were to breach below it. I have since changed my mind.On the way down, I expected the selling to abate around $6.50. Yet, it fell through it like butter, so I assumed I was missing a piece of the puzzle. I booked my partial profits and I'm thrilled that I did!This was a low conviction trade because I am unsure of its fundamentals for the long-term. I considered it a tactical trade and I didn't want to turn it into an investment. So now what?Unless investors know the industry and the company inside and out, Nio stock still remains a better trading vehicle than an investment.First of all, I am not convinced that the electric car will replace the internal combustion engines -- at least not for a long while. Electric vehicles remain inefficient, and the infrastructure to support the ubiquity of electric cars is still in its infancy.Then there is the matter of subsidies. It seems that every couple of months we hear of some subsidy expiring, thereby affecting the trade. Now there is the matter of competition and not the one from Tesla. The mega-auto manufacturers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) are slated to unleash a herd of new electric vehicles in the near future. These are competitors whom Nio should fear. Why? They have deep pockets and the infrastructure to scale. How to Trade Nio StockSo from a trading perspective and for the short-term investors seem to so far be ignoring the competition aspect of risks in NIO. The most recent stock crash happened because of a perfect setup for failure. The 60 minute bit hit just before the company released its earnings. So it came into the event up huge, which makes it impossible to rally off the news.At that point, management needed to hit a home run on all fronts and they didn't. The report missed the mark and broken expectations make for a broken stock. This puts the bulls on their heels as they remount the next effort. The onus will remain on them to break the lower-high trend that started from the first week of its public life.So is NIO stock a good buy here? The answer depends on investor time frame. If I believe in the industry and specifically in this company then yes, it's a buy. Because the incremental selling came from events that are no longer here.But if I am looking to tactically trade it I could consider reselling a similar put like I had to generate income. Or I would chase the stock as it breaks through bullish trigger lines.The first one comes at $5.75. This will be a hot zone where bulls will face resistance. This was a recent ledge from which NIO fell to its lows. The next level is about $1 higher, which is also another recent accident scene that brought a %25 dip from it. Above those two levels, there are many others but we'd have to take them as prices near them for better context.Meanwhile, NIO will need the help of the general markets and a deal with China on tariff could also go a long way. Otherwise, it would need to fight both its own negative price action and the market-wide tide.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The automaker, which recently stopped selling most of its sedans and small cars in the U.S., has re-entered the hybrid market and introduced a plug-in model on one of its more popular vehicles.Source:  Barbara Eckstein via FlickrThis brings Ford closer to peers who have moved ahead of the company in the development of hybrids and electrics. It could also serve as the spark needed to again interest investors. The Ford EscapeOn April 2 Ford debuted its 2020 model Ford Escape. It will offer both a hybrid model and a plug-in version of its SUV. The plug-in model will achieve a full charge on a Level 2 charger in around 3.5 hours.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises Also, the company has &quot;targeted&quot; a range of about 30 miles for electric-powered driving. Ford also plans to introduce an all-electric SUV-crossover model that they claim holds a range of 370 miles. However, the company released few details on this specific vehicle.Still, we do know that this returns the Escape Hybrid to the market after Ford introduced it in one generation and discontinued hybrids in the next. It also brings Ford into an EV market where it has lagged peers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), GM (NYSE:GM), and Toyota (NYSE:TM).Hopefully, the stock will also benefit. One of the many headwinds facing F stock involves falling behind in the EV market. Now, with the 2020 Ford Escape, it addresses at least one of the critical challenges facing the company. The Dividend and Ford StockStill, a key question revolves around how investors will react. The Ford stock price has risen steadily since December. However, at around $9 per share, it has only just begun to increase from its lowest levels since just after the financial crisis.It also leaves its forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio at 6.7. Analysts predict an average earnings growth rate of only 3.8% per year over the next five years.F stock has not traded at an average PE ratio higher than 12 over the last ten years. Consequently, I do not expect Ford to achieve high multiples anytime soon. However, the average PE over the previous five years has come in at 9.85. Analysts project earnings of $1.19 per share for this year. This would imply a price of $11.72 per share.Reaching that price would take the equity higher by about 30% from current levels. InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango discounts future earnings and projects a 2019 price target of $11 per share. Hence, two different approaches yield the same result--Ford should trade higher.Moreover, even if the company's EV rollout does not move Ford stock, investors will still reap one key benefit--dividends. Ford's current annual dividend of 60 cents per share yields almost 6.7%. Admittedly, Ford has shown a history of adjusting the payout based on current cash flows.The dividend has fallen from a high of 85 cents per share in 2016. Still, if Ford's EVs or its popular line of trucks increases profits, I expect this payout will rise over time. Final Thoughts on Ford stockInvestors now wonder if the move into EVs will stimulate Ford. Since Ford will offer hybrid and plug-in models on the Escape, the company has addressed an area where it lags behind its peers. But will this help F stock?Ford has risen in recent weeks. Still, despite a 6.7 forward multiple and an almost 6.7% dividend yield, F stock remains cheap. Company financials indicate that Ford should reach $11 per share. Moreover, even if rising to that price takes time, investors benefit from a generous payout which Ford can afford.Hence, between the multiple and the payout, Ford is a win-win whether or not EVs recharge its stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-05,"In the intense battleground that is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), both bulls and bears can claim a win this week. Tesla stock plunged Thursday on poor Q1 delivery numbers. But TSLA stock may well rally on Friday after a courtroom win for CEO Elon Musk.Source: OnInnovation via Flickr Musk was in court after the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) alleged he violated a settlement by using Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to deliver material information. But Judge Alison Nathan sent both Musk and the SEC away without an answer, instead giving the two parties two weeks to work out a new agreement. Given there were legitimate fears of a possible ban on Musk serving as a director or officer of Tesla, the news looks like a win for the embattled CEO. But the news on Wednesday is much more important to Tesla stock than what came on Thursday. A D&O ban was highly unlikely. In the wake of the &quot;funding secured&quot; debacle, few investors trust Musk's Twitter timeline as a reliable source of information anyhow.The delivery numbers, however, raise real concerns. Tesla's growth story is in real question, and with a market cap still at $46 billion, that's the bigger problem for Tesla stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Musk EscapesMusk's courtroom appearance on Thursday looks like a win. For one, the renegotiated settlement seems likely -- at worst -- to just be a reiteration of the original deal, perhaps with more specifics. Musk already has said he doesn't &quot;respect the SEC&quot; -- and may well violate that agreement again. But in the meantime, there should be little change for Tesla.  * 3 Reasons This Marijuana Stock Stands Out From the Pack More importantly, the SEC told Judge Nathan that it wasn't looking to remove Musk as CEO, anyway. Rather, its attorneys asked for &quot;escalating fines&quot; should Musk continue to violate the agreement.Any bears expecting Musk's removal -- or suspension -- from Tesla are likely disappointed. But given the long-running management issues here, some bulls may be disappointed as well. After the last few months, with a series of unforced errors and a steady stream of executive exits, more than a few shareholders likely wouldn't mind if Musk stepped down -- or had more help. Deliveries Send TSLA Stock DownStill, for the most part, the SEC news doesn't much change the case for, or against, Tesla stock. As even shorts have pointed out, the Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) settlement proved that regulators don't want to risk taking companies down by punishing executives. And while Musk may be the creative genius behind Tesla, execution has been lacking of late.The deliveries number, however, can't be ignored. Tesla delivered just 63,000 cars in the quarter -- down 31% against Q4 figures. That's a huge problem for a company supposedly dominating the EV market. And a company that -- according to Musk (and many TSLA bulls) -- has had more demand than it could serve.Tesla did note that it had some 10,000 cars in transit at the end of the quarter. And it reaffirmed guidance for full-year deliveries of 360,000-400,000. Investorplace's Luke Lango pointed to those facts in arguing that the numbers don't break the bull case for TSLA stock. But I respectfully disagree.First, Tesla had nearly 3,000 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter before this one -- which means that fact aside, deliveries still dropped sharply. Secondly, the quarter significantly increases the likelihood of a capital raise.Tesla is going to burn operating cash in the quarter. It repaid its $920 million convertible debt in cash on March 1. It has to fund part of the new Gigafactory in Shanghai. The company wrote in its release that it had &quot;sufficient cash on hand&quot; at the end of the quarter. The question is: sufficient for what? The Core Problem for Tesla StockIn a way, the events of Wednesday and Thursday highlight the short case for Tesla stock -- a case I've put my own money behind. There is so much noise about short &quot;FUD&quot; and Musk's mission and the myriad allegations of impropriety or, occasionally, outright fraud. The SEC battle feeds into all of that.But the underlying problem with TSLA stock is more simple and more fundamental. At its core, the bull case for TSLA is based on the idea that the company will be the most effective automobile manufacturer in modern history.Its gross margin targets of 25% for the Model 3 are well above those of U.S. rivals Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), and even Japanese giant Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM). Its long-term revenue growth is based on maintaining its obvious market share lead in electric vehicles. As Musk himself has pointed out on many occasions, automobile manufacturing is a brutally difficult business and to support a $50 billion-plus valuation (and thus upside for Tesla stock), Tesla has to do it better than anyone else. The Short Case for TSLATesla is not doing that. It is not coming close. Musk said the company was building its own car carriers -- it then acquired a trucking company last month. Deliveries just tumbled -- including a 50%+ drop in the Model S and Model X, which are Tesla's more profitable cars.If Tesla isn't more efficient than its rivals, TSLA stock is overvalued. It's that simple. Meanwhile, the Q1 numbers are a sign that demand might not be what Tesla thought it was -- and the huge end of quarter scramble to serve overseas markets suggests significant logistics improvements are needed.  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio None of those risks look priced into Tesla stock right now. And it's those problems that drive the real short case here -- not complaints about what Elon Musk said on Twitter.As of this writing, Vince Martin is short Tesla through a hedged put option position.

2019-05-14,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Owning Nio NYSE NIO stock has not been easy on investors Getting into NIO is a speculative challenging thesis But as they say no guts no glory what is hard now may become great reward later,Nio Stock Below $5 Is a Long-Term Opportunity
2019-05-14,"Owning Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock has not been easy on investors. Getting into NIO is a speculative, challenging thesis. But as they say, no guts no glory -- what is hard now may become great reward later.Source: Shutterstock Fundamentally this is a startup company so for now value is not its forte. It sell at 6.6 times sales which is three times more expensive than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).In March, NIO stock collapsed soon after it appeared in a special report on 60 Minutes.  That sparked an influx of Main Street investors who piled into the stock only to set it up for the perfect failure that followed. So in early April, I wrote about the opportunity to trade it but only if it took out $5.75 per share, which it never did. So is it now the better time trade it it. Yes, but the answer is more complicated than that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe TV show caused the stock to spike in March to $10, only to deflate and fall back to the breakout level and below. So NIO now sits 55% lower than in the glow of the 60 Minute exuberance and more than 70% below its all-time highs.Clearly this is a broken stock for now. But the verdict about the company also being broken won't come for long while.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk So investing in it cannot be time sensitive -- the success of it will need time to unfold. Electric vehicles are gaining momentum but are still far from ubiquity and are way behind the internal combustion engines. This is a complicated process, as it requires establishing the support infrastructure even with the great headway there so far.Tesla did most of the heavy lifting so that Companies like NIO and even the giant manufacturers like General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F) and even Volkswagen can simply walk through the door that Elon opened. Be Patient in NIO StockPatience is a virtue for Nio investors and they probably are shocked to see new all time lows with it trading below its initial day of public life. But that is the price we pay when we bet on speculation. I don't mean that it's punishment, these are the ups and downs that go hand in hand with betting on the next new thing: e-cars.Last year, NIO probably stole bids from TSLA when headlines broke out about the Saudi Arabia Fund being interested in NIO. This was the direct result of the infamous Elon Musk tweet of funding secured.Clearly Nio stock had its moments, as it came out of the gate like a race horse. But it quickly faded, and within a month it had broken below $6 per share. It did put in great efforts to regain momentum, but the breakout from $8 per share failed in December. This perhaps was bad timing, as the whole stock market was in a sharp correction at the time.Nevertheless, NIO fell back into prior support. The TV bit gave it another shot in the arm to try for the breakout, and this one went farther. Unfortunately for the bulls, investors hated the March earnings report. The stock fell off a cliff, and here it is sitting on new all time lows.Technically, there is little to discern from the chart with regards to support since this is literally off the charts. But going long here can be justified for two groups.First, investors who believe in the global adoption of the e-car movement. They buy NIO here and assume that it will be one of the winners for the very long term. Or second, traders who are looking to profit shorter term from a miraculous bounce to prior levels. These tactical trades are tricky since there are few downside clues. They can easily turn a trade into an investment without proper management.Assuming the stock will start rising again, there will be resistance at $4.40, $4.55, $4.70. There are many other resistance line above those but it's only fair to let the bulls prove themselves capable of recovering the $5 line first before looking at higher levels for now.In summary, Nio has the opportunity to be a winner of the electric car movement for the long term. But this thesis will require patience and intestinal fortitude to see red before green -- pun intended. As for the tactical trade, there are better tickers for that.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-15,"Two hours west of London, at an abandoned Royal Air Force base, a major electric car initiative has begun… by none other than Dyson.Most of you know Dyson for its vacuums, hand dryers and fans. But I, for one, have been waiting for its electric vehicle (EV) for years -- ever since it made a key acquisition that I'll get to in a moment.Then in November, we found out that Dyson will build an auto plant in Singapore. All in all, Dyson is looking to invest $2.7 billion in EVs. Now, at the old Hullavington airfield, the company will research and test its EV prototypes right at home in the UK.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the EV field is currently dominated by the usual players -- the United States, Germany, Japan, and now China -- Britain is looking to get in on the action as well. In fact, it wants to go 100% electric: The UK is considering a moratorium on new cars with gas or diesel engines. (Norway already made that call, and France, Germany, India, and China are mulling it over, too.)2040 is the most likely date for Britain to go all-electric, while 2035 is a possibility, and 2030 is what Sir James Dyson is pushing.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Dyson's electric car sounds just as sleek and high-tech as you'd expect. And it plans to deliver it as soon as 2021. While the model is still in development, Dyson's initial patent images (like the one above) show:  * An SUV-crossover design, with three rows of seating  * Lower-than-normal seating, for better aerodynamics  * Narrower/taller wheels… both of which would boost its driving range.Range is crucial to any EV maker -- and especially one that also aspires to make its flagship products (the fancy vacuum cleaners) powered 100% by battery.In 2015, Dyson acquired a Michigan startup that was working on next-generation batteries. They've since parted ways, but nonetheless, we've known since 2017 that Dyson is eager to get in on the new technology.For a vacuum cleaner, strong battery power that allows for cordless design is a nice convenience. For an electric car, a strong battery is a must. You can afford to finish vacuuming later, but you can't afford to be stuck on the side of the road -- and you can't afford to spend all day charging the thing either.Lithium-ion batteries have been the standard since the 1980s, believe it or not, when Sony started putting them in its camcorders. After they made it into Apple's iPhone in 2007, the rest was history. But the next generation of batteries will solve two major problems:* Lithium-ion batteries rely on materials like cobalt… which is mined from conflict zones (mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo) that are struggling to keep up with demand.* And the liquid inside is not only toxic - but also flammable. In 2016, the battery in Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 was exploding. You couldn't bring the phone on a flight. And smoking, flaming, or exploding batteries have caused a few hundred other incidents in airplanes, too. In just five years (from 2012 to 2017), 49 batteries were recalled in products ranging from laptops to power tools.No company wants that. And the current leaders in automotives are dedicating serious cash to solving the problem.BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) is shopping around for a supplier of next-generation batteries for its electric car, the i3. Others, like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), are looking to develop their own. Rumor has it that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is, too, after it acquired a battery startup in February.All of this revolves around one specific technology that's safer AND more powerful. Some call it the &quot;Jesus Battery&quot; because, compared to the old lithium-ion technology, this battery is nothing short of miraculous. The Key to Cashing In on the Battery RevolutionAs an investor, there's one thing I particularly like to see when I buy into a tech trend: patents.Dyson doesn't just have the smooth-talking billionaire CEO you see in its TV commercials. It has a number of impressive patents across its business. The electric SUV-crossover is just the latest -- and surely not the last.And when it comes to the &quot;Jesus Battery,&quot; one tiny company in southeast England holds some key patents.Automakers like Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) are relying on this company for its electric car models. Yet the company is totally off the radar - for now.So, you'll want to check this out before everyone else starts rushing in. I've got a full presentation on the investment opportunity in this &quot;Jesus Battery,&quot; which you can view for free by clicking here.Insiders are already calling this potential new battery a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in energy technology. Forbes calls it simply: &quot;The battery that could change the world.&quot;This breakthrough device could change how you get around… how you communicate with others… even the way you think about the world.Folks who get in on this breakthrough now, BEFORE it's rolled out on a mass scale, will have the chance to be a part of perhaps the single largest wealth-creation event in the last 25 years.I can share with you what I've learned and show you how to profit.

If you get emotional, that's your responsibility.Source:  Barbara Eckstein via FlickrLet's talk about why F stock has garnered significant interest lately. Since the start of this year, Ford stock has gained 32%, which is remarkable.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal But  auto sales have flatlined for the last four years. Additionally, ride-share services like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) have transformed personal transportation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt also doesn't help that millennials just don't care for buying cars as previous generations did when they were young. Millennials are growing up at a time when multiple, private transportation options exist. However, it's also true that young Americans are comparatively financially strapped.If they're going to buy a car, they need a reliable one. That hurts Ford because it's not the most reliable automaker. That leads me to the first of my many unpleasant points: American Cars Stink, and So Will Ford StockI just have to say it: American cars are terrible. Over the past several years, Detroit has promised it would compete effectively against the Japanese and Germans. I still remember Chrysler's &quot;Imported from Detroit&quot; tagline. It was a clever, catchy piece of marketing genius.Unfortunately, it was also pure nonsense. Part of the appeal of owning an American car is that, well, it's American. Back in my high school days, our principal said that it's important to buy American cars to support our economy. But it's equally critical for domestic manufacturers to compete overseas.I'm sure my principal's sentiment was repeated across the nation.  The fact that people have to resort to patriotism to tout American automakers , though, indicates that American cars can't compete on quality, reliability or attributes. Americans Reject Their Own CarsF stock and American cars in general are emblematic of this great nation's many problems. They appeal to folks on a superficial basis, but are very weak when it comes to fundamentals.Look at the politicians who supposedly &quot;serve&quot; their constituents. How many of them personally drive American cars when the cameras aren't looking?  Probably very few.Exhibit A is President Donald J. Trump. As a tall, rich, (arguably) good-looking white man with a sharp tongue, he obviously appeals to the  patriotic crowd. Today, he &quot;drives&quot; an American car because he has to.But when he was just &quot;The Donald,&quot; he didn't seem to care too much for domestic rides. Remember that episode of The Apprentice when he showed up in an exotic Mercedes-Benz sports car? How quickly we forget that, at one point, Trump's most-prized automotive possessions were a Rolls-Royce and a Lamborghini Diablo!Why, then, should I buy an American car when my own President doesn't even exclusively buy American cars? Hard Numbers Condemn F StockIf you got through all that without cursing, congratulations! You probably dismissed my arguments against Ford stock as subjective reasoning. But now, we're going to get into the numbers.Honestly, they just don't look good for F stock. The last time its quarterly revenue hit a peak was in June 2007. At that time, sales slightly exceeded $44.2 billion. Since then, the automaker has failed to equal that haul, despite our supposedly robust economic recovery.Compare the malaise of Ford Motor Company stock to its fierce rival, Toyota (NYSE:TM). From an automotive perspective, I'm not a big fan of TM, either. I find their cars intractably boring. But as a business and an investment, it's doing pretty well, despite the shortcomings of its products.Toyota's quarterly revenue peaked in March 2012, with a haul of just under $72 billion.Its top line has been declining ever since. The difference, though, is that TM is climbing back. Toyotas have broad appeal in Japan, the U.S., and Latin America. With its Lexus luxury brand, it's also capturing some snobby Europeans.Ford is doing what it does best: give up. With that kind of loser's mentality, I just can't trust Ford stock for the long haul. Even a Tailwind for Ford Motor Company Stock Is Dying!Don't think that I'm completely biased against Ford stock. The one area where it excels is big, heavy trucks. In that area, Detroit is currently untouchable.Sadly, though, this market is fading. Sales of heavyweight trucks last peaked in 2006, shortly before the housing and banking crises.I'm not sure if the segment will ever regain its prior peak.

2019-05-30,"You don't have to be an athlete to recognize that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is one of America's top brands. Ordinarily, such a lofty distinction will put you in a great position in the markets. Unfortunately, two critical headwinds threaten to derail the party. NKE stock closed down almost 3% yesterday.Source:  Kristian Olsen Via UnsplashFirst, we have competitive jitters clouding the overall athletic-apparel industry. Segment retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), which up until mid-April had a solid showing in 2019 absorbed a nasty tumble. After releasing results for the first quarter that missed both earnings and revenue expectations, FL stock tanked 16%.Of course, Foot Locker is highly dependent on Nike, with the iconic shoemaker accounting for roughly two-thirds of sales. In turn, Nike is shifting toward online sales and direct retail channels, which obviously hurts FL stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the broader takeaway is that the American consumer is cutting back on discretionary spending. After all, Foot Locker had a strong showing for Q4, including much better-than-expected same-store sales. Therefore, the curbing of spending habits will invariably hit NKE stock.But the bigger headwind impacting Nike stock and the entire athletic-apparel segment is the bitter U.S.-China trade war. Nike's management team, along with their rival counterpart Under Armour (NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) and other shoe retailers, urged President Trump to back down.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement The reason of course is obvious. If you have a slowdown in sales at home, China's emergent economy and billion-plus consumer base represents an easy solution. But with Trump's fierce rhetoric causing an equally outraged response, the Chinese are in no mood to play ball.Although I like NKE stock based on its fiscal stability and segment domination, geopolitics must be respected. Protracted Trade Dispute Threatens Nike StockHere's the thing: if the world's top two economies can settle their differences now, we're back to the natural order. Nike stock jumps on powerful Chinese demand, and a stabilizing North American base.But what's the likelihood of that scenario? Given recent political and international headlines, I believe the current signs bode poorly for NKE stock.Over the past weekend, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe played the charm offensive toward President Trump. The reason? To get Trump to listen to reason regarding the White House's &quot;shotgun&quot; tariffs. Specifically, the President threatens to penalize both Japan and the European Union unless they renegotiate supposedly unfavorable trade deals.Japanese auto giant Toyota (NYSE:TM) responded incredulously, citing their massive investments toward American infrastructures and jobs. In my opinion, they're right to be outraged. A true capitalist businessman would understand that competition breeds superior offerings for consumers.Besides, Detroit has had at least four decades to improve their craft. It's not Toyota's fault that they stink.But the bigger takeaway as it relates to NKE stock is Trump's mentality. Apparently, he has zero qualms about hurting regions that are net accretive to U.S. economic interests. How much more will he aggressively attack China, which is very much our ideological adversary?Admittedly, it's not all bad news for Nike stock. The underlying company is gaining ground in China. Moreover, management views the Asian juggernaut as a largely untapped opportunity. Plus, the average Chinese consumer loves American brands.However, that demand faces threats because Nike doesn't have a monopoly in athletic fashion. Principal rival Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) has also gained significant momentum with Chinese millennials, particularly with its Yeezy brand.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer Clearly, this reignited conflict is coming at the worst possible time for Nike stock. Technical Posture for NKE Stock also a Bad OmenI realize that even among InvestorPlace contributors, a debate rages between the technical and fundamental approaches. Granted, some of the assertions from technical analysts are a bit on the wonky side.But I also think real value exists when both the fundamentals and technicals confirm the same narrative. Fundamentally, the U.S. consumer market has notably weakened, sending FL stock into the dumpster. However, hybrid producer/retailers like NKE don't have a Chinese emergency valve anymore. That obviously hurts the case for Nike stock.And its technical chart gives you all the information you need to know. After hitting a peak this year in the second half of April, Nike stock is conspicuously pensive. It's roughly the same situation for American athletic-apparel makers.But the obvious winner in this mix is the decidedly not American Adidas. ADDYY shares have soared 38% year-to-date. Arguably, Adidas has better reach with Chinese consumers. On the other hand, Nike is losing its grip with both American and Chinese customers. Combined, these are good reasons to stay cautious on NKE stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-04,"InvestorPlace readers may know that I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese stocks. Although in certain cases this segment provides upside, more often than not, the longer-term picture remains questionable. Such is the case with Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturer Nio (NYSE:NIO). Within a half-year period, NIO stock rudely transitioned from Wall Street heartthrob to persona non grata.Source: Shutterstock Earlier this year, I took a negative view on NIO, juxtaposing its introduction with the now-defunct DeLorean Motor Company. Both companies produced visually stunning cars designed to appeal to the mass consumer market. However, both upstarts suffered credibility issues that eventually reached the bottom line. Things got so bad for DeLorean that the brand and the man behind it fell ignominiously from grace. At least his car was immortalized by Hollywood.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Admittedly, that sounds like a &quot;click-baity&quot; thing to say. As our own Tom Taulli mentioned, China enjoys the largest EV market in the world. Plus, this segment has grown impressively in recent years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet Taulli remains cautious on Nio stock for good reason: mere size doesn't directly translate to higher performance. Otherwise, Michigan would always win the national championship.Put another way, NIO isn't taking advantage of its home market. Since June 2018, the company sold 15,000 units of its flagship ES8 SUV, according to Quartz contributor Echo Huang. However, that's only 1% of China's EV sales. Seems like NIO has lost the EV roadmap.So while EV may be robust in China, NIO isn't eating much of that pie. That hurts the longer-term outlook for the Nio stock price. But another factor, science, can kill it. EVs Are the Future … of the FutureWhen you watch as much YouTube as I do, you come across some conspiracy theories. One of my favorites is this: J.P. Morgan -- the man, not the bank -- secretly knew that EVs were inherently superior to steam and fossil-fuel alternatives. However, he wanted to profit from the scarcity fear. Thus was born the petroleum-fueled cars we mostly enjoy today.But like most conspiracies, sound and reasonable explanations exist, too. In this case, the combustion engine probably won out because it was the most effective platform in most circumstances. Subsequently, this is a history lesson that might sting the Nio stock price.I say that because it's already hurting Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Back when I was bullish on TSLA, I praised the company for developing great-looking cars that ran on electricity. On the other hand, Toyota's (NYSE:TM) Prius is just sad.But that's just one superficial component that Tesla addressed. It's most important contribution to EVs is range. That assuaged consumer fears and many jumped on board.However, these same drivers are coming across another underappreciated problem. You see, EV batteries have tight thermal tolerances for peak performance, typically between 60 to 80 degrees; in other words, San Diego weather.For you poor souls who don't live in San Diego, you're going to suffer inefficient batteries that take longer to charge during the winter. In some states, that means your Tesla will be somewhat useless for a quarter of the year.Tesla owners are finding this and other temperature-related inconveniences out the hard way. So, too, will NIO owners, and that's why I'm not big on NIO stock.Bear in mind that many parts of China experience bitterly cold winters. Once word spreads about EV inefficiencies, the negativity will cut the practical market for NIO stock. Cost Structure Doesn't Work for Nio StockTesla and EV bulls will counter my pessimism, stating that scientists are working on longer-term solutions for temperature-sensitive batteries. Right now, serious research is occurring to develop solid-state batteries. These don't have liquid inside, so they're much more adaptable to outside conditions.Great. We still have two problems. First, this research is very much laboratory research. Therefore, we might have to wait a decade before companies implement them in the automotive market. Second, and more importantly, how much will a solid-state battery going to cost?  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault I'm no expert but I'm guessing quite a bit. This segues into the terrible financial situation for NIO. The company is stretched widely, essentially requiring a government bailout. Still, here's the ugly reality. Even if NIO fixed their internal dilemmas, they must address scientific challenges.As things currently stand, EVs are desirable prima donnas. They save the environment, but they're expensive and inconsistent anywhere but San Diego. Obviously, NIO can eventually address this challenge with solid-state batteries. But then they have to raise the price of their cars and kill margins which are already on life support.To sum up, NIO stock has internal and industrial headwinds. We haven't even talked about the damage to China that the trade war will inflict. From all angles, this just looks like a losing bet.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-10,"In the classic Twilight Zone episode To Serve Man, space aliens descend upon earth, bringing with them advanced technologies. With worldwide prosperity achieved thanks to these extraterrestrial innovations, sovereign states destroyed all their weaponry. The aliens earned the earthlings' trust through their book entitled, &quot;To Serve Man.&quot; Similarly, a genius named Elon Musk gave investors Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and TSLA stock.Source: Shutterstock Like the fictional aliens, Musk gave consumers something they've never seen before. In our case, it was electric vehicles that didn't stink. Previous electric or hybrid vehicles appealed only to drivers who were strictly focused on technical statistics and efficiencies. They certainly didn't appeal to customers who wanted to look good in their new rides.When it broke out, TSLA was like a breath of fresh air. The company first rolled out an EV roadster, then sedans and SUVs. They were -- and still are -- sleek and sexy machines. It's no wonder Tesla stock jumped the way it did a few years back.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut like the Twilight Zone episode, not everything was well. When the aliens offered the earthlings apparently free travel to their homeland, people jumped on the opportunity en masse. There finally was a way for humans to break out of their mold.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets There was just one problem: &quot;To Serve Man&quot; was a cookbook!Of course, I'm not suggesting that Elon Musk is a cannibal: he's high but he's not that high. But he committed a similar action. Tesla EVs are gorgeous cars that perform well under the right circumstances. But in anything less than an ideal environment, EVs quickly lose their appeal.And I believe now that this vulnerability will undermine TSLA stock. The Core Product for TSLA Stock Is Fundamentally FlawedPrior to Musk ensnaring himself in unnecessary troubles and controversies, I was bullish on Tesla stock. Sure, the company has always had its critics who frequently complained about rising debt and that awful cash burn. But eventually, I thought that the power of the TSLA brand -- specifically, its EVs and innovative technologies -- would right the ship.Frankly, I was wrong. EVs, whether from Tesla, Toyota (NYSE:TM) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), won't work, at least for some time. They're inherently flawed, only truly serving the interests of the wealthy and geographically privileged. Living in San Diego, I was naturally fixated on the tree and not on the raging forest fire.Whether you want to buy TSLA stock or a Tesla car, you desperately need to know something: EVs only perform to advertised specs in ideal conditions. If temperatures hit either hot or cold extremes, your battery capacity (and thus, your range) will drop considerably.During last winter's unusual chill, EV owners reported a 50% reduction in range.That's not a statistic you should take lightly. How would you feel if your car's gas mileage absorbed a 50% haircut because it was raining outside? This is exactly the reason why I'm avoiding Chinese EV-maker Nio (NYSE:NIO).But the worst part is that nothing economically practical in the nearer term can be done about this issue. When EVs drive in hot weather, their range also declines, especially if the driver cranks up the air conditioning. That's because the EV battery must provide all the primary and secondary power needs.Eventually, Tesla will figure out this problem and improve efficiencies, perhaps with solid-state batteries. But such innovations will take time, a luxury that TSLA stock does not have. Dependency on Mass Appeal Hurts Tesla StockRange Rovers and Maseratis are among the most beautiful cars on the road. They're also some of the least-reliable offerings. Yet they remain desirable because of their consumer base. Essentially, the people who buy such cars can also afford their problems.I probably wouldn't be that alarmed if Tesla stock was levered strictly to their original customer profile: rich yuppies. A recent academic study pointed out that the average EV owner has a household income of $140,000. These are folks that don't care about capacity reduction because they probably don't drive that much. And they probably live in a southern Californian paradise.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 But Tesla isn't in the business to move Maseratis. They made a huge deal about the Model 3, their affordable EV for the masses. Thus, the TSLA stock price moved on rumors and news about Model 3 production stats.Here's my question: What happens to those new owners who didn't anticipate the EV platform's quirks and issues? After all, not everyone lives in southern California. Certainly, not everyone makes $140,000 a year.And while Tesla and other EV makers crank away at these issues, the old internal-combustion engine is still making strides. I'll bet that many disappointed Model 3 owners will revert to traditional cars. When that happens, it might be lights out for TSLA stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thousands will try to get rich quick -- but only a select few who play it smart will make a fortune.I've been covering electric cars for a year…and now every car maker in the world is racing to catch up.In the last month alone:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Subaru (OTCMKTS:FUJHY) announced its first EV, in partnership with Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM).  * So did Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY). In Britain, Jaguar Land Rover is working on them, too.  * Even Dyson is getting in on the action.  * But some of the most ambitious, futuristic plans are coming from China, where Enovate is working on a true &quot;Tesla Killer.&quot;For my money, Toyota's the one to watch. Because it's laser-focused on what's most important: the battery.Why are people eager to buy electric cars? They're sleeker, cleaner, and require way less maintenance. That's all thanks to the battery-powered motor.Right now, electric vehicles are powered by a larger version of what's in your cellphone and laptop: the lithium-ion battery. But by upgrading to next-generation battery technology, Toyota's EVs will run on batteries that are more compact - but way more powerful… and safer, too.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 For the Japanese market, Toyota has designed an ultra-compact EV. And with these new batteries, which eliminate the liquid electrolyte, much of the bulk disappears.Take a look at the picture below. The front hood of the car literally disappears!And an electric car has got to be just as convenient as gas. The internal-combustion engine may be 100-year-old technology, but it'll go for about 300 miles on a tank. With this battery, you could get DOUBLE the range after just 15 minutes of charging.Plus, since you don't need the liquid electrolyte, the batteries aren't flammable. Remember the problems with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7? If you tried to bring the phone on an airplane, the flight attendants would confiscate it because the lithium-ion batteries had started catching fire. In early 2018, HP had to recall 50,000 laptops for a similar reason.But next-generation batteries don't have that fire risk. In one memorable test, a startup called Ionic Materials shot its battery with a Remington .22. It took three bullets, did not catch fire, and kept working!So you can see why Toyota is running full-tilt toward this goal. In a briefing last Friday, Toyota executive Shigeki Terashi said he wants to unveil the new batteries &quot;by the time we have the Olympic games&quot; in Tokyo next July. He knows that with everything we'll be asking the battery to do, the current lithium-ion technology just won't cut it. We need safer, longer-lasting batteries.Toyota is just one major player in a &quot;battery cartel&quot; of sorts that's sprung up in Japan. The government is working directly with researchers, automakers, and other big names like Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) to get this particular new technology to market.That's only one example of why we, as investors, need to find a pure play on the battery revolution. Invest Where &quot;Big Auto&quot; is Dropping Major CashI'm a big believer in &quot;picks and shovels&quot; investing. And that's because, if you look back at the 1849 Gold Rush, most of the prospectors ended up broke - but the guys who sold them their picks and shovels got rich. One German immigrant did even better by selling work pants made of a new, more durable material. His name was Levi Strauss… and, still today, we all wear blue jeans.With any big trend, you always want to look at the suppliers. Electric cars are no exception. Therefore, at Investment Opportunities, I'm recommending companies that supply these next-generation batteries.Japan may be the current favorite to mass-produce them - but one tiny company in the United Kingdom holds a few of the key patents. Toyota is relying on it for electric cars… yet I'm willing to bet you've never heard of it.I've got a full presentation on the investment opportunity in this new technology - nicknamed the &quot;Jesus Battery.&quot;Find out exactly what makes this battery so miraculous here.Insiders are already calling this potential new battery a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in energy technology. Forbes calls it simply: &quot;The battery that could change the world.&quot;For early investors, this presents the kind of moneymaking opportunity that could turn a tiny initial stake into an absolute fortune.Folks who get in on this breakthrough now, BEFORE it's rolled out on a mass scale, will have the chance to be a part of perhaps the single largest legal creation of wealth in the last 25 years.I can share with you what I've learned and show you how to profit.

2019-06-21,"Woe to those who left Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) for dead. After almost two years of an extended trend downward, SNAP stock has revitalized itself and turned a corner.Source: Shutterstock There was a time when investors who were long SNAP stock were embarrassed to discuss this holding publicly, as so much disdain was held for this particular tech stock. There were a series of missteps in the early days that led to SNAP stock price plummeting shortly after its IPO pop. User growth deceleration, a voting structure that was very unfriendly to shareholders, issues with its Android app, and subsequent executive departures all contributed to SNAP stock price dropping more than 50% and trading down to $5 a share.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 But those same owners of Snapchat stock are the ones standing tall now. SNAP stock price is up over 165% this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe shares have been on a huge run, rivaling the performance of recent IPOs. With a number of new services including Snap Games and original premium content directed specifically at mobile-device users, it looks like the best is yet to come for Snapchat stock. Where SNAP Is NowWith 190 million Daily Active Users (DAUs), it would be a mistake to dismiss SNAP as a fad. The user base skews quite young, but that highly targeted audience is the proverbial nectar for the bees that are advertisers.Snapchat reaches 90% of all 13-24 year-olds and 75% of all 13-34 year-olds in the U.S.Even though SNAP has a disadvantage to the likes of Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) in terms of advertising capabilities, that has changed markedly with the improvement of its interface and incremental technological upgrades.SNAP has successfully upgraded and enhanced its Ads Manager to make it more friendly to marketers. Features like target- cost bidding, bulk uploading capabilities, bulk editing and cloning, and the expansion of location categories to the U.K., Canada, and France are all major steps that will ultimately improve its top line. Additionally, its Reach & Frequency product now allows for one-day ad buys (the previous minimum was three) and has similarly undergone geographic expansion.These are all extremely positive signs.An example from SNAP's first-quarter earnings conference call shows that the company is attracting huge advertisers:&quot;Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) ran a sophisticated campaign across our various video and AR products to promote the Corolla Hatchback among Millennials. Snapchatters engaged with the ads, watching more than 90% of their Commercials on average, and playing with their Lenses for more than 10 seconds each on average.&quot; SNAP's New Products Will Drive MonetizationThere is a lot of potential in the new slate of Snap Originals, the company's premium, mobile shows created exclusively for Snapchat's audience. SNAP now offers more than 450 premium content channels worldwide and in the first quarter, launched over 50 new Shows and Publisher Stories in international markets.The premium content and  Snap Games will continue to bring users back to the platform, increasing their stickiness and making SNAP more than just a camera-centric company. More importantly, new products mean new monetization opportunities e.g., video advertising. The Bottom Line on SNAP StockA lot of people, especially those over 30, are still inclined to dismiss SNAP as a fad for youngsters. However, there are pockets of value within a company that has worked through a lot of its initial missteps.There is so much room to monetize SNAP's captive and targeted user base, and it looks like the company is finally showing signs of doing so by improving both the product side and the advertising platform. Those trends will definitely be positive for SNAP stock.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any of the stocks named.

2019-06-24,"No matter where you stand on the automotive spectrum -- foreign or domestic -- the industry itself is undergoing significant changes. Unfortunately for General Motors (NYSE:GM), a lot of the changes aren't beneficial for GM stock. Although shares are up 14.5% year-to-date -- compared to a 10.4% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the company faces strong headwinds.Source: Shutterstock Now, another distraction threatens to disrupt the General Motors stock price. For the fourth straight year, GM is appealing to federal oversight agencies to avoid recalling their cars due to deadly Takata air bag inflators. While the sentiment is certainly understandable -- no one wants to deal with such massive liabilities -- this move is risky.Here's the reality with the automotive industry: no one manufacturer is perfect. The paragon of reliability, Toyota (NYSE:TM), has incurred several high-profile recalls that detracted from its hard-earned image. And Japanese companies in general have a reputation for quality, but again, this is not a 100% accurate pronouncement. After all, Takata is a Japanese company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal But evidence exists that consumers (and investors) are willing to forgive these defects, so long as companies take responsibility quickly. According to Zacks, major recalls don't necessarily spell doom for automakers. That's the good news for GM stock.The not-so-pleasant news for the General Motors stock price is that consumers expect action and accountability. In 2014, GM recalled vehicles that suffered from an ignition-switch defect. Initially, management stalled for time. Eventually, though, the company cleaned house at the highest level. They also set up a $675 million victims-compensation fund.GM stock recovered relatively quickly from the scandal, probably in no small part to the strong compensatory measures. But with these Takata air bags, GM is going in reverse. Self-Imposed Race Against Time Hurts GM StockI'm not seeing the upside for either the automaker or the General Motors stock price. The public already knows about the problem as Takata air bags have dominated the headlines for years now. By avoiding the issue, GM saves some costs today, but risks bankrupting its tomorrow.Moreover, the pressure is two-fold. First, Takata used a volatile chemical to catalyze the air bag-deployment process. However, high humidity and hot temperatures can cause the chemical to deteriorate. Potentially, this results in shrapnel exploding inside the cabin during a deployment, severely injuring or killing drivers and passengers.Obviously, the passage of time -- more instances of heat and humidity -- don't help matters. GM footdragging on this crisis could hurt its reputation, sinking GM stock.The second pressure point is Takata. Having incurred more liabilities than is possible to pay back, Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. But rather than a complete dismantling of the organization, the dissolution will occur in stages.That gives time for Takata to help support liability cases and assist the recall process which benefits General Motors stock. However, the underlying company must act quickly to advantage Takata's support.Eventually, all of this reaches a conclusion. After that, Takata will not exist, and that means zero support from that point forward.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half From the consumer's perspective, that doesn't really matter. Affected automakers have an obligation to repair their Takata-air bag equipped vehicles. But some problems may not become apparent until years down the line, well after Takata is gone. Then, automakers will have to repair their cars without Takata's critical input. That's a huge risk for GM stock, which hasn't gone anywhere since the fall of 2017. Recalls a Kick in the Teeth for General Motors StockStill, I concede one reason why management seeks its recall exemption: the air bag crisis directly impacts GM's flagship vehicles.If the company didn't appeal, the recall would affect multiple variants of the Chevrolet Silverado, along with this year's GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickup truck. Additionally, air bag risks exist with certain years of Chevy Tahoe and Suburban SUVs, along with GMC Yukons and Cadillac Escalade SUVs.In other words, we're talking about the big money makers for GM stock. American cars have all but given up making sedans, having lost too much ground to Japanese automakers. Where domestic cars remain relevant is with big trucks and SUVs.That's why it's absolutely vital for GM to protect their image here. If they start sending out recall requests to millions of owners, they might not get return business.However, it's still the wrong play. GM already learned its lesson with the ignition-switch defect: get right with the public or face its wrath. That they're blatantly ignoring past mistakes makes me concerned about General Motors stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-24,"Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has had a long and unsuccessful run on the capital markets. Plug stock started trading in 1998 around $120 per share (split-adjusted) and ran up to as high as $1,500 per share over the next couple of years.But the price collapsed shortly thereafter and has never recovered. Shares dropped under $10 in 2008, and PLUG stock would fall to as low as 13 cents earlier this decade. In 2014, PLUG stock briefly spiked to $10, but that rally failed as well and shares are back down to $2 now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is a classic sort of boom and bust trading pattern of many small NASDAQ companies. They labor on for many years, hoping to commercialize some new or improved technology with limited success.Plug Power fits the mold. It has been able to generate a fair amount of revenue over the years. But it has never reached a point of achieving consistent profits; in general, its margins have been too low for the business to ever take off.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019  Huge Ongoing LossesDespite scaling up its revenues dramatically, there is little evidence that Plug Power is about to become a viable profitable business. From 2013 to 2018, Plug Power has increased its revenues from $25 million to $175 million. Gross profit, however, only flipped from a small loss to a gain of $2.6 million in 2018.Normally, if revenues go up sevenfold, you'd expect it to do more for your profit margins. Making $2.6 million in profit on your goods sold off of $175 million is rather lackluster.The company spends about $40 million per year on overhead. On top of that, it is spending around $30 million per year on R&D. Thus, while it only makes a gross profit of less than $3 million, it has more than $70 million in other costs that it has to fund each year to keep the business operating and competitive.Throw in more expenses, such as interest on the company's rising debt load, and annual losses approach $100 million per year. This figure has been spiking upward recently, even as revenues have gone up dramatically.As such, there's simply not much evidence that Plug Power's current business model is anywhere close to a trajectory needed to eventually become a solid business for PLUG stock owners. Hydrogen Still Is an Issue for Plug PowerThere are niche markets where hydrogen fuel cells are already practical products with viable use cases. But much of the enthusiasm for this sort of stock comes from the idea that hydrogen is going to go mainstream. Some folks, such as the people who publish Capitalist Exploits suggest that hydrogen is about to take off.They say hydrogen stocks will boom over the next five to ten years and investors have to get in now before the market surges.I don't buy their argument. If you read the full report, much of it is about the potential for future hydrogen fuel cell usage in mass markets such as transportation vehicles. But this market has already existed, to a limited extent, for the past decade and is showing little sign of reaching an inflection point now.If anything, electric vehicles are making it harder for hydrogen to take off. How many alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles is the market going to support at once?It's worth considering that we've seen this movie before. A decade ago, billionaire Boone Pickens heavily pushed natural gas-powered vehicles. The Clean Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) company was a multi-billion market cap outfit that intended to take natural gas cars mainstream. It didn't work out, however. Despite natural gas fuel being both cheaper and cleaner than gasoline, the savings weren't sufficient to cause a mass shift.Hydrogen faces many more obstacles than natural gas did in trying to go mainstream. Hydrogen is more dangerous - see this station blowing up recently, for example, which led Toyota (NYSE:TM) to stop selling its hydrogen models. Stations using hydrogen cost much more to build than gas stations or electric charging facilities. And outside of a few markets like California, there isn't enough hydrogen infrastructure in place. PLUG stock could get a big boost if hydrogen vehicles get popular. But I'd bet heavily that they won't over the next few years. PLUG Stock VerdictCompetitor FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) got rid of its CEO and hired a restructuring firm earlier this month. That strongly implies the possibility that FuelCell will be going bankrupt shortly. That's even with them announcing a new deal with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) recently. FCEL stock is down to 22 cents, and has lost 99% of its value over the past year.FuelCell's collapse has served as another reminder of the difficulty of taking hydrogen mainstream. There's a huge difference between having a cool technology that works in a lab, and having something that you can sell in the mass market profitably.Now, Plug Power isn't about to follow FuelCell's path. At least not yet. Plug Power's market cap is still over $500 million, meaning that it has plenty of ability to keep issuing new shares to fund its ongoing losses. Still, one must wonder how long the market will keep tolerating Plug Power's unending string of massive cash burn.After twenty years on the public markets, it's increasingly hard to think that the company's business model will ever turn into a significant success for its shareholders.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned XOM stock.

2019-07-08,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has gone through all of the market cycles. As shares went from $20 to $60, many investors thought it was too much too fast (aka: doubt). Then Nvidia stock eclipsed $100 and as the euphoria phase took hold, NVDA stock was close to $300. Source: Shutterstock However, that multi-year surge came to an abrupt end in the fourth quarter of 2018. It didn't help that the Nasdaq was crushed (falling about 20% from peak to trough in less than three months) because of Nvidia's connection to cryptocurrencies. Never mind that Nvidia is so much more than just crypto. But at this point in time, it set up the perfect storm to absolutely crush this high-quality company. So with that in mind, let's take a much deeper dive into Nvidia stock to see if it's something investors should consider at current prices.  Crypto and Nvidia StockBitcoin exploded back onto the scene in 2017. Prices went from sub-$1,000 in March to more than $18,000 by year end. That type of explosive performance drew in retail and institutional investors from around the world. But its lull hurt more than just crypto investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 In order to &quot;mine&quot; cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, miners needed powerful computer systems. Specifically, they needed graphic chips from companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Astute speculators connected the dots that Nvidia's management was either not on the ball with who its actual buyers were or they were not honest with its investors. For the record, I do not believe CEO Jensen Huang & Co. were intentionally dishonest with their investors. Although not being in touch enough to realize that crypto-miners were the real buyers for its graphic chips and not hardcore gamers isn't exactly a compliment. Where was the confusion?   Nvidia made crypto-specific chips for miners, separate from the chips intended for gamers. So when bitcoin prices peaked in December 2017 and trended lower throughout 2018, it became more expensive to mine bitcoin than to sell bitcoin. Therefore, miners stopped buying Nvidia's crypto-specific chips and Nvidia thought they were okay from a revenue perspective. However, management failed to account for miners buying chips that were intended for gaming but used for mining. Not only did the demand drop-off create a huge deficit in sales, but it also crimped profits, margins and inventory for multiple quarters. The company is still trying to recover from the fallout.  Future of Technology and Nvidia Stock  If you've never watched one of Nvidia's keynote presentations at its GTC events, you're really missing out. I've been fortunate enough to actually attend GTC in the past, so seeing them live really instills a sense of what Nvidia is working on, but they can still be viewed online. They're usually lengthy, but worth it. (Here's the keynote from GTC DC, which is only an hour long). The company's products play a vital role in the future of technology. Simply put, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data storage, robotics, cloud computing and processing power is changing the way we do everything. Almost everything that is done today has hard data, whether that's in autonomous driving, healthcare, ecommerce, agriculture, social media, you name it. In many cases, the data is growing and becoming even more specific. That not only creates demand for storage, but it also creates the need for A.I. to help sort it. Without machines, humans could never parse through this much data effectively. Not only would humans fail to sort this much data at the rate it's growing, but they wouldn't make sense of it, either. A.I. can connect the seemingly random dots into a logical pattern, paving the way to thousands, if not millions of efficiencies. Artificial intelligence applies computers to do the heavy lifting in a number of circumstances. Companies like Nvidia help power these applications, greatly increasing the efficiency. That efficiency relates to both the time it takes and how much power the application is consuming. Nvidia's GPUs are vastly superior to its CPU counterparts, and because Nvidia makes the best GPUs, it is a go-to supplier for top tech companies. Need some examples? There are plenty.  AI and Nvidia Stock  Take healthcare, an area that I am extremely optimistic about when it comes to implementing artificial intelligence. A radiologist could see 8,000 images in a day. Sometimes the abnormalities they're looking for are easy to spot, like a broken bone. Other times they can be very difficult. But say we could use an A.I. application to whittle down that list to 1,000 images or 500 images in a day. That not only makes the radiologist's job easier but improves their accuracy as well.That's not to mention the fact that Nvidia's GPUs can vastly improve image quality as well. Artificial intelligence applications go beyond medical imaging and radiology though. It leverages its power for genomics and bioinformatics, pathology and computational biology, and other fields. Turning to agriculture, A.I. can be used to drastically cut down costs and boost crop yield. For instance, rather than blanketing the entire farm in harmful pesticides, farmers can use machines equipped with A.I. cameras to determine what's a weed and what's a plant. When it's a weed, the machine can specifically target it with pesticide, resulting in a 90% reduction in pesticide use and giving a 10% boost to crop yields. Autonomous drones can be used on farms as well, surveying large areas of land to determine what may need more or less of something (such as water). Autonomous drones help other companies too; oil rig operators for example. By using cameras to determine potential areas that need repair before major damage occurs, rig operators not only improve their inspection time by 25% but also reduce their maintenance costs by 25%.    Last but not least, A.I. plays a huge role in social media and e-commerce. I dislike ads as much as the next guys. But when they're tailored to my tastes, hobbies and recent searches, they are much more relevant to me. We're going to be served ads and services, so they may as well be applicable. A.I. is also used to connect people, ideas, services and products that are related to the specific user, their purchases, location and other factors. No matter what the industry, A.I. is being used to improve efficiency and that's a big benefit to a number of different parties. We need to be careful with A.I., which is still in its infancy and has a long way to go. That bodes well for a company like NVDA, which is powering this technological revolution. Autonomous Driving and Nvidia StockEarlier I mentioned that I had previously attended Nvidia's GTC events. I was there for the purpose of autonomous driving and seeing what the company was doing within the industry now. Further, I have met with Nvidia's Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive, numerous times, ranging from auto shows to autonomous driving conferences. It's allowed me to glean a lot of information on the industry and specifically what Nvidia is up to. Many investors and consumers don't believe autonomous driving solutions will be here anytime soon. Admittedly, it will be some time before a car is capable of driving in any condition in any location completely on its own. But just as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo has shown, self-driving functions aren't all that far away; they're here right now!The progress Nvidia's making in this industry is very important. It's not just making GPUs or chips that can power an autonomous robo-taxi. The company's building an entire suite dedicated to the success of autonomous driving and it will succeed for two very simple reasons. The first? The industry of autonomous driving will succeed. There's simply too many lives at stake and too much money. Roughly 40,000 people die per year in the U.S. alone from auto-related accidents. An estimated 94% of those accidents occur due to human error. The second reason Nvidia will succeed with autonomous driving? An even simpler answer than the first: It makes the best products.  Building a Suite for Autonomous Driving ProductsIts suite includes everything that an automaker would need. Its Drive IX product allows for artificial intelligence in the cockpit. Mercedes-Benz began using Nvidia to power its new MBUX infotainment system in its A-Class and now drivers can find it throughout Mercedes' line up. The Drive IX can do more than just be your A.I.-driving assistant though. With eye-tracking, head position and gaze tracking, and facial and gesture recognition, it can incorporate tons of data into the driving experience.   For instance, does the driver turning left through an intersection see the oncoming car from the side? The vehicle can know now and it will be a building block in the future. The Drive AB2X allows for level 2 driving capabilities. These types of features still require a human driver, but incorporate safety features like lane-tracking, emergency braking, self-parking, etc. These features may not get the love that the fully autonomous fantasy gets, but they are an important building block, as is the previously mentioned Drive IX. That's the tip of the iceberg. Drive Pegasus is an incredibly powerful piece of equipment, allowing a vehicle to become a fully autonomous driving machine. Its power consumption is reasonable considering that it's capable of generating 320 trillion operations per second. That generates a ton of data though, doesn't it? It does, especially when testing an entire fleeting for hours at a time over the course of months and years. That's exactly what car companies are forced to do, if they want to solve the automation puzzle.   It's also why Nvidia recently announced its SuperPOD product. The SuperPOD is now one of the world's top 25 supercomputers and can be set up in roughly three weeks. That's compared to six to nine months for similar systems. And for those wondering, 22 of the world's 25 most powerful supercomputers are powered by Nvidia's GPUs, just to give a sense of what type of high-quality company we're talking about. Last but certainly not least is Nvidia's Drive Constellation. This product is perhaps my favorite given its level of safety and efficiency. It's costly, difficult, time-consuming and potentially dangerous to test an autonomous vehicle out on the open road. By using a simulation, companies can cut down all of those &quot;expenses&quot; and drastically improve their efficiency. Explained simply, Constellation operates as a &quot;hardware in the loop&quot; system. One server runs a synthetic environment in virtual reality, where the tester can make an almost unlimited number of scenarios. Rain, snow, sleet or sun, in the desert or on the coast, during the day, at night or at sunset; it doesn't matter. Rather than waiting for the perfect opportunity to test in potentially rare conditions, i.e. with the sun setting at the perfectly uncomfortable angle that can last for just a few minutes, even in optimal testing environments, we can run it on a simulator. The second server runs Nvidia's Drive Pegasus, which reacts to the simulated VR scenario exactly how it would in real life. You can see why Constellation is such a promising product. Just earlier this year, Nvidia announced that Constellation is now commercially available.  Nvidia Stock and Autonomous PartnershipsThe announcement for Constellation's availability came alongside an announcement that Nvidia is partnering with Toyota's (NYSE:TM) Research Institute-Advanced Development in Japan and Toyota Research Institute in the United States. It has continuously upped its partnership with Daimler's (OTCMKTS:DDAIF) Mercedes as well, either for Robo-taxis or supercomputing vehicles. Further, Nvidia just announced its deepest partnership yet, with Volvo trucks. The company is &quot;using the NVIDIA DRIVE end-to-end autonomous driving platform to train, test and deploy self-driving AI vehicles, targeting public transport, freight transport, refuse and recycling collection, construction, mining, forestry and more.&quot;Daimler is working on autonomous trucking solutions as well. It wouldn't surprise me one bit to see those ambitions being powered by Nvidia (although it's not yet announced). Nor would it surprise me to see autonomous driving functions in Mercedes' current consumer vehicles being powered by Nvidia given the work the two companies are doing on an autonomous robo-taxi service.  Only time will tell, but more partnerships are likely down the road as we get closer to making autonomous driving a reality.  Trade War Implications and Nvidia StockComing into May, the trade war had nearly faded to an afterthought. The U.S. and China seemed like they were on a path to an agreement and that all would end well. At the start of May, an unexpected tweet from the President sent shockwaves through the market, as it became clear the two countries were not as close as it had been perceived. Nvidia stock went on to shed almost 25% in just one month after that. A decline was to be expected, but losing a quarter of its value in just a few weeks was unreasonable. That's even as Nvidia generates a fair amount of revenue from China and while the trade war is unkind to semiconductor companies in general. At the G20 summit in June, President Xi and President Trump met to get talks back on track. While there was no trade agreement, none was expected. Instead, there will not be an escalation in tariffs and the U.S. ban on Huawei will be lifted. That initially gave a nice lift to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) and others. However, that newly-found optimism was quickly swatted back to reality. Economist Peter Navarro, who currently serves as the assistant to the president, and director of trade and manufacturing policy, provided a bit more insight into the so-called unbanning of Huawei on CNBC. In a nutshell, he said the ban on low-tech components would be lifted, which is good for names like MU, SWKS and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO).     However, where does that leave proprietary, high-tech components? That leaves names like Broadcom, Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and others in limbo to some degree. Nvidia took a hit with some of its peers, as investors try to sift out what this means for each company's top and bottom line. At the end of the day, the trade war will drive the narrative for many semiconductor stocks. Whether it's fair or not doesn't matter. In the short to intermediate term, these headlines will matter and make life more difficult for companies like NVDA. But as long as talks don't disintegrate, this group may be able to resist the urge to plunge lower.  Mellanox Deal's Implications for Nvidia StockIn March, Nvidia announced that it will acquire Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) for $125 per share. The all-cash deal valued MLNX at roughly $6.9 billion, with management expecting the deal to close by the end of the year. Of course, that's dependent on China too. Many investors will recall that when the trade war was still in its infancy, Chinese regulators went mum on the Qualcomm-NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) deal. Qualcomm's attempt to buy NXPI was a great deal but took forever to get approval. It secured approval from every party but China, a country that simply didn't say anything about the deal. Eventually, the two companies parted ways and that was that. The fear for Nvidia is that China will oppose the deal or pull another mime treatment. The hope is that, with recent progress made on the trade front and with the U.S. lifting some of its bans on Huawei, Chinese regulators will bless the NVDA-MLNX deal. Will Nvidia survive without Mellanox? Of course. But the deal is a good one for Nvidia. Should it close on the deal, management expects that MLNX will immediately be accretive to earnings and free cash flow. An earnings boost is nice, but increasing free cash flow is even better. Further, management expects the deal to be accretive to gross margins. Increasing profits, increasing profitability, and increasing free cash flow? Yeah, investors want this deal to go through. Not only that, but MLNX will help cement NVDA in the data center, helping build out one of its strongest business segments. From Nvidia's press release: &quot;With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize datacenter-scale workloads across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating cost for customers.&quot;From Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: &quot;We're excited to unite NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform with Mellanox's world-renowned accelerated networking platform under one roof to create next-generation datacenter-scale computing solutions.&quot; Valuing Nvidia Stock Price  For the year, consensus expectations call for earnings of $5.23 per share on revenue of $10.98 billion. Assuming in-line results, this would represent a year-over-year decline of ~20% and 6.2%, respectively.   That's as the company works through some short- and intermediate-term headwinds. The trade war has caused some issues, as has the crypto hangover. As a result, it's made NVDA stock seem quite expensive at 30.8 times current earnings. Who wants to pay 30 times earnings for a company that's experiencing a top- and bottom-line thumping? Investors are banking on the company recovering in the second half. If it doesn't, then we may have to start calling management's judgment into question. But if they do recover, my guess is that investors will flock back to this stock because Nvidia is without a doubt a best-in-breed company. Best of breeds command a premium valuation and for good reason: they have premium products. If estimates are right, Nvidia will see revenue surge almost 20% next fiscal year to $13.14 billion, driving a 33% boost in earnings to $7.11 per share.  NVDA Valuation vs. PeersHow does that stack up to its competition? Let's have a look:   '19 Rev Growth '20 Rev Growth '19 EPS Growth '20 EPS Growth P/E fP/E P/S NVDA -6.2% 20% -20% 33% 30.8 23 9.1 INTC -3.3% 4% -7% 5% 11.25 10.7 3.1 AMD 6.1% 22% 41.3% 57% 46.5 29.7 4.8 Above we have a look at earnings and revenue growth estimates for this year and next year, as well as a few valuation metrics. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) lacks any real attractiveness here, at least from a growth perspective. It's true that it has an attractive dividend yield of 2.6% compared to its peers, but its growth is simply disappointing. AMD has a great growth profile as it turns free cash flow positive and cleans up its balance sheet. AMD has a long runway for success, but it simply doesn't make the same caliber of product as Nvidia.  Trading Nvidia Stock  Click to EnlargeAbove is a daily chart of Nvidia stock. We can see how hard shares faded despite the positive G20 summit news. With Nvidia stock starting to pull back, it's giving investors anticlimactic price action following what should be a more favorable operating environment. In any regard, bulls will now want to see the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) hold as support. Should it fail and Nvidia stock falls below $155, a drop back down to recent range support may be in the cards. That comes into play near $132, and can also be seen on the weekly chart below.   Click to EnlargeThe $190 price is proving to be resistance (noticeable on both charts) while support sits down in the low-$130s. However, on the weekly chart investors will also notice the 200-week moving average. I would expect this moving average to act as significant support should Nvidia stock price fail to hold above its 50-day moving average. Further, the 10-week moving average is near $158. If NVDA stock can hold above this area, $155 to $158, and better yet, bounce on a potential test, we could see a retest of upper resistance. On a rally, we need to see if Nvidia can push through the 50-week moving average currently at $187. Further, we need to see if it can get above $190 to $192, which was resistance throughout April. If it can, $200+ is possible, with upside targets of $208 and $228 on the table. Those prices represent the 50% and 61.8% retracement for the one-year range.

2019-07-12,"(Bloomberg) -- A long history of failed automotive mergers and tie-ups -- from Daimler-Chrysler, to GM-Fiat and BMW-Rover -- used to be reason to doubt that combinations or partnerships between big carmakers were a good idea.But as the world’s biggest manufacturers anticipate an age of increasingly electric, autonomous and shared vehicles, they’re increasingly becoming bedfellows.Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co. have scheduled a press conference in New York on Friday after months of talks about joining forces to develop self-driving and electric vehicles. Aligning with one another in the burgeoning fields would build on an existing partnership to work together on commercial vans and trucks.The expanding alliance between the world’s No. 1 and America’s No. 2 car companies is only the latest example of the auto industry giants joining forces to cope with the transformation sweeping their industry. The transition is going to be costly: Since 2010, more than $14 billion has been invested in autonomy and mobility technologies, according to BloombergNEF.“BMW and Daimler are pairing up and matching up on their autonomous-vehicle program, as are Toyota and Uber, and you’ve seen GM and Honda, and now VW and Ford,” said Mike Ramsey, an automotive consultant at Gartner Inc. “That leaves Hyundai and Kia hunting around desperately for partners. And then the remainder, like FCA and PSA.”Here’s a rundown of some of the most noteworthy tie-ups of the last few years among the world’s leading automakers:BMW-Daimler DealsBMW AG and Daimler AG vowed earlier this month to team up on developing cars capable of traversing highways without human intervention starting in 2024. While drivers will remain behind the wheel, the companies said their vehicles will be able to navigate highways and park on their own.The luxury-auto arch rivals also agreed to pour more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) into the car-sharing and ride-hailing businesses they combined to form one joint venture earlier this year to compete with the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc.Fiat’s Renault FlirtationFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- already an Italian-American amalgam -- pursued a merger with Renault SA earlier this year, though the potential deal abruptly collapsed last month due to the French state’s intervention and concern about the implications for Renault’s existing alliance with Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.Still, it may be too soon to write off the idea. Renault and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire have said talks with Fiat Chrysler could resume once the Renault-Nissan alliance is on firmer footing. Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann told Italian newspaper La Stampa this week called the attempt to merge with Renault an “act of courage.”BMW’s Other BlocsNearly two years before Fiat Chrysler’s merger proposal with Renault, the company entered a coalition led by BMW that’s creating an autonomous-vehicle platform slated to be launched in 2021. Other members of the collaboration include Intel Corp., Aptiv Plc, Continental AG and Magna International Inc.And that’s not all for BMW. Jaguar Land Rover announced in June it will team up with the German automaker to work on its fifth generation of electric-drive technology, which is set to roll out next year with an electric X3 crossover.Daimler Joining GeelyDaimler decided earlier this year to transform Smart, its struggling small-car division, into an all-electric brand rooted in China with the help of its largest shareholder, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.The two groups also agreed last October to enter China’s ride-hailing and car-sharing business by forming a 50-50 venture. They plan to levereage models including the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and E-Class and the ultra-luxury brand Maybach to battle market leader Didi Chuxing.Honda Hitching RidesEven Honda Motor Co. has pivoted from the go-it-alone approach that it stuck to for decades. The Japanese automaker joined an existing venture between Toyota Motor Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp. earlier this year.Last fall, Honda committed to investing $2.75 billion in General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving unit. The two already were working together on electric-vehicle batteries and hydrogen fuel cell systems.Toyota’s Electric-Car CooperationToyota, whose battery-powered RAV4 partnership with Tesla Inc. ended up being a short-lived clash of polar-opposite business cultures, entered another electric-vehicle alliance in 2017 with Mazda Motor Corp.Months after announcing the Mazda pact, Toyota added Suzuki Motor Corp. to the mix, with the two saying they plan to bring electric vehicles to China and India beginning in 2020. And in June, Toyota added Subaru Corp. to its stable of EV partners.&#92;--With assistance from Keith Naughton.To contact the reporter on this story: Kyle Lahucik in Southfield at klahucik3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",VW-Ford Alliance Expansion Shows Carmaker Partnerships Are Here to Stay

2019-07-25,"If you're looking for a speculative bet on a well-known company, few names fit that bill more so than General Electric (NYSE:GE). Over the past few years, I have twice been dazzled and disgusted with GE stock. In other words, I've had some success with calling shares correctly, but I'll freely admit to some failures as well.Source: Shutterstock In my last article about General Electric stock, I gave a fairly comprehensive look at the bull and bear case. Ultimately, I concluded that shares presented a risky but compelling opportunity. With a healthy mix of both tailwinds and headwinds, GE comes down to market sentiment. For the last several months, the trajectory has been mostly flat. Thus, the bad news might be baked in.But here's the worrisome part from a technical perspective. GE stock is up 44% year-to-date. However, since late February, shares haven't moved much. Thus, a very real possibility exists that the bears will punish this pensive price action. We have already witnessed hefty losses in 2017 and 2018. No one would be surprised if the equity dropped further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season That said, General Electric stock is roughly only a third of its January 2017 market value. It's hard for me to imagine a repeat bout of such intense volatility without some fresh, persuasively bearish news.As such, I think the bullish argument has some merit, but only if you're willing to accept the risks. Here are three reasons why GE stock could stage a comeback: GE Is Under New ManagementI realize it's an overly-covered topic. For almost two decades, General Electric languished under former CEO Jeff Immelt's leadership. Naturally, GE stock also eroded, but not necessarily in a linear fashion.And this latter point represents a supporting argument for Immelt. After all, General Electric stock experienced two major shocks: one following the tech bubble and the other following the 2008 financial crisis. Neither event is Immelt's doing.That said, the optics ultimately derail the former exec's case. When Jack Welch gave the keys to Immelt, General Electric was a vibrant, robust organization. Today, it's a sad shell of its former self.Nevertheless, part of the American capitalist ethos involves coming back from the ropes. And if anyone can bring back GE stock from the grave, it's current CEO Larry Culp. During his time at Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Culp turned around a confused, convoluted organization into a lean fiscal machine.What I didn't know is that Danaher utilized an operational system called lean manufacturing, which emphasizes &quot;continuous quality improvement and low working capital.&quot; Toyota (NYSE:TM) and other Japanese firms pioneered this process following World War II.Surely, if war-torn nations can spark a comprehensive recovery, then a resurgent General Electric stock isn't completely irrational. It will take patience. However, those willing to exercise it might enjoy a profit windfall. Power Isn't DeadSeveral hours prior to writing this article, I experienced a sudden blackout. Immediately, I blamed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the rise of electric vehicles. EVs must get their power from somewhere, and that somewhere is our already-strained electrical grid.But what does this have to do with GE stock? Simply, the underlying company has two core businesses: aviation and power. Regarding the former unit, most recognize that this is General Electric's money-maker. While Culp has happily divested several businesses to drum up much-needed cash, he didn't abandon aviation.Last fiscal year, this unit rang up $30.6 billion in revenue. Take this away and you start having some serious problems. Fortunately, the overall narrative behind aviation is largely bullish, even considering Boeing's (NYSE:BA) grounding of their 737 Max jetliners.But the second-biggest revenue source is power. Last year, it brought in $27.3 billion in sales. That's great, but according to critics, the world is rapidly shifting toward clean and renewable energy sources.I agree about the shift, but I disagree with the implication. While we're headed toward a renewable future, that future won't come soon. I'll step out on a limb and say this: even if you're a young Generation-Z member, the transition won't happen in your lifetime.That's because our entire infrastructure is based on fossil fuels. Actually, this is one of my major criticisms about EVs. The tech is wonderful but if everyone jumped on board, it will cripple our electrical grid.Plus, fossil fuels are now plentiful and thus, incredibly cheap. Even MIT and the University of Chicago admit that &quot;market forces alone won't reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels for energy.&quot;Stated differently, fossil fuels are here to stay, and that directly benefits General Electric stock. GE Stock Has Found a BottomFinally, I arrive at my technical argument for General Electric stock: I believe shares have found a bottom.As I mentioned earlier, the bears will counter my point by emphasizing GE's flat trajectory. And I won't dismiss that reasoning. However, in most cases, people don't trade the markets just to watch a stock move sideways. Eventually, it will move decisively in one direction or another.I concede that the bullish arguments aren't that strong to skyrocket GE stock right now. This will require patience and tolerance to turbulence. At the same time, the bearish narrative isn't convincing enough to drop shares more than they have. Otherwise, we would have seen that decline.If I haven't already mentioned it, General Electric is incredibly risky. However, with a proven management team and an under-appreciated business unit, this is a name worth gambling on.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"For nearly a two-month period, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had many investors fooled. After tumbling badly for most of the year, TSLA stock mounted a very respectable rally.Source: Shutterstock From the end of May until just hours prior to the tech firm's second quarter of 2019 earnings report, shares jumped 43%. However, the façade came crumbling down after the critical financial disclosure.Still, I can appreciate why investors are confused about the resultant volatility. After management broke down their key metrics, Wall Street wasted zero time responding. Tesla stock cratered during afterhours trading on Wednesday. When the regular session opened on Thursday, shares found themselves gaping down to $233.50, eventually closing at $228.82.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut why? Sure, Tesla earnings disappointed on paper because it missed the Street's expectations for both revenue and profitability. Consensus estimates heading into Q2 was for per-share earnings to generate loss of 40 cents. Instead, the company incurred a loss of $1.12 per share. Revenue of $6.35 billion missed the consensus forecast of $6.41 billion.That said, in the year-ago quarter, Tesla rang up $4 billion in top-line sales. Thus, we just saw a nearly 59% growth rate. For those who hold a bullish opinion of TSLA stock, the erosion in equity value doesn't match the fundamentals.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now After all, Tesla stock is a legitimate growth name. Utilizing groundbreaking technology that has in many ways disrupted the automotive old guard, Tesla essentially mainstreamed electric vehicles (EVs). Before they arrived on the scene, EVs were slow, ugly abominations.I agree that a miss on earnings is a poor excuse to dump TSLA stock. However, I don't disagree with the dumping, and here's why: Golden Age of &quot;ICE&quot; Hurts Prospects for TSLA StockNoted Tesla bull Ben Kallo of Robert W. Baird & Co slammed the markets' &quot;overreaction&quot; to the Q2 report. In Kallo's view, Tesla exceeded expectations: TSLA has $5 billion on the balance sheet, strong domestic demand, and even stronger demand in China.However, I don't believe Wall Street necessarily reacted to the print. Instead, they're recognizing the challenges that impact Tesla stock where the rubber meets the road. In other words, Tesla has serious competition in the automotive space, and Q2 reaffirmed this headwind.As Growth Investor editor Louis Navellier pointed out, Tesla has a pricing problem. Their flagship SUV, the Model X, is priced well above competing EVs from luxury brands. In response, TSLA reduced production of the Model X (and the pricey Model S) and ramped up the Model 3.That move led to another issue: all things considered, the Model 3 isn't profitable, according to Navellier.And the situation could worsen for Tesla stock because of a great irony: we're in the golden age of &quot;ICE,&quot; or the internal combustion engine.While advancing technologies sparked new innovations like EVs, they also substantially upgraded old school platforms. For the kind of money that you spend on the cheapest Tesla, you have many options. Moreover, well-established favorites such as the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Camry offer everything you want in one package: performance, good looks, practicality and reliability.Another point to consider is that gasoline prices are at multi-year lows. Of course, that could change quickly. Even with a spike in demand, I can't imagine prices will return to record highs. Supply is just too plentiful.That ultimately means an abundance of compelling, attractive ICE vehicles that will disrupt the disrupter. Infrastructure Is Just Not Ready for TeslaTo summarize, extraordinary competition hurts the near-to-intermediate term narrative of TSLA stock. Even if management gets past that hurdle, they still have a longer-term headwind to address: the U.S. and global infrastructure is just not ready for mass-scale EVs.Let's take the current heat wave that's hitting many parts of the U.S. as an example. Rolling blackouts occur because unusual spikes in demand (such as people turning on their air conditioners at full blast) stressed already stretched power grids. What happens when on top of this season demand, we have millions of EVs draining electricity?I'm not an expert in this field, but I imagine the results wouldn't be too pleasant.Let's also discuss a mundane topic: garages. According to government statistics, 63% of housing units in the U.S. have garages or carports with electricity access. In the western regions, that metric jumps to 76%.But here's the thing: I'm sure nearly every working adult required some kind of vehicular transportation to get to work. Therefore, whether you're talking 63% or 76%, the market for EVs is limited before you initiate your first advertising campaign.Combined with the problems Tesla has on the business end, it's difficult to recommend TSLA stock to anyone but speculators.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

After all, Tesla stock had rallied into the report, gaining nearly 50% in less than eight weeks.Source: Shutterstock The Q2 results should make investors less upbeat about Tesla stock. The issue  is not just that Tesla earnings missed expectations. It's that its earnings, particularly in the context of its previously-announced deliveries number, raise real questions about Tesla's operating model.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek Meanwhile, long-running concerns about its management were only amplified by the departure of another key executive and more questions about the company's strategy. Q2 was an important quarter for TSLA and for Tesla stock  - and it was something close to a disaster. It seems likely, then, that TSLA stock will retest its early June lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla's Earnings Don't Look Good EnoughTesla's earnings, like Tesla stock, are somewhat in the eye of the beholder. And optimists can point to good news within Tesla's results. Automotive revenue rose 60% year-over-year, and jumped 44% versus the company's disappointing Q1. Automotive gross margin did weaken quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, but lower regulatory credits drove the sequential decline.TSLA's adjusted earnings were negative, but its free cash flow was nicely positive at $614 million. As the company highlighted in its Q2 shareholder letter, Tesla closed the quarter with $5 billion of cash and equivalents. Profitability might be pushed out a quarter, with some questions about Q3, but on the Q2 conference call, CEO Elon Musk projected a strong 2020, particularly in the second half.That good news, however, is colored by a key fact: Tesla has launched what it expects will be its flagship product, so its revenue should be increasing. But, so far, Tesla is, as the old jokes goes, selling vehicles at a loss and trying to make it up on volume. Its automotive gross margin of 18.9% simply isn't good enough.And that margin is declining in large part because its sales mix is shifting from higher-priced S and X models to the Model 3. S and X deliveries were down 21% year-over-year in Q2. There's a real question at this point as to whether the Model 3 is profitable , and yet Tesla keeps cutting the prices of the vehicle.Bulls can point to Tesla's Q2 free cash flow, but that cash flow isn't sustainable. The company's capital expenditures were just $250 million, versus full-year guidance of $1.5 billion-$2.0 billion. Q2 free cash flow was boosted by $150 million-plus as a result of  the timing of that spending. Declines in its stock-based compensation added another $210 million. And changes in working capital - mostly inventory reduction - added another $287 million.Those three factors drove all of the positive free cash flow  and then some. And in the first half of the year, TSLA actually burned cash, excluding its new stock and debt offerings. Again, concerns about its profitability are realistic. The Strategic Question Surrounding TSLA StockThere's little in Q2 to dispel the bearish argument that TSLA simply isn't that profitable, if at all. The bullish response is that TSLA will become more profitable as it grows. A new factory in Shanghai, China is on the way. The Model Y should arrive next year. And Elon Musk has said that  &quot;robotaxis&quot; should drive demand and earnings, once they're ready, potentially at the end of 2020.But any investor betting on growth needs to answer a simple question: why isn't Tesla acting as if it expects that growth to come? Elon Musk has said that existing Tesla vehicles will be worth as much as $250,000 each in a matter of years, after they become self-driving automobiles.Why, then, is Tesla cutting prices now?  Musk was actually asked on the call why the company was cutting prices. His answer was &quot;there's a tremendous amount of desire to buy our cars, but people, obviously, they don't have enough money to buy them, they cannot.&quot; But if TSLA can't  make a profit by selling its cars at an affordable price point, that's a real and obvious problem for Tesla stock.Meanwhile, Tesla cut its full-year capital expenditure guidance. That's another questionable move for a company that supposedly is growing. How is Tesla building its Shanghai factory, rolling out a new car, and developing autonomous vehicles by spending less capital? If its growth opportunity is so huge, shouldn't Tesla be spending accordingly?Tesla's strategy just doesn't make sense at this point. The company had planned to close almost all of its stores; now it's not. Its cars will be worth $250,000, but Tesla is cutting prices. It's hard for investors to believe in TSLA when its management is acting like it doesn't. Avoid Tesla StockMeanwhile, Tesla lost one of its co-founders, JB Straubel, who is stepping down. And that continues a steady exodus of Tesla executives, including former CFO Deepak Ahuja, who departed earlier this year.Following Tes;a's  Q2 results,  there are questions about the company's fundamentals, its strategy, and its management. And while TSLA stock is cheaper than it was, it's not cheap. The company still has a market capitalization of $40 billion, and an enterprise value not far from that of Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). But unlike Ford, GM, Toyota (NYSE:TM), and even Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), Tesla isn't profitable.Maybe that will change. In fact, it's likely that TSLA will become profitable again. But the Q2 earnings raise real questions about just how much profit Tesla can ever drive - and if those earnings can support a $40 billion valuation. I continue to believe that they can't.As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bearish options position in Tesla stock. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

The electric-vehicle maker saw its share price fall from $264.88 per share down to as low as $222.25 last week following a disappointing earnings report. With investor sentiment negative, the TSLA bears may be vindicated.But is this just a short-term dip? While Tesla's performance over the last quarter failed to meet expectations, Tesla's production and sales continue to rise.TSLA stock is down 27% in 2019 It seems as if the Tesla bears are finally having their day in the sun. But are the bears misguided?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August Is TSLA at a turning point that will lead to profitability? Let's take a closer look at TSLA stock, and see whether we can determine its future direction..  A Closer Look at TSLAWhile Tesla's performance improved in Q2, it failed to meet expectations. The company posted quarterly revenue of $6.35 billion, lower than analysts' average estimate of $6.4 billion. But its sales climbed 40% quarter-over-quarter, and 59% year-over-year.It delivered 95,356 vehicles in Q2 (setting a company record), and production reached an all time high of 87,048 vehicles. The company also posted positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Specifically, Q2 EBITDA came in at $370.3 million, compared to a loss of $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2019.Tesla stock has two key catalysts in the pipeline. The first is the Shanghai &quot;gigafactory.&quot; The Chinese facility is projected to open later this year. Expanding operations into China is a game-changer for Tesla stock. TSLA anticipates the facility could produce up to 150,000 vehicles per year. With the Model 3's Chinese base price set at around RMB 328,000 (~$47,653), the gigafactory will be a shot in the arm for the company's global sales.The second catalyst is the launch of the Model Y in America. The Model Y is anticipated to hit the streets in the fall of 2020. A compact SUV model, the Model Y has a large potential market. Targeting the high-margin SUV market is the right move for the company.  I can see this vehicle enabling  Tesla to become a top brand amongst the &quot;mass affluent.&quot; Risks to the Bull Case on TSLAThe TSLA bears make a strong case. The company continues to depend on dilutive equity sales and convertible debt offerings to fuel growth. Tesla boosted its cash reserves by $2.35 billion thanks to a recent offering. Tesla believes it has the liquidity to fund both Chinese Model 3 production and US Model Y production. But will it need to raise more money?Given Tesla's track record, I can see the company talking a big game, but having to sell more equity to meet its goals. On the other hand, I could see the Tesla bears eating crow on a small amount of good news. The company is targeting &quot;positive GAAP net income&quot; starting in Q3  With TSLA in such murky waters, what should investors do with Tesla stock? Should investors consider buying Tesla stock on weakness or should they wait until the shares drop further? All Bets Are OffUntil we see Tesla's Q3 earnings (scheduled to be released in October), all bets are off. The TSLA bulls have a solid case. In the next year, the company's sales could skyrocket thanks to the Model Y and the opening of the gigafactory. The company could start posting consistently profitable results. This will give credibility to the current valuation of Tesla stock. On the other hand, the TSLA bears make cogent arguments of their own. The company's valuation is largely built on high expectations. If TSLA fails to deliver, the bears' day in the sun could continue.So what's the verdict on TSLA stock? Tesla stock trades at a premium valuation to its automotive peers. That's understandable, given the company's disruptive powers. But it is not as if the major car makers aren't in the electric vehicle game themselves. Once electric vehicles become viable without the help of government tax credits, the major auto names may have the edge in selling affordable electric cars to the masses. But that may not hurt Tesla stock. TSLA is not looking to become the next Ford (NYSE:F) or Toyota (NYSE:TM); it's gunning for the mass affluent market.But in terms of Tesla stock, I am on the sidelines. I learn towards the bears, but can easily see the stock jumping on crumbs of good news. I also believe Tesla stock price could capitulate, as we saw earlier this year (when TSLA fell from over $300 per share to under $200 per share). With a plethora of other growth stories out there, investors may be better off skipping TSLA stock in favor  of other opportunities.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Everywhere you turn in the transportation industry these days, Toyota Motor Corp. seems to already be there.From batteries and self-driving vehicles to lunar rovers and ride-hailing companies, the world’s second-biggest automaker is on an investment spree, pouring more than $3 billion into deals and partnerships in recent years. Toyota, which reports first-quarter results Friday, is placing bets across the board, mimicking technology investors like SoftBank Group Corp.Toyota, Volkswagen AG and other carmakers face an uncertain future as new technologies and business models ripple through the $2.23 trillion global auto industry. Uber Technologies Inc. has made younger buyers less interested in owning and driving cars, and Tesla Inc.’s success with electric vehicles has spurred bigger rivals to counter with their own products. All told, car sales will be only slightly higher in 2030, while new spending on mobility services will total $1.34 trillion, Accenture predicts.“They are developing by far the most diverse lineup of different mobility products, from personal mobility to luxury cars and various types of shared mobility and commercial vehicles,” said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo. “Investors, to the extent that they are invested in the auto sector, generally agree that Toyota is looking like a winner.”Indeed, shareholders are endorsing Toyota’s approach. The automaker’s stock rose 1% on Thursday, leaving it up 10% this year and adding $18.6 billion in market value. That’s better than the Topix index and other Japanese automakers, even amid tepid profit and sales growth. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict quarterly operating profit will rise 1.3% to 692 billion yen, while revenue will climb 1.6% to 7.48 trillion yen.Big BetIn addition to investments and partnerships, Toyota’s spends about 1.05 trillion yen ($9.7 billion) a year on research and development.Akio Toyoda, chief executive officer and grandson of the automaker’s founder, has been holding forth at public appearances about Toyota’s transformation into a mobility service provider from a manufacturer.“My true mission is to completely redesign Toyota into a mobility company,” Toyoda said in May, saying the mission is to not just make products that move people around but provide “all kinds of services related to mobility.”Ride-HailingToyota’s strategy is to tie up with the strongest ride-hailing providers in each region and then integrate its hardware and software into their services. Toyota is a major investor in the world’s three top ride-hailing companies: Uber, China’s Didi Chuxing and Southeast Asia’s Grab Holdings Inc.In Japan, the carmaker teamed up with SoftBank — which has poured even more money into the three companies — in yet another mobility service venture called Monet Technologies Inc.The Japanese companies are betting that Monet can evolve into a variety of transportation-related business. For example, they envision meal-delivery vehicles that can prepare food en route to customers, or hospital shuttles that offer medical examinations.Toyota’s rivals aren’t standing still, either. General Motors Co. injected $500 million into Uber rival Lyft Inc. in 2016 while also pursuing its own robotaxi program with the Cruise Automation unit. Daimler AG and BMW AG merged their car-sharing operations this year after buying up several local ride-hailing ventures.ElectrificationWhile Toyota was first out of the gate with the Prius hybrid car, it hasn’t rolled out any mass-market EVs. Like Volkswagen and other major automakers, the Japanese company was biding its time. That will change next year, when Toyota introduces the first of six EV models planned through 2025.To secure enough batteries, Toyota recently stepped up its dealmaking with manufacturers, racing competitors to secure supplies for pure-electric and hybrid vehicles. Volkswagen and Daimler have made tens of billions of dollars in battery investments.In July, the Japanese auto giant made back-to-back battery announcements with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and BYD Co. Toyota also is committed to work with suppliers Toshiba Corp., GS Yuasa Corp. and Toyota Industries, as well as long-term partner Panasonic Corp.In Japan, Toyota teamed with Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp., Subaru Corp. and parts makers to develop a common platform for EVs, betting that a combined effort can save development and production costs.Earlier this year, Toyota’s brought forward its EV sales target by five years. The company now expects to see annual sales of 5.5 million units globally in 2025, compared with a previous timeline of 2030.Fuel CellsToyota placed bets on fuel-cell technology years ago, gambling that hydrogen would replace batteries to store and deliver electricity for cars. So far, the technology’s complexity and high development costs has scared off most rivals. Three years after introducing its Mirai hydrogen car, the model remains a rarity even in Japan.Even so, Toyota is keeping fuel-cell car development alive, with hopes that Chinese interest in hydrogen will create a bigger market for the technology. In April, Toyota said it will work with Chinese truckmaker Beiqi Foton Motor Co. and Beijing SinoHytec Co., an affiliate of Tsinghua University, to develop more commercial vehicles with fuel cells. In July, it struck a similar deal with carmaker China FAW Group Co. and Higer Bus Co. to supply fuel-cell systems.Hybrid CarsAfter keeping its hybrid-car technology in Japan, the U.S. and developed markets for years, Toyota is now seeking to enter new markets. It will supply its hybrid system to Suzuki globally, while Suzuki will sell compact vehicles through Toyota in India and Africa, the carmakers said in March. The pair also will jointly develop a multipurpose vehicle that will be sold in India under both brands.Toyota also may share the hybrid-car engine technology it pioneered with the Prius with Chinese manufacturers, seeking to catch up with rivals in the world’s biggest auto market. Toyota is in advanced talks to license its hybrid system to Chinese carmaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Bloomberg reported last year.Toyota will benefit if China eases emissions rules so that low-polluting hybrid cars aren’t penalized as much as normal gas guzzlers. Policy makers are now considering rules that would count levels from a super-low emission vehicle as one-fifth of a normal gasoline car, according to a draft of the rules released July 9 by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.A majority of Toyota’s new partners are Chinese manufacturers because Toyota wants to catch up there with Volkswagen and General Motors in the next decade. China contributed most of Toyota’s growth last year, as well as this year, thanks to new products and its Lexus luxury brand, which benefited from lower government tariffs on auto imports from Japan.Connected CarsAlthough Toyota lags behind General Motors and European rivals, the digital information business has been a central -- yet less visible -- element of its vision for the future.Automobiles are generating more data that can be shared in order to improve safety, monitor road conditions and help passengers. For example, many manufacturers see a future when collisions become rare because autonomous vehicles will be programmed to avoid each other.Toyota is working to have 70% of new cars connected globally by 2020, with almost all of those in the U.S. and Japan. Automakers are already using the cloud to generate revenue through telematics insurance and car-sharing services.Toyota also has talked about using data to alert dealers when cars need servicing, provide information about road and traffic conditions for smart city planning, and inform retailers where their customers are commuting from to allow more targeted marketing.Moon PlansAlthough less relevant for Earthlings, Toyota wants to be the first automaker on the moon. Together with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Toyota is planning to build a six-wheeled, self-driving transporter that can carry two humans for a distance of 10,000 kilometers. They expect to land a vehicle on Earth’s closest ndaimeighbor in 2029.The rover will use solar arrays and fuel cells to generate and store power. The vehicle will be big enough so the astronauts can take their suits off and live in it while exploring the lunar surface.“Toyoda is determined to shift his company into a mobility company from a conventional hardware-oriented corporation,” said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities Co. “It’s yet to be seen if Toyota can win among the competition and rapid changes in the business model, but it seems management is determined to chase this course.”(Updates with Toyota shares in)&#92;--With assistance from Kae Inoue.To contact the reporter on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at jma124@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Reed Stevenson, Michael TigheFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Betting Like SoftBank Drives Toyota’s Value Up by $19 Billion

2019-08-06,"&quot;Our industry is going to change more deeply in the coming 10 years than in the 100 years before.&quot;Source: Shutterstock Matthias Muller, the former CEO of Volkswagen, spoke those words in May 2017. And if he's smart, he's worried about all the change coming to the auto industry.Just behind Toyota, Volkswagen is the world's second largest car maker. Its industry is facing one of the most powerful and most varied set of disruptions in the history of capitalism.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDuring this time of epic change, huge, seemingly-dominant companies will go out of business very quickly. Longstanding billion-dollar brands will become worthless virtually overnight. New companies will spring up in their place and make their shareholders very wealthy.If you understand what's about to happen, you could make a tremendous amount of money in a short time. What's coming is going to be that powerful and that fast.Think of the auto industry like a large dining table that took decades and hundreds of billions of dollars to set up. The tablecloth is about to get yanked out.Let me explain the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of change coming to one of the biggest industries on the planet. While this perfect storm is terrifying to some, I hope you'll see it as a huge opportunity. The 4 Horsemen of the Auto Industry ApocalypseIf the old auto industry is about to get demolished, here are the four horsemen of its apocalypse … the four major disruptive changes hitting the industry: Disruptive Change 1: The decline of the internal combustion engine.The 20th century was the age of oil … thanks in large part to the internal combustion engine. Some of the world's largest industries have been created to extract fossil fuels, refine them, and burn them while getting from point A to point B.But over the past decade, electric vehicle technology has advanced by leaps and bounds. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) have invested billions of dollars in the pursuit of increasing the range and reliability of electric vehicles.In addition to technology improvements, electric vehicles have governments on their side. Thanks to environmental concerns, governments in China and Europe are moving to phase out internal combustion engines and phase in electric vehicles. Bloomberg estimates that at least 50% of cars sold by 2040 will be electric.What's coming is a profound shift in how the automotive industry works. I don't believe we'll see the &quot;death of oil&quot; anytime in the next decade. But we will see a continuing shift toward electric vehicles. This means I'd much rather own the best companies involved in electric vehicle battery technology and materials for potential 10X gains over the best oil companies. Disruptive Change 2: The rise of ride sharing services.Thanks to ride sharing services like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), the concept of &quot;car ownership&quot; has radically changed in the minds of many consumers. Instead of going through all the expense and time associated with owning a car, many people -- especially the under 40 crowd -- would rather just &quot;Uber&quot; to get where they need to go.We're talking tens of millions of consumers who don't care about American &quot;car culture.&quot; This is a radical shift from days past.I think we're already seeing the impact on sales. U.S. total vehicle sales rebounded strongly coming out of the Great Recession, exceeding 18 million per month in mid-2015. But except for a couple of spikes since then, sales have largely plateaued and even trended down. Disruptive Change 3: The rise of autonomous vehicles.Just like electric vehicle technology, autonomous vehicle technology has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade.Self-driving cars have gone from a science fiction fantasy to actually operating in the real world. Waymo -- owned by Google parent Alphabet -- is successfully testing self-driving taxis in Phoenix, Arizona. Tesla has invested enormous amounts of money into making its vehicles autonomous.While estimates of autonomous vehicle adoption over the next 20 years are all over the place, it's safe to say this technology is extremely disruptive to the &quot;old&quot; transportation industry. Autonomous vehicle technology leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stand to benefit. Disruptive Change 4: The growing importance of &quot;tech&quot; in cars.The &quot;in car&quot; experience of the future is going to be drastically different than the &quot;in car&quot; experience of the 1990s.From entertainment systems to navigational systems to voice-activated controls to autonomous driving features, the role that software-driven high technology plays in cars is growing every year.For example, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leads the world in self-driving car patents. The technology behind digital assistants -- which are operated with voice commands -- is dominated by big tech companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet.These tech giants will wield increasing amounts of power in the transportation industry.Summing Up For generations, the auto industry didn't change much. Car makers sold cars with internal combustion engines. There were no ride sharing services like Uber. And the thought of a self-driving car was science fiction.Today, most drivers fill up their cars the same way they did a century ago. The photo below is not much different than today.But now, everything automotive is about to radically change. Transportation will change more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 100 years.Thanks to extraordinary advances in technology, an epic period of change is coming for the trillion-dollar auto industry.If any of today's giants are unable to navigate the coming perfect storm of change, they'll quickly go out of business.Powerful new car makers, component makers, and software makers will take their market share and deliver massive rewards to shareholders. I'm talking on the order of 2X, 3X, 5X and even 10X your money.As with any major business change, I hope you see it as a huge opportunity.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-08-15,"Up until fairly recently, I used to be a big fan of Elon Musk and his vaunted company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, a series of unnecessary controversies and unforced errors made me change my opinion. Granted, I still think the man is a genius. However, I wanted to avoid the coming train wreck in TSLA stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com And man, was that ever the right decision. Year-to-date, Tesla stock is down more than 28%. Of course, this figure includes the effect of June and July's sympathy rally in TSLA. Without it, shares would have shed closer to 40%.For the bears, I say &quot;never say never.&quot; In my opinion, TSLA stock is on the verge of falling into an overwhelmingly negative ecosystem. From internal troubles to external headwinds, Tesla is about to face an unprecedented series of challenges.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are three reasons to avoid Tesla stock (unless you want to short it): Recession Cuts Two Ways for TSLA StockOn Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered an 800-point drop, the worst day of 2019 so far. Since no publicly traded company operates in a vacuum, virtually all stocks tanked. Even companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) which has no exposure in China dipped severely. This drew fears of a coming recession.Logically, then, it wasn't a good day for Tesla stock, which does have exposure in China. In fact, before the U.S.-China trade war escalated in the past few weeks, TSLA was making an aggressive push toward dominating the electric vehicle market share in China.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall You can say those plans got scuttled.But that's only the headline headwind. The other swing of the blade comes from a possible recession's associated risks. Primarily, I'm talking about oil prices. During the midweek session, the international oil benchmark Brent crude dropped more than 3% on weak global economic data.That's a massive problem for TSLA stock because it takes away the EV's principal selling point: eliminating pain at the pump.Thus, if we head into a recession, don't expect consumers to jump on EVs. By the way, Tesla's cars aren't that reliable, taking away another selling point and adding troubles to TSLA stock. Tesla Stock Could Get 'ICE-d'I believe most economists agree that we're headed toward at least a market correction, if not a recession. Given that we're on the longest bull market ever, I think that's a reasonable forecast.But let's say that we don't have a recession for whatever reason. Maybe President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping engage in a &quot;Titanic&quot;-like bromance. Or maybe the Federal Reserve finally found the magic formula to quantitative easing.Would an extension of the bull market save Tesla stock? I highly doubt it because of the competition.As I argued last month, we're living in the golden age of the internal combustion engine, or &quot;ICE&quot; for short. While fossil-fueled cars are archaic compared to EVs, they offer astounding conveniences and performance at a great price.Previously, I used the example of a Toyota's (NYSE:TM) popular Camry: It's practical, sporty, reliable and affordable. Also, I think it's good looking. But the point is, modern ICE cars are combining so many attributes under one umbrella. On the other hand, because EVs represent relatively new technologies, they lack ICE cars' consumer friendliness.As an aside, consider General Motors' (NYSE:GM) 2020 Corvette. A mid-engine beast that resembles an Italian exotic, GM made the shocking announcement of selling their flagship for only $60,000. Who'd buy an EV under such an aggressive pricing environment?The innovation in ICE cars is bad news for TSLA stock. Same Old TeslaFinally, let's discuss the third reason to avoid TSLA stock: We're still dealing with the same old Tesla. Specifically, the company loves to overpromise and underdeliver.This has been a criticism that has dogged the company for years. Usually, this has revolved around car deliveries. But recently, the bearish assessment extends to product features, such as automated driving.In the past, Wall Street gave Tesla stock substantial leeway. After all, EVs represented an exciting new technology. And while traditional automakers forwarded ugly or otherwise uninspiring hybrids, Tesla cars were undeniably gorgeous. Stated differently, Tesla did EVs right.But the honeymoon phase is over. The Street wants to see hard numbers to back up the premium in TSLA stock. They also want Musk to stop making unnecessary errors and start taking his business seriously.Of course, some of the bullish arguments rest on the company doing exactly that. But for me, I'm going to read between the lines.As you likely know, Tesla has experienced a mass exodus of key executives. Most recently, chief technology officer JB Straubel stepped down from his post.You've got to wonder what's going on at Tesla. Executives at these types of organizations are overpaid and underworked. So it must take something extraordinary for them to give up such great money. Whatever the case, it's probably not conducive for TSLA stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-19,"The idea of electric cars is not new. In fact, they date back to the 1880's. Over the decades there have been several pushes to popularize them but most efforts had so far fizzled. That is until recently, where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made e-cars mainstream. And now other companies are joining the movement, including a Chinese manufacturer called Nio (NYSE:NIO). In spite of the popularity of e-cars, those who owned either TSLA or NIO stock this year are in a world of hurt.Source: Shutterstock The good news is that the global consensus now is that electric cars are here to stay. And that they are a credible threat to the internal combustion engine. While only time will tell, there is a noticeable adoption rate and it seems exponential. We all know at least one person with an electric vehicle or someone thinking about buying one. So the market is viable and that answers the biggest uncertainty in the bullish thesis.Nio stock is struggling, but today's point is that it may just be temporary. If I still own the shares this is not the time to give up on them. Furthermore, this could be a good time to bet on a reversal of fortune for the Nio stock price. The last tactical trade that I was eyeing late July failed to materialize.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company got its biggest exposure in the U.S. last year when the TV show 60 Minutes aired a special on it. Consequently Nio stock spiked to $10 per share, but once again, it failed to hold that level. Since then, the stock fell as much as 78% from that high to the low, and it is now slightly above that. Nio Stock Needs Time to HealSo now the bulls are left wondering how low can Nio stock go? Zero, is the answer, but that is true for any stock. So the more constructive question is: How high can the stock go? In other words, does Nio, the company, have a future in the electric car market?Yes, it does.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential So far, Nio seems to be doing as well as the rest of them. The easy way to illustrate this is to compare its stock price to that of Tesla. Over the last year they have moved in tandem. So this suggests that the stock is broken but the company's prospects and fundamentals are not. And if that's true, then all Nio stock really needs is time to heal.But management could help the cause along by stemming the slide in sales trends. Unlike TSLA which is growing its unit sales, NIO's monthly deliveries are going south. The next earnings report will be pivotal on that front.Meanwhile, the benefit of having Nio stock fall so far from the high is that it's so close to zero that it makes for a small risk with big potential reward. At $3 per share, it makes for an easy debt for the long-term. This is a stock that I would buy and forget about for years or until it spikes. If the e-car market flourishes, then Nio stock is likely to recover most of its past glory.It is also important to note that based on the headlines, the Chinese car market in general is struggling. So this is further testament to the fact that this is not a Nio problem, but rather a industry-swoon. First, you have to consider the general Chinese car industry and, second, the electric car market.This too shall pass. For those who still haven't booked their losses in it, it's perhaps too late to sell this low.  * 7 Great Small-Cap Stocks to Buy There's not a lot to discern from the chart other than it looks like grim death. But Nio stock has been setting higher lows for almost two months. In addition it is also setting lower highs and that means the price range is tightening into a fine point. These usually result in big moves, but where it's headed is unknown.What makes this interesting is that this is the same area of the 12 months point-of-control. So from a bull/bear debate, this is where they like to fight it out the most and this creates congestion. So in theory, the bulls have an the advantage and they could break out from this descending wedge.It is entirely possible for the Nio stock price to reach $4 sooner rather than later. There would be resistance there and at every past ledge. But those are also potential triggers for more upside.While this write-up sounds bullish, it is imperative to remember that it's up to the Nio bulls to prove that this company is worth it. So I consider this a highly speculative trade and one that has low odds of success. But the lower the odds, the bigger the potential the rewards. And at $3 per share, it's a relatively small risk that is worth the effort.Last week, the entire stock market took a beating on recession fears. So if this week the headlines cooperate, then Nio stock could start that bounce rally along with a rallying stock market.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-28,"Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp will take small equity stakes in each other, the Japanese car makers said on Wednesday, as they seek to develop newer technologies  and meet sweeping changes upending the global auto industry.  Car makers - especially smaller ones like Suzuki - are struggling to meet the breakneck growth of an industry transformed by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), ride-hailing and autonomous driving.  Toyota will pay around 96 billion yen ($910 million) for a 4.94% stake in Suzuki, while Suzuki will acquire in the market around 48 billion yen worth of shares in Toyota.",Toyota pulls Suzuki firmly into its orbit through stake deal
2019-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. are strengthening their relationship by taking stakes in one another, the latest alliance in an industry that’s facing sweeping changes in technology, consumer preferences and business models.Japan’s biggest automaker will acquire about 5% of Suzuki shares for about 96 billion yen ($907 million), while Suzuki will get a smaller holding valued at about 48 billion yen in Toyota, the automakers said in statements Wednesday.The move builds on ties established two years ago between the two carmakers and is aimed at expanding their collaboration to keep up with electric and self-driving cars, as well as growing demand for on-demand rides and new businesses that are reinventing how people get from A to B. For Toyota, the deal adds yet another automaker to the company’s expanding portfolio of partnerships, which includes Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.“As the late Sergio Marchionne often reminded his peers, there are too many automakers doing very similar things,” said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi of Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Intelligent Mobility group, referring to the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV CEO who died last year. “Suzuki and Toyota have unique attributes complementing each other.”Toyota will pay 4,004 yen a share, lower than Suzuki’s closing price of 4,085 yen on Wednesday. Suzuki shares are down 27% this year, following a 15% decline in 2018 as the Indian economy cooled.“Toyota is getting Suzuki at an attractive valuation,” said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities (Japan) Ltd. “It appears to be very similar to the mutual investments made between Toyota and Mazda.”Autonomous DrivingSuzuki said it will use 20 billion yen of the proceeds on development of new technologies including autonomous driving, and the remainder to replenish its capital.Suzuki is seeking to team up with a larger carmaker after an acrimonious split with Volkswagen AG. Toyota has budgeted about seven times more on research and development than Suzuki for this fiscal year, and the smaller automaker has pointed to the soaring cost of making competitive cars as a reason to join forces with a partner.“On autonomy, it makes more sense for Suzuki to rely on Toyota because it requires a lot of time and money,” Izadi-Najafabadi said.Alliances are becoming ever more critical in the global auto industry, as manufacturers seek to pool resources and save costs. Ford Motor Co. has teamed up with Volkswagen AG, while Honda Motor Co. and General Motors Co. are working together. There’s also the three-way alliance of Renault SA, Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which has been on shaky ground since the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November.India FootholdThe deal gives Toyota greater access to Suzuki’s presence in India, which is on track to overtake Japan and become the world’s third-largest vehicle market.While Suzuki is small in other markets, it occupies almost half of the market share in India. Sales at Suzuki’s Indian subsidiary fell 34% in July, the worst decline in almost seven years, as a slowdown in consumer spending, the largest driver of growth in the $2.7 trillion economy, became more pervasive.In February 2017, Toyota and Suzuki agreed to begin “concrete examination” of a partnership in technology and procurement. A year later, they agreed to sell each other’s hybrid cars and other vehicles in India. This March, Toyota further expanded the alliance to supply its hybrid system to Suzuki globally, while Suzuki will sell compact vehicles through Toyota in India and Africa. The carmakers also said they plan to produce joint battery electric cars in India around 2020.(Updates with comment from analyst in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at jma124@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Reed Stevenson, Ville HeiskanenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Toyota, Suzuki to Deepen Ties"

2019-09-03,"Increasingly, oil giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is looking like a tale of two cities. On one hand, Exxon Mobil stock enjoyed a brilliant surge between January and the last few days of April. This run up more than made up for the losses incurred last December. However, since the end of April, shares have not looked the same.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The volatility in the XOM stock price is understandable. Optimism toward a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war has given way to trepidation. With both sides trading barbs, seemingly unwilling to concede an inch due to pride and political pressures, there seems no end to the conflict. Moreover, because China owns the biggest automotive market in the world, economic deterioration there spells trouble for Exxon Mobil stock.On another level, our own economy isn't firing on all cylinders. The yield curve inverted again. This historically has been a reliable indicator for predicting recessions. If we do succumb, consumers will shut down unnecessary spending, including limiting transportation use to vital functions. Such a deflationary environment would negatively impact XOM stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd if that weren't enough, Exxon Mobil stock faces another geopolitical headwind: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Prior to recent events, OPEC members adopted a deal to collectively cut production in an effort to support oil prices. However, countries like Russia aren't exactly going along with the plan, stirring discord among other members.In other words, we might see a flood of fresh supply. Based on simple economic principles, that would depress XOM stock. As such, is big oil too much of a big pain to bother with? Longer-Term Narrative Remains Unchanged for XOM StockUnderlining the many headwinds for Exxon Mobil stock is a technological shift. As a Bloomberg article highlighted a few days ago, XOM is about to lose its top-ten status as one of the S&P 500's biggest companies. This would be the first such instance since the index began almost a century ago.Additionally, the demotion represents the growing influence of technology and its replacement of industrial stalwarts. On the surface, that augurs unfavorably for Exxon Mobil stock as societies eye the end of hydrocarbon energy sources. However, that goal is far from becoming a reality.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off While industry experts predict demand for automotive gasoline will peak due to improving fuel efficiencies and the rise of electric vehicles, I believe these forecasts are misguided.For example, it's true that small sedans like the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Corolla are popular worldwide. However, SUVs are gaining significant ground, and they may eventually overtake compact sedans. Combined with America's love for big vehicles, you have a recipe for robust oil demand. And that should translate to support for the XOM stock price.Further, let's consider how modern cars achieve their improved fuel efficiency. One of the most popular ways is to fit smaller-displacement engines with turbochargers. Admittedly, turbocharging -- under certain conditions -- does improve fuel efficiency on front-facing statistics.But on the back end, turbocharged vehicles are more complex than their naturally aspirated counterparts. They produce significantly more heat, and therefore require more upkeep, including frequent oil changes. Thus, fuel-efficient vehicles might hurt an oil company's gasoline revenues, but they can make up for it with alternative products. EVs Can't Hurt Exxon Mobil StockBut the other automotive headwind against Exxon Mobil stock that analysts often cite is the rise of EVs. Since their early days about ten years ago, EV sales have veritably skyrocketed. As more people make the switch, fossil-fueled cars appear on their last leg.While EVs are popular, upgrading infrastructures for their mainstream integration is not. While charging stations are growing, monetizing them remains a huge challenge. Under a bull market, this effort is already an uphill battle. But in a recession? Forget about it.Furthermore, under a downturn, I see the EV dramatically losing its financial incentive. For instance, I've discussed ad nauseum the surprising inefficiencies and inconveniences of EVs.On another note, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently made a splash in business headlines regarding its Model 3 price cut. But that won't do anything about the other surprising cost of EV ownership: insurance premiums. Oh yeah, insuring the cheapest Tesla costs more than insuring a Porsche 911.It's one of the reasons why drivers are turning in their Teslas for presumably &quot;normal,&quot; fossil-fueled vehicles. The Bottom Line on XOM StockNow, before you jump aboard XOM stock, I do think we will see volatility in oil prices. And that might spook investors, resulting in volatility in XOM. Because of the global economic context, shares are now more speculative than before.At the same time, I'm not buying into the existential crisis argument for Exxon Mobil stock. This is still very much a relevant, longer-term investment. Therefore, if you're risk tolerant, I'd take a small position now. Later, I'd wait for additional signals to see where this market is likely heading.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In this episode of Matt McCall's &quot;Money Line&quot; podcast, he talks about what the craze means for Costco stock and what savvy investors should be doing to ride the rotisserie-chicken-filled wave.If you haven't seen the videos, you might be a little confused. What's the big deal about COST stock? Well, as McCall highlights, Costco's grand opening in Shanghai is important for several reasons. It offers packaged, bulk goods that many Chinese consumers want. Plus, the Shanghai location also sells high-end cosmetics and designer handbags.Costco's management had to close the store's doors early Aug. 27 amid reports that wait times for parking spots topped three hours. Later that day, it took to WeChat to announce a new maximum capacity of 2,000 people.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile McCall is still on the fence about buying his own Costco membership, he isn't on the fence about what this means for Costco stock. Tune in to learn how to play this retail trend. McCall's PodcastYou might remember that last week, McCall went head on with mainstream media organizations and &quot;irresponsible&quot; analysts. He's talking about ones that are searching for a recession around every corner. He still doesn't see one coming, and he has some advice if market fears are keeping you up at night. The fact that the S&P 500 is just 5% to 6% off an all-time high is reassuring, too.One thing McCall does see is a new trend for investors on the horizon. Fans of electric vehicles may know that lithium ion batteries, used to power such cars, have two major downsides. One, they rely on cobalt, primarily mined from geopolitically tense hotspots. Two, they are highly flammable. (Remember Samsung's phone scare?)But McCall sees solid-state batteries as the future because they offer less flammable, longer-lasting support. Their potential is in everything from EVs to smartphones. Subscribers to his VIP podcast or newsletters have access to an exchange-traded fund, of sorts. He's put together a list of plays in the solid-state battery space that are all up despite market volatility.Not a paid subscriber? Don't worry. Listen up for more on how General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) are positioning themselves for this up-and-coming trend.

2019-09-04,"The decision by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to offer insurance on its own vehicles, starting in California, has created more buzz than may be warranted.Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com While Tesla's cars are a curiosity in most of the country, they're common in California. Electric vehicles represent almost 8% of the market, and Tesla accounts for more than half that figure. Its Model 3 is the third best-selling car in the whole state, behind only Honda's (NYSE:HMC) Civic and Toyota's (NYSE:TM) Camry.By the end of 2018, Tesla had sold 532,000 cars and almost half were less than a year old. The average Model 3 owner is 46 -- although average ages of Model X and Model S owners are 52 and 54, respectively. The company says Tesla cars registered accidents once every 1.76 million miles, 2.87 million with the autopilot engaged. That's against an industry average of one accident per 436,000 miles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSounds like good odds to me. TSLA's NumbersDrivers on one Tesla forum say their insurance costs differ. ValuePenguin estimates the cost of insuring a Tesla at about $2,450 per year, or $200 per month. Tesla claims its rates will be about 20% below those of competitors.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now This means if Tesla can get half its California owners to buy its insurance, it could bring in $500 million in cash over a year. The resulting business would still be tiny measured against the whole company. Tesla's batteries and solar panels currently bring in about $1.4 billion per year, according to the latest quarterly report.The question then becomes whether Tesla can make a profit on its insurance. The company has an enormous amount of data on its drivers, but that's not unusual. Many insurance companies offer to collect data on drivers in the name of low rates. Since Tesla is only offering policies in a state where it has significant market share, it can deliver parts and expertise easily to customers. It already has 28 service centers in California.Tesla could be a competitive player then, at least in California. Grabbing a bigger chunk of its loyal customers' business would be a small boost to the top line and, over time, to the bottom line as well. Tesla's SkepticsWarren Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), which owns Geico. He was skeptical when Tesla CEO Elon Musk first discussed insurance in April. He compared car companies selling insurance to insurance companies selling cars.Geico has 13% of the U.S. auto insurance market, writing $29.6 billion worth of policies per year on about 24 million vehicles. It's geared up to handle that business. Tesla isn't a threat to Geico, or any of the other large insurers. Even if every Tesla owner in California switched to Tesla's insurance, the company's share of the U.S. car insurance market would be less than 0.5%.So why has the move drawn so much commentary, especially skeptical commentary? The answer to that question is simple: it's Tesla. If Elon Musk announces a new cup holder, it draws headlines. The Bottom Line on TSLA StockThe bottom line on this announcement is that there's not much bottom line.Insurance isn't going to be a huge business for Tesla, and Tesla is not going to be a big factor in the insurance business.Tesla next reports earnings on Oct. 23. Analysts expect a loss of $1.40 per share, on revenue of $6.6 billion. That's about 10% more revenue than last quarter, and less than a year ago.That's what analysts are looking at and that's why the shares, while down 32% so far in 2019, still look overpriced. If Tesla wants to make shareholders happy, it needs to make more cars.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-09-04,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cannot catch a break.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Just when it got past a difficult earnings report and the resulting controversies had begun to calm down, an article in Vanity Fair resurfaced doubts surrounding the battery and auto company.Although Tesla continues to revolutionize both transportation and energy, investors may need to pay heed to the negatives in deciding whether to pull the trigger on Tesla stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla Was Low Key in Recent WeeksBefore earnings, I speculated that TSLA could move higher if the company met or exceeded expectations.That did not happen.Tesla stock missed earnings estimates by 72 cents per share and also fell short on revenue. With that, TSLA plunged. Since the earnings miss, it has steadily moved downward. Today it trades at about $225 per share.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off In fairness, Tesla remained quiet for most of August. If anything, one might have seen the news since the earnings miss as somewhat encouraging.For one, Tesla will receive an exemption from a tax on most foreign car makers within China. The factory the company is building in Shanghai continues to move forward. Secondly, TSLA announced it would sell insurance on its vehicles. Available just in California for now, this would lower ownership costs and bring Tesla recurring revenue.David Marino-Nachison of Barron's made an interesting point about the lack of news coverage surrounding the automaker lately. Over the year, Tesla's eccentric CEO Elon Musk has stoked controversy with errant tweets or provocative statements to the media. Since the earnings report, that had calmed down. Doubts About Musk Have ReturnedHowever, just as that story came out, InvestorPlace's Wayne Duggan pointed to a piece in Vanity Fair that has again called into question the leadership style of Musk. According to the article, his bailout of SolarCity has some of his worst critics calling him a &quot;con artist.&quot; Duggan sees Musk as a guy who promises the impossible and sometimes fails to meet those very high expectations. Whatever the truth, the debate itself casts doubt upon TSLA.Going by its financials, I like TSLA stock. Yes, the forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 57.4 appears high. However, with growth predicted to average 114.3% per year over the next five years, that seems like a bargain.Still, if the Vanity Fair article is even somewhat accurate, we cannot assume that things are as they seem. As Duggan points out, both Tesla and Musk's SpaceX firm invested in SolarCity. He also mentions the problems at the Buffalo, New York factory. So-called &quot;Gigafactory 2&quot; is the manufacturing site of Tesla's Solar Roof. Duggan also highlights Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) lawsuit against Tesla, the result of panel fires in stores and warehouses.In fairness, other parts of the company fare better. Tesla became the top luxury car brand in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2019. It also ranked fourth in overall sales. Tesla came in just above General Motors' (NYSE:GM) Buick and right below Toyota's (NYSE:TM) luxury brand, Lexus. Moreover, Zimbabwe has turned to Tesla batteries to power the nation's mobile phone network.However, studies show that negative headlines draw more attention than positive news. This reality could make investors wary of buying TSLA at anything but a discount. The Bottom Line on TSLA StockThe negatives surrounding TSLA appear poised to drive the stock in the near term. Given the forecasted growth and the promise of the technology, I can understand why investors willingly paid a premium for this equity. From a purely financial standpoint, paying under 60 times forward earnings for triple-digit, long-term profit growth looks like a huge bargain.Moreover, the Tesla battery has expanded the art of the possible. TSLA has succeeded in an area where numerous others have failed -- building a commercially viable electric car. As mentioned before, it also brings power to areas of the world without a reliable supply of electricity.However, as people like the company's namesake, Nikola Tesla have demonstrated, with genius often comes eccentricity. Unfortunately for investors, &quot;eccentric&quot; looks like a generous description for Tesla as of late. Investors are right to call the company into question over SolarCity and the failure of the Solar Roof. Such shortcomings will at least amount to a reputation hit. Uncertainty in the overall market will only add to those doubts.Tesla may well deliver on its promise to change energy as we know it. But with an inability to always deliver on its promises, traders should hold out for a deeper discount or avoid TSLA altogether.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-05,"In honor of the just-released Porsche Taycan, here's a pop quiz: How long does it take for an electric sportscar to go from 0 to 90 miles per hour and back again?If you remember a few years back, electric motors weren't exactly known for speed. The first mass-market example was in Toyota Motor's (NYSE:TM) Prius, and to this day, everyone loves poking fun at the Prius hybrid. You can still find plenty of Prius jokes online.­Well, we've come a long way. Wednesday afternoon, Porsche (OTCMKTS:POAHY) released the Taycan - which is fully electric, by the way - and is promoting its new model with a spectacular video of a test run aboard an aircraft carrier.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBelow you see the Porsche Taycan gearing up (so to speak) on the USS Hornet's flight deck. In the video, which you can watch here, the car goes from 0 to 90 mph and then back to 0 mph in just 10.7 seconds.Source: Porsche.comI haven't had a car in a decade - having lived in big cities most of my life - and I'm normally a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S fan. But if I was in the market, I'd want this one!  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Porsche seems to have overcome most of the worst stereotypes about electric vehicles (EVs):The 0-90-0 test run proves it can get up and go - the Porsche Taycan has a top speed of roughly 155 mph, comparable to the Model S in &quot;Ludicrous&quot; mode.Plus, Porsche says it can produce an impressive 40,000 Taycans in a year. That's comparable to Porsche's sedan, the Panamera… and it's about double Tesla's first-year production of the Model S! It's also double what Porsche originally had planned for the Taycan. But EVs are clearly in high demand.And, of course, the Taycan has Porsche's classic styling:Source: Porsche.comThe next hurdle to clear is range.The company is advertising a roughly 270-mile range for the Porsche Taycan. That doesn't quite measure up to, say, the Porsche 911 Carrera, which can get over 400 miles on a tank.The internal-combustion engine may be 100-year-old technology, but so far EVs have struggled to compete on range. That's largely due to severe limitations with the current batteries. Batteries 101Right now, EVs rely on the same technology first developed for Sony camcorders in the 1980s: the lithium-ion battery.It's the same battery you'll find in your smartphone and laptop, too. But to power something on the level of a Porsche Taycan, the lithium-ion battery becomes incredibly bulky.That bulk just amplifies one of the other problems with lithium-ion: It has a liquid electrolyte inside that is flammable.Remember the problems with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7? If you tried to bring the phone on an airplane, the flight attendants would confiscate it because the lithium-ion batteries had started catching fire. In early 2018, HP had to recall 50,000 laptops for a similar reason.But electric cars are the future - and, all over the world, regulators are &quot;laying down the law&quot; to get people to make the switch: from California to Germany and even China (which struggles with pollution).So, naturally, carmakers are revving up their search for an alternative battery.Porsche and other German automakers like Audi (OTCMKTS:AUDVF) and Mercedes all want next-generation batteries in their fleets as soon as possible. The German government is providing a $1 billion grant for battery research. Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) have applied for their slice of that funding.In Japan, a &quot;battery cartel&quot; of sorts has sprung up. The Japanese government, too, is working with researchers - plus major names like Toyota and Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) - to get this particular new technology to market. Toyota is pulling out all the stops to deploy it for mass production by summer 2020, when the Olympics come to Tokyo.Why? Well, with this battery, you could get DOUBLE the range after just 15 minutes of charging.Plus, you don't need the liquid electrolyte, so these batteries aren't flammable. In one memorable test, a startup called Ionic Materials shot its battery with a Remington .22. It took three bullets, did not catch fire, and kept working!As an investor, this technology is ideal for a pure play on the battery revolution. Invest Where &quot;Big Auto&quot; Is Dropping Major CashI often talk about &quot;picks and shovels&quot; investing. And that's because if you look back at the 1849 Gold Rush, it was the folks supplying the picks and shovels who ultimately got rich.Therefore, at Investment Opportunities, I'm recommending companies that supply this new technology -- nicknamed the &quot;Jesus Battery.&quot;Any competitors that have it will CRUSH Tesla, which may as well flush all the money it's spending on lithium-ion batteries down the toilet. Find out exactly what makes this battery so miraculous here.If you ever wanted to invest in the coming electric car revolution, but weren't sure how, THIS is your chance.I know I do.So I found a company that holds key patents.Automakers like Toyota are relying on this tiny company for its electric cars. Yet the company is totally off the radar.That makes now the right time to get in… before everyone else.

2019-09-10,"Since early June, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock sunk below $180, TSLA shares have been on a mostly upward trend. Yet this looks more like, well, a &quot;dead cat bounce.&quot;Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Keep in mind that -- for the year so far -- TSLA stock is off about 31%. Furthermore, when you take a longer view of Tesla stock, say during the past five years, the average return was -3.89%.Despite all this, the company has plenty of devoted fans. And yes, there are good reasons for this. The fact is that TSLA is obsessed with innovation. Because of this, the company has been up the game of old-line automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season TSLA has also been getting lots of traction with market share, with about 15% of the sales of luxury cars in the U.S. (It's actually a hefty 46% in California.) For this year, Tesla forecasts the delivery of 400,000 vehicles (although, this does look like a stretch goal).Another thing to consider: TSLA has a thriving battery business. Interestingly enough, it has become a significant revenue driver as the company continues to snag larger customers.And finally, with sophisticated tech systems, TSLA continues to accumulate large amounts of valuable data. This has not only helped with improving the autonomous driving capabilities but has opened up new business opportunities. The most recent example of this is the company's foray into the insurance business, which will initially be targeted in California. With the data advantage, TSLA will be able to offer major discounts on premiums -- but still allow for a potentially lucrative revenue stream. The Issues With TSLA StockSo with all the positives, why has TSLA stock been in a funk? Could it be that investors are missing the story here? Or perhaps there are some real issues?Well, I think the bears have the better arguments. For example, there are some tough macro headwinds. With oil prices languishing, there has been less of an advantage for EVs.It also does not help that global economic growth is trailing off. In such an environment, it will be tough to gin up demand for EVs. Note that during July there was a 14% drop in global EV sales (this was the first decline ever recorded), based on data from Sanford C. Bernstein. It looks like a key was a scaling back of subsidies in China. But there was still a drop in North America.Yet perhaps the biggest issue with TSLA is the baggage from its $5 billion acquisition of SolarCity, which was struck in 2016. At the time, there was certainly lots of skepticism. The founders of the company, Lyndon and Peter Rive, were cousins of TSLA's CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla, Musk and SpaceX also had major debt holdings in SolarCity.And besides, why get into the solar business, which is intensely competitive, in the first place?But Musk thought all this was overblown. He made various statements on how SolarCity would be a strong growth driver.However, since the deal, things have not turned out so well (just look at a recent piece in Vanity Fair). Consider that SolarCity continues to generate losses and requires large amounts of cash to finance the upfront costs for leases. The company has also suffered from a drop in market share, from about a third of the residential category to a mere 7% (this is according to Wood Mackenzie).Then there was the recent lawsuit from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has alleged that SolarCity panels have resulted in seven fires at its stores. The company is now demanding the removal of the solar panels in over 240 locations. Bottom Line On TSLA StockNow, TSLA has definitely been a agent of major change in the auto industry. There's little doubt about this. But again, the SolarCity deal is likely to weigh on the operations, in terms of the continuing losses, heavy debts and distraction. In the meantime, there is the potential slowing of the EV market as well as emerging competition.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Given all this, TSLA stock looks like something to avoid.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-09-10,"News last week that the United States and China would resume negotiations next month sent stocks sharply higher. Astute investors may grow tired from watching markets go up or down on hope alone. Even without any solid trade terms, anticipation of a resolution is powerful enough to move stocks. The automotive sector is a beneficiary of the two countries backing down from tariffs. Currently, China is imposing tariffs on the U.S. with Ford (NYSE:F) most likely to feel the impact.Yet the trade war is not the only reason for investors to buy automotive stocks. Valuations are compelling and some of these companies reward investors with rich dividends.There are seven automotive stocks that investors should buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Automotive Stocks to Buy: Ford (F)Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com Since peaking at $10.50 in July, Ford stock fell steadily and recently found a bottom at around $8.75. The company reported a weak quarter but the stock's drop increased its dividend yield to 6.3%. Ford is not without issues. It is recalling 482,520 vehicles in the U.S. because the mechanism that controls how seat backs recline may have been improperly assembled. This news is not a setback: The company is acknowledging a problem and fixing it.In July, the decline in automotive sales in China fell by just 4.3%. But with Ford still losing money in the region, the slowing decline is welcome news. In Q2, Ford said that it saw signs of stability in its business in China. Overall earnings before interest and taxes increased by 19%, supported by a broad-based improvement in market factors led by China, North America and Europe. In China, consolidated revenue grew 48% year-over-year driven by higher volumes of Ford's Lincoln model. Additional initiatives that enhanced capabilities and stronger ties with joint venture partners will lead to stronger performance in the region. * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Ford stock is worth over $11 if, using a five-year revenue exit model, investors assume revenue growing 1%-3% annually. Similarly, analysts have an average price target of $11.36. This target is achievable if Ford's revenue rebounds in the quarters ahead. General Motors (GM)Source: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com General Motors (NYSE:GM) shares may have bottomed recently below $36, as it trades currently in the $39 range. Investors flocked to the stock when trade tensions eased. The company reported Q2 results Aug. 1 and included a reaffirmed full-year earnings per share guidance of $6.50-$7.00 for the year. In the period, North American year-over-year results improved, led by growing truck sales. Average transaction prices and crossover delivers rose. Later this quarter, the start of the deliveries of the Silverado with an optional all-new Duramax turbo-diesel engine opens a new chapter in good fuel economy. And the unveiling of the 2020 Corvette Stingray to an audience of 300,000 should excite sports car enthusiasts.GM's Cadillac is in high demand, too. It sold more than 111,000 vehicles globally in the last quarter. It launched a new XT6 seven-passenger model in China and the U.S., giving it an edge over its competition in the high-growth, luxury SUV segment.To align its workforce to demand, GM has jobs for every employee affected by the restructuring. So far, around 1,700 of the 2,800 employees accepted a transfer to plants that support the company's growth segments. So, as the economic slowdown in China gets resolved, GM is in a good position to capture more market share while operating more profitably.GM shares trade at fair value but the stock has a dividend yielding 3.9%. Honda (HMC)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Honda (NYSE:HMC) shares bottomed at $23 in August and traded recently at $24.85. Valuations for HMC are even more compelling than for either F or GM stock. HMC stock has a dividend yielding 3.3% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.9. Last month, sales were at levels not seen in the company's history. It also set multiple all-time monthly records. Truck sales and passenger car sales lifted total sales to 173,993, up 17.6% year-over-year. All segments performed well, including the CR-V, Passport, Accord and Civic. Even sales of the tiny-but-gas-efficient Fit grew 58% year-over-year.In the first quarter, Honda reported a 0.7% drop year-over-year in revenue. Profits fell due to higher selling, general and administrative costs. Despite the weak quarter, higher research and development spending along with renewed demand should drive sales higher in the quarters ahead. On the balance sheet, higher operating margins from the motorcycle, financial services and automobile business should ensure that Honda meets full-year guidance. * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Honda shares have a modest upside but also pays a 3.3% dividend yield that will keep investors happy. Cost reductions and favorable raw material pricing will also help the company meet its full-year 2020 targets. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU)Source: bondvit / Shutterstock.com Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) shares may not have the same quality levels as a Ford or Honda, but investors are happy with the company's prospects. The stock bottomed close to $12, trading recently just below $14. With a trailing P/E of 6, this stock is among the cheapest. If investors decide the stock is worth a valuation closer to its peers, then the stock might even get to the Wall Street average price target of $19.73.FCAU stock is still enjoying a rally fueled by speculation the company is holding talks with Renault to merge. On paper, merging the two firms makes sense because a bigger company could compete more effectively. It could share costs and technology with Renault. Electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle development between the two firms would prevent the two from falling behind. Fundamentally, neither firm should be kept independent in the name of being a national asset. Both auto firms need a bigger resource pool to compete as global players. A merger should result in a better return on capital.On the charts, FCAU stock is at the cusp of breaking out of a year-long downtrend. A definitive merger would send the stock back to yearly highs. Toyota (TM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Close to a 52-week high, Toyota (NYSE:TM) is not an ideal deep-value play. But at a trailing P/E of 8 and with a dividend yielding 3.3%, TM stock may still reward patient investors. In August, the company reported strong 12.3% growth on a volume basis, posting sales of 218,403 units. This is the best-ever August. Hybrid sales increased 68.3% in the Toyota division and 44.2% for the Lexus division, suggesting that investors benefit from the company's diversification from gas-powered vehicles.As the popularity of cars falls, Toyota is bucking the trend by reporting a 15.2% increase in Corolla sales. Highlander sales rose 21.7% while RAV4 sales were up 17.2%.Just as Ford paired with Volkswagen in a joint venture and Fiat may merge with Renault, Toyota and Suzuki invested in each other. Toyota is buying a 5% stake in Suzuki while Suzuki will buy $453 million of TM stock. The companies will share costs related to the development of new technologies, and primarily, self-driving cars. * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off In its first-quarter earnings call, Toyota said it will address staff redundancies in the U.S. It will also reduce redundancy in accounting. To increase profit margin above the 8% level by the fiscal year 2021, it will increase the SUV/truck ratio. So long as customers demand such vehicle types, Toyota will adjust its product mix to meet their needs. Navistar (NAV)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Navistar (NYSE:NAV) is not technically a car company. As a truck supplier, its strong Q3 report and analyst price target that is 22% above the recent $25.35 closing price are two reasons to consider this stock.Navistar reported revenue growing 17% year-over-year, led by a 25% increase in truck revenue. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization rose 22% to $266 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose 8.7%, up from 8.4% last year. The company provided volume guidance for 2019 and 2020. While Class 6/7 and Class 8 units are both up in 2019, it will drop in 2020. Still, the company reaffirmed revenue of $11.3 billion -$11.8 billion.Importantly, Navistar's days sales inventory on-hand is on the decline. The normal range, established since 2014, is 80 days - 120 days. In July, it was at 85 days. The balance sheet remains strong, with manufacturing cash balance at $1.12 billion. It faces no debt maturities until the year 2025 when $1.6 billion is due.NAV stock does not offer a dividend but Wall Street forecasts upside through the three recent &quot;hold&quot; ratings and one &quot;buy&quot; posted by analysts. Similarly, investors may input assumptions in a five-year discounted cash flow growth exit model to arrive at a higher fair value target. Ferrari (RACE)Source: Kharchenko Olena / Shutterstock.com With a market capitalization of $37 billion, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is similarly sized to Ford but almost half the size of GM. Although the stock does not pay a dividend,it is growing at a healthy pace.In the second quarter, Ferrari reported total shipments growing 8.4% year-over-year to 2,671 units. Revenue rose 6.8%, adjusted EBITDA was up 8.7% to $346 million and the EBITDA margin was 32%. The company benefited from an increase in V8 models shipped, offset by a drop in V12 models falling by a few units. Geographically, sales to China rose due to a decision to speed up client deliveries ahead of new emission regulations.Ferrari confirmed its guidance will approach the high end of the range on all metrics. Volume increase for the 488 Pista and 488 Pista Spider, Portofino and the 812 Superfast is driving demand for cars and spare parts. Higher sponsorship levels from Formula 1 racing activities is likely contributing favorably to the full-year results.Ferrari does not need a dividend to increase shareholder value. It has a $1.65 billion multi-year share buyback program and will buy back $220.1 million in the second half of 2019. In the first half of the year, it bought back $165.5 million worth of shares.RACE stock is the most expensive of the stocks discussed, with a P/E of 34 times. But it earned that valuation. Its clientele is buying more units, driving revenue higher.As of this writing, Chris Lau held shares of F.

2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Put together the best solar panels money can buy, super-efficient batteries and decades of car-making know-how and, theoretically, a vehicle might run forever.That’s the audacious motivation behind a project by Toyota Motor Corp., Sharp Corp. and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization of Japan, or NEDO, to test a Prius that could revolutionize transportation.“The solar car’s advantage is that — while it can’t drive for a long range — it’s really independent of charging facilities,” said Koji Makino, a project manager at Toyota.Even if fully electric cars overtake petroleum-powered vehicles in sales, they still need to be plugged in, which means building a network of charging stations across the globe. The sun, on the other hand, shines everywhere for free, and when that energy is paired with enough battery capacity to propel automobiles at night, solar-powered cars could leapfrog all the new-energy technologies being developed, from plug-in hybrids to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, in one fell swoop.But the current forecast is only partly sunny because there’s still some work left to reach that level of efficiency.“This is not a technology we are going to see widely used in the next decades,” said Takeshi Miyao, an auto analyst at consultancy Carnorama. “It’s going to take a long time.”Not for lack of trying. Toyota and Hyundai Motor Co. already introduced commercial models with solar panels on the roof, but they were too underpowered and could barely juice the sound system.A Prius plug-in hybrid that sells for more than 3 million yen offers solar panels as an option, but they only charge the battery when parked. The maximum amount of power for driving only lasts about 6 kilometers (about 4 miles), said Mitsuhiro Yamazaki, director at the solar energy systems division of NEDO.Toyota has been testing a new solar-powered Prius since July, though it acknowledges that cars running nonstop without connecting to a hose or plug are still far away. Even so, the Toyota City-based company said the research will pay off in other ways.Indeed, there have been some breakthroughs, mainly due to advancements by Sharp. The prototype’s solar panel converts sunlight at an efficiency level of more than 34%, compared with about 20% for current panels on the market.Because the solar cell being used by Toyota, Sharp and NEDO is only about 0.03 mm thick, it can be placed on more surfaces, including the curvy parts of the roof, hood and hatchback. The electrical system can charge the vehicle even when it’s on the move.If the car is driven four days a week for a maximum of 50 kilometers a day, there’s no need to plug into an outlet, NEDO’s Yamazaki said.Toyota’s bet on solar is one of many that Japan’s No. 1 carmaker is placing on the future of transportation. With Volkswagen AG and other auto titans facing uncertain futures as new technologies and business models ripple through the $2.23 trillion global industry, they’re investing billions of dollars in cars powered by electricity and hydrogen to keep apace.For more, read: Betting Like SoftBank Drives Toyota’s Value Up by $19 BillionChina also has explored efforts to tap the sun for transportation purposes. China tested an “intelligent highway” that buries solar panels, mapping sensors and electric-battery rechargers under transparent concrete, with the photovoltaic cells generating enough electricity to power highway lights and 800 homes.Hanergy Holding Group Ltd. introduced four cars powered by solar panels in 2016 as a way to expand the use of photovoltaic technology. The cars could be charged in daylight while driving, but they also contained lithium batteries for plugging in.NEDO started the current project in 2016 with the goal of achieving an output of 1 kilowatt in vehicles by using a solar-battery module with a conversion efficiency of more than 30%. Sharp, one of Japan’s largest makers of solar panels, is developing the solar-cell technologies with NEDO funding, while Toyota is responsible for making the system to convert energy into driving power.While the car’s greatest potential markets will be sunny climes, such as California and western China, NEDO will evaluate whether it’s also suitable for cities such as Tokyo, a key assessment for deciding whether to mass produce the vehicle, Makino said. The current trial is scheduled to run through March.If the solar-powered Prius can be made, it could compete with established manufacturers such as Hyundai and startups Karma Automotive and Lightyear. The Lightyear One is a $170,000 luxury electric car that, according to its developers, can drive almost 500 miles on a single charge.The startup, founded in 2016 by a group of Dutch engineering students, uses 54 square feet of solar panels on the roof and hood that add more than 7 miles each hour to the car’s driving range. Production is planned to start in 2021, and more than 100 cars have been preordered, the company said.Sharp’s solar cells more commonly are used for charging homes and satellites. Toyota’s demo car is covered by about 1,100 cells, each about the size of a business card, said Hiroyuki Juso, a senior manager at Sharp’s solar panel project. The expense of the cells makes mass production unlikely for now, he said.“There is potential in this technology,” Carnorama’s Miyao said.To contact the reporters on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at jma124@bloomberg.net;Kae Inoue in Tokyo at kinoue@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Reed Stevenson, Michael TigheFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Toyota Is Trying to Figure Out How to Make a Car Run Forever
2019-09-12,"Inspired by new ultra-thin solar panels developed for satellites, a project led by Toyota Motor Corp is experimenting with a sun-powered Prius that it hopes will one day require no plugging in.

2019-09-18,"Like most American males, I love cars. I may not know much about them, but I love driving fast (in accordance with local and state laws, of course). And Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of those rare companies that has combined multiple technologies into one cohesive whole. In the past, this has supported a wild upswing in TSLA stock.Source: franz12 / Shutterstock.com Better yet for car enthusiasts, Tesla has never stopped innovating. Recently, the iconic sports-car manufacturer Porsche (OTCMKTS:POAHY) made waves with its Taycan electric vehicle. Recently, a Porsche Taycan Turbo lapped Germany's famous Nurburgring track with a time of 7:42. In doing so, the automaker set a lap record for a production electric vehicle.If you've seen the undulating curves and corners of the Nurburgring, you know that anything under an eight-minute lap time is wicked fast. Not to be outdone, Tesla ran its latest Model S around the same track. Unofficially, the S completed a full cycle 20 seconds faster than the Taycan. And if that's a truly legitimate time, Tesla stock deserves an upgrade just on the improved performance alone.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the world of auto racing, a hundredth of a second may represent the difference between victory and defeat. When you're talking about 20 seconds in this context, it's a different dimension. Again, in theory, this should lift the TSLA stock convincingly.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip After all, look at Ferrari (NYSE:RACE). Its business is entirely based on performance and sex appeal.But Tesla is no Ferrari. Clearly, it's best suited for being an EV supercar manufacturer, yet it insists on being a &quot;regular&quot; automaker. Unfortunately, this confusing message hurts Tesla stock in the long run. TSLA Has Ferrari-esque Running CostsAlthough not apparently a priority, Tesla is nevertheless working hard on its uber-cool Roadster. A true supercar, the company claims it will hit 60 miles per hour from a standstill in 1.9 seconds.That's the kind of outrageous statistic that gets people excited about Tesla, and perhaps TSLA stock. For context, Ferrari's 812 Superfast -- that is unfortunately its real name -- hits 60 one second slower. As I mentioned up top, one second is an eternity.Thus, with the EV platform, Tesla has not only matched the competition in terms of streetlight-to-acceleration, it has utterly dominated its fossil-fueled exotic peers. However, it's proven performance won't do much for Tesla stock. That's because TSLA insists on providing a comprehensive product portfolio.On the surface, I'm okay with that. For instance, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has found great success building reliable every-man cars. At the same time, it has ventured into the luxury and performance categories with its Lexus brand.But the difference here is that Toyota -- aside from the larger scale -- has a cohesive strategy. In other words, it's not like Tesla, trying to peddle deceptively expensive cars to middle-class drivers. The hidden expenses of owning even the &quot;entry level&quot; Model 3 represents a longer-term risk for TSLA stock.While EVs undeniably appeal to the techie crowd, they also have multiple liabilities. Specific to Tesla, its EVs are expensive to insure: Essentially, it's on par with insuring a Porsche 911.And why is protecting your Tesla so onerous? To put it simply, Teslas basically are the Ferraris of EVs, but it doesn't want to admit that. Because of their exotic technology and parts, they're very expensive to repair.As such, they should only be marketed to the affluent. Anyone who blinks at $10,000 or higher repair bills shouldn't drive these things. TSLA Stock Faces Risks from Eroding Consumer BaseI wasn't kidding about the $10,000, either. One unfortunate Tesla driver documented his nightmare story of a fairly typical fender-bender accident. After being rear-ended by an SUV, he received a final bill for the damage totaling nearly $36,000.From the pictures the driver shared, I think we can all agree that the damage is not worth the cost of an entry level Mercedes Benz model. And from what other Tesla drivers shared, these are not necessarily atypical expenses.Again, this is because Teslas are exotic cars masquerading as normal ones. While the average consumer is initially wowed, more people eventually will catch on. When they do, they probably won't want to deal with EVs and their (expensive) quirks.Instead, they'll go back to the trusty internal combustion engine. Yeah, it's loud and environmentally unfriendly. But when you're facing a $36,000 repair bill, any alternative is a better alternative. And that really doesn't bode well for Tesla stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-24,"Questions surround Ford (NYSE:F) on just about every level imaginable. In recent weeks, missing earnings and receiving a debt downgrade have hurt Ford stock. Moreover, uncertainty over economic growth, geopolitics, and consumer taste only make Ford more unpredictable.Source: Philip Lange / Shutterstock.com However, given the struggles and the financials of Ford, the stock has likely priced in most of these factors. Hence, Ford should become a buy--for those that can handle the uncertainty in the type of returns they receive. Uncertainty Has WorsenedBack in mid-July, I recommended that readers buy Ford, mostly for its high dividend and low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. However, an earnings miss started F stock on a downward trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Just when the stock price had begun to recover, a debt downgrade by Moody's started the downward trend again. Ford has fallen by about 10% since my call. It now trades near the $9.20 per share level.This also comes at a time of change for the company. They have begun a $7 billion restructuring that reduces bureaucracy and focuses the company increasingly on electric vehicles (EVs), something seen mostly as a market for upper-income consumers who might choose a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota (NYSE:TM), or some alternative product.Still, the drop in Ford stock since the downgrade has amounted to less than 4%. To me, this signals that the equity has priced in most of the issues with the debt. Moreover, the downgrade should surprise few analysts.Looking at the balance sheet, Ford holds over $156 billion in debt matched against only $36 billion in equity. That also does not account for about $80 billion in total pension obligations.Furthermore, the lower price makes my previous thesis even more true in some respect. The forward PE ratio now stands at 6.6, and the dividend yield has risen to 6.5%. What Might Ford Do?When I look at the financials, I keep going back to James Brumley's statement that &quot;nobody has a clue what to make of Ford now.&quot; Certainly, the situation leaves numerous questions on how Ford will grow. Does it move away from dividends? Or as Luke Lango theorizes, will increasing sales allow it to keep its payout?External factors also come into play. How will the trade war affect the stock? What does economic stagnation in places such as Europe and South America affect the company? Not only do owners of F stock face uncertainty, but they also face it so many levels that they struggle to evaluate the stock. The Case for Ford StockWhere Ford will trade years from now remains anyone's guess. So many factors will make that determination. Unfortunately for traders, many cannot forecast many of these determinants with a high level of accuracy.However, I keep going back to two numbers, the 6.6 forward PE and the 6.5% dividend yield. Both numbers give growth investors a compelling incentive to buy Ford stock. Admittedly, the dividend yield may fall, perhaps even to 0%. For this reason, I would not recommend F stock to income-oriented investors. However, such a move improves its cash flows and would likely take the stock price significantly higher.Conversely, if they maintain the dividend, Ford becomes a source of cash flow. I expect the PE to rise over time in this scenario too, but at a slower pace.Moreover, over the last ten years, Ford stock has traded from just below $7 per share to just above $18 per share. The low came right after the financial crisis, so it would likely take a worst-case scenario to return to that price point. At the current price of about $9.20 per share, the $18 per share level, last seen in 2014, would nearly double investor returns.Although we do not know whether to treat Ford as a growth or income play, chances are, it becomes at least one of those.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. is boosting its stake in Subaru Corp. to about a fifth of the smaller automaker, as Japan’s biggest car company arms itself for a future of self-driving vehicles, electric cars and evolving transport services.Subaru, the maker of Forester and Outback wagons, will also take a stake in Toyota, strengthening their capital ties and collaboration, according to a statement from the companies. Toyota, which is increasing its holding to about 20% from 17% at a cost of about 75 billion yen ($700 million) at Friday’s closing price, plans to make Subaru an equity affiliate, bringing sales and profit from the automaker onto its income statements.Toyota first took a stake in Subaru in 2005 and the move is part of a plan of spreading its bets. The Japanese carmaker, Volkswagen AG and other auto companies have been forging partnerships as they face an uncertain future, with new technologies and business models disrupting the $2.23 trillion global auto industry. Toyota is investing in electric and autonomous vehicles, fuel-cell and hybrid cars, as data-intensive connected cars.“This is part of Toyota’s recent efforts to find allies,” said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Tokyo. “They’re getting ready for the next era that includes self-driving technology. Toyota is taking a 360-degree view.”Shares of Subaru fell 0.7% in Tokyo on Friday. The stock is up about 32% this year. Toyota declined 0.8%.The two companies have jointly developed automobiles since striking up their partnership. Toyota is by far the larger manufacturer, with 10.6 million cars and trucks produced in 2018. Subaru made about 1 million vehicles last year, down 5% and the first drop in seven years.Toyota also owns stakes of less than 10% in both Suzuki Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp.As part of their pact, Toyota and Subaru will jointly develop all-wheel drive vehicles -- a traditional Subaru strength. The companies will also together work on the new Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ sports cars.“For Toyota, this alliance brings not just technologies such as Subaru’s i-Sight, all-wheel-drive and flat engines, but also safety and security know-how,” Yoshida said. “It brings in elements that Toyota doesn’t have.”By consolidating Subaru to its accounts, Toyota will add about 50 billion yen to annual profit, said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. The deal benefits both companies, as Subaru also gets access to technology it wouldn’t be able to develop itself, she said in a note.(Updates with cars to be jointly developed in eighth paragraph, comment from analyst in 10th.)&#92;--With assistance from Kae Inoue.To contact the reporter on this story: Tsuyoshi Inajima in Tokyo at tinajima@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Reed Stevenson, Ville HeiskanenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Toyota Raising Stake in Subaru to at Least 20%, Report Says"

2019-10-10,"(Bloomberg) -- As others automakers plan battery-powered SUVs and trucks, Toyota Motor Corp.’s vision for the future of driving remains a hydrogen-sipping sedan.The Japanese behemoth will begin sales late next year of the second-generation Mirai, its fuel cell-powered four-door, and ramp up annual production by 10-fold from the current model. Toyota’s bet that it can position a hydrogen sedan for more of a mass market flies in the face of rivals wagering on putting batteries into the bigger-bodied vehicles consumers are buying.Toyota has been slower than peers to embrace EVs, citing uncertain demand in key markets including the U.S. and technical hurdles that limit battery range and recharging times. While the company has pledged to offer an electrified version of every model in the next five years, and 10 fully electric vehicles by early the next decade, it’s also going to keep coaxing consumers to give hydrogen a try.“Toyota won’t be putting all our eggs in one technology basket,” Doug Murtha, Toyota’s U.S. group vice president for corporate strategy and planning, said at a briefing in Greensboro, North Carolina.Toyota’s near-term electrification goals in the U.S. center on its gas-electric hybrid powertrains. It currently sells six hybrid vehicles and said Thursday it will add a plug-in hybrid version of its RAV4 crossover next year.The company plans to increase sales of hybrid cars and SUVs in the U.S. to 25% of deliveries by 2025, up from about 9% today.Slow DevelopmentToyota began developing hydrogen-powered cars more than 20 years ago, but progress has been slow due to high material costs and steep hurdles to setting up refueling infrastructure. Recent technological advances halved the cost of fuel cell stacks that mix hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, allowing the carmaker to boost global output from 3,000 a year in 2018 to 30,000 next year and 200,000 by 2025, Taiyo Kawai, general manager of the company’s hydrogen efforts, told reporters during a briefing in London.Rival automakers such as General Motors Co. in the U.S. and BMW AG in Europe have invested in fuel cell technology but are prioritizing EVs in their current and future zero-emission products. In the U.S., only Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. sell fuel cell-powered passenger cars -- and only at a handful of dealers due to the scarcity of hydrogen stations.Fuel cell vehicles offer several advantages over battery-powered cars, including quicker refueling times and longer driving ranges. But they remain a novelty, accounting for less than 0.1% of the nearly 100 million vehicles produced each year, according to research by the National Academy of Sciences.“Unfortunately, despite years of education efforts, hydrogen cars are still a mystery to most people,” said Jackie Birdsall, a senior engineer at Toyota’s R&D center in Gardena, California. “The good news is that fuel cell technology is gaining momentum around the world,” she said.‘Such a Hassle’Improvements have been made to shrink the size of hydrogen fuel tanks and reduce the amount of costly platinum needed for fuel cell stacks. But there’s still more to do, including replacing platinum with cheaper synthetic materials, said Shawn Litster, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University.Toyota, which loses money on the current Mirai, hasn’t said when it plans to break even with a future version. The company showed a near production-ready model to reporters this week in Greensboro, but wouldn’t say when the car will make its official public debut.The first Mirai -- which means “future” in Japanese -- debuted in late 2014, but availability in the U.S. has been limited to California and Hawaii. California has spent about $100 million over the past several years to build out a network of hydrogen stations. The state currently lists just 38 retail locations that are operational; another 22 are in various stages of development.The first-generation car’s oddball looks, $58,500 sticker price and cramped interior made it a hard sell for dealers. Most U.S. drivers lease the Mirai, and experiences with the futuristic vehicle have been mixed.Lawrence Kopp, a 42-year-old San Diego area resident, traded his Mirai in for a gasoline-powered Ford SUV in August after two years of headaches. Too few hydrogen pumps and a lack of cabin space wasn’t a good fit for a father with young children. “It was such a hassle I was ready to go back to a gas vehicle,” the corporate real estate executive said.Going GlobalThe new version of the Mirai is sleeker and more coupe-like, with a lower, longer and wider stance. It has room inside for five passengers, one more than the current model, and sports racier 20-inch wheels.Toyota says the Mirai will make a 30% leap from the existing model’s 312-mile range. Pricing won’t be announced until later, but it will be sold as a premium vehicle under the Toyota brand. Sales may be expanded to some states in the Northeast and Northwest, pending their buildup of hydrogen station networks.Toyota’s U.S. executives said that while they may prefer to have an SUV to sell, the company has stuck with a sedan body style to compete with premium models where passenger cars are still popular. In addition to Japan, Europe and the U.S., the Mirai will be sold in China, Australia and parts of the Middle East.“If I were king, we might have gone for something larger,” Murphy said. “But this needed to be a vehicle for global markets, not just us here.&#92;--With assistance from Siddharth Philip.To contact the reporter on this story: Chester Dawson in Southfield at cdawson54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Toyota Plans 10-Fold Boost to Hydrogen Bet With Restyled Sedan

2019-10-14,"It seems like everybody's talking about self-driving cars and the automakers that manufacture them lately, but investors shouldn't forget that these cars will all need microchips. One way to stake your claim in the autonomous vehicle revolution is with a position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock.Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com Granted, you'll hear media pundits raving about Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) as the undisputed leader in self-driving car technology. I can assure you, however, that Google isn't the only player in this game -- and that the Nvidia stock price could rise dramatically as the competition heats up. Like Self-Driving Cars? Then You Should Love Nvidia StockThe fantasy of cars that drive themselves is quickly becoming a reality in modern society. As Lafayette College's Michael A. Nees explains, engineers and other researchers have advanced self-driving technology to the point where humans are practically irrelevant to the driving experience: &quot;Recent indications have suggested that some design teams believe they can engineer the role of the human operator out of the system altogether.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now This technological progress, as we might expect, has given rise to a nascent industry. The evident leader so far has been Google, whose Waymo subsidiary has been a bellwether in autonomous vehicle tech. However, Nvidia is quickly becoming a credible competitor to Google, to the point where Nvidia could threaten to take market share and topple Google as the leader in the space.OK, so that might be an exaggeration, but at the very least we can envision the graphics-card company making inroads into the self-driving vehicle market. While Google set the pace with Waymo, Nvidia likewise partnered up with Optimus Ride to test out self-powered public transit in Brooklyn, New York.Research firm UBS has projected that the world's autonomous taxi industry will be worth $2 trillion by the year 2030, so I think it's a savvy move for Nvidia to get into the self-driving vehicle market via the public-transportation angle. Just as important, this initiative will allow the company to test-drive the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier, which Nvidia describes as &quot;the world's first processor designed for autonomous driving&quot; with &quot;six different types of processors to run redundant and diverse algorithms for AI, sensor processing, mapping and driving.&quot; Pushing Self-Driving BoundariesWhile the Optimus Ride initiative is impressive, Nvidia is persistent in exploring the potential of self-driving vehicle chips. To this end, Nvidia has joined forces with Toyota (NYSE:TM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and other leaders in the tech and/or automotive sectors to form the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, or AVCC.The AVCC launch at San Jose, California's Arm TechCon marked the start of a massive, industry-wide collaboration to expedite the mainstreaming of self-driving automotive technology with better, faster chips and other essential components. AVCC Board Chairman Massimo Osella appreciated the enormity of the task faced by the burgeoning industry, as well as its importance:&quot;The massive amount of technological innovation required to power fully self-driving vehicles at scale requires collaboration at an industry level… We are delighted to join this group of key leaders in the automotive industry. As the AVCC, we are working together to create the 'go to' organization for autonomous computing expertise to help bring this technology to market.&quot;Nvidia Automotive Hardware and Software Systems Senior Vice President Gary Hicok likewise expressed the ambitious nature of the collaboration, along with Nvidia's eagerness to move the technology forward:&quot;The hardware and software requirements for autonomous vehicles are enormous, requiring an energy-efficient, high-performance AI platform to process sensor data and achieve the highest levels of safety… As the leader in AI computing, we are working closely with transportation innovators, tackling the complexities of developing and deploying safe autonomous vehicles at scale.&quot; The Takeaway on Nvidia StockJoining in the AVCC and getting a head start in autonomous public transportation are emblematic of Nvidia's willingness to take initiative in what's clearly a growth industry. NVDA stock might not go up today or tomorrow, but in time I suspect that shareholders will reap the rewards of Nvidia's early and powerful move into self-driving technology.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s corporate debt market has marked a milestone with a record-low 0.0000000091% yield.The landmark bond sale from a Toyota Motor Corp. unit highlights how the Bank of Japan’s ultra-low rate policy is distorting the market: not just by guiding rates to new lows but also by creating opportunities for traders to still profit.It works like this: the BOJ periodically buys corporate bonds rated BBB or higher and with a remaining maturity of one to three years on the secondary market, as part of its asset purchases. In the so-called BOJ trade, traders who correctly anticipate which securities it will buy can profit by purchasing those notes at issuance and later selling them to the central bank at a higher price.“The BOJ distorts market prices by buying debt at a higher price than what’s sold in the market,” in a side effect of its bond-buying operation, said Toshiyasu Ohashi, chief credit analyst at Daiwa Securities Co.That dynamic appeared to be at play in Toyota’s case.The automaker’s unit, Toyota Finance Corp., will issue two tranches of 20 billion yen ($184 million) in three-year and five-year bonds each on Oct. 25, it said last week.

2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Renault SA will offer its electric Kangoo van with added hydrogen fuel-cells before the end of the year and roll out the technology to another model in 2020.The move sees the French carmaker joining competitors Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. in sticking with fuel-cell vehicles even as the industry largely backs electric cars powered by lithium-ion batteries. The hydrogen addition will boost the driving range of Renault’s Kangoo and Master vans as much as threefold compared to electric models, allowing a refueling in 5 to 10 minutes, the company said Tuesday.European automakers are under pressure to roll out zero-emission cars to comply with new regulation to cut pollutants. While many prioritize battery-electric vehicles, manufacturers like BMW AG have for years invested in fuel-cell cars. The long-standing technology, which emits only water vapor, has struggled with high costs, complex storage of hydrogen and a lack of infrastructure.Toyota and Hyundai both offer hydrogen-sipping vehicles. In adding both rechargeable batteries and fuel cells to its vans, Renault follows the example of Mercedes Benz-maker Daimler AG, which is rolling out a fuel-cell sport utility vehicle that also features a battery to bridge patchy refueling points.Read More: Mercedes-Benz Rolls Out Fuel-Cell SUV to Tackle Tech HurdlesThe hydrogen Kangoo ZE will be priced from 48,300 euros ($54,000) with a driving range of 370 kilometers (230 miles).

2019-10-24,"ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) will report its earnings on Nov. 1 before the opening bell. The company has suffered amid falling oil and natural gas prices. Moreover, this report comes as Exxon stands accused of misleading investors about its climate change-related costs. However, these short-term headwinds could actually make the long-term outlook of XOM stock more attractive.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com  Analysts Expect Lower Revenue, ProfitsAnalysts, on average, predict the company earned 67 cents per share in Q3. That would represent a 54.1% decline from the EPS of $1.46 that the company reported for the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts also expect XOM's revenue to take a substantial hit. Their average  forecast is $64.79 billion, compared with the $76.61 billion that XOM generated in Q3 of 2018.ExxonMobil remains a diversified energy company. However, its relatively large exposure to upstream activity has hurt its profits and XOM stock. That's because slowing growth across the globe has taken a toll on both oil and natural gas prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Exxon Stock Remains a Long-Term BuyThe long-term outlook on XOM stock is straightforward and positive. For all of the talk about the switch to electric cars, lithium batteries can cause significant harm to the environment, according to the National Institutes of Health.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential That's bad for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It also could bode poorly for Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM). However,  it probably ensures that demand will remain strong for the fossil fuels produced by ExxonMobil, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and their peers. And  investors can assume that the world's energy needs will primarily be met by fossil fuels for a long time to come.Moreover, XOM stock pays an annual dividend of $3.48 per share, and it now yields 5%. Since Exxon Mobil has hiked its annual payout for 36 years, it's probably safe to assume that it will be raised again in 2020.Furthermore, stockholders will benefit from the company's  profit growth. Analysts, on average,  expect its profit to increase by an average of 8% per year over the next five years. The price-earnings ratio of XOM stock is 17.5. Considering those factors, the long-term buy case for Exxon stock looks strong. The  Short-Term Outlook of ExxonMobil Stock Is UncertainSome long-term  Exxon stock bulls, including InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek, think that the Nov. 1 report isn't too important. However, many investors want to know whether they should buy XOM stock before the Nov. 1 announcement.Unfortunately, those looking for a short-term trade might find ExxonMobil challenging. Lower oil prices and rock-bottom natural gas prices have driven Exxon Mobil's profits and Exxon  stock price down. Like Bezek, I do not see this situation changing anytime soon.Further, the climate change lawsuit could hurt the company's results down the road. The state of New York has accused the company of lying to investors about the costs of climate change.New York's attorney general alleges the company misrepresented climate data to make its investments appear more valuable and less risky. ExxonMobil insists it did nothing wrong. Legal experts estimate the trial will run 15 days, which means the Q3 report will come out during the trial. How Bad News May Help XOM StockInvestors should also not ignore the fact that XOM stock has lost about one-third of its value since it peaked in June 2014 at over $103 per share. Last December, XOM stock fell to a multi-year low  of $64.65. Exxon has had one earnings miss over the last year. With the stock currently trading around $69 per share, a disappointing report could cause Exxon stock to retest its December low.However, bad news could help the short-term case for Exxon stock.  XOM stock could fall below $65 per share if the results are poor or the outcome of the climate change lawsuit is negative for Exxon Mobil. If XOM subsequently rebounds, it will have formed a double bottom. That, in turn,  would increase the likelihood that the shares have bottomed for good, boding well for XOM stock going forwardStill, whether or not that scenario plays out, investors should probably wait until after the company releases its earnings and the lawsuit is resolved before buying Exxon stock. At that point, investors may  have the necessary information to determine whether the long-awaited recovery of XOM stock has begun.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-10-25,"General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock has shown signs of life heading into earnings next Tuesday. There has been some good news along the way that has helped General Motors stock rally nearly 6% over the last twelve sessions.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Most notably, a concerning strike by the United Auto Workers union has been resolved. An electric Hummer reportedly is on the way as GM continues its push into electric vehicles. And General Motors stock remains cheap, at just 5.5x 2020 consensus earnings-per-share estimates.But it's simply difficult to pound the table for GM stock at the moment. Recent earnings in the industry highlight where investor attention is focused. GM stock is cheap, but it has been cheap for years now, and that has done little for investors. Going back to the beginning of 2014, even including dividends, shareholders have earned returns of less than 2% annually. &quot;Peak auto&quot; concerns still hover over the stock, and the strike will have a significant short-term impact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith earnings coming on Tuesday morning, there's the potential for a pop. Still, at this point, the story here seems widely known, and the market has made up its mind. GM stock is cheap not because the market isn't paying attention, but because it is. Expectations for GM EarningsFundamentally, General Motors stock does have a nice set up going into earnings. The stock has been rangebound for years now, but the upper end of that range generally includes prices in the low $40's against a current price below $36. Interestingly, there has been heavy buying in Nov. 1 call options at the 38 strike, suggesting some traders see the earnings report as a potential upside catalyst.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up The short-term bull case does make some sense. Management will detail estimates on the cost of the strike, which Bank of America estimated at a whopping $2 billion. But those costs aren't a surprise. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a steep decline in earnings, with the average estimate of $1.31 notably lower than $1.87. And GM earnings historically have beaten estimates: in fact, the company hasn't missed on the bottom line since the first quarter of 2015.Of course, from a broader perspective, that track record is kind of the point. Four-plus years of consecutive earnings beats have done little to drive any real upside in General Motors stock. Top-line performance will be muted: the company already disclosed sales figures at the beginning of the month, which sent GM stock down nearly 4%.There may be an upside earnings surprise on Tuesday. And with GM stock toward (but not at) the lower end of its long-term range, that could be worth a dollar or two to the share price in the near term. But history shows that quarterly beats alone can't move GM stock higher. Reports Elsewhere Raise Concerns for GM StockMeanwhile, a bottom-line beat doesn't even guarantee near-term upside. Rival Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) handily beat earnings estimates on Wednesday afternoon. The stock promptly fell 6% in trading Thursday thanks to downside guidance.Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared on Thursday, gaining 17% despite posting its first year-over-year revenue decline in seven years. The message from the market is simple: it's looking forward to the value of electric vehicles, not backwards at profits from ICE (internal combustion engine) cars.  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction Over time, GM perhaps can change the narrative around its stock by succeeding in electric vehicles. It's making an effort to do just that. But the GM stock price itself shows that investors remain skeptical. Concerns about potentially declining ICE sales in the U.S. and in China, where GM had a woeful quarter, will pressure the stock in the meantime. And the costs of the new UAW deal may only add to those worries.To be clear, this doesn't mean that GM is doomed. It doesn't mean that General Motors stock is a short. But for now, at least, it seems like the market has made up its mind about GM stock. And I'm not sure what the company will do in Q3, or any time soon, to change that. EVs are a long way off. Cyclical worries aren't going anywhere. The valuations of Ford and GM shares, along with the likes of Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and even Toyota (NYSE:TM), show the lack of faith investors have in the industry at the moment.That lack of faith is why GM stock has been trading sideways for years. It will take a lot more than one earnings report to restore that faith.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-29,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV plan to back President Donald Trump in a contentious battle with California officials over automobile emissions rules, splitting with major rivals including Ford Motor Co.GM, Toyota and several other automakers plan to intervene on the administration’s behalf in a lawsuit filed by environmental groups challenging the U.S. Department of Transportation’s rule stripping California of its ability to regulate tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions.The move was announced Monday by John Bozzella, a spokesman for the companies siding with the administration, who call themselves the Coalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation.California and more than 20 other states have filed suit to block the administration’s plan to revoke the state’s powers, a legal battle that threatens to tie up the critical industry standards in litigation for years with an uncertain outcome.“With our industry facing the possibility of multiple overlapping and inconsistent standards that drive up costs and penalize consumers, we had an obligation to intervene,” said Bozzella, who is also chief executive officer of the Association of Global Automakers, an industry trade group. “The decision to intervene in the lawsuit is about how the standard should be applied, not what the standard should be.”The Trump administration last year proposed to dramatically ease federal automobile greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards that had previously been coordinated with California. California officials rebuffed and vowed to continue to enforcing their more stringent standards, which are in place through 2025.To support the proposed rollback, the Trump administration has pointed to government data showing more automakers are taking advantage of a built-in mechanism in the rules by tapping credits earned by exceeding efficiency targets in earlier years to comply with the standards now, rather than through fuel efficiency gains alone.The move by GM and the other companies breaks with Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG, which in July agreed to meet tougher emissions targets set by California. The automakers siding with the administration were harshly criticized by some Democrats, environmental organizations and California regulators.Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said in a statement that the state regulator was disappointed in automakers “hiding behind the Trump administration’s skirts and its assault on public health.”“California will continue to carry out our mandate to meet national air quality standards and keep working with those automakers committed to a framework that delivers cleaner vehicles that benefit consumers and the environment,” Nichols added.Dave Cooke, a senior clean-vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the legal intervention by the companies shows their full support for the Trump administration’s goal of curtailing California’s authority over vehicles.“It’s not just a process question -- they’re going to the mat over state authority, on the side of the administration,” he said in an email.Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said that “to say I’m disappointed is an understatement, especially given the number of times these companies have told me personally that they wish to avoid costly litigation and regulatory uncertainty.”“Instead of choosing the responsible path forged by four automakers and the state of California, one that will move us toward the cleaner, alternative fuel vehicles of the future, these companies have chosen to head down a dead-end road,” Carper said.Most automakers have urged officials in Washington and Sacramento for more than a year to compromise, but no deal materialized after limited talks broke down earlier this year.Still, Bozzella said he held out hope for a middle ground. “We can still reach an agreement that is supported by all the parties,” he said.Ann Carlson, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, was skeptical about that possibility.“‘By throwing their heft behind the Trump position that California lacks the authority to issue its own standards, GM and company are making it even less likely that California and the federal government will reach some sort of compromise,” she wrote in a blog post Monday.(Adds environmental group comment and other details starting seventh paragraph.

2019-11-29,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s once-in-a-generation car slump is hobbling carmakers around the globe that placed their bets on what is the world’s biggest auto market. But one group is weathering the slowdown unscathed: Japan.Iconic car companies like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. are increasing sales in a market that has fallen almost every month since June 2018. They’re doing it by targeting what’s proven to be a sweet spot in the faltering market -- demand for hybrid gasoline-electric cars. Japanese automakers are leaders in the technology, which appeals to Chinese consumers keen to heed the government push toward new-energy vehicles, but aren’t ready to shift to pure-electric autos just yet.“The hybrid I drive now is as reliable as the one I used before but more fuel-efficient,” said Charles Wang, who bought a hybrid Toyota Camry in 2019 after driving a gasoline-powered Honda Accord for six years. “I never regretted my choice of sticking to Japanese cars.”Toyota, maker of the pioneer hybrid model Prius, and peers Honda and Nissan Motor Co. have been early adopters of the technology that combines an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. That’s allowed them to keep sales humming even as demand for gasoline cars wanes and pure-electric vehicles are yet to catch on.Japanese brands boosted sales 4.3% in the first first 10 months of the year, outpacing U.S., European, South Korean and Chinese rivals, according to China Passenger Car Association. Japan is now close to overtaking Germany as the biggest foreign car power in China, though Germany is benefiting from resilient demand for its premium models.Sales of Japanese brands’ hybrids have risen about 30% this year in China to more than 220,000, making the vehicles one of the fastest-growing market segment, according to the association. Japanese carmakers control about 99% of the traditional hybrid market in China, according to numbers from consultancy WAYS Information Technology Co. that exclude plug-in vehicles.Among the reasons shoppers are going for hybrids is range anxiety -- the fear that an electric car’s battery runs out and leaves the driver stranded. China’s charging infrastructure is in early stages, though manufacturers and the government are trying to hasten a buildout.Hybrid demand has also been spurred by those buying a second car, as such customers are more likely to be concerned about fuel consumption, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of CPA.What’s more, providers of mobility services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing are also increasingly moving to hybrids for their fuel efficiency, Cui said. So even if such services will reduce the total sales of cars, the Japanese manufacturers may be less affected than others.Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., which makes cars with both Toyota and Honda, has benefited from robust demand for models such as Camry, Yaris and Accord. GAC Toyota boosted sales 17% and GAC Honda 7% in the first 10 months of the year. That compares with a 11% slump in total industry deliveries, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Guangzhou Auto shares slipped 0.3% Friday morning in Shanghai after earlier rising as much as 2.2%.To ride the trend, Japanese companies touted their new hybrid models at the Guangzhou Auto Show last week. Those include the new Wildlander sport utility vehicle by Toyota and Honda’s Breeze, an SUV that comes in both hybrid and gasoline variants.GAC Honda is preparing to expand its production capabilities in 2020 after running at 120% capacity this year. GAC Toyota plans to add new models annually over the next three years.“GAC is full of confidence in our two Japanese car ventures’ future development,” the carmakers said in a statement responding to Bloomberg’s inquiry. “GAC Honda and GAC Toyota will enlarge its product lineup and add more capacity in line with market demand.”Thus far, the Japanese brands have also weathered China’s cooling economy relatively well. Less-affluent customers in regions outside big cities have been more affected by the slowdown, weighing on sales of lower-end local brands but sparing the mid-prized offerings of Toyota, Nissan and Honda. The lower-end slump has pushed the car industry’s total sales down in 16 of the past 17 months.“Consumers of Japanese-brand cars are mainly middle-class buyers with steady and decent income,” said PCA’s Cui. “They are less impacted by the slowing economy.”(Updates with Guangzhou Auto shares in 10th paragraph)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Tian Ying in Beijing at ytian@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Ville HeiskanenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Japanese Hybrids Are Beating the Slump in China’s Car Market

2019-12-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has a problem with selling its hybrids -- it can’t get enough of them.“The only thing holding us back on hybrids is capacity,” Bob Carter, Toyota’s North American executive vice president for sales, told reporters on Thursday at an event in Detroit. “We can’t make enough Corolla and RAV4 hybrids.”While many of its competitors are walking away from hybrids and plowing billions into battery-powered cars, the Japanese automaker has seen demand surge for its 14 gasoline-electric models. Toyota’s hybrids accounted for 13% of total Toyota and Lexus brand sales in the U.S. last month and made up nearly a quarter of the volume for its top seller, the RAV4 compact SUV.Toyota could easily sell twice the number of hybrid RAV4 models, but can’t source enough electric batteries for the popular vehicle, Carter said. It currently has an 11-day supply of them in stock, compared to more than 20 days’ supply of gasoline-powered versions, he said.Carter said the RAV4 hybrid’s appeal has as much to do with features like sporty styling, extra torque and all-wheel drive as it does with its combined 40 miles per gallon fuel economy -- 10 mpg above the gas-only model.Toyota plans to shift production of the RAV4 hybrid from Canada to a plant in Kentucky early next year, and also add a plug-in hybrid option from next summer to be imported from Japan. But that growing demand for hybrid versions of the RAV4, Corolla and other Toyota vehicles has come at the expense of its most famous hybrid, the Prius, sales of which are down 21% so far this year.To contact the reporter on this story: Chester Dawson in Southfield at cdawson54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chester Dawson at cdawson54@bloomberg.net, David Welch, Kevin MillerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Toyota’s Biggest Problem Is Keeping Hybrid Car Models in Stock

2019-12-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.The billionaire behind six-month-old Vietnamese auto startup VinFast plans a feat even Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. couldn’t pull off during their early days: sell a car in the U.S.Pham Nhat Vuong, the Southeast Asian country’s richest man and now in charge of the new automaker, is so intent on exporting electric vehicles to the lucrative American market in 2021 that he’s plowing as much as $2 billion of his own fortune to reach that goal. His cash would account for half the capital investment of VinFast, which began delivering cars to Vietnamese consumers with BMW-licensed engines earlier this year and aims to expand into electric vehicles.“Our ultimate goal is to create an international brand,” the 51-year-old tycoon said in an interview at the Hanoi headquarters of the car company’s parent Vingroup JSC, which Vuong founded and holds the title of chairman. “It will be a very difficult road and we will have to put in a lot of effort. But there’s only one road ahead.”The homegrown cars made under Vuong’s sprawling real estate-to-hospitals conglomerate faces an uphill battle to succeed overseas. Carmakers such as India’s Tata Motors Ltd. and Malaysia’s Proton Holdings Bhd. struggled to win over consumers away from their home turf. Even in Vietnam, VinFast Trading and Production LLC has formidable competition from established foreign players such as Toyota, Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai.Shares of Vingroup fell as much as 2% Tuesday. The benchmark VN Index of Vietnamese stocks dropped 0.6%.VinFast follows a long list of Chinese automakers that have also had ambitions to sell vehicles in the U.S. going back more than a decade. Though the plans have yet come to fruition, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Zotye Automobile Co. and others have set up local sales units and research-and-development operations to show just how serious they are. Some Chinese brands have also exhibited at American auto shows in recent years.Vuong, whose net worth is $9.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is undaunted. Vingroup sold some shares last year and he plans to sell as much as 10% of his own to raise funds for the ambitious project. He owns 49% of VinFast, while the parent, Vingroup, holds 51%.The automaker won’t be profitable for as many as five years, said Vuong, adding the local market is “too small” and overseas sales are key to becoming profitable. Vuong directly owns 26% of Vingroup, according to Bloomberg data. Vietnam Investment Group JSC, in which Vuong has about a 92% stake, holds 31.6% of Vingroup.And VinFast will have to overcome an even more daunting task of winning over demanding consumers in the U.S. and other developed markets, where emissions and crash standards are stringent.Adding to these challenges is successfully manufacturing and selling electric vehicles. Many Chinese startups, backed by billions of dollars in funding, bet on the prospects for EVs in the world’s biggest auto market, but few are making money. BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co., China’s biggest maker of pure electric cars, forecasts a 2019 loss. Unprofitable NIO Inc., which is traded in New York, has struggled to assuage concerns that it’s running short on cash amid sputtering demand.High HurdlesVinFast’s first EV won’t roll off its assembly line until late next year, but Vuong said he plans to export those vehicles to the U.S., Europe and Russia in 2021.VinFast must clear several high hurdles to compete outside Vietnam, said Michael Dunne, chief executive officer of automotive consultant ZoZo Go LLC, which specializes in the Asian market. “It will be some time before the company is ready to compete in the U.S. -- still the world’s toughest market,” he said. “You need a solid brand name.”Many consumers prefer a second-hand Honda Motor Co. or Toyota vehicle over a new car with an unfamiliar brand name, Dunne said. The Vietnamese automaker will need to produce at least 100,000 vehicles a year to be cost competitive, develop a global brand and establish a parts-and-services network, he said. Still, VinFast has an opportunity to crack smaller Southeast Asian markets, he said.VinFast, which operates a 335-hectare factory in the northern port city of Haiphong, is selling its first line of vehicles -- a hatchback, sedan and SUV -- at below cost. The hatchback retails for the equivalent of $17,000, while the four-cylinder sedan goes for $47,400 and its SUV is offered at $60,400. The company targets production of as many as 500,000 vehicles a year by 2025. The carmarker also makes electric scooters.In the next few years, Vingroup will have to spend “many trillions of dong per year” to cover losses for VinFast, estimated at as much as 18 trillion ($777 million) annually, Vuong said. Those losses include financing and depreciation, and as much as 7 trillion dong each year to absorb the hit of selling cars below cost, he added.Vingroup will divest stakes in other units to fund VinFast while other subsidiaries have been ordered to reduce costs, Vuong said, without providing details. VinFast will also seek additional loans, in addition to about $1.95 billion of international loans it has already raised. Vuong also plans to list VinFast on a Vietnamese exchange and possibly overseas, he said, without elaborating.“We have the desire to build a Vietnamese brand that has a world-class reputation,” he said. “Our biggest challenge is that Vietnamese products do not have an international brand. To many international friends, Vietnam is still a poor, backward country. We will have to find a way to market and prove our products represent a dynamic and developing Vietnam that has reached the highest standards of the world.”(In an earlier version, company corrects share sale information in 7th paragraph to say Vingroup sold some shares last year, not the founder.)&#92;--With assistance from Ville Heiskanen.To contact the reporters on this story: Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi at giang1@bloomberg.net;K.

2019-12-20,"Seemingly everywhere you look, the narrative for Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) appears positive. Primarily, both the U.S. and the world are increasingly gravitating toward clean energy. This dynamic supports PLUG stock, as the underlying company specializes in hydrogen fuel cells. Unlike gasoline combustion mechanisms, the only exhaust product of hydrogen-powered vehicles is water.Source: Shutterstock On paper, hydrogen is a compelling fuel source. As scientists have discovered, hydrogen is the most abundant element not just on earth, but in the universe. Since we will never run out of the stuff, we theoretically shouldn't have the price volatility inherent in fossil fuels. That too bolsters the longer-term bullish thesis for Plug Power stock.Finally, the element is actually safer than you might think. When most people hear about hydrogen, they immediately think about the Hindenburg disaster. But, as Washington State University researcher Jacob Leachman explained, the Hindenburg's developers cut many safety corners.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore importantly, hydrogen dissipates very rapidly. Leachman explains that a hydrogen flame, &quot;tends to burn out, and up and away&quot; from the [ignition source], very quickly. Other academic institutions and corporations have tested this concept, confirming Leachman's statement. In contrast, gasoline fires almost always linger, creating even more fire hazards. Indirectly, this safety aspect is a big plus for PLUG stock.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 Additionally, for most of this year, Plug Power stock has been one of the surprise hits of 2019. Between January's opening price and November's closing session, PLUG skyrocketed more than 214%. Naturally, this robust rally got many fence-sitters interested.However, in this month, PLUG stock has shed nearly 24%. Is the bull case for the alternative-fuel company fading, or should investors continue to hold? Unfortunately for PLUG Stock, You Can't Cheat ScienceEven for those who are bullish on Plug Power stock, nearly everyone concedes that shares belong in the speculative category. After all, the PLUG price once traded in four-digit territory. Call me cynical, but there's usually a reason why an equity loses 99.8% of its market value.That reason comes down to science. As far as we know, we cannot cheat the physical laws of this universe. Generally speaking, the concept of alternative energy involves duping the public into believing that we can get practical energy cleanly and cheaply.For instance, hydrogen's unsinkable abundance should support PLUG stock. However, the reason it hasn't over these years is that hydrogen is not a practical fuel source. Principally, this element has very tight tolerances. It must be kept in liquid form, as any other form like ice or steam will fail to create energy.Furthermore, keeping hydrogen in its viable form requires energy -- and creating hydrogen in that form to begin with is an expensive process. We also haven't even talked about transporting hydrogen, which is also an onerous and costly procedure. Unfortunately, these grossly inconvenient factors limit the ultimate market for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Logically, this also presents headwinds for PLUG stock.Now, it's true that hydrogen-powered vehicles are cleaner for the environment. Also, they typically have greater range than electric vehicles, all other things being equal. However, is that enough for convincing more investors to jump aboard Plug Power stock?Ultimately, I think it comes down to the economics. According to several reports, a record number of people care about the environment. However, that sentiment might go out the window if green initiatives start hurting the wallet, because the bottom line is that hydrogen-fueled vehicles are too pricey for most consumers. Plug Power Stock Is an ExperimentPart of the long-term allure of PLUG stock is that advancing technologies could make hydrogen a viable alternative fuel source. Personally, I think both physical laws and economics work against this idea.Still, major companies like Toyota (NYSE:TM) are stepping forward and cheerleading the hydrogen narrative. Additionally, Toyota's native Japan is poised to take leadership in proving the concept of a hydrogen-based society.Does this move the needle for PLUG stock? Not really. Here's the painful truth: Toyota has ample funds to experiment with whatever they'd like, and they do. Some of those experiments will lead to practical innovations and others won't make it past the cutting room floor. That's the luxury that typically only the biggest companies in the world has.Obviously, PLUG doesn't have that luxury. If the company falters in its experimental bid, that's it. Shares will drop to penny stock status at best. For most investors, I imagine that's too steep of a risk.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-09,"As with many other stocks in 2019, General Electric (NYSE:GE) ended with a nice bullish move. Starting in early October, shares of GE stock went from $8.28 to around $12 per share. This put the year-long return for 2019 at about 53%, which exceeded the gain on the S&P 500.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com This performance, though, is more than just about general optimism in the overall markets. CEO Larry Culp has done a standout job at the helm since coming on board in October 2018.Although, this should not be a surprise. When he was the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) -- from 2000 to 2014 -- there was a five-fold jump in both the revenues and market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHe showed that he can effectively manage the strategic vision, as well as the nuanced details of a complex organization. He also demonstrated a great ability to apply process methodologies, like lean manufacturing -- which strives for continuous improvement. This approach was initially innovated at Toyota (NYSE:TM).  * 8 of the Strangest Stocks Worth Your Time When Culp became CEO of GE, the situation was dire. The company had gone through two CEOs, the shares were delisted from the Dow, the dividend was slashed and the losses were piling up. From 2016 to 2018, the General Electric stock went from $32 to under $7.However, Culp put together a smart playbook to right the ship. Of course, a key part of this was an aggressive focus on reducing the bloated cost structure. He also was swift in unloading assets, like the biotech business and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR).Yet, this was mostly about the low-hanging fruit. Going forward, it will likely be more difficult to find ways to improve the organization. Many Problems RemainOne of the biggest issues for GE stock is the GE engine segment, which accounts for a hefty 60% of the industrial profits. The problem, of course, is Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which has been sidelined due to two traffic airline crashes. It is still far from clear when production and deliveries will resume. But in the meantime, GE is feeling the impact, with a quarterly loss of $400 million in cash flows. This is likely to put lots of pressure on the company given the enormous debt load of $93.2 billion.Furthermore, the other company segments are also lagging. For example, even though the Power business has shown improvement, revenues were still off by 14% in the latest quarter. What's more, the Healthcare Systems unit has been mostly lackluster, with a meager 5% increase on the top line. There has continued to be weakness in China and the Middle East.Then there is GE Capital, which is suffering from the liabilities of its long-term care business. In the quarter, there was a loss of $645 million. Bottom Line on the GE Stock PriceFor the most part, Culp has stabilized operations, which is definitely crucial. Not long ago, there were serious concerns about the viability of GE; The situation had gotten that bad.But despite all this, it does look like that much of the good news has already been factored into GE stock. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 18x, which is rich for a company that still has a host of problems. By comparison, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) trades at 20X and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is at 18X. No doubt, both of these companies are on much more solid footing.So, at least in the near-term, it's probably best to be cautious with GE stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2020-01-10,"It's hard to believe there was a time when computer industry professionals pejoratively called Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) &quot;the poor man's&quot; Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). That descriptor is absolutely laughable today. In 2019, Advanced Micro Devices stock destroyed the markets, returning nearly 155% for stakeholders. That compare's to INTC's respectable but comparatively pedestrian 33% return.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com More importantly, AMD is not content resting on its laurels. Instead, management has demonstrated killer instincts, sticking it to its longtime rival at the Consumer Electronics Show. The annual tech trade show attracts the best of the best, turning Sin City into Silicon Valley for four days. And what Advanced Micro brought to the table may sustain momentum in the AMD stock price.Among the many chips and processors that they displayed for various computing applications, the biggest buzz was around the latest-generation Ryzen Threadripper. Designed specifically for content creators, financial analysts and other data-intensive users, the Threadripper features a whopping 64 separate computing cores on a single chip. That breaks a consumer-level record, undoubtedly whetting the appetite for Advanced Micro Devices stock. It's also twice the number of cores of the previous-gen Threadripper.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnother innovation is the Ryzen 4000 Mobile, which is optimized for laptop applications. Though not independently tested, AMD claims that it can outperform Intel's Ice Lake chips by a country mile. On paper, that adds to more pressure on Intel while bolstering AMD stock.And what does Intel have to offer in response? Unfortunately, more excuses about supply shortages. To be fair, Intel showcased innovations in folding laptops. But in terms of processing prowess and power, it was overshadowed by AMD.  * 9 Boring Stocks to Buy You Should Never Let Go Of So, has Advanced Micro Devices stock become a no-brainer for 2020? Here's my take. Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Match the Hype?One thing I can say for certain about AMD is that its product innovations deserve high praise. From a business perspective, I appreciate the strategic shift from playing the discount-leader game to becoming a legitimate innovator. Perhaps the greatest victory is that for once, Intel is looking over its shoulders with envy at AMD stock.If buying semiconductors was all about the underlying product, I'd give Advanced Micro Devices stock the green light without hesitation. However, there's more to it than that. While AMD has competed impressively against its bigger and better-resourced rivals, the company is winning one component of the semiconductor game. And that component is becoming less relevant.Now, don't get me wrong -- producing record-breaking processors is always a strong accomplishment. But the modern semiconductor industry is more than just fitting an increasing number of cores for high-speed performance. Rather, it's putting all the cogs together for a cohesive platform.Although Intel may have disappointed at CES, one company that stood out was Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Basking in the glow of last year's Turing graphics processing units, Nvidia decided to debut other innovations for this year's edition. One of those was a Toyota (NYSE:TM)-made robot that runs on Nvidia's chips. Through a virtual reality setup, a human operator controls the lifelike robot.In other words, Nvidia isn't just sitting on its throne, pumping out faster and faster GPUs. To be sure, it's doing that. But the company is also investing its resources toward groundbreaking innovations, such as robotics. More pointedly, making super-fast GPUs is becoming a commoditized exercise. The real money is pioneering novel platforms and applications.  * 7 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now This alone isn't necessarily a knock on Advanced Micro Devices stock. But investors may want something different to justify driving shares higher. Contrarianism Won't Help the AMD Stock PriceAs we all know, markets typically run in cycles. After a strong, sustained bullish run, investors often table profits and seek the next undervalued play. And with its recent annual returns, Advanced Micro Device stock is far from undervalued.Furthermore, if I was a contrarian, I'd rather look at the other well-known semiconductors. As I mentioned earlier, Nvidia offers exciting innovations beyond GPUs. Late last summer, the company revealed their progress in developing conversational artificial intelligence. That could potentially launch its own tech subsegment.If I really wanted to go contrarian, I'd look at Intel. Yes, the company looks like a blubbering idiot, but isn't that a contrarian's dream? After all, Intel is a great innovator going through a rough patch. Even if you were bearish on the tech firm, you got to admit that it won't stay defeated forever.Thus, the bottom line is that AMD stock has earned a seat at the table. Obviously, that's worth something. But right now, the underlying company's competitors offer a more attractive pathway to profitability.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s stock is soaring, and traditional auto manufacturers are staging glitzy presentations of new plug-in models. You’d think the electric-vehicle age was finally dawning.But so far, Tesla is the only car company looking likely to benefit in the coming years. Look at every other corner of the U.S. auto industry -- the world’s most valuable automaker, dealers, consumer surveys and market forecasts -- and a more ominous picture emerges.A top American executive for Toyota Motor Corp., whose market value is still more than double Tesla’s even after Elon Musk’s epic run, recently warned of electric-car catastrophe. Auto retailers caution growth will be slow, citing still-high battery costs and range constraints. And far more U.S. shoppers are willing to kick the tires on a hybrid than cars that only plug in.The cause for concern remains as EVs start to appear in showrooms in greater numbers. The models on the market will swell almost sevenfold to 121 models in the next half decade, from 18 now, according to LMC Automotive. But the researcher sees all those vehicles claiming just 5.5% of U.S. sales in 2025.“We’re going to see electrified Armageddon,” Bob Carter, Toyota’s executive vice president of North American sales, told reporters in December. “Supply is going to get ahead of true customer demand.”There is irony, of course, in Carter predicting an EV reckoning just as Tesla was wrapping up a record year. The dim view he holds is not unique among legacy automakers, which have spent more than a century building and selling cars that burn fossil fuel. But that cautious mindset is rooted in pragmatism -- profits remain elusive in the high-cost, high-price EV business.That’s why Toyota and other automakers have been reluctant to dive head-first into EVs until they’re closer to reaching price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, which BloombergNEF predicts will happen around 2024.Tesla is being rewarded for not waiting: Its shares surged another 6% on Tuesday to $540.94, a new intraday record. The stock has doubled since Tesla reported a surprise third-quarter profit in October, bringing the company closer to a $100 billion market value.EV sales are expected to grow to be roughly the size of the shrinking mid-size car segment by mid-decade, to about 934,000 units, LMC says. But whereas the meager family sedan market will be split between just 13 models, the researcher expects there to be more than nine times as many EVs fighting for air.Thanks to its hot-selling Model 3 sedan, Tesla accounted for nearly eight-in-10 EV sales in America last year. By 2025, LMC sees Tesla offering seven models that will account for a quarter of segment sales. That would leave the 114 competing offerings from other automakers averaging annual sales of 6,145 per model, or about 118 units a week.“It’s tough to make a business out of that volume per EV,” said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC. “Electric vehicles are the future. What’s in question is when that future will arrive and when it pays off? It’s a long road and there definitely could be some carnage along the way.”Automakers, fearing they’ll be left behind if they don’t accelerate their shift from the internal combustion engine, are going to great lengths to build buzz for new electric models.Ford Motor Co. staged a star-studded unveiling of its Mustang Mach-E in an airplane hangar a short stroll from SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company. Porsche debuted its Taycan using Niagara Falls, a Chinese wind farm and a German solar site as backdrops.But with the notable exception of the Model 3, consumers have not been charged up by the highly touted electric offerings already on the market.Sales of the Chevrolet Bolt sagged almost 9% last year and the Nissan Leaf slumped 16%, with neither cresting 17,000 units. Last month, Mercedes-Benz put off the U.S. debut of its first EV by a year after Jaguar and Audi struggled to sell their first electric offerings.So far, only Tesla and its billionaire chief executive officer have come up with an alluring amalgam of status and sex appeal.“Tesla has created the market by having a mystique,” said Art St. Cyr, the head of American auto operations for Honda Motor Co., pointing to Musk’s Model 3. “If Honda, Toyota, GM or Ford made that vehicle, we probably wouldn’t sell them in those numbers.”Honda, Ford and Toyota, which all have a history of selling hybrids, see them prevailing for the time being because mainstream buyers continue to suffer “range anxiety” -- the fear of being stranded by running out of juice in an EV.“People are not generally willing to pay more to be inconvenienced,” St. Cyr said.General Motors Co. is jumping more aggressively into EVs, with plans to field 20 models worldwide by 2023 and sell 1 million by 2026. It’s joining forces with South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. to build a $2.3 billion battery factory in Lordstown, Ohio, where the car manufacturer stopped building gasoline-fueled Chevrolet Cruze compacts last year.“Customers aren’t interested in hybrids,” Mary Barra, GM’s CEO, said during an industry conference in November.But a study released by Deloitte this month found 27% of U.S. consumers are actively considering a hybrid, while just 8% are looking at pure electrics. Some 59% of Americans still want gasoline-powered cars, the highest of any country Deloitte surveyed globally.Government mandates have made China the world’s top market for EVs, and European regulators also are stimulating demand with incentives to help reach more stringent goals for reduced emissions.But in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has sought to ease car-pollution rules and fuel is cheap, consumers are in no hurry to ditch the gas pump. The Deloitte study found consumers in the U.S. are most concerned about a lack of charging stations.“The automotive ecosystem still has some work to do in terms of making EVs as easy and convenient as internal-combustion engines,” said Craig Giffi, Deloitte’s vice chairman.The onslaught of new EVs coming could actually help solve the problem. Until now, most EVs other than Tesla’s have been boring “compliance cars” aimed at meeting tougher regulations, said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering at AAA, which just conducted a survey that found 96% of EV owners would buy another because the experience was better than expected.“Most people are looking for a crossover utility vehicle these days,” Brannon said. “Now, we’re seeing some of those coming, and that’s what it’s going to take. It has to be something people want to drive and can get excited about.”The pickup segment, home to the three best-selling models in the U.S., is about to get jolt, too. Musk caused a sensation with the unveiling of the Cybertruck in November. Ford has an electric truck under development recently filmed towing 1 million pounds of loaded rail cars. And Amazon.com Inc.-backed Rivian Automotive Inc. plans to roll out its R1T starting late this year.But for all the hype about the chips automakers are pushing forward on the table, it’s unclear when or if their gamble will pay off.“Somebody’s got to buy these things,” said Toyota’s Carter. “There is a market. The question is: How big and when will it mature?”(Updates with Tesla shares in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from David Welch, Gabrielle Coppola, Chester Dawson and Melinda Grenier.To contact the reporter on this story: Keith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan at knaughton3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, ;Dimitra Kessenides at dkessenides1@bloomberg.net, Keith NaughtonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Tesla Created Demand for Electric Cars, But Only for Teslas"

2020-02-05,"(Bloomberg) -- California’s top environmental official criticized General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. for backing the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke the state’s authority to regulate auto emissions, saying she hoped car companies had learned by now to work with the powerful agency.The tough rules California has implemented and enforced for years already have had an impact on automakers, Mary Nichols, the chairman of the state’s Air Resources Board, said Tuesday at the BNEF Summit in San Francisco. She believes the regulator deserves some credit for the industry’s plans to field more electric vehicles in the near future.“We’ve had something to do with that here in California, and I’m pleased with that,” Nichols said. “In the case of General Motors and Toyota, just to name a couple of names, to have them not understand that California had actually helped them in all this in so many ways is disappointing.”GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and several other carmakers filed legal motions last fall that sided with President Donald Trump’s administration in the court battle over its rule to strip California of the authority to set its own tailpipe-emissions standards. The skirmish is a key aspect of the White House’s move to dismantle tougher fuel economy rules set by the Obama administration.The clash with California also has fractured the industry. On California’s side are four automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., which last summer agreed to meet rules that would be a compromise between Obama’s standards and Trump’s plans.In a statement, Toyota said it has consistently supported a single approach for fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards. “We do not believe that there should be different fuel economy standards in different states,” the company said.GM said it will continue to develop electric vehicles, regardless of what the fuel efficiency standards dictate. “GM remains committed to feasible, year-over-year improvements in conventional fuel economy in addition to our leading investments in electrification,” the company said in a statement.The dust-up led Nichols to skip her annual visit to the auto industry’s major vehicle show in Los Angeles last fall. She and other environmental officials usually tour the event and talk to executives about their latest technologies.“I was feeling a little bit like I didn’t want to hang out and sort of have jolly conversations with the companies that were also suing us,” Nichols said.(Adds comment from Toyota and GM starting in sixth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Ryan Beene in Washington at rbeene@bloomberg.net;Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","California Chides GM, Toyota for Backing Trump on Fuel Rules"

2020-02-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. isn’t letting a global slowdown get in the way of its plans to grow, reporting a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and raising its full-year forecast.Even as a production shutdown in China, the world’s largest car market, has cast a pall over global automakers already struggling to cope with a downshift in demand and rising costs on next-generation technology, Toyota is betting it can sell more cars.“The global market in 2020 will be probably lower than what was the market in 2019, but you saw our forecast in terms of sales volume for 2020 and we plan to sell more cars than in 2019 -- even if the market is declining,” Didier Leroy, a Toyota executive vice president, said at a press conference in Tokyo.Toyota is targeting operating profit of 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion) for the full fiscal year through March, up from a previous projection for 2.4 trillion yen and broadly in line with analysts’ expectations.That contrasts with U.S. rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., both of which lost money in the last quarter of 2019. GM expects earnings to be flat this calendar year while Ford forecast a larger-than-expected drop in profits.Shares of Toyota rose 2.6% in Tokyo, the biggest jump since July. The stock is just shy of its four-year high.Supplier SqueezeToyota’s bullish outlook reflects less severe yen appreciation than it had feared, higher profit margins in North America and Europe, and relentless cost cutting -- much of which has been borne by the company’s tight network of suppliers.Japanese auto parts manufacturer Denso Corp. last month slashed its profit outlook, and both it and fellow Toyota group components maker Aisin Seiki Co. missed analysts’ forecasts for quarterly earnings. Toyota owns 35% of Denso and 39% of Aisin.“It’s a very severe situation for our suppliers,” Masayoshi Shirayanagi, Toyota’s operating officer in charge of purchasing, told reporters in Tokyo. He said the automaker is working to strengthen those ties by taking suggestions for loosening tight specifications and easing exacting standards where possible.“Last year, we met with the heads of companies in our supplier associations in a group discussion and they expressed some unhappiness with Toyota,” Shirayanagi said.Operating income in the fiscal third quarter, which ended in December, was 654 billion yen, topping the average analyst forecast of 643.8 billion yen. Revenue came to 7.54 trillion yen, compared with the consensus estimate for 7.42 trillion yen.Big in EuropeDespite softening sales volumes in Japan, North America and China, Toyota benefited from steady growth in Europe, where hybrid gas-electric vehicles accounted for 52% of its sales last year. Profit margin in the region climbed in the latest quarter to 4.6% from 3.2% a year ago.“Hybrid vehicles are chosen by more than half of our customers and this has boosted our overall sales in Europe,” Leroy said.That has given a boost to the company’s mainstream Toyota brand -- sales of which last year exceeded 1 million vehicles for the first time since 2008 -- and helped its Lexus luxury brand post a double-digit sales growth.RAV4 CountryIn North America, operating profit rose to 105.9 billion yen, nearly four times the 26.4 billion in the year-earlier period. That came despite a 2% slide in sales volume to 668,000.Company officials attributed that profit surge to a number of factors, including a shift in production toward more light trucks such as sport utility vehicles and pickups. The company has been reworking its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. to crank out more SUVs such as its best-selling RAV4 and popular mid-size Highlander and cope with slow sales of sedans like its Camry model.“The U.S. Highlander is fresh while RAV4 is very strong,” said Tatsuo Yoshida, senior auto analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Full-year guidance was revised up, but fourth-quarter assumptions are conservative and it is likely Toyota eventually beats its guidance.”Virus ImpactToyota expects its global sales volume for the fiscal year to hit 8.95 million vehicles, unchanged from an earlier projection. Including group companies, it sold 10.7 million vehicles last calendar year, second only to Volkswagen AG’s 10.9 million. GM sold 8.4 million vehicles last year and Ford shipped about 5.4 million.One wild card is the impact from the production shutdown in China due to the spread of a deadly virus. Toyota said late last month it would extend a planned work stoppage at its Chinese factories until at least Feb. 9.Japan’s largest automaker said its profit forecast doesn’t take the shutdown into account and that it is still assessing the likely impact on its earnings and global supply chain from a protracted work stoppage.“The impact of this new additional problem is really unclear at this stage,” Toyota’s Leroy said.Toyota said sales in its home market were hit hard by an October sales tax hike, with income and sales declining in the latest quarter. But Japan is still its most lucrative market, where it earned more than 400 billion yen in profit and boasted margins topping 10%.&#92;--With assistance from Tsuyoshi Inajima.To contact the reporter on this story: Chester Dawson in Southfield at cdawson54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Ville Heiskanen, Reed StevensonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Toyota in Growth Mode Defies Slowdown in Global Vehicle Demand

2020-03-20,"When I last wrote about General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock in early January, I warned investors to be cautious. And since then, shares have gone from $12 to $6.7, for a loss of 44%.Source: Carsten Reisinger / Shutterstock.com None of my analysis had to do with the coronavirus from China, which was just emerging. But of course, the world is much different now -- and unfortunately, I still think investors should continue to stay away from GE stock. Strong Leadership Isn't EnoughIt's true that CEO Larry Culp has done a standout job since he took the helm in Oct. 2018.  He is a proven leader who knows how to run complex organizations.  Keep in mind that from 2000 to 2014 he was the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), which saw a five-fold increase in stock value during his tenure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCulp's leadership combines the right mix of strategic vision and understanding of the details. He also is a big believer in process methodologies, like lean, which allow for continuous improvement. Such strategies have their roots to the early days of Toyota (NYSE:TM).  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw While all this will be helpful, the fact is that it will not be enough. There are just too many serious issues facing GE stock right now.After all, before Culp came on board, the company was in dire straights. GE posted major losses on the bottom line and there was a slashing of the dividend. In fact, the shares had to be delisted from the prestigious Dow. Note that all of this happened while the economy was doing quite well.Now, Culp has certainly taken swift actions. He has continued to cut costs and unload various assets, such as from the medical business, to reduce the debt load. But this will probably not matter much either. If anything, Culp will need to take deeper actions -- and fast. GE is particularly vulnerable as most of its businesses are cyclical, except for the healthcare segment. So as the world plunges into recession, the company's cash flows will come under extreme pressure.Granted, GE is expected to get $21 billion from DHR for the sale of its biopharma division. There is also about $35 billion in credit lines. In other words, GE should have sufficient liquidity. But there will still likely be losses across most of its businesses. The aviation engine business is certainly in jeopardy as world travel comes to a grinding halt. Boeing (NYSE:BA), of course, has already requested a $60 billion bailout for itself and numerous suppliers.What's more, even though GE has been shedding its energy assets, there is still exposure to this market. The company still has a 37% stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR). Since early January, the shares have gone from $25 to $9.84. And the Power unit, which has been recovering lately, will also like deteriorate. Consider that the business has been cash-flow negative. The Bottom Line On GE StockBack on March 4th, GE put out guidance for its 2020 cash flows, which are expected to come in at $3 billion, compared to $2.3 billion last year. But this didn't factor in the coronavirus impact. And in light of the wide-scale closures of businesses across the US and parts of Europe, it's hard to see how this forecast could hold up.  It's also important to note that GE's aviation engine business accounts for about 60% of industrial profits. Thus, the next couple quarterly reports could be fairly bad.  So right now -- with all the uncertainty and the high exposure to economically sensitive parts of the global economy -- there's really no reason to buy into GE stock.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

The two hope to have running prototypes on Japanese roads this year. Commercial production is possible, but no timeline was mentioned. Toyota will be in charge of the fuel cell system and controls.

2020-03-27,"Despite my long-term bullishness, I concede that the wild swings in the markets have been discomfiting for my readers. Truly, we're witnessing an unprecedented response to this crisis that will impose both societal and economic scars. As you might expect, companies which are levered to consumer sentiment like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have taken a beating. At one point, TSLA stock was driving toward four-digit prices. Now, it's well off its record highs.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Nonetheless, with shares above $500, TSLA stock is actually one of the best-performing stocks of this year, up nearly 21%. That's remarkable considering that the Nasdaq Composite is still down about 15% year-to-date despite recent substantial momentum.On Wednesday, the Senate approved a historic $2 trillion stimulus package, designed to support floundering businesses and provide immediate relief to American families. And Friday it passed in the House of Representatives.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, many questions remain about how the U.S. will fight the coronavirus from China pandemic, and more importantly, how we as a nation will recover. Understandably, broader hesitation exists toward discretionary retail names. Nevertheless, I believe investors can find encouragement that TSLA stock has remained strong amid the turmoil.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks Crashing on the Coronavirus Pandemic That said, here are a few reasons why you should consider Tesla's market discount. TSLA Stock Has a Great PR BoostOn Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases. Although it's not a great statistic, anybody that has been closely following trends understands that this was inevitable. As I'll explain later, it doesn't take away from the fact that we're heading toward the end of this crisis.Unfortunately, the one concerning outlier is the state of New York. At time of writing, it had nearly 39,000 cases, a figure that will explode higher over the next 24 hours. The most crucial problem is that hospitals in high-risk areas such as New York City are desperately running low on beds and ventilators.However, Tesla is stepping up big time, with CEO Elon Musk announcing that he will reopen the New York Gigafactory quickly to manufacture ventilators for Covid-19 patients in that state. For people suffering from the disease, this move is a godsend.Additionally, the perception of the government response has been very negative. Thus, Tesla has the opportunity to play the hero. But will that help TSLA stock?Obviously, it couldn't hurt. But various studies demonstrate that &quot;modern consumers trade in the currency of goodwill.&quot; And with word of mouth traveling at the speed of light, this is a huge moment for Tesla and TSLA stock. Traditional Automakers Can't Take AdvantageThat said, not everything is going Tesla's way. A significant headwind is that Saudi Arabia and Russia are now engaged in an oil price war. Because this deeply affects the domestic oil industry, the U.S. has urged Saudi Arabia to stand down.We'll see what comes of it. Even if the Saudis end the oil war, it won't immediately send oil back to prior highs. After all, this isn't just a supply issue but rather a demand problem. Thus, with lower prices at the pump, this dynamic theoretically bolsters traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM).The thing is, their shares are in the red for the year, whereas TSLA stock is well in the black. In my opinion, cheap gasoline prices alone won't reverse this circumstance.As you know, the pandemic has been brutal for all automakers due to global supply chain disruptions. Mathematically, though, this headwind impacts traditional manufacturers over the long run more so than it does Tesla and other electric vehicle companies.That's because EVs have fewer moving parts, translating to a simpler, streamlined platform. On the other hand, a car with an internal-combustion engine has tens of thousands of parts. Some could be critical, meaning that a little component built in some far-off land could keep you grounded indefinitely. Bottom Line on TSLA StockTesla remains one of the best-performing stocks on the market in 2020 so far. Additionally, it doesn't stand to be impacted as hard by the coronavirus as some of the other automakers -- meaning TSLA stock remains an interesting pick here.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-03-31,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (NYSE: FCAU), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) have all announced that they plan to reopen their plants in early or mid-April. Each company is hoping to start ramping up production as soon as possible in an effort to losses.Last week, the world's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) announced that it is burning approximately $2.2 billion each week. This represents approximately 40% of last year's average weekly revenues. That number is huge, especially when compared with average weekly revenues. If such large outflows are happening to the world's biggest car producer, other automakers are facing the same or even worse scenarios. Many large companies are already scrambling for additional credit in order to fortify their cash reserves. Volkswagen even called the European Central Bank to speed up its plan to buy commercial papers directly from companies. To sum up, when you see those numbers and hear such news, the reason to restart production becomes quite clear.Plans Of Other AutomakersFord announced that it plans to reopen five plants that produce Ford pickups, SUVs, vans and commercial trucks. All plants will include stronger safety measures in order to protect workers' health. However, the United Automotive Workers union has met the move with skepticism and concern.Last week, UAW's President Rory Gamble announced that a Fiat Chrysler employee died of COVID-19. Soon after, the number of Chrysler's employees who passed away increased to four. As a result, Fiat Chrysler said that plants across the U.S. and Canada will remain closed until April 14.  Honda announced that it plans to resume production on April 7. Toyota said their plants will remain silent until April 20.On the other side, GM informed its workers that it is extending temporary closures of its North American plants. Reopening dates were not mentioned. They explained that the situation is dynamic and that it can change on a weekly basis.Automakers Racing To Come To The RescueU.S. automakers have a history of stepping up during times of conflict. Ford has built bomber airplanes and GM assault crafts during wartime. Both companies, along with Toyota and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), have pledged to produce ventilators and other medical equipment until this crisis is over. But this sort of switch is by no means easy. Workers at an automobile plant are not specially trained for this production that also involves intellectual property rights, regulatory approvals, and safety considerations.Even still, help is sorely needed. COVID-19 is getting momentum in the U.S., with daily new cases growing at an exponential rate. Since last Monday, the number of infected people has increased by 100,000, which means it has more than tripled in only seven days.Given the unprecedented circumstances of this global health crisis, everything remains unclear. In the meantime, automakers are in a race against the clock if they want to help save lives.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAM Newswire.

Year to date through April 6, it is up 23.4%, significantly better than the 18.4% decline of the U.S. markets as a whole. Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Who knew that Tesla could be a good hedge against a falling market? Most likely, anyone who believes in innovation getting us out of the current mess we're in.Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his team in Buffalo have pivoted to create a ventilator that can help save lives. The company is using Model 3 parts to make it happen. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe plant, which usually makes solar panels, would reopen to turn the prototype into actual working ventilators. Unfortunately, there's not much chance that Tesla's going to be able to make them in time to meet the apex of the coronavirus in New York.    * 7 Retail Stocks to Keep Your Distance From Honestly, it would have been interesting to have had someone like Musk in charge of the Federal government's coronavirus response from the very beginning. In conjunction with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the duo could have made a difference. Sadly, that ship has sailed, and our lives are in the hands of President Trump. But I digress.  TSLA Stock Having a Stellar YearI find it amazing that out of 607 U.S.-listed stocks with a market capitalization greater than $10 billion, Tesla is one of only 40 stocks up more than 10% in 2020. Tesla? That company that people continue to argue can't possibly make money consistently. Well, if you're in that camp, you'll likely get your way in the second quarter, thanks to the devastation of the coronavirus. In the short-term, Tesla stock could enter negative territory as investors realize the extent of the damage done by the virus.It's hard to imagine Tesla reaching its goal to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020. While it finished the first quarter with 88,400 deliveries, 10,300 higher than the analyst estimate, the second quarter is expected to hurt all manufacturers. Estimates by IHS Markit suggest the total global car deliveries in the second quarter will fall 12% year-over-year to 78.8 million. In January, IHS Markit's estimates for the second quarter were 10 million higher. Whether we're talking about Tesla, General Motors (NYSE:GM) or Toyota (NYSE:TM), the numbers are going to be abysmal. There's no getting around that. Tesla reports Q1 2020 results on April 29 after the markets close. We'll find out at the end of the month just how bad the second quarter is expected to be. Tesla's production at its plant in California has been idle since March 24. The plant in Buffalo has also been idled. However, its Shanghai production facility reopened February 10 after being closed for two weeks as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus. By the end of March, its Shanghai plant had gotten back to producing 3,000 vehicles per week. Its goal for the year in Shanghai is 150,000, with Model Y production in China getting underway soon.That's excellent news.  Buy on the DipLong-term, I'm 100% behind Ark Invest CEO Catherine Wood's $7,000 prediction for TSLA stock by the end of 2024. In my most recent article about Tesla in February, I reminded investors that a good sell-signal for its stock would be when Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) unloads its position. There are lots of tech companies in America, but few with the innovation chops of Tesla. That's why I've long been a fan of Musk and the company.  As we head into the second quarter, there are plenty of analysts who've turned bearish on Tesla. It's hard to argue with this logic. However, whatever happens to Tesla, I'm confident that GM and Ford (NYSE:F) will suffer just as much, probably more.   While lower gas prices could convince a few people to hold off buying an electric vehicle, that train has already left the station. Long-term, Tesla will benefit from leading the charge.As I write this, Tesla stock is trading around $538. If you hold for 2-3 years, I think it's a buy. If it falls into the mid-$400s, which it very well might in the next 2-3 months, it becomes a screaming buy.Forget value-play Ford. Innovation makes Tesla a better buy.

2020-04-24,"Bank of America analyst John Murphy downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) April 22 from a &quot;neutral&quot; rating to &quot;underperform&quot; on valuation concerns. Also, the analyst lowered his target on TSLA stock by $15 to $485, 31% less than where it's currently trading.Source: Tudoran Andrei / Shutterstock.com Is this downgrade a signal it's time to sell or merely another Tesla naysayer trying to ruin the party? TSLA Stock Has Run a Long WayBenzinga's Wayne Duggan made an interesting point about TSLA stock while reporting the analyst's downgrade April 22. Duggan reminded investors that &quot;Tesla shut down its production at its factory in Fremont on March 23 due to Covid-19. Since the production shutdown, the stock is up 61.4%.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMurphy expects the global production volume in 2020 to be 23% lower than in 2019. In the first quarter, global production fell by 24%. Here in the U.S., volumes dropped by 11%. As for Tesla, it produced 102,672 vehicles in the first quarter, 33% higher over a year earlier. In terms of deliveries, Tesla delivered 88,400 in the first quarter, 40% higher than last year.  * 7 of the Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now Since Tesla reported its first-quarter production and delivery numbers, Tesla stock is up 54%.While those are impressive numbers, the world is still dealing with Covid-19 and a global recession. It's unlikely that Tesla can keep up the pace. Since March 24, Tesla's Fremont production facility has been shut down. It won't be reopened until at least the beginning of May. The employees who can't work from home have been furloughed until then.So, the company's lost about a month's production in California, although its Chinese plant is producing Model 3s at a remarkable rate.From a valuation perspective, Tesla is trading at five-times sales and 50.5-times cash flow. By comparison, Toyota (NYSE:TM), which many would consider the most efficient auto manufacturer on the planet, has a price-to-sales ratio and price-to-cash-flow ratio of 0.62 and five, respectively. Toyota's P/S and P/CF ratios are lower today than their five-year averages.Not convinced. Tesla's enterprise value of $134.7 billion is 62 times its EBITDA while Toyota's enterprise value of $309.4 billion is seven times its EBITDA; one-eighth Tesla's.The various shutdowns, as judged by Murphy's estimates for 2020, are likely to hurt all vehicle producers. And yet, Tesla has a year-to-date total return through April 21 of 64% compared to -14% for Toyota.From a valuation perspective, it's easy to see why Murphy has grown skeptical that Tesla can keep rising in a broken economy. Tesla's Just Getting StartedOne only needs to look at what's happening in China to realize that Tesla's place in the world is rising while companies such as Ford (NYSE:F) are hanging on for dear life.In March, its China factory delivered 10,160 electric Model 3s. The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) suggests this accounted for 30% of the entire electric vehicle market in China for May. In February, it delivered 3,900 and 2,620 in January.That's amazing when you consider it only broke ground in January 2019. The company's goal in China is to produce 150,000 vehicles in a year there. In the first three months of the year, despite Covid-19, it delivered 16,680 or 11% of its goal. And it hasn't even begun producing the Model Y SUV.The company's overall goal in 2020 is to deliver more than 500,000 vehicles. Despite the coronavirus, Elon Musk still believes it can meet the goal. If China keeps up the pace and the U.S. gets back to work in a couple of weeks, my bet is on Elon.I'm sure Ark Investment Management CEO Catherine Wood would feel the same. In February, I discussed how she felt TSLA stock could hit $7,000 by 2024. In Wood's worst-case scenario, it would hit $1,500 by then, doubling your return over five years.&quot;We've gotten much less reaction now than we did the first time around, when we put out $4,000 with that letter [August 2018],&quot; Wood told Institutional Investor in February. &quot;And the reason is that the stock price has more than quadrupled. If there's one thing that investors respect, it's the market -- and the market is saying we're right about something.&quot;Wood's take on Tesla is all about innovation. The minute it becomes like Ford and stops innovating, I'm sure she'll cut and run. Until then, I'm sure it will remain one of Ark's largest holdings. The Bottom Line on TeslaMaking predictions about stocks over the past three months has burned me on many occasions. That said, I do believe that Tesla will continue to gain market share in the years ahead.I can't tell you what's going to happen to TSLA stock after it reports earnings April 29. What I will say is that long term, Tesla has got to be in your portfolio if you want to generate above-average returns.Tesla is a long-term buy.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-05-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Zero-percent financing deals hit a record last month as carmakers kept the U.S. auto market from collapsing.More than one in every four new vehicles sold in April did so with 0% loans, according to market researcher Edmunds. By opening up the lending spigots, the U.S. avoided a reprise of the almost 80% drop automakers experienced in China in February, the month the coronavirus hit the world’s largest car market hardest.Both 0% offers and longer-term loans are buoying demand at a time when large swaths of the country are under stay-home orders and many dealerships are forced to keep showrooms shut. While the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts are making it easier for automakers to dangle the deals, their lenders still are forgoing revenue they’d make in more normal times.“I think 0% is an important tool in our toolbox and will continue to be offered for a while,” said Randy Parker, the vice president in charge of sales for Hyundai Motor Co.’s U.S. subsidiary. After other automakers offered no-interest financing, the company “wanted to remain competitive in the marketplace.”Hyundai’s U.S. sales fell 39% last month, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.’s both plunged by more 50%. Through May 4, the South Korean carmaker is offering zero-interest financing for seven years on the Tucson crossover and Elantra sedan, and for six years on the Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle.Toyota changed its incentive and marketing programs on April 22 to better align with deals elsewhere in the industry, including offering 0% for five years on core vehicles such as the RAV4 SUV, Camry sedan and Tacoma mid-size pickup.But it has resisted offering terms longer than 60 months, viewing that as harmful to resale values and therefore risky for car buyers. “We’re not into zero-for-84 months,” said Bob Carter, executive vice president for sales at Toyota Motor’s North American unit. “It’s not only not healthy for the industry, but also for the consumer.”Even with all the discounts, April was a painful month. Edmunds estimated industrywide deliveries fell 53% from a year ago, the worst month in at least three decades. The industry’s annualized sales rate slowed to 8.6 million, according to Ward’s Automotive Group, the worst reading in at least 45 years.“April is likely the bottom for auto sales, so hopefully there’s only room for improvement from here,” Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said in a statement. “Although automakers are doing their part by offering landmark incentives, those might not be enough if consumers cannot recover financially from this crisis.”(Adds seasonally adjusted annual rate in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Carmakers Dodge Disaster With Biggest-Ever Share of 0% Loans

2020-05-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy has slipped from sales-tax hangover into deep recession, official data is set to show on Monday, with worse to come even as coronavirus restrictions on activity are gradually lifted.Analysts see the economy shrinking at an annualized pace of 4.5% in the first three months of this year. A 21.5% cratering of gross domestic product is then expected in the current quarter as the broader impact of the pandemic lashes the economy.Tokyo to Stay Under Virus Emergency Even as Japan EasesWhile Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s decision to partially lift a nationwide state of emergency offers hope that companies in Japan’s service sector now have a chance to start a slow recovery, manufacturers are likely in for a longer wait as global demand continues to take a battering.Aware that the economy still needs more life-support measures, Abe called Thursday for a second extra budget barely two weeks after parliament passed a beefed-up first supplementary budget. Existing stimulus measures already total more than 20% of GDP.Hopes for a V-shaped pickup for Japan should be cast aside, said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities Co., adding that the global recovery needed by Japan’s exporters is likely to be slow and come in fits and starts.“Any expectation that manufacturing will be a catalyst for recovery is nonsense,” Ueno said, ruling out the notion that continued social distancing measures might cause the service sector to recover at a slower pace than the factory sector.That’s bad news for Japan’s industrial heartlands, such as Aichi prefecture where Toyota Motor Corp.’s headquarter is based. Some 38% of the prefecture’s economy is based on manufacturing, compared with only 9% of Tokyo’s, where services comprise 85% of output. Manufacturers generally have more of a presence outside the greater Tokyo area.Toyota said Tuesday that it expects profit to tumble 80% this fiscal year to a nine-year low as its car sales take a bigger hit than during the global financial crisis.PMI data still shows service sector activity in a far weaker state than manufacturing, but that’s likely to change in the second quarter, according to Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.“For Japan, exports and production will get extremely bad,” given the strict lockdowns implemented in the U.S. and Europe, said Ugai. “Companies just aren’t going to put any money into capex under these kinds of circumstances.”Ugai expects GDP to contract an annualized 42% this quarter, the bleakest forecast among 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Emergency EasedStill, lifting the state of emergency outside the main urban areas of Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka may help improve domestic consumption, though the return to shops, restaurants and offices is likely to be cautious.Without a vaccine, Japan like other nations will face the risk of further waves of infections, and having to shut down parts of the economy as those occur, Mizuho’s Ueno said.Why a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTakeFor the country’s service sector, another likely factor that could extend the recession is tourism -- previously one of the clearest success stories of Abenomics.Until last year, the number of overseas visitors to Japan had risen around five-fold over eight years. But spending by foreign tourists plunged 42% in the first quarter of 2020, according to the Japan Tourism Agency.The drop is likely to worsen in the current quarter as the pandemic has intensified. The loss will be felt especially in places outside Tokyo where overseas tourists have spent the most such as Osaka, Kyoto, Hokkaido and Fukuoka.What Bloomberg’s Economist Says“A weak report could tip the balance toward larger fiscal support in a follow-up package that appears to be in the works... Weakness was likely widespread, with private consumption, business investment, housing investment, and public investment likely all falling.”&#92;--Yuki Masujima, senior economistClick here to read more.(Adds comments from Bloomberg economist.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Japan’s Recession to Be Confirmed With Worse Yet to Come
2020-05-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Big, futuristic investment bets on the post-coronavirus period still feel too early. Yet Toyota Motor Corp. seems to be confident that the dollars will matter.That stands out in a world where most rivals can barely think about cash flows for the next six months, let alone investments a year from now. While guiding toward an 80% drop in operating profits for its 2021 fiscal year, Toyota says it plans to drop capital expenditures by around 3% and keep that spending at 1.35 trillion yen ($12.6 billion), while lowering research and development only 1%. As a portion of net revenues, R&D would rise to 4.6% to about 1.35 trillion yen, up from 3.7%, which is the average since 2017.Toyota is doing what it hasn’t during previous crises that damaged supply chains and businesses around the world. In a speech during this week’s earnings call, President Akio Toyoda recalled the four difficult years after the financial crisis, made worse in 2011 by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand. The company cut costs and investments and grew substantially leaner, but “lost necessary muscle.” Toyoda said that “because we stopped everything to stop the bleeding, including investing in the future, we ended up needing some time to strengthen our company composition.”In the past couple of years, Toyota has splashed out billions on the future of cars. The investments range from $1 billion in Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailing service, Grab Holdings Inc., the largest by an automaker, to $500 million in Uber Technologies Inc. It also has set up a joint venture with Softbank Corp. Meanwhile, the Toyota Research Institute and its Advanced Development offshoot have tried to go big into fields like artificial intelligence.So far, it’s hard to say what the exact returns have been, and it will stay that way while Covid-19 has people locked down and driving less. As long as the pandemic and its economic devastation mean lost jobs and tighter purse strings, will consumers really be ready to spend on electric cars or fancy gadgets? It seems more likely that they’ll push off upgrades for later. No one is in the mood to spend, except, well, Toyota. Sure, outlays now, in theory, set the company up to get ahead of the industry. But Toyota hasn’t necessarily shown technology prowess in the past, so it’s hard to say whether it will be able to going forward. The automaker could very well catch the future wave just right, or mistime it terribly.Corporate liquidity has become a prized commodity globally. To bolster its already-strong balance sheet, Toyota said it has signed up for a 1.25 trillion yen loan, a prudent move. But how does that square off against the planned spending, which is almost as much as in previous years? Even before the pandemic, pressure to keep up with increased connectivity and autonomy was weighing on carmakers’ balance sheets. Moody’s Investors Service noted after downgrading Toyota in April that accommodating new investments means companies “are required to save costs elsewhere.”There seem to be two Toyotas, as I have noted previously. One is focused on cost-cutting and operating within the confines of a struggling world market, and the other is trying to spend into the future. The first enables the second. Two years ago, Toyoda said that the company would hone the power of cost reduction “to strengthen earning power and expand our investments in new technology and new fields.&quot;Slimming down, especially now, is difficult. It’s unclear how Toyota classifies all of these investments, and whether they fall under R&D outlays, but costs as a portion of net sales have been edging up on a quarterly basis, despite tight control. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 production line challenges – when to stop, when to open – remain and require spending. With sales and the core business undergoing deep change, it’s hard to justify large expenditures for unknown returns. Investors may have the same problem.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-05-14,"Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) gave an optimistic prognosis when reporting its fourth-quarter results, believing the worst of the economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic was over and expecting that, at its biggest markets at least, sales could rebound even by the year-end.The industryDespite Toyota's optimism, the rest of the auto industry has a less confident vision of what the future holds.Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said on April 29 that ""no one has a clear visibility on the duration and severity of this crisis.""A majority of automakers seemingly share this sentiment, with many focusing their efforts to pile up cash and decrease spending to ensure they can survive a prolonged downturn.Out of Detroit's big carmakers, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) learned the hard way the damage a lack of capital can wreck from the 2008 downturn. Nevertheless, it and others, like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Fiat Chrysler N.V. (NYSE: FCAU), are gearing up to restart production in North American factories as soon as May 18th.This trails Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC), which have restarted production at some of their U.S. plants on May 11, trailing news of a sizable drop in sales through April for both companies at -54%.Toyota's Q4 And Full-year EarningsIn its recently-announced Q4 earnings report, Toyota announced a quarterly net profit decline of 86% to $587 million for the January-March quarter. Although not stellar by any measure, it does stack up better than many of its competitors. The figure is double that of the $292 million net profit reported by GM for the same period, whereas Honda Motors reported a net loss of $274 million for the quarter on Tuesday and didn't provide any guidance due to uncertainty around when sales might rebound.For the full fiscal year, Toyota clocked in a revenue of $278.5 billion. This is pretty much flat when compared to last year, although net profit did rise slightly to $19.3 billion. And as for the year ending in March 2021, Toyota expects both revenue and sales volume could fall around 20% in with nearly 80% drop in operating profit to $4.7 billion.View more earnings on TMIAlthough it might delay the introduction of new models to save on cash, research and development spending will be kept steady this year.OutlookWhile most other automakers are rightfully cautious of what the future may bring, tiptoeing around a turnaround schedule, Toyota's prognosis is among the sunniest offered by the group.Still, the global car industry has been witnessing a slump for the past few quarters. It has only worsened as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.Nevertheless, major markets are showing small signs of life. China is slowly reopening its economy, with an increasing number of dealerships operating. As U.S. factories prepare to restart production, carmakers may start the prolonged process of bouncing back.But this year is far from done when it comes to challenges ahead. Nevertheless, Toyota has made quite a cushion to face them.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan has sunk into a recession that’s likely to deepen further as the full force of the coronavirus pandemic hits economies around the globe.The world’s third-largest economy shrank an annualized 3.4% in the three months through March from the previous quarter as exports slid and social distancing crimped consumer spending, official figures showed Monday, confirming the second-straight quarterly contraction.Even with a partial lifting of restrictions on economic activity in recent days, other major economies are expected to join Japan in recession in the current quarter as households limit spending to essentials and companies cut investment, production and hiring to stay afloat amid the devastating fallout of the virus.Policy makers will also need to consider more than just their approaches to restarting their economies, as the pandemic triggers a reassessment of priorities.“The post-coronavirus world won’t be a return to the pre-corona world,” said Masaki Kuwahara, an economist at Nomura Securities.“There’ll be more need to control risk for contagious diseases. And the changes won’t be limited to just contagious diseases. Various themes of sustainability will also weigh more on people’s minds,” he added, suggesting that societies may now become more tolerant of inefficiency in the economy if it results in more sustainability and safety.Worse to ComeWhile Japan’s drop in gross domestic product was slightly better than an expected 4.5% fall, helped by stronger-than-expected consumption and business spending before the pandemic escalated, analysts and policy makers agree that worse is in store in the current quarter.“There’s no doubt that this quarter has gotten much worse,” said economist Takeshi Minami at Norinchukin Research Institute, noting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s April declaration of a state of emergency and tougher restrictions on activity came in early April. “Companies are struggling to secure funding and that suggests business investment will remain weak and many workers are concerned about their wages.”Despite the rising sense of crisis, Japan so far appears to be doing less badly than other major economies.China, where the virus first spread, shrank 9.8% last quarter on a non-annualized basis from the previous three months. That translates into a drop of close to 40% in terms comparable with Japan’s.The U.S. economy contracted 4.8% in the first three months of the year, but is expected to shrink more than 30% this quarter in annualized terms. Canada is seen shedding more than 40% of GDP.For Japan, analysts forecast a 21.5% contraction in the three months through June, a record for official data going back to 1955.More AidThe crisis has put pressure on policy makers in Tokyo to step up stimulus measures that, at a record 117 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion), already total more than 20% of GDP by the broadest measure.Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, speaking Monday after the GDP report, said the government is aiming to pass a second extra budget swiftly to get more aid to businesses and households and warned of the risk of the economic pain deepening even more.BOJ’s Lending Under Virus Program Triples After April TweaksThe Bank of Japan last month lifted its ceiling on government bond purchases as the government ramps up spending. The BOJ is also expected to introduce another lending program for small companies at an emergency meeting that could come as early as this week.In recent days, rates of new virus infections have fallen in Japan and the government last week lifted its state of emergency for 39 of Japan’s 47 prefectures, although Tokyo and other dense economic centers still remain under heavy restrictions.Until stay-at-home requests are lifted, policy makers won’t be able to spur growth no matter how much money is spent, according to economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute.“For now, they have to spend money to prevent job losses and bankruptcies,” Saito said. “We’re not at a stage where the Bank of Japan can boost demand with monetary easing, and the BOJ will focus on corporate financing for now.”Export SlideJapan’s policy makers also have little control over the world’s demand for the country’s exports, a main driver of growth that could stay depressed for a long time. Even though key overseas markets are starting to reopen from lockdowns, progress will come in fits and starts, with the risk of new infection waves looming.Monday’s report showed exports dropped almost 22% last quarter on an annualized basis, the biggest decline since the 2011 tsunami. Corporate earnings forecasts from automakers and other manufacturers suggest the decline is likely to steepen. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan’s largest company, sees profits tumbling 80% this fiscal year.What Bloomberg’s Economist Says“Looking ahead, our high frequency data dashboard is pointing to more pronounced weakness in the economy in 2Q. Even if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifts the state of emergency by end-May, we doubt the economy will pick up until 3Q, at the earliest -- and even then, the strength would hinge on recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.”\--Yuki Masujima, economistClick here to read more.(Adds economist comments on post-virus pandemic world)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Japan Sinks Into Recession as Gloom Deepens for World Economy

2020-05-27,"(Bloomberg) -- At a factory near Germany’s border with the Czech Republic, Volkswagen AG’s ambitious strategy to become the global leader in electric vehicles is coming up against the reality of manufacturing during a pandemic.The Zwickau assembly lines, which produce the soon-to-be released ID.3 electric hatchback, are the centerpiece of a plan by the world’s biggest automaker to spend 33 billion euros ($36 billion) by 2024 developing and building EVs. At the site, where an East German automaker built the diminutive Trabant during the Cold War, VW eventually wants to churn out as many as 330,000 cars annually. That would make Zwickau one of Europe’s largest electric-car factories—and help the company overtake Tesla Inc. in selling next-generation vehicles.But Covid-19 is putting VW’s and other automakers’ electric ambitions at risk. The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic has pushed the auto industry, among others, to near-collapse, emptying showrooms and shutting factories. As job losses mount, big-ticket purchases are firmly out of reach—in the U.S., where Tesla is cutting prices, more than 36 million people have filed for unemployment since mid-March. Also, the plunge in oil prices is making gasoline-powered vehicles more attractive, and some cash-strapped governments are less able to offer subsidies to promote new technologies.Even before the crisis, automakers had to contend with an extended downturn in China, the world’s biggest auto market, where about half of all passenger EVs are sold. Total auto sales in China declined the past two years amid a slowing economy, escalating trade tensions, and stricter emission regulations. EV sales are forecast to fall to 932,000 this year, down 14% from 2019, according to BloombergNEF. The drop-off is expected to stretch into a third year as China's leaders have abandoned their traditional practice of setting an annual target for economic growth, citing uncertainties. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect just 1.8% GDP growth this year.The global market contraction raises the prospect of casualties. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that Renault SA, an early adopter of electric cars with models like the Zoe,  could “disappear” without state aid. Even Toyota Motor Corp., a hybrid pioneer when it first introduced the Prius hatchback in 1997, is under pressure. The Japanese manufacturer expects profits to tumble to the lowest level in almost a decade.Automakers who for years have invested heavily in a shift to a high-tech future—including autonomous vehicles and other alternative energy-based forms of transportation such as hydrogen—now face a grim test. Do their pre-pandemic plans to build and sell electric cars at a profit have any chance of succeeding in a vastly changed economic climate? Even as Covid-19 has obliterated demand, for the car makers most committed to electric, there’s no turning back.“We all have a historic task to accomplish,” Thomas Ulbrich, who runs Volkswagen’s EV business, said when assembly lines restarted on April 23, “to protect the health of our employees—and at the same time get business back on track responsibly.”Volkswagen Pushes AheadGlobal EV sales will shrink this year, falling 18% to about 1.7 million units, according to BloombergNEF, although they’re likely to return to growth over the next four years, topping 6.9 million by 2024. “The general trend toward electric vehicles is set to continue, but the economic conditions of the next two to three years will be tough,” said Marcus Berret, managing director at consultancy Roland Berger.Volkswagen’s Zwickau facility became the first auto plant in Germany to resume production after a nationwide lockdown started in March. Before restarting, the company crafted a detailed list of about 100 safety measures for employees, requiring them to, among other things, wear masks and protective gear if they can’t adhere to social-distancing rules.The cautious approach has reduced capacity—50 cars per day initially rolled off the Zwickau assembly line, roughly a third of what the plant manufactured before the coronavirus crisis. (VW said Wednesday that daily output had  risen to 150 vehicles, with a plan to reach 225 next month.) Persistent software problems also have plagued development of the ID.3, one of 70 new electric models VW group is looking to bring to market in the coming years. Still, Ulbrich and VW CEO Herbert Diess over the past three months have reaffirmed Volkswagen’s commitment to electrification. “My new working week starts together with Thomas Ulbrich at the wheel of a Volkswagen ID.3 - our most important project to meet the European CO2-targets in 2020 and 2021,” Diess wrote in a post on LinkedIn in April. “We are fighting hard to keep our timeline for the launches to come.”Diess has described the ID.3 as “an electric car for the people that will move electric mobility from niche to mainstream.” Pre-Covid, the company had anticipated that 2020 would be the year it would prove its massive investments and years of planning for electric and hybrid models would start to pay off.A more pressing worry that could hamper VW’s ability to scale up production is its existing inventory of unsold vehicles. The cars need to move to make room for new releases, but sales are down as consumers are tightening their spending. One response has been to offer improved financing in Germany, including optional rate protection should buyers lose their jobs. VW also has adopted new sales strategies first used by its Chinese operations, such as delivering disinfected cars to customer homes for test drives, and expanding online commerce.Other German automakers are similarly pushing ahead with EV plans. Daimler AG is sticking to a plan to flank an electric SUV with a battery-powered van and a compact later this year. BMW AG plans to introduce the SUV-size iNEXT in 2021 as well as the i4, a sedan seeking to challenge Tesla’s best-selling Model 3.A potential obstacle for all these companies—apart from still patchy charging infrastructure in many markets—is the availability of batteries. Supply bottlenecks appear inevitable given that the number of electric car projects across the industry outstrip global battery production capacity. And boosting cell manufacturing is a complicated task.China's (Weakened) EV Dominance For VW and others, the first big test of EVs’ appeal in a Covid-19 world will come in China. Diess has referred to China as “the engine of success for Volkswagen AG.” VW group deliveries returned to growth year-on-year last month in China, while all other major markets declined.Not long ago, China appeared to be leading the world toward an electric future. As part of President Xi Jinping’s goal to make the country an industrial superpower by 2025, the government implemented policies that would boost sales of EVs and help domestic automakers become globally competitive, not just in electric passenger cars but buses, too.With the outbreak seemingly under control in much of the country, China is seeing some buyers return to the showrooms, but demand for passenger cars is likely to fall for the third year in a row, putting startups like NIO Inc.  at risk and hurting more-established players like Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co., which suffered from a 40% year-on-year vehicle sales decline in the first four months of 2020.The Chinese auto market may shrink as much as 25% this year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, which before the pandemic had been expecting a 2% decline. EV sales fell by more than one-third in the second half of 2019.NIO, the Shanghai-based startup that raised about $1 billion from a New York Stock Exchange initial public offering in 2018 but lost more than 11 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) last year, was thrown a much-needed lifeline when a group of investors, including a local government in China’s Anhui Province, offered 7 billion yuan last month.Other Chinese manufacturers are counting on support from the government, too, including tax breaks and an extension to 2022 of subsidies, originally scheduled to end this year, to make EVs more affordable.For now, the government will also look to help makers of internal combustion engine vehicles, at least during the worst of the crisis, said Jing Yang, director of corporate research in Shanghai with Fitch Ratings. But, she said, “over the medium-to-long term, the focus will still be on the EV side.”America is Tesla CountryCompanies can’t count on that same level of support from President Donald Trump in the U.S., where consumers who love their SUVs and pickup trucks have largely steered clear of electric vehicles other than Tesla’s.The U.S. lags China and Europe in promoting the production and sale of EVs, and that gap may widen now that Americans can buy gas for less than $2 a gallon.“When you’re digging out of this crisis, you’re not going to try to do that with unprofitable and low-volume products, which are EVs,” said Kevin Tynan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Weeks after announcing plans to launch EVs for each of its brands, General Motors Co. delayed the unveiling of the Cadillac Lyriq EV originally planned for April. Then on April 29, the company said it would put off the scheduled May introduction of a new Hummer EV. The models are part of CEO Mary Barra’s strategy to spend $20 billion on electrification and autonomous driving by 2025, to try to close the gap with Tesla.In another move aimed at winning over Tesla buyers, Ford Motor Co. unveiled its electric Mustang Mach-E last November at a splashy event ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show. The highly anticipated model had been scheduled to debut this year. Ford has not officially postponed the release, but the company has said all launches will be delayed by about two months, potentially pushing the Mach-E into 2021.Elon Musk, whose cars dominate the U.S. electric market, cut prices by thousands of dollars overnight. The Model 3 is now $2,000 cheaper, starting at $37,990. The Model S and Model X each dropped $5,000.Musk engaged in a high-profile fight with California officials this month over Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, which had been closed by shutdown orders Musk slammed as “fascist.”  In a May 11 tweet, he said the company was reopening the plant in defiance of county policy. On May 16, Tesla told employees it had received official approval.During most of the shutdown in California, the company managed to keep producing some cars thanks to better relations with local officials regulating its other factory, in Shanghai. That plant closed as the virus spread from Wuhan in late January, but the local government helped it reopen a few weeks later in early February.First Zwickau, Then the WorldThe ID.3’s new electric underpinning, dubbed MEB, is key to VW’s strategy to sell battery-powered cars on a global scale at prices that will be competitive with similar combustion-engine vehicles. Automakers typically rely on such platforms to achieve economies of scale and, ultimately, profits. MEB will be applied to purely electric vehicles across all of the company’s mass-market brands, including Skoda and Seat.VW said it spent $7 billion developing MEB after Ford last year agreed to use the technology for one of its European models. Separately, the group’s Audi and Porsche brands are built on a dedicated EV platform for luxury cars that the company says will be vital in narrowing the gap with Tesla.VW plans to escalate its electric-car push by adding two factories, near Shanghai and Shenzhen, that it says could eventually roll out 600,000 cars annually, more cars than Tesla delivered globally last year.While China is the initial goal, making a dent in Europe and the U.S. is the long-term one. Like China, Europe had been tightening emissions regulations significantly before the pandemic. New rules to reduce fleet emissions will gradually start to take effect this year, effectively forcing most manufacturers to sell plug-in hybrids and purely electric cars to avoid steep fines.Because of the mandates, Europe’s commitment to electrification isn’t going away, said Aakash Arora, a managing director with Boston Consulting Group. “In the long term, we don’t see any relaxation in regulation,” he said.For VW, this crisis wouldn’t be the first time it started a new chapter in difficult times. Diess saw an opportunity coming off the manufacturer’s years-long diesel emissions scandal that cost the company more than $33 billion to win approval for the industry’s most aggressive push into EVs. When VW unveiled the ID.3, officials compared its historic role to the iconic Beetle and the Golf, not knowing that this might hold in unintended ways: The Beetle arose from the ashes of World War II, and the Golf was greeted by the oil-price shock in the 1970s.“We have a clear commitment to become CO2 neutral by 2050,” VW strategy chief Michael Jost said, “and there is no alternative to our electric-car strategy to achieve this.”(Updates with Tesla price cut starting in the third paragraph.

2020-05-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Stocks were supposed to be mired in a bear market after they plunged in March as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered business and sent U.S. unemployment to its highest rate since the Great Depression.Even a 62% recovery by the S&P 500 Index by the middle of May failed to comfort experts like billionaire money managers Stan Druckenmiller and David Tepper , who characterized stocks as the worst investments of their careers. They weren't alone; amid an estimated 47% collapse in gross domestic product, fewer than a quarter of respondents to an Evercore ISI survey said they expected the next 10% move in the market to be higher.So far, though, stocks have held their own as economic indicators sagged, regaining 37% of their value from the low point in mid-March. “The stock market looks increasingly divorced from economic reality,” a New York Times article on the phenomenon proclaimed.Or maybe not — not if you think of it as the Microsoft market. No company has defied the pessimism more than Microsoft Corp., and for a lot of sensible reasons. The Seattle-based maker of global business and consumer software led all publicly traded companies most of the year with a $1.4 trillion market valuation, exceeded only by Saudi Arabian Oil Co. which isn't yet freely traded.Unlike the largest fossil fuel company, which lost 13% since its December $1.9 trillion initial public offering, Microsoft is within 5% of its Feb. 11 record high and appreciated $947 billion since 2015, more than any of the 10 largest companies, including Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The gap between Microsoft and Aramco narrowed to $229 billion from $840 billion, a trend likely to continue amid weak global growth in the months ahead.That's because Microsoft, unlike Aramco, is a mainstay of the global economy, developing and supplying 75% of the operating systems used by computers and servers worldwide, according to the market-analysis company IDC.Microsoft's vast infrastructure and productivity applications enable companies, governments and individuals to navigate increasing social and workforce disruption caused by the pandemic and other disasters stoked by global warming and climate change.As one of the anchors of the Nasdaq 100 Index (more than 80% are technology firms) Microsoft signifies the growing dependence of the economy on these companies, which this year outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average by the most since 2000 (Nasdaq 100 gained 8% as the DJIA lost 10%), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Microsoft could emerge stronger than most of its rivals once the Covid-19 crisis subsides, in our view, as enterprises spend more to upgrade their infrastructure and applications, translating into above-consensus, double-digit sales growth from fiscal 2022-2021,” said Anurag Rana, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in a May 15 report. “Its deep portfolio of cloud products, client relationships and security spending are differentiators.”Such confidence is prompted by the past five quarters, when Microsoft earnings for the first time exceeded forecasts by at least 10% after beating the average of analyst estimates in all but one of the 23 quarters since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike its five more glamorous peers — Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — Microsoft has an uninterrupted growth rate with the least volatility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.To be sure, the Faang companies and similar technology marvels retained much of their value during the Coronavirus pandemic. Netflix has gained 28% since the end of 2019; Amazon is up 30%, Apple 9%, Facebook 10%. Tesla Inc., the maker of electric, battery-powered vehicles, rallied 93% since the end of 2019 and is worth just $59 billion less than No. 1 Toyota Motor Corp.Tesla anticipated the remotely engaged economy by selling its vehicles online and improving the customer experience with periodic, automatic software upgrades. The traditional auto companies haven't fared well. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, is down 24% since the end of 2019 and General Motors Co., the largest U.S. auto maker, declined 28% and is worth only 26% of Tesla's current market capitalization of $149 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That's why the Dow, once the benchmark of corporate America, is a shadow of its former self as industrial companies represent just 9% of the average, down from 16% in 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Microsoft already had a great relationship with Fortune 2000 tech departments because of its dominance in Windows and Office software products,” said Bloomberg's Rana in a recent interview. “As these legacy companies look to invest more digitally transforming their business post Covid-19, Microsoft should get its fair share of work” — lifting the stock market as it helps transform the economy.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",What’s Keeping Stocks Afloat?

2020-05-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that’s orbiting the Earth with two U.S. astronauts is the picture of New Space Age glamour. It’s a sleek, stylish commercially made capsule that’s destined to be featured beside Italian sports cars in future design textbooks. Just don’t tell that to Elon Musk, SpaceX’s chief executive and chief designer. “Is a Ferrari more reliable than a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic?” he once asked a space journalist. The answer, of course, is that the simpler sedans are far more reliable than the well-crafted sports car. So SpaceX, Musk made clear, was going to make Corollas.It’s a practically minded outlook for a company founded on the galactically large ambition to transform humanity into a multiplanetary species. But Musk and SpaceX implicitly understand something that national space programs haven’t really accepted: Success in space exploration isn’t, ultimately, about achieving “firsts” like the moon landing. Rather, it’s repeat business that will establish moon colonies and Musk’s Martian city. To get that business, SpaceX has to show that national space programs, with their expensive, Ferrari-like rockets, capsules and contractors, won’t get there. On Saturday, it succeeded.The 20th century space race wasn’t about the money, it was about the record books. The respective financial strengths of the U.S. and Soviet systems certainly played a role, but when national pride is at stake, performance matters more than costs. For decades, NASA, in particular, internalized that priority by adopting cost-plus contracts with its contractors. Under these arrangements, NASA agrees to pay the value of a project’s development costs, plus an associated fee (often about 10%). It’s an excellent system for encouraging contractors to invest in difficult, long-term projects with hazy costs.But if the goal is to create something that works repeatedly, and on-budget, cost-plus is a problem. After all, if a contractor’s fees increase during project delays, then that contractor lacks an incentive to control costs and finish on deadline. Making matters more difficult, expensive government programs must meet political requirements that no profit-seeking business would ever consider. The development of the 1970s-era space shuttle was spread out over states and produced an outrageously expensive “reusable” rocket that took thousands of hours to prepare for reuse. In 2012, Musk correctly called the shuttle “a Ferrari to the nth power.”By that point, Musk, too, was working with the U.S. government. But unlike traditional NASA contractors such as the Boeing Co, he was doing it on a fixed-fee basis. So, rather than get paid along the way, SpaceX accepted a fixed fee to build a technology, and whatever wasn’t used in development could be kept as profit.That doesn’t mean cutting corners. NASA requires that SpaceX’s technology meet its high safety standards (often to Musk’s chagrin). But it does mean that SpaceX has a strong incentive to find ways to control costs while building cutting-edge technology. For example, rather than try to perfect a single rocket for a flawless first launch, SpaceX opted for iterative design, whereby it launched — and failed — early prototypes repeatedly, as a means to learn from its mistakes and speed up rocket design. It’s an approach that differs substantially from traditional aerospace companies, which spend years and money perfecting a design before flying it (the Ferrari approach). Likewise, SpaceX, freed from political constraints, concentrated its design and testing in single locations, rather than spread it out geographically. It’s what any rational for-profit manufacturer would do.This approach has been fruitful. The rocket that carried the Crew Dragon capsule into orbit is a Falcon 9, from a family of rockets developed for $390 million with assistance from NASA under fixed-price contracts. According to a 2011 NASA report, the cost would’ve been $1.7 billion to $4 billion if the same rocket had been developed using traditional means. More dramatically, the development of the Falcon 9 has reduced the cost of a space launch by a factor of 20, at least. A kilogram launched on the space shuttle, which last flew in 2011, cost about $54,500. A kilogram on the Falcon 9 runs about $2,700.Of course, launching humans into space is more difficult and expensive than launching cargo. Even so, SpaceX managed to lap more traditional contractors. In 2011, NASA announced plans to build the Space Launch System, a massive new rocket to send Americans back to the moon. To save on costs and time, the rocket was to be built using engines and other components from the space shuttle program. Ominously, it was also to be built by the Boeing Co under a cost-plus contract. In 2014, NASA committed to a November 2018 launch date at a cost of $9.7 billion. Then the launch dates started slipping, all to the benefit of Boeing. By March, the launch date had moved to the second half of 2021, with costs escalating to $18.3 billion. If and when it flies, each rocket will exceed $1 billion — more than three times what it cost to develop the Falcon 9.For now, SpaceX’s approach is the clear winner, but its challenges are far from over. Above all, the company must demonstrate that its relatively inexpensive human-capable flights have a commercial market — an idea that’s far from certain. Similarly, the company will need to prove the business case for its longer-term, and substantially more expensive, ambitious exploration program. But today, at least, the Musk’s Corolla is beating the Ferrari by millions of miles.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-06-03,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the rise of the robots: Japan’s second-largest company is now a maker of industrial automation systems, highlighting the rising importance of a less visible sector to a nation long associated with consumer-facing brands.Keyence Corp., a maker of machine vision systems and sensors for factories, has jumped 19% this year to become Japan’s second-largest company by market value. At a valuation of over 11 trillion yen ($100 billion), it has overtaken telecommunications giants SoftBank Group Corp., and NTT Docomo Inc., which have jostled for the honor to sit behind Toyota Motor Corp. over most of the past decade.Keyence is famed for its dizzying profitability with an operating profit margin of more than 50%, among the country’s highest. That’s enabled by its “fabless” output model, according to analysts, with production of its array of pressure sensors, barcode readers and laser scanners outsourced to avoid high capital costs.Its industry-leading sales system creates bespoke solutions for clients, and its frequently listed as the highest-paying company in Japan. The surge in its shares has also benefited founder Takemitsu Takizaki, who has overtaken SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son by a good margin to become Japan’s second-richest man.“It’s got everything — high growth, high dividends and a high operating margin,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. “It’s the type of long-term stock you want to leave to your kids or your grandkids.”Keyence has more than tripled in market value since early 2016. “We feel the sense of expectation from our shareholders,” said Keyence director Keiichi Kimura when asked to comment on the milestone. “We’ll do our best to live up to those expectations.”The rise has also underscored how important the country’s parts and robot makers have become to the stock market, shown in the weighting of companies that make up the the country’s benchmark Topix index. Japan stocks were once dominated by banks and automakers — but years of zero rates which now dip into negative have hurt the profitability of the former, while the importance of the latter was declining even before the coronavirus sent the industry into reverse gear.The weighting of the Topix’s Electrical Appliance sector, also home to the likes of Sony Corp., Murata Manufacturing Co., and Fanuc Corp., has increased to almost 15%, the highest in about a decade, as the importance of the Banks and Transportation Equipment sectors have declined. The Information and Communication sector, headed by the five listed companies that dominate Japan’s mobile carriers, is the second-most heavily weighted segment.The growing presence of IT shares has also been a feature in the U.S. stock market, with the sector making up the highest proportion of the S&P 500 Index since the dot-com bubble burst. The coronavirus pandemic has amplified a trend for investors to prefer companies that eliminate humans from the process — a trend Keyence benefits from both with its fabless production model, and by enabling companies to automate their own production.“It’s a business model that grows the more factory automation throughout the world progresses,” said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities’ Fujito.Founder Takizaki holds about 23% of Keyence’s shares, Bloomberg-compiled data show. For the Topix, which takes the free float of the shares into account in its weightings, those holdings mean Keyence is less heavily weighted than Sony, whose market value trails by comparison. Toyota the biggest company on the index, and even forecasting an 80% drop in profit this year, the automaker remains Japan’s largest business with a market value double that of Keyence.“We like Keyence as it outsources production instead of owning factories, allowing it to focus on R&D,” HSBC analysts including Helen Fang wrote in a May 26 report that initiated coverage of the company with a buy rating. “It also uses a direct-sales model that keeps it close to clients. This strategy means it can better capture market share in a widening array of industries and can focus on high-value client solutions.”While the coronavirus pandemic will depress profits this year, Nomura sees a recovery “to record-high profit levels” the following year and sees a record profit the next, analyst Masayasu Noguchi wrote in a report May 28 raising its target price on the stock.“It’s unclear how long the coronavirus pandemic will continue,” Keyence’s Kimura said. “The global uncertainty is likely to continue and in the midst of that we’ll continue to do what we can.”Factory Automation in Asia May Be First to Recover From PandemicThe notoriously tight-lipped Osaka-based company does not provide earnings guidance in its sparse quarterly disclosure. It’s an outlier in a country where companies are being encouraged to boost their transparency and communication with the market.“They are an efficiency-above-any-other kind of company, so doing extra that doesn’t result in revenue addition is probably less of a priority,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Takeshi Kitaura. “They think generally those following the company are happy when they manage solid earnings and growth.”Yoshiharu Izumi, an analyst at SBI Securities Co., says that Keyence holds talks with shareholders and that reassures investors, and doesn’t view the paucity of disclosure as a problem. “Keyence has overtaken Sony, which is extremely proactive in responding to shareholders,” he said. “When Keyence starts putting energy into disclosure, that might be the time to sell.”(Updates with quotes from Keyence from sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",A $100 Billion Robotics Supplier Is Japan’s Second Biggest Firm

2020-06-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Soon after the Federal Reserve’s March 23 assurance that it would make borrowing easier for American corporations, Sysco Corp. sold $4 billion of debt.Not long after that, the food-service giant announced plans to cut one-third of its workforce, more than 20,000 employees. Dividends to shareholders would continue, executives said.That process repeated itself in April and May as the coronavirus spread. The Fed’s promise juiced the corporate-bond market. Borrowing by top-rated companies shot to a record $1.1 trillion for the year, nearly twice the pace of 2019. Companies as diverse as Sysco, Toyota Motor Corp., international marketing firm Omnicom Group Inc. and movie-theater chain Cinemark Holdings Inc. borrowed billions of dollars -- and then fired workers.The companies were under no obligation to behave any differently, but their actions call into question the degree to which the U.S. central bank’s promise to purchase corporate debt will help preserve American jobs.While the Fed has yet to buy a single bond, its pledge threw a lifeline to the market that undoubtedly kept some people working. Retail chains such as Dollar General Corp., CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Lowe’s Cos. and Costco Wholesale Corp. said they’re adding personnel after tapping the bond market.But unlike the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which has incentives for employers to keep workers on the job, the taxpayer-backed facilities that the Fed and Treasury Department created for bigger companies have no such requirements. To make sure the emergency programs help fulfill one of the Fed’s mandates -- maximum employment -- the central bank is essentially crossing its fingers that restoring order to markets will translate to saving jobs.“They could set conditions, say to companies, hire back your workers, maintain your payroll to at least a certain percentage of prior payroll, and we will help,” said Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor for President Bill Clinton who now teaches economics at the University of California, Berkeley. “It’s hardly clear that if you keep companies afloat they’ll hire employees.”Unanimous SenateThe lending programs -- credit for big companies and the so-called Main Street facilities for midsize firms -- are supported by the CARES Act, a law that passed the House with more than 96% of the chamber’s votes and cleared the Senate unanimously. For many supporters, putting conditions on the assistance was a step too far. If Congress had intended any, it would have made it explicit in the legislation, they say.“Really it’s all about creating a context, a climate, in which employees will have the best chance to either keep their job, or go back to their old job, or ultimately find a new job,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a May 29 webinar hosted by Princeton University. “That’s the point of this exercise.” A spokesman for the U.S. central bank declined further comment.Even as businesses around the country began reopening in May after months of stay-at-home orders, helping a battered U.S. economy add 2.5 million jobs in May, prospects remained grim for millions of Americans who’ve been let go since February. An extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits that Congress approved in March is slated to stop on July 31. The prohibition against firing workers in the $25 billion government rescue of U.S. airlines expires Sept. 30, and the biggest recipients have said they intend to shed employees after that date.Protecting WorkersReich’s view is echoed mostly by progressive Democrats and supporters of stricter regulatory oversight of the financial system.“The Fed’s primary motivator in creating these lending facilities is not protecting workers,” U.S. Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, said in an email interview. “The American people should not be asked or expected to loan $500 billion with no strings attached.”A letter, circulated by the Wall Street watchdog group Americans for Financial Reform and published May 27, urged Congress to attach conditions favorable to workers to any Covid-19-related rescue programs. It was signed by 45 organizations, including labor unions and religious and environmental groups.Without provisions for employees, “the credit assistance will tend to boost financial markets, but not the broad economic well-being of the great majority of the population,” Marcus Stanley, Americans for Financial Reform’s policy director, said in an interview.Stanley said the corporate-lending programs don’t have to require companies to keep or rehire workers, but they could give priority to those that do.In its legislation, Congress did express an intent that workers benefit from taxpayer-funded assistance, but it left a lot of the details to Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.“Our No. 1 objective is keeping people employed,” Mnuchin said during a May 19 Senate Banking Committee hearing after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, accused him of “boosting your Wall Street buddies” at the expense of ordinary Americans. “What we put in the Main Street facility is that we expect people to use their best efforts to support jobs,” Mnuchin said.The phrase “best efforts” echoes the original terms for the Main Street program, which required companies to attest they’ll make “reasonable efforts” to keep employees. The wording was subsequently changed to “commercially reasonable efforts,” which Jeremy C. Stein, chairman of the Harvard University economics department and a former Fed governor, called a welcome watering-down of expectations that the central bank would dictate employment policies to borrowers.Emergency Help“It was smart of them to weaken that,” Stein said. “You can’t expect companies to borrow to pay employees.”Companies might not seek emergency help if too many strings are attached to the aid, Stein said. Others question the practicality of tying workers to their companies as economic realities shift.“To go to great lengths to make companies keep employees that they don’t need, in light of new expectations that economic activity will remain below pre-Covid levels for a long while, doesn’t make sense,” said Mark Carey, a former Fed staff member and now co-president of the Risk Institute of the Global Association of Risk Professionals.The Fed approached this crisis with the intent of keeping credit flowing everywhere, from municipalities to small businesses to big corporations to households. Powell said the programs are about lending, not spending -- in other words, they aim to ease a financing pinch rather than stimulate the demand companies need to keep workers on the payroll.Weird Hybrid“For the Fed to second-guess a corporate survival strategy would be a step too far for them,” said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University history professor and author of “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.” Putting explicit conditions on program beneficiaries would make the central bank “a weird hybrid of the Federal Reserve, Treasury, BlackRock and an activist stockholder.” BlackRock Inc. is the world’s biggest money manager and was hired by the central bank to assist with bond programs.Through the Main Street facilities, which are scheduled to begin operations any day, the Fed will buy as much as $600 billion in four-year loans made to companies by commercial banks with principal and interest deferred for one year. The program is aimed at midsize businesses, with 15,000 or fewer employees or annual revenue of $5 billion or less in 2019.The central bank’s credit backstop for larger companies is split in two. The $500 billion primary program is designed to buy slices of syndicated loans or new bonds from companies with investment-grade credit scores or one notch below. It’s available to corporations that can prove they can’t borrow elsewhere. The $250 billion secondary facility buys individual corporate bonds already on the market and exchange-traded funds that include investment-grade and junk bonds. The Fed kicked off the program last month; its balance sheet as of June 2 listed ETF holdings valued at $4.3 billion.European DifferencesEuropean countries are charting a different policy course by paying workers directly. The U.K., for example, is offering 80% of salaries up to 2,600 pounds ($3,207) a month. The Netherlands and Denmark have effectively nationalized private payrolls.The U.S. government paid adults who make less than $75,000 a year a one-time sum of $1,200, with $500 for every dependent child. The cost was $239 billion.The S&P 500 has jumped 38% since March 23, the day the Fed intervened. Observers of the stock market wonder how it could be so bullish at the same time as the country faces an avalanche of joblessness unsurpassed in its history. The choices companies are making provide an answer.Since selling $4 billion in debt on March 30, Sysco has amassed $6 billion of cash and available liquidity, enabling it to gobble up market share, while cutting $500 million of expenses, according to Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hourican. Sysco, which is based in Houston, will continue to pay dividends to shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Joel Grade said on a May 5 earnings call.Junk BondMovie theaters were one of the first businesses to close during the pandemic. Cinemark, which owns 554 of them, shut its U.S. locations on March 17. Three days later, the company paid a previously announced dividend. It has since said it will discontinue such distributions. Cinemark borrowed $250 million from the junk-bond market on April 13, the same day it announced the firing of 17,500 hourly workers. Managerial staff were kept on at reduced pay, according to company filings. Cinemark, which is based in Plano, Texas, said it plans to open its theaters in phases starting June 19.The theater chain opted to go to the bond market over seeking funding from the government because “it didn’t come with any of the strings attached that government-backed facilities can include,” CEO Mark Zoradi said on the April 15 earnings call. It “was really no more complicated than that.”Sysco and Cinemark declined to comment for this story, and referred to their executives’ previous remarks.Omnicom issued $600 million in bonds on March 27. In an April 28 conference call to discuss quarterly earnings, CEO John Wren said the company was letting employees go but didn’t say how many. He said the company was extending medical benefits to July 31 for employees furloughed or fired.Wren added: “Our liquidity, balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong and we have no plans to change our dividend policy.” Omnicom didn’t respond to requests for comment.Toyota borrowed $4 billion from investors on March 27. Three days later, the Japan-based car company said it would continue paying dividends to shareholders. Eight days after that it said it would drop roughly 5,000 contract workers who helped staff its plants in North America. Scott Vazin, a Toyota spokesperson, declined to comment.In a March 24 letter, 200 academics, led by Stanford University Graduate School of Business Professor Jonathan Berk, called lending programs aimed at corporations “a huge mistake.” Better to focus help directly on people living paycheck to paycheck who lost their jobs, it said.“Bailing out investors who chose to take high-risk investments because they wanted the high returns undermines capitalism and makes it an unfair game,” Berk said in an interview. “If you don’t have a level playing field in capitalism, it doesn’t work.”(Updates with details of May jobs report in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Fed Vow Boosts Debt Binge as Borrowers Cut Thousands of Jobs

2020-06-07,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese behemoth that makes electric-car batteries for Tesla Inc. and Volkswagen AG developed a power pack that lasts more than a million miles -- an industry landmark and a potential boon for automakers trying to sway drivers to their EV models.Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. is ready to produce a battery that lasts 16 years and 2 million kilometers (1.24 million miles), Chairman Zeng Yuqun said in an interview at company headquarters in Ningde, southeastern China. Warranties on batteries currently used in electric cars cover about 150,000 miles or eight years, according to BloombergNEF.Extending that lifespan is viewed as a key advance because the pack could be reused in a second vehicle. That would lower the expense of owning an electric vehicle, a positive for an industry that’s seeking to recover sales momentum lost to the coronavirus outbreak and the slumping oil prices that made gas guzzlers more competitive.“If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,” said Zeng, 52, without disclosing if contracts for the long-distance product have been signed. It would cost about 10% more than the batteries now inside EVs, said Zeng, whose company is the world’s largest maker of the batteries.Concerns about batteries losing strength and having to be replaced after a few years is one factor holding back consumer adoption of EVs. Tesla last year flagged it expected to bring into production a battery capable of a million miles of operation, and General Motors Co. last month said it is nearing the milestone. That distance is equivalent to circling the planet 50 times.Anticipating a rapid return to growth for the EV industry, CATL is plowing research-and-development dollars into advances in battery technology. While the coronavirus outbreak will drag down sales throughout this year, EV demand will pick up in early 2021, said Zeng, who founded CATL a decade ago.Car buyers holding back during the pandemic is creating pent-up demand that will be unleashed starting next year, led by premium models, he said. CATL’s customers include BMW AG and Toyota Motor Corp.Zeng’s comments strengthen views that electric vehicles are set to weather the economic slowdown caused by the outbreak better than gas guzzlers. Battery-powered cars will swell to 8.1% of all sales next year in China, which accounts for the largest share of global EV sales, and to 5% in Europe, BNEF predicts.“The pandemic may have a lasting effect throughout 2020, but won’t be a major factor next year,” Zeng said. “We have great confidence for the long run.”CATL struck a two-year contract in February to supply batteries to Tesla, a major boon for the Chinese company as the U.S. electric-car leader has thus far mainly worked with Japan’s Panasonic Corp. and South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. The deal followed months of negotiations, with Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk traveling to Shanghai to meet with Zeng.The CATL batteries are set to go into Model 3 sedans produced at Tesla’s massive new factory near Shanghai, which started deliveries around the beginning of this year. Batteries are the costliest part of an EV, meaning suppliers of those components have a chance to reap a lion’s share of the industry’s profits.Zeng said he often shares insights with Musk, with the two exchanging text messages about developments in technology and business. CATL is strengthening its relationship with Tesla, with matters such as cobalt-free batteries on their agenda, Zeng said.“We’re getting along well and he’s a fun guy,” Zeng said of Musk. “He’s talking about cost all day long, and I’m making sure we have the solutions.”Zeng said Musk also requested his help in obtaining ventilators for coronavirus patients. The U.S. billionaire delivered more than 1,000 of the breathing machines from China to officials in Los Angeles in March.Shares of CATL have advanced about six-fold in Shenzhen since its initial public offering in 2018, giving the company a market value of about $47 billion. Tesla, by far the most valuable EV maker, has a market capitalization of about $160 billion.A “trigger point” for electric cars will occur once they overtake gasoline-powered vehicles around 2030-2035, Zeng said. That view is more ambitious than that of researchers such as BNEF, which expects the shift to take place a few years later.CATL, which is adding a production facility in Germany, is set to make more than 70% of batteries required by BMW, an early customer, Zeng said. CATL also works with Volkswagen’s Audi unit and is cooperating with Porsche, he said.Zeng didn’t rule out building a plant in the U.S., though he said the company has no specific plans for now.“Our team has made achievements in competing with our global rivals in overseas markets,” Zeng said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",A Million-Mile Battery From China Could Power Your Electric Car

2020-06-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Federal Reserve officials don’t like to talk about asset inflation.This is hardly surprising. The levels of stocks and corporate bonds, after all, aren’t part of their stated dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Moreover, the central bank has tried desperately to come off as not just catering to Wall Street interests since the 2008 financial crisis. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the importance of its “Fed Listens” forums, for one. Just last week, the New York Fed detailed a new event series called “The Fed and Main Street,” which aims “to discuss the challenges faced by vulnerable communities and highlight opportunities to work together toward an equitable economic recovery.”Such a statement sounds a little tone-deaf after the events of the past few months. The coronavirus pandemic has caused tens of millions of lower-paid and disproportionately black and Hispanic Americans to lose employment income while protests continue across the U.S. against systemic racism and police brutality. The Fed, meanwhile, has been given the lion’s share of credit for the V-shaped recovery in asset prices after increasing its balance sheet by $3 trillion and seizing control of bond markets. To further point out the contrast between Main Street and Wall Street:Main Street: The U.S. unemployment rate is 13.3%, up from 3.5% at the start of the year. Even though the federal government expanded aid, almost one-third of unemployment benefits estimated to be owed weren’t paid as of last week, and the program is set to end after July. Wall Street: The Fed’s corporate credit facilities opened up the bond market for Sysco Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Omnicom Group Inc. and Cinemark Holdings Inc. Each company raised billions of dollars in cash — and then fired workers. In Sysco’s case, dividends to shareholders will continue. Main Street: The Fed found that among people working in February, almost 40% of those in households making less than $40,000 a year had lost a job in March. Broadly, more than half of households making less than $50,000 experienced a loss in employment income because of Covid-19 as of late May. Bloomberg Economics forecasts that the next wave of job cuts will target millions of higher-paid workers. Wall Street: The S&P 500 Index recently staged its biggest 50-day rally on record and is now higher than it was coming into 2020, up more than 47% from its March intraday low. The tech-heavy Nasdaq eclipsed its all-time high. Dave Portnoy is becoming an incarnation of market sentiment, recently boasting: “Stocks only go up. Only losers take profits.”This is a huge discrepancy that will have serious implications for the American economy should it persist. The Fed’s own data show that slightly more than half of U.S. households (about 65 million) own stocks in some form, with a median value of $40,000. But that doesn’t come close to telling the whole story. A Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association analysis from October breaks down holdings even further, which is best represented with a chart:In the Fed’s own words, wealth tends to increase “because of the feedback effect on higher incomes from the returns generated by accumulated assets.” Meanwhile, ownership of equities “varies substantially” based on race. More than 60% of white families own stocks, either directly or through a retirement account, compared with 31% and 28% for black and Hispanic families, respectively. This follows directly from the large gap in median net worth among the groups:So, the wealthiest Americans, who own the largest share of financial assets, are reaping the biggest windfalls from the Fed’s unprecedented intervention across financial markets. Meanwhile, according to minutes of the central bank’s December meeting, central bankers heard at their “Fed Listens” forums that retirees were struggling with rising health-care costs and representatives of low- and middle-income communities flagged the increased prices of basic necessities like food, housing and utilities. Their incomes might have gone down lately, but those costs haven’t. The Fed has no good answer for this. Analysts are already pondering whether the central bank’s $600 billion Main Street Lending Program, put in place to save U.S. small businesses and tens of millions of jobs, is destined to fail. Bill Dudley, the former New York Fed President and Bloomberg Opinion contributor, spelled out the issue candidly in a Bloomberg TV interview last week:“The Fed’s monetary policy tools are really about supporting economic activity and driving the economy to higher levels of employment. However, that can actually cause financial asset values to go up, and that can actually exacerbate inequality. The Fed’s choices: not have a recovery, have less inequality; or have a recovery with buoyant financial asset prices and more inequality. The Fed’s tools are just not suited to address the inequality problem. It’s pretty much that binary.How does the Fed actually get money to millions of households and small businesses? That’s difficult to do operationally. It’s much easier to intervene in the capital markets, where the Fed can rely on counter-parties, primary dealers and others, to essentially help the Fed buy financial assets.”Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, put it even more bluntly in a recent report. “Fed balance sheet expansion and banking sector money creation are used for savings and purchasing financial assets,” he wrote. “You can increase the Fed balance sheet and the money supply as much as you want, if the money goes into asset transactions rather than GDP transactions it will not be inflationary.” Except, of course, for asset prices.It’s important to say that out loud, particularly when Fed officials use euphemisms like providing “liquidity” to the system or restoring “market functionality,” while lamenting a lack of wage growth and inflation in consumer prices. Years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing are one reason investment proceeds have increased as a share of total income since the end of the last recession while those from wages and other labor sources have tumbled. It looks as if the Fed’s answer to the coronavirus crisis will only serve to exacerbate those trends. There are no easy answers. Dudley acknowledged in a Bloomberg Opinion column last week that the Fed has encouraged moral hazard. “This doesn’t seem to be a good road to stay on,” he said. “But getting off it is very difficult. After all, no one wants to risk a depression in order to teach hedge funds, mortgage REITs or mutual-fund investors a lesson.”Maybe there’s middle ground. Central bankers will probably never do this, but imagine if they explicitly factored asset inflation into their policy decisions and mandate for stable prices. If stocks or other risky investments started to run higher, at a level well beyond their historical rate of return, that would be a signal that they should increase short-term interest rates or shut down bond-buying programs. That, in turn, would increase the cost of credit and could prevent some of the questionable corporate-finance maneuvers from the last expansion — think debt sales used to fund share buybacks, or the prevalence of “zombie firms,” which do little to aid most Americans.As it stands, the Fed merely monitors undefined “financial conditions.” According to the Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions index, they are now just as accommodative as they were when the central bank raised interest rates in March 2018 and December 2018. The same goes for a Bloomberg index that layers indicators of asset-price bubbles — like tech-share prices and the housing market — on top of the original parameters. Why not have a stated target for financial conditions and pledge to take action when it’s breached?I concede it’s hardly a perfect solution. But at least it’s something, rather than widespread acknowledgment that the current strategy isn’t ideal but that there’s simply no other way. It’s telling that only after the longest U.S. economic expansion in history did job gains reach parts of the population that had been previously left behind. Will those same people have to wait another decade this time around?Powell and his colleagues need a better answer on asset inflation and income inequality. I’d press the Fed chair on this topic if I were asking questions on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Pledging to talk with leaders in low-income communities — and communities of color in particular — is a good first step.But it’s not enough. The word “unprecedented” is often tossed around when describing the Fed’s interventions in recent months. As of now, it looks as if those actions will also create new extremes between America’s “haves” and “have-nots.” This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg) -- The surge in Tesla Inc.’s shares so far this month moved Elon Musk’s company even closer to displacing Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable carmaker.With a market capitalization of more than $190 billion, Tesla still has some distance to close to reach Toyota’s $210.5 billion valuation, which includes treasury shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A rally of about another 11% in Tesla shares could see it claim the crown if Toyota holds steady, with Tesla already up 23% since the beginning of June.Tesla’s valuation comes despite a gulf in the scale of the two automakers. The Palo Alto, California-based maker of electric cars produced 103,000 vehicles in the first quarter, or about 4% of the almost 2.4 million made by Toyota.Tesla climbed another 9% Wednesday to close above $1,000 for the first time as Musk, the chief executive officer, told employees it was “time to go all out” and put its Semi truck into volume production. Wedbush Securities Inc. touted the “massive” opportunity for the company in China, with Tesla appearing to be on track to reach 100,000 deliveries from its Shanghai factory in the first year.Tesla became the world’s second-most valuable automaker in January, when it surpassed Volkswagen AG. It’s now worth more than twice the German rival, which said Wednesday it will meet an end-of-summer deadline to start delivering its flagship ID.3 electric car.Tesla’s recent rally has also been boosted by hype surrounding newly listed Nikola Corp., a battery-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell truck maker.Toyota, meanwhile, forecasts an 80% plunge in profit this year and expects it could take until the first half of next year before the auto market recovers to pre-pandemic levels. Shares in Toyota are down about 10% so far this year, trading about 17% lower than the record high hit in 2015.Toyota’s market valuation includes the 14.3% of shares that Toyota itself holds as treasury stock, worth around $30 billion.

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares have been soaring in the weeks since Elon Musk said he thought they were too high. The chief executive officer just weighed in again on Twitter by referring to an internet meme generally used to ridicule the stock market.After a 9% jump on Wednesday lifted Tesla shares to a record closing price of $1,025.05, Musk’s initial post was cryptic.When one of Musk’s followers asked him what happened, he wrote back: “Stonks.”The intentional misspelling of the word stocks is often used on the internet to refer to the irony or absurdity of the equity markets. Tesla’s market capitalization has pulled within about $20 billion of Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s most valuable carmaker.The gulf between the two companies on other metrics is immense.

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Last week, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk liked a tweet that read, “Tesla is now officially the most valuable automaker of all the world!! Congrats!!”The tweet showed a screenshot of a well-shared Google sheet created by Reddit user u/brandude87, listing the world’s top 25 automakers by market value. The sheet showed Tesla above Toyota Motor Corp. for the first time, with a market value of $183.7 billion versus Toyota’s $178.78 billion.There’s just one problem: many investors, including those using financial data terminals such as Bloomberg’s, were seeing something very different: that Tesla still had to gain more than $25 billion dollars in market value to surpass Toyota.So who was right? Well, it’s complicated.Everyone can agree that a company’s market value, or its market capitalization, is determined by the amount of shares outstanding multiplied by its share price. But not everyone agrees on what should be counted in those shares outstanding.In recent years, Japanese companies have been expanding share buybacks to boost their returns to investors -- and they have a tendency to hoard these shares, with Toyota, which has been aggressively repurchasing its own stock over the past six years, holding more than any other company in Japan.Known in financial parlance as treasury stock, how the shares are accounted for varies from country to country. Some markets forbid holding of treasury shares entirely, while others have capped the amount that can be held.When it comes to Japanese-listed companies, treasury shares are typically included in quoted market cap figures. And when a company as valuable as Toyota holds as much as of its own shares as it does -- just over 14%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- that can have a big impact on market capitalization.A ranking of companies by market value published monthly by Tokyo Stock Exchange operator Japan Exchange Group Inc. shows market capitalization including treasury stock and lists Toyota’s market value at the end of May as 22 trillion yen ($205 billion) -- a figure which included almost $30 billion in treasury shares.Tesla Closing In on Toyota Market Value Spurs Celebration, DoubtExcluding those holdings, it’s only worth 18.8 trillion yen ($175 billion), according to Bloomberg calculations. That matches what you’d find on portals such as Yahoo Finance -- the source of the calculations in the tweet Musk touted. Many calculations of market cap, including those of U.S.-listed companies, typically don’t include treasury shares, which aren’t considered available to investors.Tesla, meanwhile, holds no treasury shares. What’s the right apples-to-apples comparison if you’re trying to determine which is the world’s largest automaker?“It’s semantics,” said Nick Reece, a money manager at Merk Investments. “Market cap can be defined in different ways. It depends on what you’re trying to get at.”After a 6% jump in trading on Monday in the U.S., Tesla’s $183.8 billion valuation was above Toyota’s $175 billion valuation, less its treasury stock.The amount of treasury shares held by Toyota has doubled since 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company periodically uses portions of them for executive compensation plans or, most recently, selling some of them to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. as part of a tie-up.“I guess the treasury shares have some value as far as accounting treatment is concerned,” said Michael Shaoul at Marketfield Asset Management. “But I think you could exclude them in a market cap comparison as long as you made it clear that they exist.”In any case, perhaps it’s not the right comparison to be made between a company that has made an average of more than 2 trillion yen ($18.7 billion) in net income for each of the last six years, and one that has yet to post an annual profit.“There isn’t a single person who thinks that simply because Tesla’s market cap has come close to that of Toyota, that Tesla is a company that is on par with Toyota,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo.“However, if you look 10 years down the road and factor in extreme expectations, $1,000 a share or $1,100 may be appropriate.”(Adds link to related story, updates market values throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Is Tesla Bigger Than Toyota or Not?

2020-06-19,"[Editor's note: &quot;5 EV Stocks to Buy for Big Gains over the Next Decade&quot; was previously published in January 2020. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]The 2010s were the decade in which the electric vehicle (EV) revolution got started.At the start of the decade, electric vehicles were essentially non-existent. Over the course of the next ten years, several things happened, all of which sparked more widespread EV adoption.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGlobal legislation started promoting EV purchases in an effort to combat carbon emissions. Infrastructure was built out to support EVs. Technology advanced to give EVs more range and power. Battery costs came down to make EVs more affordable. Consumers became increasingly aware of the adverse environmental impact of gas-powered cars, and similarly increased their uptake of EVs.Net net, EVs went from non-existent at the start of the 2010s, to over 2.2 million global deliveries in 2019, or more than 2% of global auto-deliveries.This growth ramp is far from over. If the 2010s were the decade when the EV revolution got started, the 2020s will be the decade in which the EV revolution goes mainstream.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge All the same tailwinds will remain in play. Global legislation will continue to incentivize EV adoption. Charging station infrastructure will continue to expand. EVs will continue to become more advanced with more range. Battery costs will continue to come down. Consumers will continue to pivot toward EVs as they become more and more concerned with reducing carbon emissions.In other words, all the same tailwinds that started the EV revolution in the 2010s will sustain that revolution in the 2020s. Considering EVs are ramping from a 2% penetration rate in 2018, the room for further growth here is tremendous. Indeed, IEA thinks that by 2030, global EV sales could measure anywhere between 20 million and 30 million cars, implying 10-fold to 15-fold growth from 2018.That's huge growth. Big enough to warrant buying and holding some EV stocks for the next decade. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock At the top of this list of EV stocks to buy for the future of transportation, we have global EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Tesla is the poster child of the EV revolution and with good reason. At just under 250,000 deliveries last year, Tesla accounted for about 12% of global EV deliveries. Last year, 2.2 million EVs were sold worldwide.In other words, Tesla is the unparalleled giant in the EV industry, with increasing market share thanks to the introduction and production/delivery ramp of new vehicles, like the Model 3.This dynamic should persist as the company continues rolling out new models and products. Tesla projects to maintain its leadership position in the global EV market over the next decade -- a period during which the EV market will grow by at least 10-fold.The result? Huge revenue and profit growth over at Tesla. All that growth will inevitably drive TSLA stock higher in the long run. General Motors (GM)Source: Shutterstock Traditional auto stocks aren't just sitting on their hands while the EV revolution passes them up. Instead, many traditional auto stocks are actually pivoting their vehicle portfolios to benefit from non-cyclical EV adoption tailwinds.One traditional auto stock which has done a really good job of this? General Motors (NYSE:GM).General Motors has an impressive lineup of EVs. It's headlined by the Chevrolet Bolt, which is the fourth-best selling EV in the U.S. this year, and the Chevrolet Volt, which lines up as the eighth top-selling EV in the U.S.Importantly, both cars are on the cheap end of the EV price range, which paves a path for both of these vehicle models to gain huge mainstream traction at scale.  * 15 Red-Hot Online Retail Stocks Soaring High in 2020 As such, the General Motors strategy in the EV market is pretty simple. Design solid EVs, which the masses can afford, and as the masses pivot into the EV market, convince them to buy the Bolt and/or Volt.This is a good strategy, and it does broadly imply that as the EV revolution gains mainstream traction in the 2020s, General Motors will benefit from robust EV growth. All that EV growth should drive GM stock higher in the long run. Ford (F)Source: Shutterstock One traditional auto stock that has been slow to pivot into EVs is U.S. auto giant Ford (NYSE:F). But the company is starting to aggressively pivot into the EV market, and this pivot lays the groundwork for healthy growth over the next decade.To start, Ford's headline EV -- the Ford Fusion Energi -- was the ninth-best selling EV in the U.S. last year, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Ford is in the process of building a Mustang-influenced electric crossover to rival Tesla's Model Y, a fully electric Lincoln crossover, a fully electric SUV and a fully electric F-150 pickup truck, alongside a handful of hybrid models.The sum of all these new EVs means that, by 2025, Ford's vehicle roster will be much more levered to EV tailwinds than it is today.The implication of this is that Ford's unit growth rates, which have been sluggish for several years, should look a lot better within the next few years. This growth trend improvement should push Ford stock higher in the long run, especially from today's depressed base. Toyota (TM)Source: Shutterstock Much like General Motors, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been aggressive early on with its pivot into developing and marketing affordable EVs that cater to mass adoption.Toyota's headline EV -- the Prius -- is arguably the only non-Tesla electric vehicle that consumers far and wide recognize. Not by coincidence, it's also the only non-Tesla electric vehicle which held its own against the Model 3, S and X in 2018 in terms of sales volume.Importantly, the Prius is exceptionally affordable, with prices in the $30,000 and under range. Thus, for capital-constrained consumers looking to pivot into the EV space who don't have $30,000-plus to shell out on a car, Toyota's Prius is the obvious choice.A lot of consumers fall into that categorization. As such, a lot of consumers project to buy Prius vehicles over the next several years as EV adoption rates soar.  * 7 of the Best Bank Stocks to Cash In On The result for Toyota is supercharged revenue and profit growth, the sum of which could breathe life back into TM stock, which has been stuck in a sideways trading pattern for the past five-plus years. BMW (BMWYY)Source: Shutterstock Not all the growth in the EV market over the next several years will happen at the low end of the price chart. Indeed, some of that growth will come through the high end of the price chart. Capturing a nice chunk of that growth will be BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY).BMW already has a formidable EV roster. Last year, the BMW 530e, i3 and X5 were among some of the top selling EV models in the U.S. This year, many of those same models are again some of the top-selling EVs in America, alongside the luxury i8, which has seen its U.S. delivery volume grow ten-fold.Going forward, BMW is only going to grow this EV roster. The company is planning to have 25 EVs on its vehicle roster by 2023, many of which will be luxury EVs. In so doing, the company will better position itself to drive healthy revenue and profit growth through luxury EV adoption over the next several years. Indeed, management expects EV sales to double by 2021.That's a bunch of growth. BMW stock, which trades more than 40% off decade highs, is not priced for this growth. As such, over the next several years, robust luxury EV growth should converge on a discounted valuation and spark a nice recovery rally in BMW stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TSLA and F.

2020-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Last summer, a suburban Boston couple who publish an online newsletter about EBay Inc. began calling the Natick Police Department to report peculiar and menacing forms of harassment: graffiti on their fence; mysterious deliveries of a funeral wreath and a book on surviving a spouse’s death; phony online advertisements about parties and yard sales that summoned strangers to their home.The culprits left few clues, and police initially dismissed the reports as pranks. So the frustrated couple took matters into their own hands and began collecting evidence. Their home security camera caught video of a Ford Explorer parked near their house. They gathered license plate numbers from a black Dodge Caravan and a silver GMC they suspected of tailing them.The tips prompted the police to take their concerns more seriously. Investigators linked rented vehicles to EBay employees and uncovered a stealthy campaign to frighten the couple, whose newsletter, EcommerceBytes, is an influential information source for the millions of merchants who peddle goods on the San Jose, California-based company’s marketplace.“The victims in this case were proactive and diligent,” Natick Police Lt. Cara Rossi said. “Once they had photos of a car that they felt was surveilling them, they did counter-surveillance of their own, and detectives now had a lead to follow. This lead led them to Ebay.”This week federal prosecutors unveiled an indictment charging six EBay employees with conducting a harassment campaign against the couple. The indictment also mentioned an “Executive 1” and “Executive 2,” which Bloomberg earlier identified as, respectively, former EBay Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig and former public relations chief Steven Wymer. Neither Wenig nor Wymer were charged with crimes.Ina and David Steiner have been publishing their newsletter, previously called AuctionBytes, since 1999. They delve into nitty-gritty details important to small merchants selling products on EBay, where 174 million shoppers around the world spend $85 billion a year.The Steiners’ longevity has made their newsletter an influential part of the EBay community even as CEOs have come and gone. Merchants get updates about their livelihoods and provide news tips. Ina Steiner, a dogged reporter, is the newsletter’s editor; David Steiner is the publisher. Ina made such frequent calls to EBay’s communications department on behalf of sellers that some EBay employees joked she should be put on the customer service payroll.But somewhere along the way, the relationship between the Steiners and EBay soured. Wenig was trying to fend off activist investors bent on breaking up the company and had become increasingly sensitive to tough media coverage.Steiner publishes regular stories about the site, often with critical commentary. Online comments beneath the stories routinely become a no-holds-barred bashing of EBay executives.Last August, Steiner published a story about a lawsuit EBay filed alleging Amazon.com Inc. employees created EBay accounts for the sole purpose of persuading its merchants to sell their goods on Amazon instead. “EBay’s CEO has been unable to stop a decline in marketplace sales, but trying to dissuade sellers from turning to Amazon (and trying to get Amazon to stop recruiting sellers) may not be the best tactic,” Steiner wrote.There were 55 comments beneath the story, including one from someone called “thievesBay” that said: “Poor eBay. The little puppy continues trying to nip at the heels of the big dog. This will go nowhere just like their last attempt.”In April of last year, according to the indictment, Wymer texted Wenig: “We are going to crush this lady.” The following month, during an exchange regarding Ina Steiner’s reporting, Wenig texted Wymer: “I couldn’t care less what she says.” Then, seconds later, he added, “Take her down.”Before long, according to the indictment, the harassment campaign was underway, with the alleged perpetrators sending live cockroaches to the couple and trying to put a GPS tracking device on their Toyota Rav4.Prosecutors claim EBay’s security director James Baugh and his underling David Harville led the elaborate campaign with help from four other EBay employees. Even as the Steiners gathered evidence that directed police toward them, the employees allegedly plotted to throw police off the trail by erasing messages and social media accounts, lying to investigators and trying to cast the Steiners as “crazy.”It didn’t work. In late August, the alleged harassers hatched a plan using the messaging platform WhatsApp to contact the Natick Police Department and the Steiners pretending to offer EBay’s help with the investigation in order to glean information and steer the probe elsewhere.Ina Steiner wasn’t having it. Shortly after connecting with the couple by phone, one of the alleged harassers messaged his colleagues, according to the indictment: “[Victim 1] said talk to the detective and then hung up the phone.” Days later, EBay put Baugh, Harville and one other employee on administrative leave after collecting work phones that were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",EBay’s Alleged Stalkers Exposed After Boston Couple’s Sleuthing

2020-06-26,"When I was a young boy, I did what other males my age did, at least the cool ones: take karate lessons. Though it may seem comical now, I learned the foundations of honor, commitment, and discipline. These are the attributes that drive companies like Toyota (NYSE:TM). But upstart Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is a completely different animal. And this is exactly why Nikola stock is so fascinating to speculators.Source: Nikola Press CenterNot too far removed from my karate days, I had the distinct privilege of attending a one-day ninja class. Taught by a then-popular Hollywood stuntman, a ninja's warcraft is wildly dissimilar from traditional martial arts. As you probably know, ninjas are assassins. They kill quickly and brutally for a profit, a perfect analogy for electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).In my adult years, I came across a discipline called Krav Maga. More self-defense than martial art, Krav Maga is undoubtedly the most ruthless and violent system I have ever learned. Its key hallmark is what I would term holistic or three-dimensional fighting. Anything - your hands, your feet, a broken pipe on the road - is a weapon. Use it to destroy your opponent.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you want to know the underlying ethos of Nikola stock, this is it.Within this holistic system, Krav Maga teaches early on to kick men in the groin. Yes, we do learn some of the crazy, flying spinning kicks that you see in UFC matches. But to execute properly requires flexibility and skill. Like developing a mechanically sound combustion-based powertrain, these components take time to perfect.  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave But if you need to take someone out right now, you kick 'em in the balls. That's why Nikola stock is up. Nikola Stock Is Both the Hunter and the HuntedHere's the thing - Krav Maga is a downright dirty system that you use to save your life. That's it. But the temptation is that attacks down low are instantly effective. Thus, whether you're facing off against Robert Downey Jr. or Robert Wadlow, all Roberts (to my understanding) have the same particular vulnerability.Underlining Tesla's incredible success is that they changed the rules completely. If they engaged in a boxing match with Ford (NYSE:F), as in combustion cars versus combustion cars, Tesla would lose. Instead, they went no-holds-barred with an electric platform; hence, Ford and other traditional automakers are keeled over, writhing in unbelievable agony.Personally, I never kicked a man down there because if I did, I would break an unspoken contract among all men. If I go there, so will everyone else.Initially, it's no surprise that Nikola is doing what it's doing. From a mechanical and engineering standpoint, EVs are easier to manufacturer. Utilizing the same &quot;dirty&quot; blueprint, NKLA built a remarkably compelling EV pickup truck. Just like that, sentiment soared for Nikola stock.But precisely because EVs are easier and quicker to develop, Nikola stock will soon face mass competition. It's the same reason why Krav Maga is a worldwide phenomenon now. Like EVs, the self-defense system distills centuries of hand-to-hand combat tactics to the most effective solutions for specific purposes.Therefore, a grandma with a walking stick can be an effective practitioner. But in the business world, of course, that low of a barrier to entry is a headwind. Should You Buy NKLA?Among the stocks I own, I have the least conviction toward NKLA. Certainly, the company has many positives. First, I love the moxie that Nikola is flaunting against Tesla. It's like President Theodore Roosevelt calling out President Donald Trump. There's just something incredibly satisfying about a boastful man getting knocked down a few pegs by his own medicine.Second, did you see the Nikola Badger? That's a truck even a Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) man would be proud to own. It's a far cry from the M.C. Escher experiment gone wrong that is the Tesla Cybertruck. I don't like to make investments based off one product. But for what it's worth, I did buy Nikola stock.However, some negatives exist too. Most worryingly, everybody is angling for each other's sensitive parts. That's why I always wore a protective cup after one harrowingly close call.But that also begs the question: what is the equivalent of a cup in the EV market? In the traditional market, that's easy to answer. For instance, a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is unmistakable, even if you're blind. Inherent in the exhaust note is the soul of an Italian opera.But what is branding in an EV? I'm willing to bet that our tech-cultural shift toward sleek sameness will drive Nikola stock higher in the long run. But in a world of testicular copycats, I'm not 100% sure who will remain standing upright.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Here’s How Much You Would Have Made If You’d Bought It.
2020-06-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. has grown from Silicon Valley gadfly to the world’s second-largest automaker by market capitalization in the decade since its initial public offering. It’s been a roller-coaster ride for the electric-car maker’s shareholders, who have experienced dizzying swoons on the way to record highs thanks in part to self-inflicted crises.“There’s always a lot of drama with Tesla, but they have spurred the auto industry on to embrace electrification as key to the future of mobility,” said Tony Posawatz, the former leader of General Motors Co.’s Volt plug-in hybrid program, ex-CEO of Fisker and current director at Lucid Motors Inc. “Whether they are profitable or not, they have impacted the luxury auto market forever more.”On June 29, 2010, Tesla made its debut as a public company -- the first initial public offering of a domestic automaker in a half century. The IPO price was $17 a share. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk rang the Nasdaq opening bell, and the company’s lone electric car, the $109,000 Roadster, was on display in Times Square.A decade later, Tesla’s stock is trading at $959.74 a share, the company has grown to about 48,000 employees and its influence on the global auto industry is unprecedented. Despite plenty of doubters and some near-death experiences, Tesla’s $178 billion market valuation is second only to Toyota Motor Corp. among all carmakers.Tesla no longer makes the Roadster, but it sells four other models in markets around the world. Besides design, one of the company’s biggest advantage lies with its batteries: A version of the flagship Model S now boasts a range of more than 400 miles. No other electric car comes close.“Their products create a lot of enthusiasm among customers,” Posawatz said.As Wall Street waits for the company to report second-quarter production and delivery figures later this week, here are 10 key moments that shaped Tesla’s extraordinary decade.1) Government LifelineIn January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department awarded Tesla a $465 million loan as part of the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program that President George W. Bush signed into law two years earlier. The funding came at a critical time, with the nation was still clawing its way out of the Great Recession. In May 2013, Tesla paid off the entire loan with interest. The DOE program has now become a model of clean-energy stimulus spending.2) Fremont FactoryIn May 2010, Tesla stunned the world when it announced it was buying a shuttered auto plant formerly run by Toyota and General Motors Co. in Fremont, California, and Toyota was investing $50 million in the startup. The surprise deal was unveiled by Musk and Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s president, who flew in from Japan for the announcement. The Fremont plant still produces the bulk of Tesla’s cars, but the company now has a second car-assembly plant near Shanghai and is building a third close to Berlin.3) Car of the YearIn December 2012, Motor Trend named the Model S its 2013 Car of the Year. It was the first winner in the 64-year history of the award not powered by an internal-combustion engine. The nod showed established automakers that battery-powered cars could be more than just nerdy science projects and gave the Tesla brand a huge boost.4) The “Gigafactory”In September 2014, Tesla announced it had chosen Nevada as the site for the automaker’s first battery-production “gigafactory,” with Panasonic Corp. as its partner. The news capped fierce battle among states hoping to land the economic-development project. The plant demonstrated Tesla’s drive to vertically integrate its supply chain all the way down to the battery-cell level. Tesla is now making moves to establish its own cell-manufacturing operation in Fremont, and investors are eager to hear more at a “Battery Day” event in September.5) Musk’s iPhone MomentWhen Tesla unveiled the Model 3 sedan in March 2016, customers lined up in a way the world had grown accustomed to seeing consumers queue up for iPhones. The promise of a $35,000 mass-market car barely materialized -- the average transaction price is closer to $50,000 -- but the Model 3 managed to rival mainstream sedans on sales charts. The company is now trying to tap into a growing segment of the market with the Model Y crossover.6) Autopilot ScrutinyOn May 7, 2016, a devoted Tesla customer and former Navy SEAL, Joshua Brown, died when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor-trailer in Florida. Tesla’s driver-assistance system Autopilot was engaged at the time, and the death was the first known fatality involving the technology. U.S. regulators investigated but found no defect. Autopilot continues to come under scrutiny, and several other fatalities in the U.S. have been linked to the system.Read more: Tesla Can’t Perfect Autopilot Without a Few Deadly Crashes7) Solar SiblingIn June 2016, Tesla announced it was making an offer to buy SolarCity, a solar-panel installer Musk founded with his cousins. The conflicts of interest were stark: Musk was SolarCity’s largest shareholder and the chairman of its board. SolarCity was struggling financially and Tesla had just unveiled the Model 3, but Musk pitched the acquisition as a “no brainer” and announced a new tiled-roof product to sell investors on the acquisition. The rollout of the Tesla-branded roof has been slow, and the deal itself continues to be contested, with a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders slated to begin next month in Delaware Chancery Court.8) “Funding Secured”As foreshadowed by Musk’s prediction the previous fall that Tesla would find itself in “production hell,” 2018 was a crazy year. Tesla struggled to mass-manufacture the Model 3 and built an assembly line under a massive outdoor tent to boost output. Scores of executives left. In July, Musk called a British cave diver a “pedo guy” on Twitter, triggering a defamation lawsuit. The following month, Musk shocked investors and his own executives when he tweeted about taking Tesla private at $420 a share and said he had “funding secured.” Three weeks later, in a late Friday night blog post, Musk backtracked and said Tesla would remain public. A month later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for securities fraud. The settlement stripped Musk of the chairman role for three years -- meaning that Musk could become chair again in late 2021.9) Shanghai ShowingTesla scored a major win in the midst of all the 2018 drama by becoming the first American automaker to be allowed to build a manufacturing plant in China without a local joint-venture partner. Tesla’s factory near Shanghai started delivery of its first vehicles on Jan. 7, one year after breaking ground. China is the world’s largest auto market and a huge part of Tesla’s future growth plans.10) Cybertruck SmashIn November, Musk unveiled the futuristic Cybertruck, an angular pickup shaped far differently than a Ford F-150. The real show stopper was when Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s long-time design chief, smashed two of the truck’s ostensibly shatterproof windows with a metallic ball. The botched demo generated an enormous amount of buzz. Tesla wants to build a plant for the Cybertruck in the U.S., and sites in Texas and Oklahoma are the two finalists.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Ten Years After IPO, a Look Back at Tesla’s Extraordinary Decade"

2020-07-01,"Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is now the undisputed leader among automakers in terms of market capitalization, thanks to the breathtaking rally in its stock seen since it bottomed in mid-March during the coronavirus-induced market meltdown. Tesla's Staggering Valuation:  Tesla's shares are valued at $208.4 billion, based on the current stock price of $1,123.65 and 185.48 million outstanding shares.In comparison, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), which held the top spot previously, has a market cap of $202.74 billion, based on the closing price of its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday.The feat is commendable for a relatively new entrant in the sector. Tesla was founded in 2003 and went public in June 2010 by offering 13.3 million shares at $17 each. Tesla's market cap breezed past the combined market cap of traditional U.S. automakers General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) in early January, when its shares hit a then-record high of $492.14, rendering the valuation at $89 billion.When debt is included, Toyota is valued at $284 billion compared to Tesla's enterprise value of $207 billion, the  Financial Times reported,  citing data from Sentieo.Tesla Catalysts Driving The Rally:  Tesla shares broke above a long-term resistance around the $385 level in mid-December 2019. After that, the stock saw a meteoric rise and peaked at $944.78 Feb. 19.The momentum in shares was supported in part by the progress Tesla was making in  China,  the hot-and-happening EV market. The company began  rolling out  the first Model 3 vehicles from its Shanghai Gigafactory in late December 2019.After turning profitable in the third quarter of 2019, Tesla reported a profit yet again in the fourth quarter. Belying expectations, the company continued its profit-generating streak and reported a surprise profit for the first quarter of 2020.The stock also received support from the news flow related to Model Y crossover SUVs, which began rolling out in mid-March, and its Cybertruck.See also:  Tesla Now China's Largest EV Manufacturer By Output: Report After the mid-February peak, the stock experienced a downturn along with the broader market in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.The stock retreated to a low of $350.51 March 18, translating to a peak-to-trough decline of about 63%.Tesla's stock took off from there at a breathtaking pace and  breached the ,000 level intraday  for the first time June 10.After moving back and forth around the mark on investor worries over a weak second quarter due to the COVID-19 impact on deliveries and production, the shares have seen a marked upward momentum in recent sessions. The stock hit new highs --both intra-day and closing -- both Monday and Tuesday, and appears on track to close at a fresh high Wednesday.Recent optimism concerning a quarter-end-push by Tesla that could lift its performance beyond expectations despite a lukewarm April-May period has generated renewed buying interest in the stock.Where Tesla Is Headed:  Tesla, being the EV pioneer, has superior technology and a competitive edge.Recently, the company announced its Model S Long Range Plus electric vehicles in North America, which have an official EPA-rated range of 402 miles.The company is also working with Chinese supplier CATL on a 1-million-mile battery. Apart from selling cars, Tesla has potential opportunity  in the form of high-margin recurring software revenue through is full-self driving advanced driver assistance system, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.Notwithstanding its prospects, the sell-side is skeptical about Tesla's heady valuation.

2020-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. displaced Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable automaker, underscoring investor enthusiasm for a company trying to transform an industry that’s relied on internal combustion engines for more than 130 years.Shares of Tesla, which have more than doubled since the start of the year, climbed as much as 3.5% in intraday trading Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization of $207.2 billion, surpassing Toyota’s $201.9 billion.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has ignored or broken many of the established auto industry’s rules and norms in the 10 years since he took Tesla public, selling cars online and assembling vehicles in high-cost California. But while his company’s value has soared, there remains a gulf in the scale of his company and the world’s biggest car manufacturers.Tesla produced 103,000 vehicles in the first quarter, or about 4% of the almost 2.4 million made by Toyota, which built its brand on affordability and reliability backed by innovations in large-scale manufacturing.Tesla became the world’s second-most valuable automaker in January, when it surpassed Volkswagen AG. It’s now worth more than twice the German giant.After pioneering gas-electric vehicles with the Prius hybrid, Toyota was late to shift to fully electric autos and has wagered heavily on hydrogen fuel cells. The company is now making a series of high-profile investments in EVs and self-driving cars. The manufacturer has forecast an 80% plunge in profit this year and expects it could take until the first half of next year before the auto market recovers to pre-pandemic levels.Toyota’s market valuation includes the 14.3% of shares that Toyota itself holds as treasury stock, worth around $30 billion.

As consumers return to stores, Unilever's sales should recover. Still, the company must adjust to the ever-lasting impact of people staying at home. So, instead of relying on ice cream and food that restaurants and cafes buy, the company needs to pivot.Unilever stock has a strong overall rating.

Those who have to go to work and want to avoid public transportation will want to buy a Toyota.Still, Toyota's sales rebound will not happen until after July at the earliest. The company forecasts a 10% drop in production volume in July. This is a solid improvement from the 40% decrease in June.  As global demand recovers, domestic production will bounce back. Toyota forecasts sales will recover to last year's levels by the end of 2020.

Looking ahead, the company has a few priorities that will sustain its growth. In addition to protecting the health and safety of its employees and customers, it will manage its global supply chain and manage the business for volatility.For instance, CEO Mike Hsu said: &quot;Like other companies, we haven't significantly pared back our SKU count, and that we've done that in partnership with our customers, who have been very supportive along that journey. And that has increased our theoretical capacity because we have fewer changeovers and less complexity in the plants.&quot;  * 5 Penny Stocks Under $10 to Buy in June By running efficiently, KMB shares could bounce higher as demand patterns recover in places like Asia, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.

2020-07-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Back when Tesla Inc. delivered 95,000 cars to customers during the spring quarter of 2019, the stock price was languishing at about $235 and Elon Musk’s electric car company was valued at “only” $40 billion. Fast forward a year and the shares are now priced at more than $1,200. With a market capitalization of $224 billion, Tesla has surpassed Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable automaker.Yet in the second quarter of 2020, Tesla delivered 91,000 vehicles — about 5% fewer than the same period last year. That’s pretty underwhelming for a company whose fans view it as a fast-growing technology company in the mold of Amazon.com Inc., rather than a sluggish metal-bashing carmaker. So how is the massive recent jump in its market value justified?In fairness, it shows resilience to sell this many cars when the company’s main California plant was shut by the pandemic for much of the spring period. Doubtless, Tesla’s new Shanghai plant picked up the production slack, which suggests the expense and effort of getting that China factory up and running was worth it. The launch of Tesla’s new Model Y crossover vehicle will have helped. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. both saw their U.S. deliveries decline by a third in the same quarter. Nevertheless, Tesla’s stock market acolytes pushed the shares up another 8% on Thursday, adding $16.5 billion to the market value. Such exuberance is hard to understand. Musk’s company sold 7,650 more vehicles than analysts expected during the second quarter, and the stock price jump equates to about $2 million of added shareholder value for each of those additional sales. This seems a little excessive given that a Tesla Model 3 sells for less than $40,000, and the profit margin on those cars is pretty slim.  The shareholder reaction makes even less sense when you consider that Tesla investors aren’t really meant to buying the stock because of the company’s current sales, which are less than 4% of Volkswagen AG’s. Rather, the investment case is a long-term one: that it will come to occupy a dominant position in clean transport and energy in the years ahead. That explains why the shares trade at 320 times its analyst-estimated earnings this year. Viewed through this lens, Tesla’s ability to shift a few thousand extra cars in recent weeks shouldn’t matter so much for the valuation.  Investors’ tendency to overreact to Tesla news made more sense when its survival was open to doubt. A year ago it was laying off workers, U.S. sales were slowing and its retail strategy was confused. Senior staff kept heading for the exit. The company was burning through cash and ran pretty low on financial fuel. It had just $2.2 billion of cash in March 2019, compared with more than $8 billion now.But subsequent evidence that Tesla can sell cars for more than it costs to produce them has transformed the mood — and with it Tesla’s stock price.Instead of “killing” off Tesla, the tepid electric offerings of established carmakers such as Audi and Mercedes have only underscored the quality of their rival’s battery and powertrain technology (the same can’t be said of Tesla’s build quality). Volkswagen’s software problems with its forthcoming ID.3 electric vehicle suggest catching Tesla won’t be straightforward, even with the Germans’ vast resources.Tesla’s stratospheric valuation appears to have become self-reinforcing. Should it require more money to fund its roughly $9 billion of capital expenditure over the next three years, it can raise it from shareholders without worrying about diluting them too much.Similarly, holders of more than $4 billion of convertible bonds that Tesla issued to fund its expansion should be happy to convert them into stock, rather than demand cash repayment, taking some of the pressure off the company and its balance sheet.  Still, Tesla’s valuation remains impossible to justify by any standard metrics. Analysts’ average price target is more than 40% below the current level. Even Musk has suggested that the share price, which has almost trebled since the start of 2020, is too high — although, as with his taunting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and his comments about “fascist” lockdowns, it’s usually better to tune out what Musk says and focus on his actions instead.  The skeptics might have more faith in Tesla’s new position as the leader of the automaker pack when Musk stops his provocations and his shareholders stop getting giddy over modest good news.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It doesn’t take much imagination to see the Federal Reserve supporting the stock price of Apple Inc.The central bank’s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility recently released details about its “Broad Market Index,” which is a roadmap for which individual bonds it will buy for its portfolio after changing the rules to avoid forcing issuers to certify they’re in compliance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Just looking at the 13 companies with weightings of at least 1%,(2)which collectively make up almost one-fifth of the index, a few things stand out. First, there are six automobile companies, with subsidiaries of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and Germany’s Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG as the three largest issuers overall. In fourth is AT&T Inc., the largest nonfinancial borrower due in no small part to its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc. Then there’s Apple. As a reminder, it’s the largest U.S. company by market capitalization at $1.57 trillion, edging out Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Its shares have easily rebounded from the selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rallying 24% so far in 2020. Yes, Apple has about $100 billion of debt outstanding, but it’s also known for having one of the largest cash piles in the world. It’s so big, in fact, that the company could repay all its obligations and still have roughly $83 billion left over.With so much cash, that naturally raises the question: Why does Apple take on debt in the first place?In each of Apple’s past three dollar-bond sales, in November 2017, September 2019 and May, the company said it would use proceeds at least in part to repurchase common stock and pay dividends under its program to return capital to shareholders. In total, the company has doled out more than $200 billion since the start of 2018. It’s easy to see why company leadership would see it as too cheap not to borrow. Apple has the second-highest investment-grade credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, allowing it to issue $2.5 billion of 30-year bonds in May that yielded just 2.72%. Its $2 billion of three-year debt, within the Fed’s maturity range, priced to yield less than 0.85%.Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, said during the last quarter’s earnings call that the company has more than $90 billion in stock buyback authorization left, adding that it plans to continue the same capital allocation policy going forward.Obviously, cash is mostly fungible for large enterprises, and any number of American companies in recent years surely issued bonds for reasons other than buybacks and also repurchased shares. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated some $700 billion of shares were acquired by U.S. companies in 2019, which would make them the biggest net buyer of equities.Still, Apple openly using debt sales to help finance share repurchases puts the Fed in a somewhat awkward position. Chair Jerome Powell has consistently framed questions about its secondary-market facility in the context of supporting the central bank’s full employment mandate. Workers are “the intended beneficiaries of all of our programs,” he said in a hearing last month. It’s possible Americans “are able to keep their jobs because companies can finance themselves.”And yet, the Fed’s secondary-market facility comes with no strings attached. In fact, as I noted last month, its maneuver to create Broad Market Index Bonds circumvented the CARES Act requirement that any company must have “significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the United States.” Rather than focus on the American worker, the stated goal is to “support market liquidity for corporate debt,” and, by extension, keep borrowing costs down for creditworthy firms. So there’s every reason to expect that Apple can and will issue bonds again in the near future, at an even cheaper rate, to fund stock buybacks and dividends. That, in turn, would most likely support share prices.That shouldn’t sit well with many people. Even President Donald Trump, who has used the stock market as a barometer of his economic policies, has signaled a preference for capital projects over buybacks. On March 20, just before the S&P 500 Index fell to its lowest level of the Covid-19 selloff, he lamented that companies used the money saved from his 2017 tax cut to repurchase shares rather than build factories. He said at the time that he would support a prohibition on buybacks for companies that receive government aid.“When we did a big tax cut and when they took the money and did buybacks, that’s not building a hangar, that’s not buying aircraft, that’s not doing the kind of things that I want them to do,” Trump said. “We didn’t think we would have had to restrict it because we thought they would have known better. But they didn’t know better, in some cases.” The Fed’s strategy for buying corporate bonds is passive enough that few would equate it to receiving direct assistance from the federal government. The same can’t be said about the central bank’s Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which as of last week is open for business. Companies that want to place bonds directly with the Fed must certify that they have “not received specific support pursuant to the CARES Act or any subsequent federal legislation” and “satisfy the conflicts-of-interest requirements of section 4019 of the CARES Act.” As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Matt Levine described in detail last week, there’s a huge amount of paperwork for issuers, and the Fed has the right to demand its money back if the forms are wrong and companies use funds for unapproved reasons.In all likelihood, these constraints will turn almost every company away from the Fed’s primary-market facility. Instead, finance officers will reap the benefits of the central bank’s broad secondary-market interventions to issue new debt to private investors at rock-bottom rates and with no such rules, as they have for the past three months. And Wall Streeters will be happy with business-as-usual in the credit markets.To put it plainly one more time: The Fed didn’t have to loosely interpret the law to create this index of corporate debt. It was already following through on its pledge to buy exchange-traded funds and had a system in place for companies to become eligible for individual purchases. It chose this third route, encouraging headlines like  “Buying Corporate Bonds Is Almost Easy Money, Strategists Say.” What could go wrong?Now that it’s scooping up individual bonds issued for share buybacks without any stipulations, policy makers should be asked again why this program is the right way to go about supporting the recovery. The truth is likely that corporate America needs low-cost debt to survive. Apple and its shareholders are more than happy to tag along for the ride.(1) The Fed's facility has not yet purchased debt from all the companies in the index, at least according to its disclosure, which only covers the$429 million in bonds it bought on June 16 and 17. Its largest purchases were Comcast Corp., AbbVie Inc. and AT&T Inc.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- It was sold as an all-or-nothing moonshot into space, the boldest pay package in corporate history.Now, with Tesla Inc.’s stock on a seemingly unstoppable rise, Elon Musk is poised to collect the second tranche of his pay award, worth $2.4 billion.Barring a sudden drop in the electric-car maker’s shares, the final performance threshold tied to market value should be met in a matter of days. That would unlock 1.69 million stock options, yielding Musk the 10-figure sum if he were to exercise and immediately sell the shares.The remarkable payout follows an equally remarkable ride for Tesla, whose shares have more than quadrupled this year and ballooned Musk’s net worth to $70.5 billion, making him the seventh-richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The automaker is currently worth more than Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and Hyundai Motor Co. combined.Read more: Elon Musk Soars Past Warren Buffett on Billionaires RankingThe rally has left Wall Street analysts struggling to make sense of the firm’s valuation, which topped $300 billion on Monday. Some have focused on the company’s work to improve batteries or the prospect that it may soon start selling cars in India.Tesla is scheduled to release second-quarter results July 22. If it reports a profit, it would be the fourth consecutive such quarter -- a milestone needed to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.Ambitious TargetsMusk, 49, has never accepted a salary, with his pay instead consisting of option awards that he can collect only if the California-based company meets ambitious targets.The most recent iteration, unveiled in early 2018, was the largest-ever corporate pay deal struck between a company’s board and its chief executive officer. It includes 20.3 million options, split into 12 tranches, that could yield Musk more than $50 billion if all goals are met, according to Tesla’s estimates.Getting all of it, however, is far from certain. Each tranche is tied to specific targets for revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as Tesla’s average trailing market capitalization over 30 days and six months. The first market-value threshold was set at $100 billion, with the others following in $50 billion increments.Tesla reached its first milestones for sales and Ebitda -- $20 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively -- last year. And its 30-day market value average has been well above the $150 billion threshold for some time. Once the six-month average exceeds that level, Musk will claim the 1.69 million options and can exercise them at will.Musk said on Twitter last week that he could cash in on some of his stock eventually to further the mission of his other most high-profile company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tesla’s Elon Musk Nears $2.4 Billion Haul as Stock Keeps Soaring

2020-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- During a series of Cisco Systems Inc. online all-hands meetings on race in early June, some workers posted comments in message channels that other staff and company management said were demeaning to Black people, exposing racial divisions at the Silicon Valley tech giant and leading to the dismissal of a number of people.During the first videoconference on June 1, following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins spoke with Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, who is Black, and Bryan Stevenson, a Black lawyer and author who founded the Equal Justice Initiative, in front of 30,000 employees. The conversations about race continued in subsequent online global staff meetings.“Black lives don’t matter. All lives matter,” one worker wrote in the comments during one of the virtual all-hands meetings, according to screen shots obtained by Bloomberg. Another said the phrase Black Lives Matter “reinforces racism” because it singles out one ethnic group. “People who complain about racism probably have been a racist somewhere else to people from another race or part of systematic oppression in their own community!” a third worker wrote in the chat section visible for all those online.Cisco, the world’s largest networking company, said it fired “a handful” of workers for inappropriate conduct because it “will not tolerate” racism. Bloomberg News wasn’t able to confirm the identities of all the fired workers so chose not to name any of them.Floyd’s death in late May under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer re-energized the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted a nationwide reckoning over the role of race in American life. Many technology companies, including Cisco, responded by affirming their support for equal rights and opportunities for Black Americans, donating to groups leading those efforts and educating their workforces on the struggle for racial equity.Internal BacklashExecutives have publicly positioned themselves against racism, but some workers inside these companies are chafing at the new focus on race. The incident at Cisco is just one example of a company facing an internal backlash to its support for racial justice.The conflict has intensified questions about how these largely forward-thinking companies should manage employees with differing views on race. While Cisco fired some workers, other tech companies facing dissent, such as Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn and HashiCorp Inc., have taken different approaches such as increased employee training. Automaker Toyota Motor Corp. dismissed U.S. workers involved in a video that mocked Floyd’s death.“Employers should be striving for zero tolerance when it comes to racism and discrimination, period,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The protests we’ve seen in the streets have become part of our new normal and will eventually make their way inside workplaces if employers fail to meet the moment.”‘Heartbreaking’Cisco said 237 of 10,400 comments made during the June 1 videoconference objected to what was being presented or disagreed that the meeting should even be taking place. Most of the messages expressed praise for management, making the minority of reactionary posts stand out and sparking responses from other staffers. The posts, written while Robbins was announcing a $5 million donation to groups combating racism, shocked some executives.“I just felt sad to see it,” Francine Katsoudas, Cisco’s executive vice president and chief people officer, said in an interview. “I felt a ton of empathy. I knew that for the African-American and Black employees that were in the meeting, that it was heartbreaking to see that.”After the first meeting, Katsoudas and her team discussed the comments so they could address what went wrong. The following week during a worldwide videoconference with staff, she read some of the most offensive posts and explained what the San Jose, California-based company considered legitimate debate.“You have a framework where red absolutely is crossing the line,” Katsoudas said. “But if someone has a question or they don’t understand something, there’s a way for them to ask that question. We went through and just placed things on that spectrum.” In 2019, 3.8% of Cisco’s U.S. workforce and 2.2% of leaders and people managers were Black, according to the company’s diversity report.“A few” employees who had written some offensive posts during the video meetings sent notes acknowledging their mistakes and said they were learning, Katsoudas said. But the remarks remained seared in the minds of some Black employees, who were shocked by the audacity of the display.“Wow…and these people work at Cisco?” one outraged employee wrote. “If they are bold enough to say those things at work for all to see, imagine what is said behind closed doors.”Several employees said Cisco was guilty of hypocrisy because it wanted to silence those who disagreed with the movement to improve Black lives. “No place for contradictory opinions or feelings,” one wrote. “Wow. This is my first and last comment, then.”LinkedIn, a social network for professionals, also held an all-employee meeting about racism last month that ended up mired in bitterness, an event that was reported earlier by the Daily Beast. The company had an anonymous comment section, which some workers filled with vitriol against Black people. Among the posts were those saying Black people weren’t hired as much because they weren’t qualified; that LinkedIn was trying to foist White guilt on workers; and that law-enforcement killings of Black people weren’t important because more African-Americans were murdered by members of their community.The meeting devastated many Black employees, who were outraged by the remarks and became suspicious of some of their White colleagues, according to people familiar with the situation. Since the meeting, some Black workers at LinkedIn have been angered by what they see as a failure by senior executives to adequately respond to the incident, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the internal communications.Executives at LinkedIn didn’t seek to unmask those making the offensive statements because they had pledged anonymity for the online comments section to create a “safe space” and felt they needed to honor that pledge, a spokeswoman said. LinkedIn’s leaders also suggested the incident was the result of a few bad apples rather than any larger issues with the culture at the Mountain View, California-based company, the people said. LinkedIn has one Black executive in its C-suite, Chief People Officer Teuila Hanson, who joined in June. The company’s workforce is 3.5% Black -- in line with its tech peers -- according to its most recent diversity report.After the meeting, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky said the display was “appalling,” apologized to employees and promised anonymous feedback wouldn’t be allowed in future virtual gatherings.Building AccountabilityThe spokeswoman pointed to other subsequent executive blog posts for the company’s response. Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Melissa Selcher said in June that LinkedIn would redouble efforts to diversify its people managers, teach employees through a companywide curriculum and develop an “accountability framework.”“We will do the hard work to build an anti-racist culture at LinkedIn, hiring and growing employees from under-represented groups and investing in a diverse and inclusive environment where all talent thrives,” Selcher wrote in the post.The company said it has donated $500,000 to the National Urban League, Southern Poverty Law Center, NAACP, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and other groups that work on advocacy and economic justice for the Black community. LinkedIn is also matching employee donations of as much as $15,000 to these types of organizations.The company is soliciting feedback from employees on what it should do next, the people said.Even before Floyd’s death, some tech companies had been forced to deal with contentious internal debate about gender, race and politics. Alphabet Inc.’s Google fired engineer James Damore in 2017 after he wrote a memo claiming the internet company was an ideological echo chamber that discriminated against men in favor of less talented women. Pundits such as Tucker Carlson of Fox News, then-Republican U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher and media outlets including Breitbart News came to Damore’s defense, pointing to the dismissal as an example of the company’s political bias against conservatives.Higher ExpectationsNow, with greater focus on issues facing the African-American community, Black tech workers have higher expectations for their employers. HashiCorp Inc., a software startup valued at more than $5 billion, recently announced a donation pledge to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which gives bail money to low-income people awaiting trial, and the Southern Poverty Law Center in response to protests against policy brutality and racism in May and June. A vocal minority of its 1,000-person workforce complained in memos to human-resources executives, saying the company was supporting “looters and rioters,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Many other staffers told executives in written messages and calls that they wanted HashiCorp to go even further in support of Black lives, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the situation.“Overwhelmingly, our employees have been supportive of the company’s actions and donations of support to the Black Lives Matter movement,” a HashiCorp spokeswoman said in a statement. “We heard from a couple of employees who expressed their disagreement through internal private channels. While we understand that some employees might have differing opinions, we stand by our actions.”As this debate plays out at their workplaces and across the country, some Black tech employees have been left feeling adrift -- unwanted by some colleagues, unsupported by some employers.“We still have work to do as a nation,” one Cisco employee wrote on an internal message board seen by Bloomberg. “I pray my daughters have a better world to live in soon.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Fires Workers for Racial Comments During Diversity Forum

2020-07-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Deep in the electric-vehicle industry’s supply chain is a little-known Japanese manufacturer that makes a seemingly mundane, but essential, device: coil-winding machines.If the motor is the heart of an EV, then coils in turn are the heart of the electric motor. Odawara Engineering Co., founded 70 years ago as a supplier for appliance makers, is an expert in the making the dense loops of wire that go into those motors. Tesla Inc., manufacturer of the Model S and Model 3 sedans and most recently the world’s most-valuable automaker, is one of its biggest customers.Although the coronavirus pandemic has depressed global auto sales, BloombergNEF predicts that economies will speed up adoption of EVs as some countries choose to bolster funding for low-emission cars and infrastructure. The global market for coil-winding machines is projected to expand at 10% annually and will reach $1.3 billion in 2024, according to Global Info Research.“We have to keep making our machines better,” said Masahiko Hoshina, vice president at Odawara Engineering. “Our clients can’t win if they can’t differentiate their products.”Electromagnetic coils interact with magnets to turn electric energy into motion, the basic principle behind the motors that power everything from drills to commuter trains. The shares of Odawara Engineering jumped 21% on Monday. Located in Odawara, a city about 90 kilometers (56 miles) west of Tokyo, the company’s prime business during Japan’s postwar economic boom was building coil-winding machines for makers of refrigerators and air conditioners. Apart from Tesla, the company also counts Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. among its customers. In 2018, Tesla made up 12% of Odawara Engineering’s sales, but in 2019 that probably slipped below 10%, the threshold for reporting such figures.Robust demand for Odawara Engineering’s machines means it will probably keep its outlook intact for the current year. The company maintained its forecast for operating profit of 700 million yen ($6.5 million) and revenue of 14.5 billion yen intact when it reported results in May, as the Covid-19 outbreak shuttered economies across the globe.“The shift toward electrification and automation won’t change” even during the pandemic, said Akihiko Kawazoe, an analyst at Toyo Securities. “The company probably won’t be impacted by the coronavirus as much. Its sales will likely be in line with its outlook.”Odawara Engineering’s Hoshina said the company’s backlog for coil-winding machines has increased since December, and he said the manufacturer is now focused on cutting costs. Bigger companies in the sector are buying smaller ones, and competition is becoming more global, he said.In 2018, Germany’s Schaeffler AG bought Elmotec Statomat GmbH & Co., a winding technology company. ABB Ltd and Thyssenkrupp AG have joined CWIEME, a global trade and expo group for coil winding and electric motors. Odawara Engineering also competes with Tana Automation Co., Nittoku Co. and China’s Changzhou Jinkang Precision Mechanism Co.In order to fit more wire into motors, Odawara is working on “hairpin” winding machines. Instead of round wires, square-shaped wires are used to pack more into electric motors, improving their efficiency and performance. Denso Corp. was among the pioneers in developing hairpin-winding technology.Even though the market is getting bigger, Odawara Engineering will focus on developing innovations instead of rushing to add capacity, according to Hoshina. Because the machines are complicated and made by hand, merely adding more workers wouldn’t work, he said.“We plan to grow gradually by choosing our clients,” Hoshina said. “By looking at which clients and what motors are promising.”(Updates with stock climb.

2020-07-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unlocked the second chunk of his moonshot pay award.The electric-car maker’s average trailing market value over six months rose above $150 billion on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, despite a dip in the company’s share price. That means Musk is now able to exercise an additional 1.69 million stock options, though he must wait at least five years before he can sell them.The options have a strike price of $350.02, meaning he would reap a $2.1 billion gain if he exercised and could immediately sell the shares.Musk unlocked the first tranche of the award in May, when Tesla’s average six-month market value topped $100 billion. The company’s shares have more than doubled since then, and the company is now worth more than Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and Hyundai Motor Co. combined.Musk’s compensation package -- the largest corporate pay deal ever struck between a CEO and a board of directors -- includes 20.3 million options, split into 12 tranches, that could yield the founder more than $50 billion if all goals are met, according to Tesla’s estimates.A representative for the company didn’t respond to a request for comment. Tesla shares rose 1.1% at 12:36 p.m. in New York trading Wednesday, taking this year’s gain to 279%.For Musk, 49, to unlock the third tranche, Tesla must reach a six-month average market capitalization of $200 billion, and either post revenue of $35 billion or $3 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, over four consecutive quarters.His latest award will boost his fortune to $74 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.(Updates share price in sixth paragraph and net worth in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Elon Musk Unlocks $2.1 Billion Award as Tesla Hits Milestone

2020-07-24,"In terms of market volatility, this year is definitely one for the books. 2020 saw market movements that would normally take decades, compressed into a single year. With unemployment rates at their highest and businesses facing the risk of bankruptcy, the economy hit some new lows this year. However, a period of downturn also presents a unique opportunity for investors to load up on growth stocks to buy at a discounted price.Historically speaking, a bear market in the S&P 500 was always replaced by a bull market rally in the years before Covid-19.While it's hard to remain optimistic in uncertain times, investors need to take a long-term approach when investing in stocks. Some companies are likely to emerge from the pandemic as losers. Others will come out of this stronger than ever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are seven growth stocks that are a great addition to your portfolio for the long-haul:  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever   * Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  * Snap (NYSE:SNAP)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Lemonade (NYSE:LMND)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * Square (NYSE:SQ)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Growth Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock One of the obvious growth stocks to buy putting up some big numbers this year is Tesla. The company's success can be largely attributed to its visionary CEO, Elon Musk, who was able to turn the pandemic into a period of growth for the company.At the onset of the pandemic, Tesla was forced to shut down its operations, resulting in a slow spring for the company. But things took a turn for the better when the electric vehicle giant was able to deliver a surprising number of cars by the end of June. The rise in production levels restored investor confidence in the company. Its stock price has only continued to rise since then.Tesla's production capabilities were bolstered by the company's plant in Shanghai, which allowed them to expand their market to China in a period of downturn in the U.S. Labor costs in China are also significantly lower than the company's plant in Fremont, California.After a string of positive achievements in the second half of 2020, Tesla stock is currently trending at the $1,500 area. Its market value currently is worth almost $300 billion and the company is set to take over Toyota (NYSE:TM) as the world's most valuable automaker.As Tesla continues to reinvent itself in the competitive world of electric vehicles, this growth stock is definitely worth the investment. Snap (SNAP)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Prior to the pandemic, Snap stock lost its momentum as people flocked to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned Instagram to stay connected. However, Facebook has been riddled with issues concerning 'fake news' this past year and people are growing increasingly wary of the social media platform.Snap stock gained some major momentum this year and the company put up some surprising Q2 numbers last week. Although net revenue was down, Snap did see an unprecedented increase in its advertising revenue that materialized as a direct result of the pandemic. Moreover, as Facebook loses its allure, its customers decided to spend their advertising dollars elsewhere -- aka on Snap.Traditionally a photo-taking app, Snap strived to diversify its business model this past year in order to stay relevant. More recently, the company announced that it is looking to integrate third-party apps and add performance enhancements on the platform. This will include a voice command tool and easier app navigation.Snap's rebound is also shaped by the fall of the Chinese social media platform TikTok. This comes after the app's data collection methods increased the risk of cyber-attacks which posed a national security threat. When news of the potential ban on the app was announced by Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, Snap stock closed 6% higher on the same day.  * 7 Micro-Cap Stocks You May Want to Take a Chance On Snap is one of the growth stocks to buy worth placing your bets on. The company said that Q3 revenue was already up 32% from the previous year. App usage increased by 4% since the lockdown. Snap's founder Evan Spiegel believes that &quot;the fundamentals of the business are strong,&quot; and so do we. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Tech stocks have been leading the market gains during the pandemic. One company that is a strong player in many investors' portfolios is Microsoft. The company secured some incredible margins this year thanks to its operating systems and cloud applications.With most people working from home since spring, Microsoft saw a boost in its cloud application usage. Azure revenue increased by 61%, while Microsoft Office had a double-digit growth year. This momentum is likely to be bolstered by the X-box gaming console expected to launch this fall.With the remote economy driving 50% of Microsoft's revenue, analysts predict a bright future for the company. Stifel analyst Brad Reback increased the company's price target from $200 to $215. He believes that cloud migration tools will be in demand long after the pandemic. This trend will help Microsoft expand its cloud services to new markets.Microsoft is only one of two AAA-rated stocks in the market and has a solid cash flow to keep it at the top of its game in the coming years. As the tech giant continues to generate juicy margins, this is one of the growth stocks to buy that is definitely worth holding on to. Lemonade (LMND)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Insurance company Lemonade is fresh off its IPO and is well-poised for tech-fueled growth. The company went public on July 2 at $29 per share and saw its price soar by 144%. It is currently trending around $83.While there is no shortage of insurance providers, Lemonade considers itself an industry-disruptor and seeks to provide a &quot;cocktail of delightful experiences.&quot; Unlike traditional insurance companies, Lemonade is tapping into the subscription-based business model that has been a tailwind for major tech companies. This fee-like revenue approach will give the company a steady income stream while making them less liable for claims.Lemonade also hopes to make insurance more appealing to a younger generation with its easy-to-use digital interface powered by artificial intelligence. The app will provide a more customer-centric approach to investing and make the tedious process of finding an insurance provider more streamlined.  * The 7 Best Cheap Stocks Under $10 Right Now Although Lemonade has an enviable stock price, the company still remains unprofitable and reported a net loss of $36.5 million in its first quarter. However, its novel take on the insurance sector shows a lot of upside potential in the long-term. We recommend you put your money in this high growth stock. Shopify (SHOP)Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com The pandemic was a final blow for brick and mortar businesses (both big and small). As companies were forced to re-think their business approach during a period of uncertainty, many found a home on Shopify's platform.The e-commerce platform served as a lifeboat for over one million businesses as consumers took to online shopping to stock up on essentials. With a growing digital footprint and partnerships with high-profile companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Facebook, the company's sales growth increased by 47% this past year.The pandemic pushed e-commerce to the forefront of the retail industry, making Shopify one of the hottest tech stocks. The tech platform's stock price surpassed giants like Netflix and Zoom as well. This earned Shopify its title as Canada's most valuable company as it hopes to keep the momentum of online shopping going long after the pandemic recedes.Shopify recently joined the $1,000 per share club. Even with a lofty valuation, the e-commerce platform only continues to grow. As of July, the platform has 1.3 million businesses, adding 200,000 more than they had in January.According to Yahoo Finance, the company's sales are expected to increase by 37% in 2020, followed by 34% in 2021. While this is not as high as its growth rate this past quarter, Shopify's versatile business model makes it a powerful player in the online retail space.Hold on to Shopify. It's one of the most promising growth stocks to buy as the world moves toward a digital-first environment. Square (SQ)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com As lockdown restrictions and store closures became the norm, consumers flocked to digital payment apps to make purchases online. Square, a pioneer in the touch-free payments space, has seen its stock surge in the past few months to hit a record high at the market close on July 6.While its merchant business was impacted by Covid-19, the company's subsidiary, Cash App, is its success story. The app lets people transfer money, invest in bitcoin, redeem rewards, and even receive stimulus checks during the pandemic. This increased activity on Cash App since the start of the pandemic and tripled Square's stock price since its low in March.The pandemic has been a boon for the financial payment ecosystem and companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square are in their heyday. Many believe Cash App's user-centric design appeals to a wider demographic and is a great alternative to the traditional banking system. The digital payment trend induced by the pandemic has laid the groundwork for apps like Cash App to grow and evolve.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever Experts believe Cash App's revenue will triple over the next few years. It would be wise to hold on to this growth stock and reap its benefits. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.com Tech companies have been the market darlings of the pandemic, but if we were to crown a winner, it would be the e-commerce behemoth Amazon. The onset of the pandemic led to a pantry-loading frenzy and Amazon was at the forefront of this e-commerce boost. With control of over 44% of the online market, the growth in online sales led the stock price to new highs.In 2020, Amazon stock surged 73%, which came as a result of changing consumer habits during the pandemic. But the company, known for its disruptive behavior, did not sit on its accomplishments but used the online boom as an opportunity to diversify its business model.The tech giant is investing heavily in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing arm of the business. The company hopes to secure global contracts in this space which could lead to potential revenue in billions in the coming years.This is alongside Amazon's other ventures such as the acquisition of Zoox, which will help streamline its delivery service with driverless cars, along with a $2 billion investment in clean energy to reduce the impact of climate change. This investment comes after the tech giant was criticized for its large carbon footprint.Amazon's diversified business model opens up more streams of income for this powerful tech company. This growth stock is already a favorite among investors, although some analysts remain wary of its elevated valuation. Nevertheless, Amazon stock does provide buyers with long-term sustainable growth.Divya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Fueled by buybacks, analyst valuations, earnings expectations and IPOs, SoftBank Group Corp. shares are retracing their way back to heights last seen during the dotcom bubble 20 years ago.SoftBank shares rose 2.3% in Tokyo Tuesday to close at 6,645 yen, the highest since March 2000. The stock is up almost 150% from March.At the peak in February 2000, SoftBank reached what remains its all-time intraday high of exactly 11,000 yen. Founder Masayoshi Son has said that surge led him to surpass Bill Gates as the world’s richest man -- if only for just three days.Some now see the stock nearing those heights again, as analysts review their assessment of Vision Fund companies.“Expectations for SoftBank’s profit growth as an investment company have been rising after the success of recent IPOs,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, senior analyst at Iwaicosmo Securities Co. His price target is 8,000 yen, the second-highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Tokai Tokyo Research Center analyst Masahiko Ishino, who last week trimmed his price target to 10,000 yen, is the only analyst who rates the stock higher. Ishino has rated SoftBank shares at or above the 10,000 yen mark for more than a year.HSBC on July 22 also lifted its price target 21% to 7,430 yen. “We continue to like the risk reward outlook at SoftBank,” analysts Neale Anderson and Binnie Wong wrote. “SoftBank is executing rapidly on its share buyback and debt reduction program.”After 133% Rally, SoftBank Investors Bet There’s More AheadIn addition to share buybacks that could be worth as much as 2.5 trillion yen ($23.7 billion), what were once downsides are now advantages, as holdings in Uber Technologies Inc. and perhaps even WeWork are seen to contribute to earnings, according to HSBC. SoftBank is “for better or worse, heavily exposed to the impact of the market’s excess liquidity, and we think it may be one of the firms that benefits most in the near term,” Citigroup Global Markets analysts Mitsunobu Tsuruo and Hiroki Kondo wrote on July 21.SoftBank will report earnings on August 11. Even if the stock should reclaim 10,000 yen, Son wouldn’t now challenge for the crown of world’s richest man. But a more realistic goal is in sight -- that of Japan’s most valuable company. A share price of around 13,400 yen could see it take that title, based on Toyota Motor Corp.’s valuation.Of course, under Son’s reckoning SoftBank is already worth far more -- his shareholder value metric, the equity value of SoftBank’s holdings minus net debt, puts its worth at 12,605 yen a share.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Hits New Highs as Son’s Investing Record Is Reappraised
2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At the moment when so many industries are staggered by the coronavirus pandemic, investors are beating the market by putting their money in companies committed to environmental, social and governance priorities favoring transparency, diversity and sustainability.ESG is where profits are, signaling that doing the right thing increasingly is the smartest bet. The iShares exchange-traded fund investing in companies it thinks have “positive environmental, social and governance characteristics,” one of the largest of the type, produced a total return this year that is more than three times the performance of S&P 500 index.The convergence of high-mindedness and profit was noted this month by Al Gore, the former vice president, 2000 Democratic presidential candidate and Oscar-winning environmental documentarian. He told a Bloomberg conference, “It is ever clearer that sustainable technologies are cheaper and better.”For more and more companies, doing the right thing is becoming as much a business imperative as a social responsibility, especially in the market for renewable energy. Apple Inc., the Cupertino, California maker of personal computing and mobile communication devices that has appreciated 30% this year, recently unveiled its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and product life cycle by 2030. Nike Inc., the Beaverton, Oregon designer and manufacturer of athletic shoes and apparel, is part of the RE100 coalition of companies planning to supply all energy needs from renewable sources by 2025.“Long term, renewables could emerge stronger than ever, especially if governments integrate support for clean energy into Covid-19 economic-recovery programs,” said a report in May by the Yale School of Environment.That’s already reflected in the anticipated performance of 38 U.S.-based companies generating at least 50% of their revenue from clean-energy products or clean technology. As a group, their sales are expected to rise 9% this year, 30% in 2021 and 23% in 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.By contrast, the 26 corporations in the S&P 500 Energy Index, a benchmark for fossil fuel, will suffer revenue declines of 29% in 2020, followed by growth of 11% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The phenomenon of ESG stocks outperforming the market is a long-term trend accentuated by the coronavirus. The 38 clean companies produced a 254% total return (income plus appreciation) in the past 12 months, 250% during the past 2 years and 330% since 2015. Among them, Palo-Alto-based Tesla Inc.’s 1-year return is 575%, including 130% since March when the coronavirus prompted much of the U.S. economy to shut down.Enphase Energy Inc., the renewable-energy equipment maker based in Petaluma, California, gained 199% the past year, including 27% since March. Lehi, Utah-based Vivint Solar Inc. is up 192% over the past 12 months and 107% since March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Traditional energy companies in the S&P 500 Energy Index lost 35%, 46% and 33%, respectively, for the 1, 2, and 5-year periods. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil declined 38% during the past year, including 13% since March. Houston-based Conoco Phillips is down 30% over 12 months, including 16% since March. Kinder Morgan Inc., the Houston pipeline transportation and energy storage provider, tumbled 28% during the past year, including 25% since March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Since March, when the pandemic proved its virulence, ESG’s advantage over the market doubled. That’s reflected in the distance between the performance of BlackRock’s iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, one of the largest exchange-traded funds investing in renewable energy and clean technology, and State Street’s Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, one of the largest ETFs investing in traditional energy companies. The fossil fuel crowd is getting crushed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Anyone who thinks that ESG investors are more lucky than smart, or a trendy cohort of woke millennials, should consider the divergence between Aramco and Tesla. Aramco, the Saudi oil giant that remains for now the world’s largest company, was valued at more than $2 trillion after its initial public offering in December. Since then, Tesla’s market capitalization quadrupled to $286 billion passing Toyota Motor Corp. to become the world’s biggest automaker. During the same period, Aramco declined 15% to $1.7 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The gap between Aramco and Tesla narrowed $500 billion, a little more than the $467 billion value of the world’s 9th-largest company. That would be Berkshire Hathaway, created by Warren Buffett, once the world’s richest man and the avatar of value investing. He’s shown no inclination to move toward ESG.

2020-07-28,"Tesla Inc shares  are off more than 2% in premarket trading Tuesday after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi downgraded the stock to underperform from market perform, while maintaining a $900 price target. &quot;Despite our relatively bullish stance on electric vehicle evolution, and structural advantages we believe Tesla may hold, we find it difficult to justify Tesla's current valuation even under our most bullish/imaginative scenarios,&quot; he wrote in a note to clients. Saccaonaghi said he understood the bull case on Tesla, involving the company's market leadership in an underpenetrated industry and Tesla's potential for margin expansion, but called the current valuation &quot;mind boggling&quot; as &quot;Tesla now even looks expensive versus large cap growth tech.&quot; He said the company's enterprise value is currently the same as that of Toyota Motor Corp.  and Volkswagen AG  while those companies make a collective 20 million cars versus Tesla's 500,000. &quot;To be clear, we are not calling on investors to short Tesla's stock, which - given recent price momentum - would probably be equivalent to us recommending investors to step in front of a barreling freight train,&quot; Saccaonaghi wrote. Instead he is &quot;merely noting that on a 12 month time horizon (and even more so, a multi-year time horizon), it has become increasingly difficult for us to imagine how Tesla's stock can continue to outperform the S&P500, mirroring our broader skepticism about the sustainability of the growth's outperformance in the tech sector amid the current once-in-a-decade widening of valuation spreads.&quot; Tesla shares have gained 268% so far this year as the S&P 500  has risen 0.3%.",Tesla stock drops after Bernstein downgrade

2020-07-31,"Earlier this month, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls cheered on a fourth straight quarter of profitability. Those bearish on Tesla stock pointed out that the company's electric vehicle regulatory credit sales accounted for all its net income.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com At this point, Tesla stock is trading purely on its long-term story. Tesla bulls believe bears are being short-sighted. But there's another risk to Tesla other than the bear thesis. Even if the long-term bull thesis is correct, TSLA may be staring down the barrel of 15 years of underperformance. The Numbers for Tesla StockTesla stock investors clearly don't care about numbers. But over the long term, the numbers will ultimately dictate the story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Gaming Stocks That Will Power Through the New Normal Tesla reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.18, easily beating consensus analyst estimates of 3 cents. Revenue of $6.04 billion also topped analyst estimates of $5.37 billion.In the same quarter a year ago, Tesla reported a $1.12 per-share loss and $6.35 billion in revenue. Revenue in the second quarter was down 4.9% from 2019. Previously reported vehicle deliveries for the second quarter were 90,650, down 4.7% from a year ago.Auto gross margins in the quarter were 25.4%, down 0.1% from last quarter and up 6.5% from a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $418 million, down 32% from a year ago.In a nutshell, Tesla reported negative revenue, auto sales and free cash flow growth in the second quarter. Yet the company was able to far exceed profit expectations due to $428 million in regulatory credit sales, up 286% from a year ago.In my opinion, the numbers for Tesla are impressive in a difficult global environment. However, year-over-year growth numbers were still fairly lackluster given the recent launch of the Model Y and the opening of the company's China factory late in 2019. TSLA's ValuationTrading at $1,500 per share, Tesla stock has a market capitalization of about $280 billion. Tesla now trades at about 103 times forward earnings and 11.8 times sales. Tesla's forward earnings multiple is about nine times the average multiple of Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) at 11.3. Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is about 29 times higher than the 0.4 average of its auto stock peers.When comparing Tesla's valuation instead to the average valuations of high-growth mega-cap tech stocks Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla is also extremely overvalued. Tesla's forward earnings multiple is 133% higher than tech peer averages. Tesla's price-to-sales ratio of 11.8 is 72.7% higher than tech peers. Not to mention that Tesla's growth rate was actually negative in the second quarter.In other words, Tesla's valuation is absurdly high relative to both auto peers and high-growth tech peers. The Problem with the Bull CaseTesla investors can laugh off its extremely high valuation all they want. They can say the numbers will eventually line up with the stock price. But the million-dollar question is exactly how long will that take?Back in 2000, long-term investors recognized that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had a massive long-term growth opportunity with its Windows operating system. From 2000 to 2015, Microsoft's revenue skyrocketed 327%. But because Microsoft's stock price got so absurdly high back in 2000, the stock dropped 20% overall from the beginning of 2000 to the beginning of 2015.Louis Stevens recently made a much more in-depth comparison between the bubble in Tesla stock today and the 2000 bubble in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).The point is that Tesla stock bulls may be 100% correct that Tesla will take bite after bite out of the global auto industry each year for the next 15 years or more. But at the stock's current valuation, there's not much upside even if that actually happens.Long-term Microsoft buyers back in 2020 were right about the company's growth outlook. But because they bought the stock as such ridiculous valuations, they lost 15 years and 20% of their investment.

2020-07-31,"Within the electric vehicle space, few if any competitors not named Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have generated as much discussion - and hot debate - as newcomer Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). With the company's Badger pickup truck - which will offer electric and hydrogen-electric powertrains - it theoretically represents a viable challenge to Tesla's dominance. However, &quot;theoretically&quot; is the operative word here. As you can tell, Nikola stock has come down a long way from its peak.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com No doubt, this led to many criticizing the upstart organization. While the Nikola Badger is a looker in my opinion, its more concept than reality. In contrast, look at Tesla. Depending on what day it is and Wall Street's mood at the time, it's either the biggest automaker in the world or running a close second.And that, as TSLA bulls will remind you, is justified. Tesla has several production cars, manufacturing facilities and raging demand, all attributes that support its bullish narrative. Compared to Nikola stock, the rookie challenger is a fanciful idea.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet me be clear about NKLA - I understand the core criticisms against the underlying company. This is speculation, pure and simple. But as far as gambles go, I think this is a smart one for discerning, patient investor.Because let's face it - at one point, Tesla was also an idea. Plus, it wasn't too long ago that several analysts questioned the company's sustainability and cash burn. Yet the EV maker pushed on relentlessly and high-conviction stakeholders enjoyed their rewards.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Therefore, it's not out of the realm of possibility that Nikola stock could do the same. From a business perspective, I would suggest that it's probable that NKLA will be in the race moving forward. Filling the Demand Gap Can Boost Nikola StockSeveral years ago, I had the chance to drive Mercedes-Benz's first-generation CLS. Though I relished the driving experience, the car was controversial because of its &quot;flying pancake&quot; styling. And like it or not, it set the trend for four-door coupes.The problem? By definition, coupes are two-door vehicles.Now, it's arguably not so much of an issue with a passenger car. But apply this logic to a pickup truck and it just doesn't work. That's the main obstacle facing the Tesla Cybertruck. With a triangular and sloped roofline, you unnecessarily limit interior space and overall usability.However, this is where Nikola and by deduction Nikola stock could fill a consumer demand gap. For the folks that criticize NKLA, they largely do so from an investment perspective (i.e. no sales). But they should view it from a pickup truck driver's angle. If they do, they'll recognize that the Badger is equally familiar and futuristic, using Car and Driver's description.The former attribute will be particularly important for any EV maker to penetrate the pickup segment. As you may know, the Ford (NYSE:F) F-series is the most popular truck in America. And the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Tacoma is the most popular mid-size pickup truck. They didn't achieve their respective successes because of weird design. Instead, they deliver utility in a smart, robust chassis.In other words, the less creative you get with your pickup design, the better. What I appreciate about the Nikola Badger is that the innovation is mostly on the inside. They didn't set out to reinvent the wheel.Also, the attractive Badger is offered at an attractive price point relative to the Rivian R1T and the Bollinger B2. This too fills a gap, which may help lift Nikola stock. NKLA Knows Its CustomersBefore you rip off an angry email, I get that Tesla's Cybertruck is priced below all the competitors above. However, I still believe that the business strategy underlining Nikola stock as it pertains specifically to pickups is superior. I'm willing to bet that consumers will pay extra not to drive something that looks like it came out of a Robocop movie.Take your pick, they all look equally stupid.One of the reasons I'm optimistic on Nikola stock longer-term is the same reason I changed my mind on Ford. You'll notice that in their EV foray, they're deliberately refusing to rock the boat. And with pickup trucks, most consumers want specific design elements. Thus, designs here tend not to change dramatically.However, you can't say that about the Cybertruck. In this case, Tesla is almost telling the consumer what they want, not the other way around. I don't think it's any coincidence that the trucks mentioned above, save for the Cybertruck, resemble prior designs.Don't get me wrong - Tesla will be difficult to unseat in the sedan segment. But in the pickup realm, Nikola has a much, much better idea. And as TSLA proves, good ideas can go a long distance.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare.

2020-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. reported a surprise operating profit and kept its outlook for the full year intact, showing its resilience to the global automotive slowdown that has forced other major carmakers to post deep losses.Japan’s biggest automaker reported a profit of 13.9 billion yen ($132 million) in the April-June quarter, even though analysts projected, on average, a loss of 207 billion yen. For the fiscal year through March, Toyota kept its operating profit outlook of 500 billion yen.Although slim for an automaker with an annual output of 10 million vehicles, the results deliver on President Akio Toyoda’s vow to remain profitable during the pandemic. Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and other automakers have reported billions in losses as the pandemic decimated demand, underscoring Toyota’s expertise in containing costs during both good and bad times. Tesla Inc. was another rare example of a profitable carmaker, with Elon Musk’s company benefiting from market-share gains and capacity expansion.“There clearly are winners and losers,” said Tatsuo Yoshida, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Toyota’s progress has been really good” compared with other Japanese automakers, he said.The shares of Toyota climbed after the results, and were up 2.3% at the close in Tokyo. The stock is down 12% this year. The Nasdaq OMX Global Auto Index is up about 4.5% over the same period.The pandemic has forced dealers to close showrooms and manufacturers to idle factories around the world, with global auto sales declining 22% in the first half to 4.16 million units. Toyota’s revenue for the quarter fell 40% to 4.6 trillion yen, slightly exceeding analysts’ prediction for 4.4 trillion yen.For the full year, Toyota kept its sales forecast at 24 trillion yen. Analysts are projecting, on average, annual revenue of 24.7 trillion yen.“Toyota was already more profitable than other automakers,” said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokyo Tokai Securities, adding that the company also rolled out new models. “They should return to normal by the fourth quarter.”Toyota also released a net income outlook of 730 billion yen, below analysts’ projection for 1.1 trillion yen.

2020-08-07,"Over the years, I have consistently pounded the table on groundbreaking technology firms. Collectively, we're entering a period where multiple innovations are converging at once, sparking what I term the &quot;Roaring 2020s.&quot; Certainly, electric vehicles represent a vital cog in this gear. However, this does not include bizarre gimmicks like Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO). Thus, I have a simple piece of advice: avoid SOLO stock.Source: Alexandru Nika / Shutterstock.com Of course, I'm not naive to what's going on in our new normal. With many people still sheltering in place, they've got nothing but time on their hands. To get some excitement in their lives, several rookie investors have poured into speculative ventures like Chesapeake Energy (OTCMKTS:CHKAQ) or JCPenney (OTCMKTS:JCPNQ). Given this context, I understand why SOLO stock has attracted eyeballs.To give credit where it's due, Electrameccanica also has an intriguing story. Basically, the company is trying to solve the &quot;last mile&quot; problem for commuters. Most of us use our personal vehicle to drive to work. When we do, we usually drive alone.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut our cars don't care whether we're using them efficiently or not. Thus, when we hit the road, we're always carrying the weight of unused space. Electrameccanica's flagship Solo EV supposedly presents the perfect solution: why not get rid of that space when we commute?In a way, Electrameccanica answers the same question posed to Uber (NYSE:UBER) but in reverse. With an ultra-compact, three-wheeled design, the Solo is a purpose-built EV for maximum commuting efficiency. Under this narrow definition, the platform is a cost-saving, environmentally friendly one, which also explains the bullishness for SOLO stock.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand But when you look under the hood, you'll realize that not all is well. SOLO Stock Is Tied to a Solution No One Asked forAlthough the idea of enhancing efficiency is a noble one, the execution is flawed. To be honest, I'm not sure if a market exists for Electrameccanica nor will it ever materialize.As a three-wheeled EV, the platform has the worst of both worlds. Technically, the Solo is a motorcycle but lacks the convenience of one. Because the front of the car has two wheels, it's too wide to sneak through tight spots. As well, it doesn't have the basic functions of a normal car; for example, extra passenger capacity and practical cargo space.Worryingly for SOLO stock, the underlying EV is an &quot;inbetweener&quot; that has partial elements of positive attributes of motorcycles and passenger cars but never satisfyingly fulfilling them. For instance, the Solo is easier to parallel park in spots which would be impossible for a normal-sized car. But how many times do you find yourself in this situation? Likely, you're not going to pay $18,500 for the privilege.Which brings me to another point of why I'm bearish on SOLO stock: who the heck thought it was a good idea to price this EV at over 18 grand? Just pay a little bit more and you're in good shape to buy a new, subcompact car from Toyota (NYSE:TM) or Honda (NYSE:HMC).Admittedly, you're not getting an EV at this price point. However, with the new normal, people just aren't driving that much. As well, combustion-engine vehicles have become very efficient. When the average commute for Americans is only 16 miles one way, the additional burden of buying a new car exclusively for commuting is a bit much.With a normal car, you open its utility to other endeavors, rendering Electrameccanica and by deduction SOLO stock a gimmick. Who Is the Solo's Target Demographic?Speaking of utility, investors should ask who the Solo's target demographic is. With the design and the lack of oomph, it's safe to say that Electrameccanica didn't have men in mind as its core customers.But then, this brings up a dilemma. According to Brad Smith, director of market statistics for Experian, &quot;Women gravitate toward utilitarian-type vehicles.&quot; Female drivers have jumped on crossovers and compact SUVs.On the other hand, men prefer flash and dash. Thus, you see performance-centric cars dominate male drivers' wish lists.This again brings up the core problem that will plague SOLO stock. At best, Electrameccanica is delivering half-baked solutions. The Solo is neither fast, nor arguably sexy. It definitely isn't practical. And that's why I say there's no market for this EV.Who'd want to buy it?Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-08-07,"There seems to be no stopping Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock at the moment. The shares of the electric-vehicle EV maker have increased 230% in 2020. Many are wondering if it can climb further, as  the shares trade at an expensive trailing price-sales ratio of 13.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There is no doubt that the stock is an exciting growth play that should be included in every portfolio. Although Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the top electric-vehicle maker, its position in China is not ironclad. As history shows, the Chinese have a preference for local manufacturers. A strong nationalistic streak will help Nio as it looks to gain a more significant foothold in its country of origin.Nio appears to be doing just that. The Chinese automobile manufacturer reported 3,533 vehicle deliveries in July, representing year-over-year growth of 322.1%. But there are other issues that the company has to deal with, such as its need for cash and its negative margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, I would wait for a more attractive opportunity to invest in NIO stock. Although the EV maker's long-term growth outlook remains intact, it's trading at high multiples at the moment. Nio Has an Advantage in ChinaIt may come as a surprise to many, but Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone is not the top smartphone brand in the largest country in the word. Instead, local brands such as Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo dominate. That shows how much the Chinese value local brands.China now accounts for roughly one-quarter of Tesla's revenue. But its good times there may last for only so long, as Nio continues to make inroads in the Chinese market. If deliveries in 2020 are anything to go by, Nio is headed for a strong year, despite the novel coronavirus pandemic.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand The Chinese government, the world's largest importer of crude oil, also wants to focus on the environment and move to cleaner energy sources. China has already announced it will continue providing subsidies for new-energy vehicles, since it wants these automobiles to account for one-fifth of its auto sales by 2025. The extension of the subsidies is favorable for Nio. The Risks Facing NIO StockNio's Chinese background may be a sticking point for some investors. The regulatory environment in the U.S. is far more robust than that of China. The recent fraud case involving Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) shows that lax regulations can cost investors severely.Tesla, Nio's main competition, also seems to have a better brand than Nio globally. That may be due to Elon Musk and his charismatic personality or it could be because Tesla generally has a better marketing strategy. But the bottom line is that Tesla has a more well-known brand than its competitors.Over time, that could change. But in order to boost its brand image,  Nio will have to greatly increase its marketing budget at a time when the company's capital expenditures are high. The Valuation of NIO StockThe big debate in the sector is whether to invest in TSLA stock or NIO stock. Both stocks seem expensive, but Tesla is on another level altogether. Valued at over $300 billion, the company's market cap stands over and above the market caps of Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Honda (NYSE:HMC), which are among the biggest names in the automobile sector.I believe TSLA stock is highly overvalued, while NIO stock has  a lot of optimism baked into it. Granted, much of that excitement makes sense, but it is still an expensive stock. The Bottom LineNIO stock is on a bull run, and it's legitimate to question whether it can climb further. I believe Nio is a growth stock, and it has several favorable catalysts that will push the share price up further. Nio is a good long-term investment.However, I think that it would be better to wait for a more attractive entry point before buying the shares.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

2020-08-14,"Back on June 30, I wrote about how Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) was grossly overvalued and a dangerous speculation. In less than two months since that story, the stock is down 36.3%. I still think NKLA stock, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and other electric vehicle stocks are caught in a market bubble.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com I've repeatedly told investors to stay away from Tesla, Nikola and other EV stocks. At least stay away until the bubble deflates a bit more and the valuations come back down to earth.However, savvy investors can take advantage of a technique known as pair trading to buy Tesla today, even at its current ridiculous valuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What's Wrong With TSLA Stock At $1,400?TSLA stock has already taken a big hit since late July. The irrational exuberance for the stock seems to have started to fade. But Tesla still has a long way to go to the downside before it is reasonably valued. Tesla trades at about 91.2 times forward earnings. Auto competitors Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) trade at an average forward earnings multiple of 9.9. Tesla trades at 10.5 times sales. Ford, GM and Toyota trade at 0.43 times sales.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List But since Tesla bulls argue that the company is the next tech giant, like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), let's make another comparison. Those tech stocks have an average forward earnings multiple of around 42, a more than 50% discount to TSLA stock. They also trade at an average price-to-sales ratio of 7.35, a 30% discount to Tesla.Tesla isn't the only stock caught in the EV bubble. There are dozens. But Nikola may be one of the most egregiously valued of all. I'd love to compare Nikola's earnings and sales multiples to Tesla's, but Nikola has none. Nikola essentially has no earnings or sales to speak of. Why Tesla Over Nikola?In a vacuum, I think investors should stay away from TSLA stock for a number of reasons. Valuation is simply the biggest. But compared to Nikola, Tesla looks like a dream investment.Essentially, both Tesla and Nikola are story stocks. Story stocks aren't valued on the viability of their business models, their growth and profit metrics or the health of their balance sheets. They are valued based on the stories the company tells investors about how great things will be in the future. For example, Tesla's revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter despite launching the Model Y and the opening of its China gigafactory. But just look at how many products the company has in development. Cybertruck, semi truck, Roadster, fully-autonomous Autopilot, and now (not kidding) Tesla spaceship are all in various stages of research and development.I'm always skeptical of story stocks because they tend to price in the perfect storybook ending before the end of the first chapter of the book. I wrote that Nikola was already priced to perfection back in July. But Tesla and Nikola are both story stocks, and they both have the same story. Investors are betting that these tiny companies with negligible or nonexistant global market share will eventually grow to dominate the world auto market over time.Like I said, I'm skeptical of that story. But if somebody asked me which company is more likely to make that fairy tale come true, it's got to be Tesla. How To Play ItFor the record, I'm not a fan of TSLA stock at all. In fact, I think there's a strong possibility stock could underperform over the next 10 or 15 years.But this trade isn't about if Tesla will be trading at $20 or $2,000 in two years. It's strictly about Tesla outperforming Nikola.I'm recommending traders go long TSLA stock and short Nikola. Nikola likely has a bright future of long-term growth ahead of it. But its market cap of $16.3 billion is crazy considering the company doesn't even have a product on the market at this point.Nikola and Tesla are two story stocks with the same story and the same happy ending. But if the growth story is a 300-page novel, Tesla is on page 25, while Nikola is only on page four. If Nikola wins in the long-term, I'm betting Tesla will win bigger. And If Tesla loses, I'm betting Nikola will end up worthless.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-08-21,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is up another 21% in the past five days. The main catalyst for the move higher is a recently announced stock split planned for Aug. 31. Stock splits, of course, create no actual value for a company whatsoever. But when it comes to TSLA stock, reality hasn't mattered for a long time. What actually matters is the story Tesla tells its investors and the stories they tell each other.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Wall Street analysts are finally having to tear themselves away from facts and numbers and admit that TSLA stock is valued instead on hopes and dreams. Wedbush and Bank of America are the latest to boost price targets for Tesla, which I believe has become the most dangerous stock in the market. Analysts Adjust to TSLA Stock RealityOn Monday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target for TSLA from $1,800 to $1,900. Ives was an early Tesla bull and has consistently been a believer in the Tesla story. To justify his new target, Ives skips ahead a few chapters in the Tesla storybook.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;We believe that the China growth story is worth at least $400 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 (million mile battery remains an elusive goal now in the grasp in our opinion),&quot; Ives says.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now In my opinion, that analysis boils down to three key words: &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;China,&quot; and &quot;story.&quot; Ives believes the China story for Tesla.Ives also says Tesla will soon be a major third-party battery supplier for other auto companies.&quot;Looking ahead, we believe Musk & Co. are slated to announce a number of new potential 'game changing' battery developments at its highly anticipated Battery Day on September 22,&quot; Ives said.Again, he is anticipating Tesla will &quot;announce&quot; game-changing battery technology. I have no doubt Ives is right. If there's one thing Tesla is good at, it's announcing things. For example, Tesla announced the roadster back in 2017, and it's still nowhere to be seen. But once again, this analysis is pure speculation about what Tesla will announce and, more importantly, what it will actually be able to deliver. Tesla's ValuationThe caveat to Ives' analysis is his stock rating, which is &quot;neutral.&quot; I've been on the sidelines when it comes to Tesla for years. TSLA stock is a story stock that is caught in the middle of an EV bubble. Anyone who is long or short the stock at these prices is nuts, in my opinion. That's why I think &quot;dangerous&quot; is the best word to use to describe the stock.Wall Street analysts like Ives believe in the story, but they aren't recommending the stock. Bank of America analyst John Murphy recently upgraded Tesla. He upgraded it to, you guessed it, &quot;neutral.&quot;Murphy was a long-time Tesla bear and a skeptic of the story. But even Tesla bears are being forced to admit that the story itself holds value if enough people believe it.&quot;While we remain skeptical that TSLA will be the dominant EV automaker in the long-run, if a big global footprint can be built with no-cost capital, the 'growth' story would carry the day for the stock,&quot; Murphy said in his upgrade note.In other words, Murphy doesn't seem to believe the Tesla story. But he says the fact that so many investors believe it is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. So at the end of the day, he too arrived at a &quot;neutral.&quot;I think it's extremely telling that you have a long-term Tesla bull like Ives and a long-term Tesla bear like Murphy both reaching the same conclusion I did years ago. Tesla stock is simply untouchable. Tesla Is DangerousTSLA stock is too dangerous to buy or short.In fact, David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, says Tesla is the &quot;most dangerous stock of 2020.&quot;Trainer recently looked at long-term projections for EV sales by global auto market incumbents, such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Ford (NYSE:F).&quot;We have not found an estimate for Tesla sales that is not well below the incumbents expected EV sales of ~3.1 million EVs in 2025,&quot; Trainer says.He is projecting Tesla shares have more than 80% downside once the market realizes the TSLA stock story and valuation are absurd.In a nutshell, Tesla is at the epicenter of an EV stock bubble. There's no way of knowing how inflated that bubble will become or when it will burst. Bullish and bearish Wall Street analysts are throwing in the towel and flocking to the &quot;neutral&quot; sidelines. It's really the only appropriate conclusion. Just stay away from TSLA stock.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg) -- When Alicia Boler Davis was elevated to Jeff Bezos’s vaunted S-Team leadership council earlier this month she became the first Black executive to enter Amazon.com Inc.’s upper ranks -- and a candidate to run the company’s far-flung logistics empire.Early next year, the current logistics chief, Dave Clark, will step aside to lead Amazon’s consumer business. Whether Boler Davis, 51, replaces him in this pivotal role will depend in part on how well she performs in her current job, running the company’s warehouses, which employ hundreds of thousands of workers and handle billions of packages a year.It won’t be easy. The former General Motors Co. executive must keep the facilities operating smoothly during the busy holiday season amid a global pandemic that has fueled a surge in online shopping even as it laid low scores of the Amazon workers who pick and pack orders for delivery.Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry, says Boler Davis’s experience running GM factories is well suited to her new role. “The fulfillment part of Amazon’s business is where everything happens,” he says. “It doesn’t matter how slick the interface is if packages aren’t delivered and done so quickly.” Amazon declined to make Boler Davis available for an interview.Boler Davis’s impressive trajectory began in Detroit, where she was born in 1969. She was raised in nearby Romulus, Michigan, by parents who married young and divorced when she was five. While her father remained part of her upbringing, money was tight for her working mother and three siblings.“We didn’t have a lot,” she told the Detroit News in 2018. “If an iron or a washer broke, I would cut some cord, get some wire, and patch it together and repair it, because I knew we didn’t have money to fix it.” The second oldest of four, Boler Davis said the eldest sister Kimberly, who went on to attend Harvard University, set the bar high for her.Boler Davis participated in a summer engineering program for high school students run by General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, which piqued a nascent interest in the field. After graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in chemical engineering, she briefly worked for The Upjohn Company, a pharmaceutical maker, and PepsiCo. Inc. She joined GM in 1994 and ran plants making Cadillac Escalade SUVs in Texas and Chevrolet Sonic subcompacts in Michigan.GM named Boler Davis a vice president in 2012, kicking off a rapid ascent. She oversaw global quality and U.S. customer experience for a little over a year, then was promoted to senior vice president and given a global mandate for both roles. In 2016, Boler Davis was named executive vice president of global manufacturing and labor relations, overseeing 180,000 employees at more than 170 facilities in over 30 countries. She reported to CEO Mary Barra, who she described as a role model.For all her success at GM, her career there wasn’t without challenges. She described being discouraged early on at the company, which was for decades largely dominated by long-tenured White men. In February 2019, she and Barra paid a 2 1/2-hour visit to a transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, to underscore the zero-tolerance policy against racism following a series of firings and lawsuits related to ugly incidents including the display of a toy monkey to taunt Black workers. Her departure for Amazon was reported later that month.Few were sorrier to see her go than Barra, according to a person familiar with the situation. The CEO considered Boler Davis a key member of her management team because Boler Davis led the company’s global network of factories, where Barra had paid her dues, the person said. GM declined to comment.Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s retiring consumer unit chief, met Boler Davis over lunch after an introduction by a mutual acquaintance, and was impressed by her leadership experience, technical acumen, and dedication to workers on the factory floor, Wilke wrote in an email to employees earlier this month. Her hiring in April 2019, to oversee Amazon’s more than 175 biggest warehouses around the world, came as the logistics unit worked to cultivate a deeper bench of executives, at times by reaching outside the company.Amazon is often compared with web and software giants, but the operations unit that Boler Davis helps lead has more in common with a sophisticated manufacturing enterprise. Amazon warehouses employ hundreds of thousands of workers who labor alongside a similar number of robots. The company built that empire by embedding the lean manufacturing principles Toyota Motor Corp. famously used to dominate Detroit, forcing GM to embrace them during Boler Davis’s days at the carmaker. She also oversees teams working on customer service, sustainability and product safety, a key topic as regulators examine how the company runs its marketplace. When longtime engineering executive Brad Porter left the company earlier this month, some of his teams working on robotics and warehouse technology began reporting to Boler Davis.As the coronavirus began spreading across the U.S., Boler Davis and colleagues chose to keep Amazon’s doors open even as many businesses closed, retooling warehouse operations and going on a hiring spree to make up for workers taking shelter at home. The company has been criticized by elected officials, labor leaders and some of its own workers for its actions during the pandemic, including for firing workers who were involved in employee organizing. Amazon has said the employees were let go for violations of company policy.Now, going into the fourth quarter, Boler Davis faces the challenge of matching Amazon’s staffing to customer demand and keeping facilities that have been extensively redesigned to protect workers from Covid-19 running smoothly through the holiday shopping season. Close observers of the company say her main rival for the top logistics job -- assuming Amazon decides to fill it -- is likely John Felton, who runs Amazon’s delivery services and was also named to the S-Team last week.Amazon’s top leadership circle has been remarkably steady over the years, made up of mostly White men, many of whom had been with the company for decades. The workforce is 27% Black, and Amazon has a more diverse makeup than most technology companies, primarily because many of the people working in the warehouses are Black. But 59% of Amazon managers are White, and 73% are men. Still, as the fourth woman on Amazon’s 26-person S-team, Boler Davis’s rise is evidence that things are starting to change.In the past, she has acknowledged being a role model for people of color. “It’s not something that I carry around and think about every day, but I certainly do focus on holding myself to a high standard of excellence,” she said in 2017. “I want to inspire others with my actions and consistently advocate for diversity and inclusion of all forms.” She has long promoted STEM education, joining Barra and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg a few years ago to discuss career and education possibilities with young girls and working women.People who have known Boler Davis since she was a student at Romulus High School, where she was known as “Le Le,” say their former classmate remains grounded despite her glittering career. Chenauda Harris, who recalls a studious girl raised with a firm hand, encountered Boler Davis at a class reunion about three years ago.“She was the same Alicia she has always been, that’s what’s special about her,” Harris says. “She is the same humble, down-to-earth person she was in high school.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon’s Boler Davis In Mix to Become First Black Logistics Head

2020-09-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- My first Uber ride was Aug. 8th, 2014. I was picked up by Hipolito in a brand-new Toyota Camry that still had the new car smell. He had bottles of water and candy for my enjoyment. Uber Technologies Inc. was still relatively new, so I quizzed him on what it was like to be a driver. He loved it. And the thing he loved most was that he was able to make his own schedule.Hipolito was not an employee of Uber; he was a 1099, an independent contractor – his own boss. He didn’t have a schedule. He also, crucially, didn’t have company-provided health insurance or other such benefits, but for all I knew Hipolito had it through his spouse. We chatted a bit before he cheerfully retrieved my bags from the trunk after we reached my destination and sent me on my way.I was reminded of this encounter by some recent developments concerning Assembly Bill 5, which the state of California passed last year. The bill forbids Uber drivers from working as independent contractors. Instead, they are required to be treated as employees, with benefits and workers compensation insurance. A state appeals court ruled a few weeks ago that Uber and rival Lyft Inc. can continue operating as normal while challenging the law. The decision came just hours before Uber and Lyft were planning to suspend services in California, their home state.It’s a very 19th century Upton Sinclair way of thinking that drivers were somehow being exploited by Uber and Lyft. The reality is probably more like the job was such a good deal that drivers probably thought that they were the ones doing the exploiting. No driver is coerced into the Uber network. A driver joins of his or her own free will. The system was working fine until the state introduced coercion and forced everyone involved to do things they didn’t want to do. An informal survey of Uber drivers found that about 70% would rather be independent contractors. A mere 17% wanted to be treated as employees.Studies over the years have shown that Uber drivers don’t make much money, after taking into account gas, vehicle maintenance and depreciation. But I seriously doubt drivers are not rational economic actors. If the economics didn’t work, they wouldn’t do it. California claims to know what’s in the best interest of drivers, which strikes to the heart of a libertarian concept known as the fatal conceit—the idea that a bureaucrat could possibly know what’s best for the masses. When government intervenes in a complex economic system, it typically unleashes a pile of unintended consequences.California considers threats by Uber and Lyft to leave the state a bluff, but they most likely aren’t. Uber and Lyft are simply not viable businesses if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, especially in a state as large as California. Here’s what Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi recently told the New York Times:“Uber would only have full-time jobs for a small fraction of our current drivers and only be able to operate in many fewer cities than today…rides would be more expensive, which would significantly reduce the number of rides people could take, and in turn, the number of drivers needed to provide those trips.”New York, New Jersey and Illinois are considering similar bills as the one in California, and Uber and Lyft will probably leave those states if that happens. California’s intransigence risks putting thousands of drivers out of work, leaving millions of people without rides in the middle of a pandemic. The timing seems a bit strange for states to go to the mat on this issue.California has become a bit of a poster child for liberal overreach in recent years. My guess is that AB5 is less about worker protections than it is about striking at the tech titans for their market power and extreme concentration of wealth, which is counterproductive given the importance of tech to California’s economy and tax revenue. But these actions are being taken under partisan, ideological grounds with the idea that billionaires somehow obtain their wealth via unseemly business practices.Consider that Uber didn’t have the best corporate image in the Travis Kalanick years, dogged by allegations of sexual harassment and a “macho” culture. The architect of AB5, Democrat assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego, is also the author of a vulgar tweet directed at Tesla’s Elon Musk, sent around the time that Musk was making noise about leaving California.The state has simply become inhospitable to business, with “over-regulation, mindless bureaucracy, high taxes, and endless lawsuits,” according to The Economist. And it will probably get worse. California legislators recently proposed both a top 16.8% income tax rate (which would be the highest in the U.S. by a wide margin) and a wealth tax - an idea that was rejected during the Democratic primary.Of course, AB5 unleashed a hurricane of unintended consequences, including ensnaring freelancers writing for websites. Under the law, the submission of more than 35 articles to a media outlet over the course of a year would force a publisher to treat the freelancer as an employee and provide benefits. Vox Media promptly ditched a few hundred freelancers and replaced them with 12 full-time employees. It has also affected hundreds of other occupations where workers operated as independent contractors.AB5 attacks economic freedom in a way that no other law does by effectively telling people who they can and can’t work for, and under what terms. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden likes the law and wants to roll it out nationwide, which could potentially cause more damage to the economy than any of his proposed tax increases.This is the 21st century. People don’t have jobs; they have gigs. This is a vast improvement over the industrial revolution way of thinking, where you go to the factory and put part A into slot B for 8 hours a day. I left my last “job” 12 years ago, and I’ve been on my own ever since. It is incredibly liberating, which is something California doesn’t seem to understand.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Jared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of &quot;Street Freak&quot; and &quot;All the Evil of This World.&quot; He may have a stake in the areas he writes about.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",California Uber Law Threatens the Gig Economy

2020-09-04,"Due to the increasing popularity of plug-in electric vehicles, traditional automobile manufacturers have struggled for both traction and relevance. One example is Toyota (NYSE:TM).Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Although legendary for its accessible and reliable cars, what consumers and investors think about the brand seems radically different. Since the second half of 2013, TM stock really hasn't moved that much.Despite frustrating spells of consolidation, Toyota may be due for a longer-term resurgence. For one thing, you can never count the automaker out. While it will probably never win on outright sex appeal, the company has developed a reputation for perfection via slow and steady progress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTrue, in the modern paradigm of blitzing to the finish line, Toyota's methodical approach may be maddening to most investors. However, when it comes to truly innovative technologies, the measure-twice, cut-once approach may be tremendously beneficial for TM stock.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks Ideal for Any Investor This is particularly the case for the underlying company's autonomous vehicle (AV) developments. Over the past few years, more than a few EV and combustion-engine automakers have made bold claims about AVs.Some automotive enthusiasts worried that an autonomous future would take away the pure joys of driving oneself to whatever destination. However, the reality of creating genuine AVs have taken the wind out of these earlier prognostications.Toyota hasn't been deterred by these setbacks, pressing on with its AV ambitions and  focusing first on the most important aspect of autonomous driving: safety. Without that component, legal hurdles would prevent any AV platform from becoming mainstreamed. As such, Toyota is experimenting with an intelligent overriding mode to prevent drivers from making dangerous maneuvers.Should that work, it can tackle other challenges on the road to true autonomy. Solid-State Batteries Could Change the Game for TM StockWhat I like about Toyota's approach is that it's a more palatable and practical strategy than competitors'. Rather than forcing autonomy suddenly, the company is giving consumers gradual tastes of the benefits of automotive intelligence. From there, you build trust, which will make pure AV platforms less of a psychological hurdle.It's this type of smart thinking that has astute investors quietly buying up TM stock. Another factor that bodes well for the automaker is that it's not subject to rampant enthusiasm. You probably aren't going to see too many wild corrections like we witnessed in the technology sector recently. Therefore, Toyota is appropriate for those looking for a solid anchor for their portfolio.But that's not to say that TM stock is limited to a safe but boring investment. Quite the contrary, management recognizes the growing demand for EVs. And while other manufacturers have taken the spotlight in this arena, you don't want to discount Toyota, not when it's possibly on the cusp of delivering the holy grail of EV, the solid-state battery.Unlike lithium-ion battles which utilize a liquid or polymer electrolyte, a solid-state battery, as the name suggests, incorporates a solid electrolyte. One of the key benefits to the solid-state design is that it's much denser, allowing for high-capacity batteries with a smaller footprint relative to lithium-ion batteries.In addition, current EV batteries have shorter lifespans, requiring frequent and lengthy charges. However, Toyota claims that it has developed prototype cells that can charge from zero to full in less than 15 minutes. Such an advance could end up disrupting the EV space, as current charging takes much longer than that.Now, that's not to say that you should buy TM stock simply on this claim. Toyota has multiple challenges to overcome, with one of the biggest being developing solid-state batteries in mass quantities. Still, the concept is no longer science fiction, making Toyota a worthwhile name to watch. A Still Viable Vanguard BusinessWhile EVs are all the craze these days, it's important to realize that their takeover of the combustion-engine car will not happen overnight. Automakers continue to churn out &quot;regular&quot; cars because for them, the economics continue to make sense.In that regard, Toyota is one of the top brands for consumers, especially during this crisis. Yes, people may continue to work from home a little while longer than many anticipated. But at some point, most of us will likely return to our regular routines. And that means cars will once again rule the road.As well, Toyota represents one of the best value propositions for consumers. For what you're paying, you're getting quite a lot. In addition, consumers have the confidence of reliable performance, something that many other manufacturers lack. Thus, no matter where you turn, Toyota provides solid businesses that should move the needle forward for TM stock.On the date of publication, neither Matthew McCall nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-09-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate in southern Japan, and companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Canon Inc. are planning to shutter factories as Typhoon Haishen approaches.The Japan Meteorological Agency said the typhoon may make landfall on Kagoshima prefecture in the southern Kyushu island on Sunday evening. More than 46,000 households were without power in Kagoshima prefecture as of 5 p.m. local time, according to Kyushu Electric Power Company Inc. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said at least 218,000 households have been ordered to evacuate to safety in Okinawa and five of the Kyushu prefectures.Canon said it will suspend operations at four manufacturing units affecting seven factories in Kyushu on Monday, while Toyota decided to halt three plants in Fukuoka. Daihatsu Motor Co.’s factories in Oita and Fukuoka prefectures will be suspended during morning shift on Monday, company spokesman Kazuki Inoue said.Sony Corp. plans to shut production in Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Nagasaki prefectures from Sunday afternoon, and is also considering closing its Oita prefecture facility during the storm, a spokesperson said.Alter DestinationsThe nation’s train and airline services will also be disrupted by the typhoon.

The ship with 43 crew and 5,800 cattle capsized after engine trouble and as Typhoon Maysak swept through.South Korean President Moon Jae-in asked central and local governments to make every preparation for Typhoon Haishen as it’s expected to cause great damage to the Korean peninsula, presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok said in a statement on Sunday.(Updates with power outage, factory and airline impact from 2nd paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Thousands Evacuate in Japan, Factories Shutter Ahead of Typhoon"

2020-09-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Narendra Modi says, “Make in India.” Toyota Motor Corp. says, stop treating cars as though they were drugs or alcohol.The Japanese carmaker has a point about the tax structure being unviable for the industry, and Shekar Viswanathan, vice chairman of the India unit, made it forcefully in an interview to Anurag Kotoky of Bloomberg News. However, instead of trying to address the specific concern about the high sin levies on cars, the government turned it into a public relations issue. The minister for heavy industries, who also looks after information and broadcasting, took to Twitter to announce that “the news that Toyota... will stop investing in India is incorrect.” The additional luxury-tax burden — 1% to 22% depending on the size of the vehicle and engine capacity — is what jacks up the overall levy in the world’s fourth-biggest car market to as much as 50% on some sports utility vehicles.Six years of headline management should have been enough for Prime Minister Modi’s government. From justifying its bizarre overnight ban on most banknotes in 2016 to defending suspiciously cheerful gross domestic product data and suppressing a not-so-rosy household consumption survey, Team Modi has left no stone unturned when it comes to spinning a narrative in which it’s doing everything right. The longer this pretense continues, the higher the risk of India getting stuck in a post-pandemic sub-5% growth rut. It’s time to start an honest dialogue with unhappy stakeholders — labor, capital, and subnational governments. Lockdowns are easing even though the coronavirus continues to spread. Workers desperately want jobs to return because there isn’t much of a safety net beyond the family or village. Businesses weren’t investing even before Covid. It’s impossible to cut consumption taxes to stoke demand. India’s fund-starved 29 state governments badly need the sin levies that are earmarked for their exclusive use. Businesses were hoping that these, which are in addition to the regular goods and services tax, would expire as planned in 2022. However, because of the hit to collections this year, they may continue well into the future. That isn’t the whole story. Import duties on steel and electronic components may go up, ostensibly to promote Modi’s Make in India campaign, pushing prices for cars still higher. The market will then be even smaller. So what can be done?Auto analyst Govind Chellappa has practical suggestions. Even if taxes remain high for now, end the constant tinkering with the rates, regulation and the fuel policy — diesel, petrol or hybrid — and commit to stability for 15 years. “It takes 24 to 36 months to develop a new product and another 12 months to set up the physical infrastructure. If taxes and regulation change every 24 months, how does one decide what to invest in?” Chellappa asks. Similarly, the badly designed goods and services levy needs a one-time overhaul, followed by long-term certainty. India must break out of this vicious cycle in which taxes are high, consumer demand is low, investment and job creation are constrained, and wage incomes are insufficient to boost purchasing power at the bottom of the pyramid. Taxes are hence exorbitant and have to be collected from a small consuming class that can afford a $23,000 Toyota sedan — and fill it up with highly taxed gasoline that costs three-quarters more than what Americans pay.Modi said in an early 2018 television interview that those earning $3 a day by selling “pakoras” — Indian fritters — should also be counted as employed. That would leave the government off the hook for the absence of new jobs in the formal economy. This false pakora/Toyota equivalence must end. India should enable large companies to grow and create good jobs with social security. When they’re more productive and paid a little better, low-wage workers will be able to afford Made in India shirts and trousers, which, as economist Rathin Roy has noted, are more expensive than imported clothing from Bangladesh and Vietnam.Ultimately, the Modi government needs to focus on one simple statistic highlighted by Ambit Capital Pvt. and Singapore-based investor Akash Prakash. As much as 40% of the country’s listed nonfinancial firms have revenue of less than $15 million. They’re tiny even by emerging-market standards, and the ratio hasn’t increased at all over the past decade.Just when India should be presenting itself as an alternative to China by making it easy for enterprises to scale up, the Soviet-style statism that New Delhi discarded three decades ago is creeping back into politics, policies, and even court orders. The first step for course correction will be to listen to criticism, rather than dismiss concerns as sour grapes or fake news. Otherwise, India Inc. will consist of a handful of very large business islands surrounded by tiny atolls that will be first to go underwater in bad weather.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-09-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Harley-Davidson Inc. is riding out of India. That’s as much of a problem for the American motorcycle icon as for one of the largest two-wheeler markets looking to make its mark globally.Harley said in a regulatory filing Thursday that it was discontinuing sales and manufacturing operations in the world’s second most populous country as part of its company-wide restructuring, or the “Rewire” plan, a five-year strategy to reset its business, focus on high-priority markets and tighten up by streamlining models. That the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company is pulling out of a thriving market for motorbikes speaks to a troubled international strategy in need of overhaul. It comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing his “Make in India” program, with the autos sector (including two-wheelers) as a key part and potentially $23 billion in production incentives on the way. Nonetheless, Toyota Motor Corp. said last week it won’t expand further there.India hasn’t been an easy market for Harley, where it’s had an assembly plant for a decade and sells a few thousand bikes. The company operates a “complete knock-down” assembly plant, where components and parts are imported from the U.S. and assembled into motorcycles for the local market. It also produces the Harley-Davidson Street series for sale outside North America. Finding the price sweet spot and gaining traction in India, even with models made for the market with smaller engines, has been difficult. Discounts sometimes help; at other times, they turn off buyers. Bike manufacturers have struggled with the existential approach — more for less, or vice versa? Indian consumers are aspirational and not that easy to please: A cheaper model of a high-end brand won’t cut it. Taxes on larger powertrains are punitive. Harley’s bikes can cost as much as 1.1 million rupees (about $15,000). That’s steep for a market where the average bike with decent mileage starts at 50,000 rupees, and its nearest competitor prices closer to 150,000 rupees.  Harley was never going for the mass market, of course. It’s long since moved beyond the Wild One to the Weekend One, selling the emblazoned-leather-jacket lifestyle of the American biker on the open road to those who can pay a top price for it. Still, in India, there has been opportunity. Volumes of premium-segment motorcycles have been growing for the last six years. Top-end models have drawn first-time buyers from higher-income levels, and are potentially an upgrade choice for the 70-some million riders of smaller bikes, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Its main rival in the segment is Eicher Motors Ltd.-owned Royal Enfield — priced well below a Harley, with a similar brand appeal. The Harley cult hasn’t grown big enough to convert into substantial sales. The top 10 brands in India have 70% of the market, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. Most of the best-selling models have been around for at least 17 years, on average. The majority of new launches fail when it comes to gaining share. As the analysts put it, the best way to get a toehold has been when new segments emerge. Harley hasn’t rolled into one. It priced itself too high, then tried to make cheaper versions that didn’t appeal to fans. The company is hamstrung to some extent by the parts it imports and then assembles at its Bawal plant. Tariffs have been a point of contention with U.S. presidents from George W. Bush to Donald Trump. But Harley struggled even after they were cut. The company has also suffered in the wider global trade frictions, with net revenues affected by tariffs imposed by China and the European Union, and by the U.S. on items imported from China. Part of the problem for motorcycles has been the transition to the latest emission norms (a good thing). Keeping up, though, has meant an increase in imported content for parts, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Duties and taxes haven’t been lowered to keep pace, while ownership costs and road taxes have increased. All together, state levies make up to approximately 50% of a vehicle’s on-road price, the highest among comparable countries, the analysts say.Modi’s ambitious plans could have been helped by a symbolic gesture to hold on to Harley. India’s inability to keep a premium manufacturer with an outsize brand points to misaligned incentives and dim prospects for becoming a top-end hub. Middle-weight players are doing fine, and large domestic manufacturers like Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co. export 47% and 26% of their production. But that may be the ceiling.In contrast, Thailand has several production-linked incentives, along with significant research and development expenditure benefits and relatively low corporate tax rates. Premium, larger-engine motorcycle makers have flocked there, including Harley, which has a manufacturing facility.Both India and Harley are walking away from what could have been a big opportunity.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-09-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the world of cars, investors seem to love news of partnerships, synergies and cost-savings as expensive tech upends long-held rules of the road. They may need a reality check.Auto companies across the globe are looking for their next green partner, even if they have their own grand plans for electric vehicles. But cautionary tales are emerging of why the best way into this brave new world – compelled by a regulatory push and sky-high Tesla Inc.-like valuations – may be to seize the wheel on their own.A quick check of how some hyped-up partnerships have fared couldn’t make things clearer.General Motors Co., which has made an aggressive push into electric vehicles, decided it was time to take an 11% equity stake worth about $2 billion in upstart Nikola Corp. Going by the risks in Nikola’s prospectus, this was a tie-up too far. Per the release, GM is giving “the in-kind services and access to General Motors’ global safety-tested and validated parts and components” — basically, most of the things Nikola needs to make trucks.Investors seemed to love the idea. Think: Traditional car company shows it has accessories for the future – electric and hydrogen. GM’s share price rose as much as 8% on the day. Nikola’s surged almost 40%. The Phoenix-based company would save $4 billion on battery and powertrain costs, the core of its business. GM would receive that much in benefits, between the equity value, electric vehicle credits, contract manufacturing, and supply of batteries and fuel cells.It doesn’t look like there’s that much value in it now, with Nikola under investigation and its executive chairman resigning. The stock has dropped almost 80% from its June peak, when it went public via a special purpose acquisition company. In fact, GM – like other car companies – is the one that likely needs the cost savings. Investors should wonder why. Sure, the Detroit giant was keeping promises. GM has said it has allocated $20 billion to electric cars and autonomous vehicles from this year to 2025. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has laid out green ambitions in clear terms: “We want to put everyone in an EV, and we believe we have what it takes to do it.” It isn’t clear what additional value Nikola would have brought. Besides, of course, the innovation hype. Barra has said GM conducted “appropriate diligence” before entering the deal. Carmakers have been setting unrealistic targets for a while. In 2017, Volkswagen AG put out a plan to make higher-density batteries in three years, according to HSBC Holdings Plc analysts. Part of the program was to bring the cost down to $120 per kilowatt hour. Today, the price remains well above $140 per kilowatt hour, and the density is still lower.Even if banding together theoretically lowers costs, what happens to competitive advantage? Bottom lines? Cheaper batteries are great, but carmakers count on high margins from expensive cars. The facts are that the pressure to make better, safer batteries is rising, and they’re in short supply.Consider the volatile relationship between Tesla and Panasonic Corp. The latter (and its stock price) has had a rocky ride with Elon Musk’s whims. For all the hope the partnership has generated, the Japanese consumer products icon hasn’t made much money from it. After a few ups and downs, the companies penned a new three-year agreement in June in which Tesla buys a certain number of batteries and makes future investments. But, here’s the thing: Tesla is looking elsewhere, too.On Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he would also purchase batteries from several best-in-class manufacturers, like South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world’s largest producer. Tesla has been looking for ways to jump-start its own battery manufacturing, reflected in the acquisition of Maxwell Technologies Inc. The biggest takeaway from Tesla’s much-watched battery day was Musk’s promise of a (much cheaper) $25,000 electric car and what that would do to reduce the price of its most important component.A number of other ventures exist in various forms: Volkswagen with NorthVolt AB, and with Guoxuan High-Tech Co.; Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and LG Chem; Daimler AG and Farasis Energy Gan Zhou Co., LG Chem and GM. The list goes on. It’s unclear whether any will produce what the market needs anytime soon: an affordable and safe electric car with efficient batteries (ignoring all the other costs of ownership, such as charging infrastructure and resale price).What additional value, then, is there from partnerships? For whatever thoughts car companies may have of going it alone, battery makers are increasingly taking pole position. Some are beginning to break even. The top six account for more than 80% of the market and are pushing for pricing power. Whoever produces cars needs batteries. It’s still simpler for automakers to outsource them than go it alone. If partnerships are done right – with capital, manufacturing prowess and real, tangible results – they can succeed. Toyota Motor Corp. has been working with Panasonic for years. It recently set up a joint-venture company that could work well enough to seem boring. For now, investors shouldn’t be wowed by glitzy tie-ups and promises. Keeping an eye on where the real returns are — like actual cars on the road and batteries that take us further, and the companies making them — may serve better. (An earlier version misidentified Nikola Executive Chairman Trevor Milton as CEO and incorrectly stated that GM had sunk $2 billion into an 11% equity stake in the company. )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-09-25,"After Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) failed to deliver any meaningful news for investors the highly-anticipated Battery Day, TSLA stock dropped more than 15% in two days this week.Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com Once again, CEO Elon Musk delivered more promises and projections and few actual results. Musk announced Tesla will produce a $25,000 electric vehicle &quot;about three years from now.&quot;The pledge was a verbatim repetition of Musk's 2018 claim that Tesla would produce a $25,000 EV &quot;in about 3 years.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt this point, most reasonable Tesla bulls and bears don't really take what Musk says seriously. But for anyone looking to buy the Tesla stock Battery Day sell-off, the share price may still have a long way to go before it reaches an appropriate range. Analyst Take on TSLA StockThe first place to go to assess value is Wall Street. Tesla is one of the least loved stocks on Wall Street. A recent study of equity analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks found that about 49% of total ratings are &quot;buy/outperform&quot; ratings, 45% are &quot;hold/neutral&quot; ratings and only 6% are sell/underperform&quot; ratings.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now Of the 32 Tesla stock analyst ratings, only 25% are &quot;buy/outperform&quot; ratings. Another 56% are &quot;hold/neutral&quot; ratings. And a surprisingly high 34% are &quot;sell/underperform&quot; ratings. The average price target among those 32 analysts is $314.40, or about 17% below its current level.Bank of America analyst John Murphy has a typical analyst take on Tesla. Murphy was long bearish on Tesla stock but recently threw in the towel and upgraded the stock to &quot;neutral.&quot;&quot;Simply put, in our view TSLA is a new disruptive (auto) company that may or may not be dominant in the long-term, but that does not matter as long as it can keep funding outsized growth, with almost no cost capital driving capacity expansion, which justifies a high stock price, in our view,&quot; Murphy says.In other words, Tesla stock investors seem willing to continue to throw money at the company at any valuation, no questions asked. Pretty much any company can thrive in that type of environment. A Closer Look at TSLA StockGiven Tesla produces automobiles, Murphy and other analysts consider TSLA stock an auto stock. Auto stock peers include General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM). But if Tesla stock is an auto stock, you wouldn't know it by its share price.The legacy automakers have an average forward earnings multiple of 10.0. They have an average price-to-sales ratio of 0.34. They have an average price-to-free cash flow ratio of 32.0.In the most recent quarter, GM reported a 53.4% decline in revenue. Ford's revenue was down 50.1%, and Toyota's revenue dropped 39.8%.Tesla revenue, on the other hand, was down 4.9%. The stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 134.2. Its PS ratio of 14.7 is about 43 times higher than the legacy auto stocks. Its P/FCF ratio of 145.7 is about 4.5 times higher.But as soon as Tesla stock skeptics bring up those numbers, Tesla bulls typically argue that Tesla isn't an auto company. Instead, they say it's a massive global tech company, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Tesla as a Tech StockApple, Amazon and Microsoft have an average forward earnings multiple of 42.6 compared to Tesla's 134.2 multiple. Tesla's PS of 14.7 is nearly double the big tech average of 7.7. Tesla's P/FCF of 145.7 is about three times the big tech average of 48.7.In the past four quarters, Tesla has averaged 5.3% revenue growth. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have averaged 15.6% growth.In other words, Tesla's growth rate suggests its valuation should probably be somewhere between the valuations of big tech peers and those of auto peers.By averaging out Tesla's forward earnings multiple, PS ratio and P/FCF premiums, Tesla would need to trade at around $15 to have a valuation in-line with auto peers.But by comparing Tesla to tech peers, its valuation premium isn't quite as extreme. TSLA stock trades at a 215% forward earnings multiple premium to tech peers. It trades at a 90.9% PS premium and a 199.1% FCF premium. The average of those valuation premiums suggests Tesla may be overvalued by about 168% and implies a price target of around $141.Of course, Tesla will need to improve its revenue growth significantly from its recent levels to warrant the type of valuations these pure tech stocks enjoy. Personally, I believe Tesla shares deserve to trade at a premium to the valuation implied by its auto stock peers and a discount to the valuation implied based on tech peers. Final TakeawayAt the end of the day, it's difficult to find any reasonable peer group for Tesla that makes the stock seem anything other than extremely overvalued. However, given the ongoing market mania surrounding TSLA stock and other EV stocks, I continue to recommend traders not short the stock. The safest place to be when it comes to Tesla is the sidelines.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan held a long position in GM.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-09-25,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",Have a Little Patience Before Jumping in on Nikola Stock
2020-09-25,"When it comes to Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), I think many investors and most of the Street have lost sight of a few important points. Most critically, they don't realize that Nikola stock can soar even if the company does not, on its own, revolutionize fuel-cell and battery technology. Nevertheless, I believe that investors should wait for a better entry point before buying Nikola.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com As I've pointed out previously, there will be meaningful demand for fuel-cell trucks from many companies that want to show that they care about the environment in general and climate change in particular. Additionally, in certain places, like California and Europe, governments are likely to mandate the use of zero-emission trucks.And  it makes sense for battery-electric trucks to be used for relatively short-distance tasks in areas where many people live and/or work. In those situations, the trucks' short range will not be an issue, while their lack of pollution will be an important asset.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere aren't many companies making &quot;green,&quot; full-size trucks now. After performing extensive research on the sector, I've only heard of several such companies, including Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hyundai, Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS), and Lightning Systems which is partnering with Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG).  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now Given the relative lack of competition in the &quot;green truck&quot; space, Nikola can succeed -- and Nikola stock can surge above its current levels -- if its vehicles are well-designed, work well without giving their owners major difficulties, and use top-notch existing technologies.The company's plan to launch hundreds of hydrogen-fuel stations could, meanwhile, give it an important first-mover advantage over its competitors, since there are currently very few such stations in the U.S.There are multiple indications that Nikola's trucks will be well-designed, function properly, and incorporate leading technology. A Closer Look at Nikola StockFirst of all, Nikola has received large orders from two huge companies: Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) and trash hauler Republic Services (NYSE:RSG). In 2018, the beer maker ordered &quot;up to&quot; 800 fuel-cell trucks from Nikola, while Republic Services  in August ordered 2,500 battery-electric trucks from Nikola.In November 2019, Anheuser-Busch announced that it had used one of  Nikola's tucks to make a delivery for the first time. I think it's likely that the beer maker has utilized many of Nikola's trucks since then and that we would've heard if the vehicles weren't functioning well by now.Further, I'd be willing to bet that both Anheuser-Busch and Republic Services used experts to evaluate Nikola's technology, engineering concepts, and personnel and found that it was poised to develop reliable vehicles with strong functionality. Nikola Is Likely to Have Leading TechnologyOn the technology front, Nikola has worked closely with Bosch, a top developer of truck components and technologies. Specifically, the two companies partnered to create a &quot;fuel cell powertrain&quot; for Nikola's Nikola Two truck.Moreover, the companies reported that &quot;Nikola trucks feature Bosch innovations such as Mirror Cam systems, Perfectly Keyless and Servotwin steering system.&quot;Further, as is well-known, General Motors (NYSE:GM) recently announced a large-scale deal with Nikola. Under the agreement, GM will  engineer and build Nikola's Badger pickup truck. Two versions of the truck will be sold: one will use only a battery and the other will be powered by a fuel cell and batteries. And outside of Europe, GM will supply all of Nikola's fuel cells.GM's electric car, the Bolt, has generally been the best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. that's made by a company whose name is not Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). I've been very pleased with my pre-owned Chevy Volt which I bought in October 2019. Given these points, I'm confident that GM will, using Nikola's design, build an excellent pickup truck for the start-up and sell it high-functioning fuel cells. Trouble With the CEOUnder its former chairman and CEO, Trevor Milton, Nikola specialized in half-truths/deception, exaggerations, and somewhat overambitious aspirations, but Milton is no longer with the company. Its CFO, Tom Brady, recently provided a measured evaluation of Nikola's capabilities, indicating that Nikola intends to be more levelheaded and transparent going forward.Additionally, one could easily argue that if Milton's statements should disqualify Nikola, then Elon Musk's statements should have doomed Tesla stock many years ago.Remember Musk's claims about Tesla's autonomous vehicles and accusations of test fudging by the EPA. Of course, The Who could forget that the SEC famously accused Musk of lying.Most recently, Musk failed to deliver on his million-mile battery tease and, much more egregiously, let the rumor that Tesla was about to unveil such a battery circulate for many weeks without denying it. The Bottom Line on Nikola StockGiven the high likelihood of strong demand for zero-emission, full-sized trucks, the lack of strong competition in the space, and Nikola's impressive partnerships, Nikola could become quite successful.If Elon Musk's history is any indication, Milton's misrepresentations and exaggerations should not be disqualifying for Nikola over the longer term.But with the coronavirus pandemic poised to potentially worsen as the weather gets colder and restrictions on the sale of over 250 million shares of Nikola stock set to expire on Dec. 3, I would urge investors to wait until at least after a week or two after that date before pulling the trigger on the shares.  I think investors who wait until at least the middle of December will probably get a better entry point.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2020-09-25,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips",Invest in LiquidPiston Stock for Credible Green Solutions
2020-09-25,"One of the main reasons people invest in technology firms is that they often forward radical new innovations. But in the case of LiquidPiston, the advancements are more nuanced. Here, the company takes an old platform -- the rotary engine -- and implements groundbreaking thermal efficiency improvements. Of course, the minor detail that prevents people from considering LiquidPiston stock is that it's levered to a combustion platform. But you may want to hear out this compelling equity crowdfunding opportunity first.Source: Shutterstock Yes, everyone in the markets is crazy for electric vehicles (EVs), and we're not just talking about their performance metrics. With EVs, you're talking about basically zero emissions on the road. And this runs counter to the concept of combustion engines. No matter how efficient this platform is, it will always require fossil fuels. Thus, it appears that if you invest in LiquidPiston stock, you're being incredibly contrarian in a misinformed manner.However, from a practical point of view, nothing could be further from the truth. You see, while combustion engines have been around longer than the sands of time, that is also in itself an asset. When you buy a traditional car, you're buying at the peak of this platform's innovation. If you go with an EV, you're still buying relatively early in the technological S-curve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the combustion engine is still remarkably inefficient, with average power units generating around 20% thermal efficiency. Thanks to LiquidPiston's proprietary technology, though, the company claims it can improve efficiency by 30%. Not only that, it can make engines ten-times smaller and lighter -- promoting paradigm-shattering cost efficiencies for automakers.  * The 7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Today Now, you can see why many astute investors want to invest in LiquidPiston stock. But the implications go beyond the traditional automobile. How LiquidPiston Stock Can Benefit From Electrical IntegrationAlthough an efficient combustion-engine car could theoretically stem the tide of the mainstreaming of EVs, there's just one problem: typically, technology moves societies forward, not backward. Over time, people will be buying more EVs, taking the sheen off combustion-engine investments.However, the moment where EVs make up a significant portion of the global automobile market may be a long time coming. According to a report from the International Energy Agency, EVs accounted for 2.6% of international car sales in 2019. Thus, the dramatic rate of demand is deceptive because we're talking about small number comparisons.So, combustion engine cars will be with us for a while. And the improvement in this ready-made platform is what drives the narrative for LiquidPiston stock.However, what many investors may not realize is that the underlying company supports EV progression rather than competing against it. As evidence, consider the recent announcement by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which declared that improving battery efficiency will soon enable the tech firm to develop a $25,000 EV.Even then, $25,000 is a lot of money for many people, especially considering the present economic climate. Furthermore, several combustion-engine cars have several examples floating at or below $20,000. Thus, even with Tesla's improvements, its cars are still priced out of the masses' reach.Nonetheless, combining the two technologies -- LiquidPiston's enhanced rotary engine and the EV platform -- in a hybrid setup could yield holistic efficiencies. Here, the rotary engine will power the battery pack, doing away with the current bulky and pricey configuration. That alone could dramatically lower the price of hybrid EVs, truly making them accessible.Moreover, LiquidPiston has integrated its engines into drones, which offers tremendous flexibility and capacity for military applications. You can read more about this exciting development on the company's StartEngine equity crowdfunding profile. Important Risks to ConsiderAs with any investing opportunity, risks abound. But with equity crowdfunding offers, the dangers to your capital are much more intense due to the unproven nature of startups. I've pointed out that most startups fail. Therefore, you should only invest in LiquidPiston stock money you can afford to lose if things go awry.Specific to the company, it's worth noting that while rotary engines feature fewer moving parts, there are reasons why this platform is not the industry standard. Historically, rotary engines consume large volumes of oil and are prone to reliability issues. And because most mechanics work on piston-driven engines, repairs require specialists, which can be very expensive.Of course, LiquidPiston claims that they have addressed the setbacks of rotary engines with their innovative take. However, I would like to let the reader know about potential problems with this technology.More importantly, LiquidPiston stock faces broader competitive threats from established players. And while the company doesn't face direct competition -- Mazda (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) abandoned its rotary-powered RX-8 -- it faces irrelevancy from other innovations.For instance, years ago, Toyota (NYSE:TM) developed an engine that achieved thermal efficiency of 38%, which is almost double the efficiency of the average combustion engine. Also, Toyota, Tesla and many others are conducting research and development on solid-state batteries. If a breakthrough is made, that means EV drivers can have much lighter cars and zero emissions.Finally, if I'm reading this correctly, Mazda has a similar idea to LiquidPistion: use a rotary engine as a range extender for EVs. Again, I point this out not to bash the case for LiquidPiston stock, but to allow informed decisions for investors. A Realistic Case for a Greener FutureThat said, here's the deal with pie-in-the-sky innovations: they're usually just that. Sure, every once in a blue moon, you'll come across a grand slam. But usually, progress is made through well-placed singles piled together in an accretive manner.For LiquidPiston, that translates to building off the rotary engine and improving its efficiency for the enhancement of both electric and combustion cars. And while it's not as sexy as solid-state batteries, the value to why you may want to invest in LiquidPiston stock is that this technology is proven.To learn more about this opportunity, head on over to its StartEngine profile.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But unlike in recent years, where a fall had it compared with stocks like General Motors (NYSE:GM) or even Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Tesla stock now has analyst support.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com People like Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch and even TV analyst Jim Cramer counsel patience.Tesla stock now has believers on Wall Street, who insist this is what CEO Elon Musk says it is - a tech stock, not a manufacturer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Key for Tesla Stock Is BatteriesThe technology is batteries. I wrote years ago that Tesla's challenge was to scale its manufacturing, but I was wrong. Others argued over whether assembly or computer components would rule the new car market. They were wrong too.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood NowIt turned out batteries were the technology that would rule the electric car market. While rivals like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) are just starting to produce electric cars, Musk said at his Battery Day event that Tesla is ready to double battery efficiency.Musk's big announcement was a new battery called the 4680. Its electrodes will be dry-coated, its cells larger. Once the kinks are worked out, the 4680 will have five times the energy, 16% more range, and six times the power of older models. The new batteries will replace cobalt with nickel and their design will be integrated into the car's structure instead of being a separate component.A better battery means prices of electric cars can achieve parity with gas-powered vehicles across the board. With the new battery installed, Musk said his cars will start at just $25,000 in three years. But his firmest product announcement was a $140,000 model for 2021 that can go from zero to 60 mph in two seconds and run 520 miles on a single charge.Tesla's battery success has analysts dreaming even beyond where Musk is willing to go. A Tesla with a full battery pack can act as a home's back-up power. Masses of Teslas can stabilize the electric grid itself.  Believe in Musk?Tesla's success in scaling has made it the hottest stock of 2020. Even with two sharp falls, which have taken the market with it, shares are up 363% on the year. Short interest that averaged 28% earlier in the year is down to 22%. This despite the fact that even assuming Tesla can hit its revenue forecast of $30 billion for 2020, it's still selling at more than 11x revenue.For the quarter ending this month, analysts are expecting revenue of $7.62 billion and (perhaps more important) a profit, 17 cents per share. For 2021 the estimate is for $42 billion in sales and net income of $3.18 per share.That will still be just one-third the size of GM. But Tesla is now worth almost 10 times more than GM's $41 billion, and could buy Ford (NYSE:F) 13 times over. Both GM and Ford are struggling for batteries in limited production. Tesla controls its supply chain.While Musk has found himself associated with the Trump administration, he now has political power of his own. Tesla is suing the administration over its China tariffs. Tax breaks are fine, but free trade is finer for Tesla stock. The Bottom LineTesla's success with batteries has made it not just a dominant car company, but a dominant factor in electric technology.What Tesla hasn't done yet is deliver solar cells in enough quantity, and at a low enough price, to power its cars and close the loop on electricity. That remains just a promise. But fewer people are now betting he can't do it.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-09-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There has always been a paradox at the heart of Uber Technologies Inc.’s business model.The ride-hailing firm aimed to attract users with prices that undercut the traditional taxi industry, thereby squeezing out the competition. With a monopoly, it would be able to raise its fares and turn a profit. But higher fares then risk irritating the customers it wooed with affordability in the first place.Those monopolies are yet to materialize. Instead the industry has seen vicious price wars that led Uber to lose $8.5 billion last year, its U.S. rival Lyft Inc. to hemorrhage $1.5 billion and the parent company of Free Now, its main European competitor, to lose a further 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion). Uber now seems to be gambling that the resolve of Free Now’s owners, the luxury carmakers Daimler AG and BMW AG, is wavering. The San Francisco-based company is considering a bid for the joint venture, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. The interest should come as a relief to the storied German giants.The two carmakers’ ride-hailing and car-sharing efforts, which include Free Now and were lumped into a joint venture dubbed Your Now last year, have proven an unwelcome distraction amid the tribulations of 2020. The meteoric rise of Tesla Inc.’s share price has accentuated the need for investment in electric mobility, just as the Covid-19 pandemic has eviscerated traditional car sales. Net profit at both BMW and Daimler this year is expected to fall to its lowest level since 2009. They can’t as readily afford to fund an asymmetric conflict against Uber, a rival whose investors aren’t anticipating a profit on the same basis until 2023.Five years ago, there seemed to be three threats to the classic automotive industry: ride-hailing, autonomous cars and electric drivetrains. Carmakers invested widely in all three. Since then, it has become clear that electric vehicles are the immediate priority: Neither ride-hailing nor autonomous cars are going to turn the industry on its head any time soon.BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse and Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius have to decide whether the long-term benefits of being in the ride-hailing game offset the near-term losses. Neither has expressed much enthusiasm about the industry publicly, which can’t have made it easy to find new investors. Even as a platform to sell vehicles to ride-hailing drivers, it’s unappealing: Toyota Motor Corp., which dominates that market, sold just 169,500 of its Prius hybrid hatchbacks globally last year, or 1.9% of its total vehicle sales.And the Uber paradox suggests that ride-hailing remains a high-risk gamble. It’s still unclear that the business model works. Besides, the most significant part of Free Now’s business is from regulated taxis, meaning it can’t unilaterally increase the price of fares.An acquisition of Free Now would also significantly strengthen Uber’s position in Europe, pushing it toward a monopolistic position in some markets, which would give it far more pricing power. That’s particularly the case in Germany, where it has struggled to gain traction. It would also give it huge power over London’s black-cab drivers, many of whom use Free Now to find fares and who already see Uber as their bete noire. Cabbies are bound to kick up a stink at the prospect of giving a cut of their fares to the Californian behemoth. Antitrust authorities are sure to take a close look at any deal, particularly since Uber would have an incentive to squeeze regular cabs even further.Should such hurdles make an Uber deal insurmountable, the German giants have few other options. The virus has severely damaged swathes of the sharing economy, meaning Free Now’s finances are unlikely suited to an initial public offering any time soon. They need to hitch a ride out of town, and fast.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Ken Kutaragi, the legendary inventor of the PlayStation gaming console, is taking on one of the hardest jobs in robotics. And he’s getting paid nothing to do it.The founder of Sony Corp.’s gaming business is the new chief executive officer of Ascent Robotics Inc., a Tokyo-based artificial intelligence startup. Kutaragi, 70, wants to make affordable robots that can safely move around and do physical work alongside humans in factories and logistics centers, and aims to have a working prototype in about a year. He said he receives no salary to save precious capital.“The Covid-19 outbreak has turned the old argument about robots taking our jobs on its head,” Kutaragi said in his first interview since taking the helm in August. “It’s pretty clear now that if we want to arrive at a new normal, we need more and more robots in our daily lives.”The industry veteran is vague about how he plans to accomplish this, other than to say partnerships will be key to moving forward. Ascent has worked with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. on a robotic arm that can pick parts out of a jumble using a single camera as input. It’s also developing autonomous driving software in collaboration with an unnamed Japanese carmaker. The company uses a combination of data from sensor-studded Lexus hybrids cruising Tokyo’s streets and a simulations where the algorithms are trained to handle so-called edge-case scenarios.‘Fast and Furious’ Driverless Cars Aren’t as Crazy as They SoundThe challenge is that he is trying to combine two technologies that have so far over-promised and under-delivered: autonomous driving and collaborative robots. The world’s biggest industrial automation companies including Fanuc Corp., ABB Ltd. and Kuka AG have struggled to grow the market for machines that can work alongside humans. At the same time, cars that can drive themselves seem to be perennially just over the horizon.“If you are looking to combine robotics and mobility, you need someone in charge who understands technology,” Kutaragi said. “We are thinking globally, not limiting our sights to Japan.”Kutaragi has a track record of solving difficult technical and business problems. He started his career at Sony in the 70s, working on some of the electronics giant’s most successful projects including liquid crystal displays and digital cameras. In the 90s, he revolutionized video gaming by pioneering the loss-leader model of spending billions on developing cutting-edge hardware and then recouping costs through content licensing deals. Kutaragi also demonstrated a keen sense of technology trends, famously shipping the PlayStation 2 with a DVD player and spurring the adoption of the new laser disc technology.Since leaving Sony in 2007, he has sat on the boards of e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc., app developer SmartNews Inc. and GA Technologies, which runs an AI-powered real estate listings website. Kutaragi has served as Ascent’s outside board director since 2018 and took over the CEO post on Aug. 26. He owns about 22% of Ascent, which he acquired from founder Fred Almeida who has left the startup. Masayuki Ishizaki, who preceded Kutaragi as CEO, has become the company’s chief operating officer.Founded in 2016, Ascent has raised about $18 million to date and employs about 50 engineers, most of whom are foreigners. Kutaragi declined to say how much runway the company has left and whether it plans additional financing.“If we don’t do it, someone else out there will,” Kutaragi said. “Management is tough, but that’s how it was with PlayStation too. It’s something I’m good at.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PlayStation Inventor Starts New Career Making Robots for No Pay

2020-10-09,"For years, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was synonymous with electric car stocks. While other automobile manufacturers have toyed with electric vehicle technology, arguably none had put as much skin in the game as Elon Musk and company. But with the surge in demand for EVs, we’ve likewise seen a rapid rise in publicly traded corporations specializing in this field. But many are left wondering how to invest for growth in this exciting market without getting burned.
Undoubtedly, growth investing is a pivotal component for shorter-term and longer-term strategies. Even if your goal as a young investor is to facilitate a comfortable retirement, you most likely can’t get there by playing it safe. As with anything in life – whether making a career move or buying a house – you’ve got to take risks. At the same time, you can’t just throw money at every opportunity, especially with highly variable markets like electric car stocks.
Don’t get me wrong – not every EV player is a speculative affair. Some I would argue are stable companies, if not outright boring. Therefore, it’s critical to know how to invest for growth rationally. With new markets, there are undoubtedly opportunities. But with that comes the specter of the unknown.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re looking to buy a new car, many consumer advocacy groups will recommend that you avoid buying the first production year of a particular model. That’s because the kinks haven’t been worked out. And this becomes a greater issue if you’re dealing with cars that have integrated new technologies.
It’s really the same principle on how to invest for growth. Rather than just buying the latest EV-related special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), you should investigate the target organization. Questions you may wish to ask are:
Does the EV firm have the right product or business plan?
Who is the management team and is it experienced in EVs or auto development?
Does the pricing for the electric car make sense relative to what it offers?
These are examples of questions you should ask of any growth investing opportunity relative to its particular sector. However, with electric car stocks, the sudden rush of participation suggests that there will be at least a few losers. Here are some of the best ways on how to invest for growth profitably.

Branding Is Tops for How to Invest for Growth
Though Tesla is never a charge up away from scoring front-page news, not all of it is positive. Case in point is an incident that happened near Dublin, California. As Nathaniel Galicia Chien was driving with his parents in their right-off-the-showroom-floor Tesla Mode Y, he heard a gush of air seep in.
In an interview with TheVerge.com, Chien recalled, “I thought a window was open…but half a minute later the entire glass top of the roof just flew off in the wind.” According to the local NBC news channel, the all-glass roof ripped off the chassis while the family was driving down Interstate 580.
This wasn’t just embarrassing for Tesla; it very well could have been deadly. But will it impact TSLA stock? Probably not.
As terrible as this defect looks, Tesla has an incredibly powerful brand. In a way, the company is like President Donald Trump. It can do whatever it wants and get away with it – well, within reason. And that’s why if you want to know how to invest for growth successfully, and especially with electric car stocks, you go with brand power.
Look, Tesla’s EVs may not be all that special, as this incident demonstrates. Similarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wowed the world with the iPhone but competitors have caught on. Yet Apple remains on top because of its brand. That’s a key attribute to consider for any kind of growth investing.

People, People, People
When it comes to starting a high-traffic business, everyone recommends that you consider location, location, location. You could have the best business in the world and yet fail in the bottom line because of where your company is situated. Therefore, smart entrepreneurs will invest whatever they can to secure the best location they can afford.
Not surprisingly, the same principle applies for many successful EV manufacturers. You want to see your target companies invest in the right executives and managers working in the right roles. To put it another way, it’s all about people, people, people.
Although it sounds cliché, people matter. For instance, Ford (NYSE:F) is a traditional automaker that was lagging in passenger car interest. Recently, the American icon pivoted toward EVs, introducing to the public the Mustang Mach-E. From a technical standpoint, everything about this debut was top notch: the Mach-E looked amazing while providing great performance and long range.
There was just one problem for automotive enthusiasts: the new Mustang was an SUV!
As you know, Mustangs have always been two-door pony cars. To have the Mustang logo slapped on an SUV was a sacrilege for many. But the problem is that fewer people are buying such sports cars. To that end, Ford made the business decision to go with what was right for the company.
That’s the kind of smart, forward-looking strategies you need. Therefore, if you want to know how to invest for growth, study the leadership team.

The Spirit of Innovation
If you’ve followed my work, you may get a sense that I despise mediocrity. If you don’t, well, let me tell you straight up: I despise mediocrity.
Honestly, I believe mediocrity and the acquiescence to it is the single-biggest catalyst for American failure. In my view, all our troubles – racism, government corruption, moral decline, you name it – stems from mediocrity. From parents refusing to rear their children properly to grown adults always pointing the finger at something or somebody else, mediocrity drives these negative behaviors.
In a similar fashion, a company’s approach to mediocrity – whether it embraces it or eschews it – represents a pivotal indicator. If you want to know how to invest for growth with reasonable probabilities, elect organizations with an innovative spirit.
Among electric car stocks, one name that comes to mind is Toyota (NYSE:TM). Following the destruction of World War II, Japanese manufacturers like Toyota had to scrap for scraps. In that period of extraordinary obstacles came the mainstreaming of just-in-time inventory management. Much of the efficiencies that Toyota is known for arose from this innovation.
Today, Toyota is one of the leaders in advanced EV battery technology, researching and developing solid-state batteries. Sure, Toyota could easily rest on its laurels but that’s not what its brand is about. For those seeking growth investing opportunities, look for the spirit of innovation, not mediocrity.

Use Some ‘Quant’ for Growth Investing
Although the above ideas on how to invest for growth are useful for filtering out the best electric stocks for your portfolio, they have an element of subjectivity involved. For instance, the results of branding are easy to quantify: you simply look at metrics such as deliveries or average selling price. But the brand itself and the power it conveys is subjective.
Some people love Tesla. And others hate the brand so much that they can’t help but deface it.
However, that doesn’t mean that everything about electric stocks is subjective. For instance, I noted in early September that Tesla shares had a strong correlation with the equity price action of Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Granted, these are different businesses but what connects them is their development of vehicles with alternative energy.
Apparently, that’s good enough for PLUG investors. And this is the primary reason why I said buying the stock is like buying TSLA for $13 (the price of PLUG at the time of writing). Earlier this month, I noted that the strong correlation still exists. Coincidentally, both stocks, while featuring different chart patterns, have the same bullish implication.
Therefore, before you dive into one of the electric car stocks available, compare their performance to a proven leader like Tesla. If they generally trend along the same trajectory, you will have greater confidence in that target asset’s performance.

Business 101
Whether you’re trying to figure out how to invest for growth successfully in the EV market or some other unrelated sector, you should focus on the brass tacks. Especially with any technology name, don’t allow yourself to be distracted with the front-facing innovations and the marketing literature.
Absolutely, listening to what a CEO has to say about his/her company is important. But objective analysis is what will keep you and your portfolio happy.
To that end, I encourage anyone interested in EV growth investing to consider the business proposition. Yes, that sleek, sexy electric car or SUV may entice your heart. But without the combination of a viable business plan and target consumer market among other metrics, you may be looking at a speculative investment.
Now, I’m not trying to moralize here because I’ve been known to dabble with high-risk, high-reward ventures myself. But when I do, I understand what I’m getting into.
A good example to showcase is Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO). Known for its flagship Solo, this EV gets its name because it has three wheels and only seats the driver. The reason? Electrameccanica specializes in commuter vehicles, which eliminates the inherent waste of people driving family vehicles to commute to work.
For me, one of the biggest challenges is the Solo’s price. At $18,500, that might be too much for a single-purpose vehicle. Additional market research will best determine if such a business model is appropriate for your growth investing portfolio.

The Electricity or the Vehicle?
Moving forward, one of the key questions to ask regarding how to invest for growth in the EV market is this: will the investment narrative focus on the technology or the sentiment?
For full disclosure, I’ve never driven an electric vehicle nor even a hybrid so I’m not personally familiar with the driving experience. Nevertheless, I’ve spoken to many Tesla owners. And they swear that once they’ve gone electric, they’ll never go analog. Reasons for this include the whisper-quiet ride along with the various technical bells and whistles.
Perhaps, though, they are enamored with the Tesla brand or the newness of the technology. But once this market becomes more fleshed out, will drivers still gawk at Tesla’s technical wizardry?
Or will they instead gravitate toward companies that feature a superior driving experience? That’s one of the interesting narratives behind Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ), which is poised to become Fisker through a reverse merger. Undoubtedly, SPAQ stock is risky. However, what attracts speculators is legendary car designer Henrik Fisker, who designed the company’s gorgeous Ocean SUV.
In my opinion, Fisker is a car company leveraging technology. In contrast, some of its competitors are arguably tech firms building cars.
One side of this coin will probably win out but which one? Again, focused market research may give you an edge in your growth investing portfolio.

Keep an Open Mind
Lastly, you don’t want to confine your portfolio into a corner unnecessarily. As with anything, you should keep an open mind. Life is much more interesting that way.
For instance, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) will probably never build an EV. Enrico Galliera, the Prancing Horse’s chief commercial officer, had this to say about the subject:
We firmly believe that battery technology is not yet developed enough to meet the needs of a supercar. In the next five years, we do not believe the technology will be able to meet the needs of a Ferrari…
As soon as electrified technology is developed, that will allow us to produce a car that fits with our position. Then why not? But the key is the technology. We will not just make a Ferrari that’s electric for the sake of it.
Many EV fans took to the blogosphere to blast Ferrari as a yesteryear car company. But let’s also keep in mind that the company’s LaFerrari exotic is its first hybrid vehicle. Of course, by hybrid, we don’t mean a Prius. Instead, Ferrari is utilizing EV battery technology to bolster its combustion engine.
Technically, though, this makes Ferrari somewhat of an electric car play because it’s utilizing the innovation. Perhaps not to the liking of EV buyers who are making the switch to protect the environment, but still – Ferrari’s keeping an open mind. Maybe you should too?

2020-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son is stepping up pressure on Grab Holdings Inc. co-founder Anthony Tan to work out a ceasefire with archrival Gojek, according to people familiar with the matter.Southeast Asia’s two most valuable startups are actively engaged on regular Zoom calls after months of off-and-on discussions and making progress toward an agreement, said the people, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. A key sticking point remains whether the two companies merge all operations or whether Grab acquires Gojek’s business only in Indonesia.Tan, Grab’s chief executive officer, prefers the narrower acquisition, which would give him more control after the deal and allow him to run the Indonesia business as a subsidiary of Grab, the people said. The 38-year-old would also face less dilution of his personal stake.Gojek’s shareholders are pushing for a combination throughout Southeast Asia because they would end up with more of the merged business, they said. Son, Grab’s biggest investor, is conceptually aligned with Gojek shareholders for a regional deal, they said.The talks underscore tensions between Tan and the Japanese billionaire, who has been a steadfast supporter of the entrepreneur’s vision for Grab. The ride-hailing service has expanded into food delivery and digital payments and aims to create an all-in-one “super app” for Southeast Asia. But the company’s losses have started to wear on Son and other backers, especially after the implosion of SoftBank-backed WeWork and the coronavirus pandemic that’s hit businesses in the region.Representatives of Grab, Gojek and SoftBank declined to comment. The talks are fluid and may not result in a transaction, the people said.One overarching concern is whether regulators would fight a combination of the region’s two leading ride-hailing providers, with overlapping operations in several other fields.SoftBank has also been frustrated that animosity between the two companies has interfered with what looks like an obvious opportunity, one of the people said. Son visited Indonesia late last year and has since joined calls to press for a deal, the person said.Grab and Gojek have been locked in a fierce, expensive battle for dominance in the last several years, so combining forces would reduce cash burn and create one of the most powerful internet companies in the region. Grab, which is present in eight countries, was last valued at about $14 billion, while Gojek, valued at $10 billion, operates in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.Investors also worry about rising competition from hard-charging rivals such as Sea Ltd., which went public in 2017 and already has a market value of about $82 billion. The Singapore-based company’s e-commerce unit Shopee and digital payments service ShopeePay have been expanding rapidly across Southeast Asia recently.The two rivals have a long list of backers. Grab’s shareholders include Uber Technologies Inc., Tiger Global Management LLC and Toyota Motor Corp. Gojek counts Google, Tencent Holdings Ltd., KKR and Warburg Pincus among its shareholders.The two sides are negotiating over the structure and valuations, as well as ways to mitigate the concerns of antitrust regulators. The deal may also depend on how long fallout from the pandemic lasts, which would impact the companies’ cash flow, according to the people.Grab has been trying to raise fresh capital. It’s in talks with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to secure about $3 billion investment, Bloomberg News has reported. The startup has been burning through cash: its Singaporean ride-hailing unit lost more than $200 million in 2019, filings show. And since the outbreak of the coronavirus, the company has also expanded its deliveries of daily essentials, as well as on-demand concierge services. In August, the firm announced a slew of financial services and products.Singapore’s Grab Joins Battle for Consumer Financial ServicesGrab Accelerates Expansion of Deliveries Across Southeast AsiaGrab Raises $850 Million to Expand Into Financial ServicesGojek has been expanding its digital payments business during the Covid era.

2020-10-16,"The markets dealt Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock some heavy blows after the U.S. Postal Service delayed its decision on awarding a potential $8.1 billion federal contract. Investors are betting big on Workhorse winning the contract, either wholly or partially.
Source: Photo from WorkHorse.com
	
Although the cat-and-mouse game will continue, it’s clear investors have already priced in the contract before it’s awarded. Plus, EVs are also red hot this year. When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the most prominent auto company in the world, ahead of Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM), the writing is on the wall. All of these factors have pushed WKHS stock to unprecedented and frankly unrealistic highs.
Although the company has evolved and taken on several forms, it has been in business since 1998. It has never turned a profit and analysts do not expect it to until 2022. Even if the company manages to clinch the contract, there are still question marks regarding how well it can execute the task.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
That makes the stock a spec play at this stage, banking more on external factors than fundamentals. That makes me wary of the electrically powered delivery and utility vehicle manufacturer at this stage.
WKHS Stock Is Not for the Faint of Heart
Don’t get me wrong here. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on the stock. Workhorse occupies a niche space in the EV industry, has a patent portfolio, and a customer list that includes DHL (OTCMKTS:DPSTF), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS (NYSE:UPS).
Also, Workhorse has closed on $70 million in financing through offering a senior secured convertible note. The company is selling $200 million of its 4% senior secured convertible notes to two institutional lenders. So, plenty of financing here will help in operations. Though the latter comes with a juicy option to convert the notes into stock at $36.14 per share, a premium of 35% over the Oct. 9 closing price.
7 Value Stocks to Buy in an Overvalued Market
But you get my point. The company has plenty going for it at this stage. However, that doesn’t justify WKHS stock rising almost 1,300% over the last six months.  It’s understandable that the prospect of an $8.1 billion federal contract will send shares soaring. Still, the prospect of getting burned is always omnipresent when you see this kind of share activity.
I always like to dig deep into the fundamentals. Analyst estimates point to less than $150 million of sales in 2021. Although that’s expected to be a 574.34% uptick, the absolute numbers are certainly not impressive for a company with a valuation of approximately $2.45 billion.
Source: Chart by Faizan Farooque, data from market estimates 
Putting All the Eggs in One Basket
Despite several catalysts, the biggest driver of WKHS stock’s recent surge is the potential USPS contract. The postal service wants to replace the white, right-hand-drive vans with next-generation delivery trucks.
In a research note, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said that Workhorse is a favorite to win the contract. Roth Capital Partners believes the company is the “best fit” out of the competitors left in the race. The bull case may have to do with Workhorse’s headquarters, Ohio, a swing state. Many analysts are betting the president will award the contract to better his chances of winning his re-election bid.
I believe that could factor into the final decision, but it’s certainly not the be-all-end-all reason why Workhorse will get the contract. Still, even if the company receives the contract or a portion of it, it won’t be a straightforward path to the top.
Workhorse is not vertically integrated, like its competitors. If it ends up with such a huge contract, it will have to undergo some massive growing pains that will include ramping up production capacity. It’s not that the company cannot do so, but it doesn’t have a history of delivering such large contracts. It will have to outsource large segments of the agreement to others. That will only contribute to Workhorse’s negative margins.

How to play WKHS stock
If you were an avid InvestorPlace reader, then you probably picked up WKHS stock was about to get hot. Under the circumstances, you made a nice profit, but the moment of truth has arrived. Sometime this month, if the company lands the USPS contract, shares will skyrocket to new heights. If there is a hitch, shares will tank. So, you need to gamble with the money that you can afford to lose.
I would advise keeping some funds invested in WKHS stock while taking some of your hard-earned profits and investing them in other, more stable stocks. The company won’t be profitable for a while, and the contract is not a done deal. So, unless you are in for the long haul, this is an excellent opportunity to part with a portion of your stake.
If you are willing to take on a bit of risk, then go ahead and keep investing in the stock. There are more signs of the company getting the USPS contract than against, so if you are willing to play the numbers, go right ahead.

2020-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Not long ago Vietnam’s Bac Giang province was one of the nation’s poorest regions, known for producing rice, lychees and poultry dubbed “running chicken.” That was before the global tech supply chain shifted its way.Now officials in the rural area north of Hanoi host representatives from Apple Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The growth in foreign investment is almost doubling every year -- even during the coronavirus pandemic -- and the province forecasts the value of exports this year will reach $11 billion, a tenfold leap in six years. Residents have swapped loud, dirty motorbikes for new Honda two-wheelers while others drive Toyota SUVs and Mercedes sedans on freshly paved roads.“Life is heaven now and it’s thanks to the factories,” said Nguyen Van Lanh, 64. His family, which once couldn’t afford to buy meat, runs boarding rooms for workers built with their factory salary savings. One relative with a loan business for plant employees drives a red Mercedes-Benz.The boom in Bac Giang highlights how the shift in the world’s supply chains is touching regions previously left behind. Vietnam’s ability to attract more sophisticated manufacturing is accelerating with rising Chinese labor costs, the U.S.-China trade war and logistics vulnerabilities amid the epidemic, which the nation’s Communist leaders have so far successfully curtailed.Shifting SandsDuring the decades after the Vietnam War as the country opened its borders to foreign investors and trade, Bac Giang remained poor. Its 2010 per capita income was $650, about half that of the nation overall, according to government statistics. The region’s flood-prone plains produced low-yielding crops, so its residents looked for factory jobs some 1,700 kilometers from home in the south. Now the province is experiencing its first boom as per capita income is forecast at $3,000 this year.Manufacturers are knocking on the doors of Vietnam’s northern provinces and committing billions of dollars to set up operations, including Samsung Electronics Co., where it is producing about half its smartphones. Apple assembly partner Pegatron Corp. plans to invest $1 billion in the northern port city of Haiphong, local media reported, following moves to Vietnam of other suppliers for the Cupertino, California company. Apple recently posted Vietnam job openings, including for a mechanical quality engineer, and managers for supply chain operations and government relations.Vietnam’s success, though, is creating a swelling trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, reaching $34.8 billion by July. Driven in part by device shipments, the imbalance triggered tariff threats. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced an investigation into Vietnam’s currency policy earlier this month.For now, investments from electronics suppliers continue pouring in as other sectors struggle amid the pandemic. The country’s tourism revenue has been slashed by about 50% and garment and other factories are laying off tens of thousands of workers as exports in the trade-dependent economy stall. Economic growth is forecast to slow to 2%-3% in 2020 from last year’s 7.02%, though the government expects a recovery to 6%-7% between 2021 and 2025.Vietnam’s low costs, political stability, investor-friendly policies, improving infrastructure and state-backed efforts to promote tech startups make the country appealing, said Gene Tyndall, a supply chain expert at Atlanta-based eMATE Consulting.Cows, FactoriesIn the heart of Bac Giang, where cows still roam the streets, a six-lane thoroughfare now replaces a one-lane road. Almost two dozen industrial parks for factories are proposed as pile drivers and cranes dot the landscape. The local economy expanded by 10.9% in the first nine months of 2020 from a year earlier compared with 2.12% growth for the entire country during the same period.“We are living the changing of the global supply chain,” said Nguyen Dai Luong, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee in Viet Yen district, where four of the province’s five operating industrial parks are located. The pace of manufacturers moving to Bac Giang has surged since 2016 as companies poured $3.8 billion into the province, a fourfold increase from the previous four years.The government is building a river port for transporting parts and, at Apple’s request, provided land for workers’ housing near the 16-hectare complex of Luxshare Precision Industry Co., the world’s biggest manufacturer of AirPods, Luong said.Bac Giang has nearly full employment, with residents of nearby provinces rushing in to chase the electronics gold rush at companies such as Luxshare. The Chinese company will hire 20,000 workers in the last four months of the year, bringing the total to 47,000 in his district, Luong said. The company employs 12,000 elsewhere in the province, he said.Higher SalariesElectronics assembly line workers can earn an after-tax salary of about $5,500 a year, including overtime and bonuses, more than the nation’s average annual salary of less than $3,000, Luong said.Nguyen Thi Ha, 22, mixed concrete for a construction company before joining an assembly line making 10 million dong ($431) a month. “I used to earn about half of that working under the sun and sometimes in the rain,” said Ha, who declined to identify her Taiwanese employer.Factory workers pack restaurants like Lao Chu Quan, downing pitchers of beer, plates of pork cooked on an outdoor rotisserie and fresh fish hot pot. “They spend freely,” said Nguyen Thi Ly, the 26-year-old manager whose family owns a Mazda automobile and five new motorbikes after having “almost nothing” before the factories came. “Our lives have changed, amazingly.”The sudden growth comes with a cost: Electronics assembly lines are high-pressured. Hoang Phuong Duy, 30, participated in a brief September labor strike at Luxshare that was triggered by a change in overtime pay calculation, leading to tense standoffs between workers and supervisors who don’t speak Vietnamese.Duy said the company quickly resolved the dispute to the workers’ satisfaction. “It’s very hard working on assembly lines,” he added. “We always have to be very fast with an intense concentration while working long hours.”Vietnam’s challenge going forward is to ensure that education improves so the country can avoid the “middle-income trap” once factories leave as costs eventually rise and pivot to a high-skilled economy, said Scott Rozelle, a Stanford University development economist.A high-quality education for future generations is the dream of Bac Giang residents such as boarding house owner Lanh, who as a child harvested rice from a “basket boat” on flooded fields where factories now rise up.“We hardly had anything to eat and clothes to wear,” he said of his childhood. Gazing down at his 3-month-old granddaughter, he added: “She will have plenty of food to eat and the best clothes to wear. We will send her to a university so she can have more opportunities than we ever had.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple’s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam

2020-10-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan will promote the use of offshore wind generation and battery storage in its new effort to become carbon neutral by 2050, according to a government official, indicating how the nation might change its policies to meet the ambitious goal.The world’s fifth-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, which is expected to formally announce the emissions pledge Monday, is aligning itself with commitments made by other major economies including the European Union and China, after lagging peers through its continued reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.“Japan’s leadership seems to have become more sensitive to the country’s reputational standing in the global climate diplomatic arena,” Jane Nakano, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said by email.The new policy could have far-reaching effects across the third-largest economy that is home to major auto and technology manufacturers. The country will need to transition much of its infrastructure to meet the new carbon targets as it remains deeply reliant on oil, coal and gas. Earlier this month, Japan started reviewing its basic energy plan with a focus on how to change its long-term power mix.Using ammonia and hydrogen as alternatives to coal and liquefied natural gas will also be a part of the push, according to the government official, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. A spokeswoman at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the powerful ministry that oversees the country’s industry and energy sectors, wasn’t immediately able to comment.There are signs industry and government are already looking at ways to replace dirtier generation with cleaner technologies. Japan’s offshore wind capacity could jump to 90 gigawatts by 2050, which is equivalent to 60% of the fossil fuel and nuclear facilities expected to close by that time, Shigehito Nakamura, managing director at the Japan Wind Power Association, said last month.The commitment comes on the coattails of other efforts by the Japanese government to curb its carbon footprint, such as plans to shut more than 100 inefficient coal power plants and tightening rules that support sending the country’s coal technology overseas. Japan has faced increased scrutiny for policies that support coal-fired generation as investors and governments step up efforts to combat climate change.While meeting the new emissions target could prove an uphill battle for Japan the transition may be easier than China’s recent pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2060. Emissions in China are still rising as the economy grows, whereas Japan has reported a decline in recent years.To be sure, Japan has set lofty targets in the past its been unable to meet. For example, it still aims to derive as much as 22% of its power from nuclear reactors in 2030 but that effort has stalled amid public opposition and court challenges in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.More nuclear reactors must restart to meet the carbon neutral target by 2050, according to Satoshi Bizen, a spokesman for the country’s Federation of Electric Power Companies. Just nine of the country’s 33 operable reactors have restarted since the 2011 disaster and only two were generating power to the grid as of Thursday.The nation’s private sector has already started a green charge. Jera Co., Japan’s biggest power producer, said earlier this month that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through shifting all of its coal plants to ammonia and increasing dependence on hydrogen, while Tokyo Gas Co., the nation’s top gas distributor, announced a similar goal last year.The most likely to benefit from the policy shift are renewable energy developers, providers, and manufacturers, alongside energy storage and battery technology providers and makers of zero emission vehicles, according to Shin Furuno, a project manager with the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change.Japan’s automakers are facing the once-in-a-generation shift to electrified vehicles and could profit from the new policies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida. Toyota Motor Corp. already set a goal of reducing average new-vehicle CO2 emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to its 2010 global average.Japan will also need to accelerate and intensify plans for renewables deployment, while natural gas will likely be a much smaller part of its energy balance by 2050, even with widespread carbon capture and sequestration, according to James Taverner, an IHS Markit analyst in London.“Current policies do not point toward a net-zero future by 2050,” Taverner said. “The next basic energy plan, due in 2021, will likely need to show major revisions in long-term aims for the energy mix if Japan is to move closer towards this goal.”(Updates with potential offshore wind power capacity in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Japan to Use Wind, Batteries to Meet Lofty 2050 Carbon Goal"

2020-11-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Surely hydrogen is the future of energy. Why else would the European Union, as part of its Green Deal, plan to shovel 470 billion euros ($550 billion) into infrastructure to electrolyze and use the stuff? Why else would China, Japan and South Korea be placing their own huge bets on the gas?The enthusiasm about hydrogen has a simple reason: Whether it’s used in a fuel cell or burned to create heat, the only “exhaust” it emits is innocently clean water. Therefore, wherever hydrogen replaces fossil fuels, it helps slow global warming. That explains the worldwide race to dominate the various niches of a market projected by some banks to be worth trillions of dollars by 2050.Then again, perhaps this is just the latest of several hydrogen bubbles, destined to pop like all the others. A first one, inflated by a seminal essay from 1970, ballooned the following decade before going pfft in the 1980s. A second expanded and popped along with the tech bubble around 2000. Maybe hydrogen is the future … and always will be.It certainly has daunting disadvantages. Yes, it’s the most common element in the universe. But it doesn’t appear in its pure form on earth. So it must be separated by running an electric current through water to split the oxygen and hydrogen atoms apart. That takes energy, which better be “green” — that is, captured from the sun, wind or other renewables. Otherwise, what’s the point?This process makes green hydrogen expensive relative to both fossil fuels like natural gas and hydrogen captured in less clean ways. BloombergNEF, our parent company’s energy institute, reckons that technological improvements will rapidly make it cheaper in the coming years. But even then, it’s still hard to transport and store. Unless combined with other chemicals, it must be compressed to 700 times atmospheric pressure or refrigerated to minus 253 degrees Celsius. Hydrogen also likes to explode.These drawbacks all but disqualify hydrogen from the application that currently gets the most hype: as a fuel to power cars, vans and trucks. On almost every count, vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells lose against their “clean energy” rivals — electric cars running on batteries.For a start, the hydrogen cars are only half as efficient. If an electric car converts 86% of the energy originally harnessed by a wind turbine into moving the vehicle forward, the hydrogen car has access to only about 45%. A car with a fuel cell also has more moving parts and is more expensive to maintain than one with a battery. And, unlike the battery car, it can’t be “reloaded” at home.This is bad news especially for Toyota Motor Corp., Hyundai Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd., the carmakers that are placing the biggest bets on hydrogen in transportation. The case for hydrogen trucks is also weak.Michael Liebreich, BloombergNEF’s founder, reckons hydrogen doesn’t even make sense for trains. It would merely eliminate the need to electrify the track, while locking in a more complex and less efficient solution. It’s only in long-haul aviation or oceanic shipping where hydrogen might beat electric batteries, thanks to its higher energy density. The batteries to get a plane to the other side of the world would be too big and heavy.Hydrogen doesn’t work much better in heating residential buildings: It’s usually easier to use green electricity to power heat pumps, which can also be “reversed” for cooling. In most industrial uses for heat, hydrogen also loses out to electricity.The long-term solution to slow global warming is therefore to electrify everything, as long as that electricity comes from renewable sources. Aye, there’s the rub. We simply can’t run everything on electricity. And we won’t ever have sun and wind amply and reliably enough to keep the lights on all the time and everywhere.So here at last is the killer app for hydrogen. It could be the fuel that picks up the slack whenever the clean power grids of the future can’t keep up. For once, the gas seems unequivocally superior to all other options, including nuclear energy.We can electrolyze the hydrogen whenever we have excess sun or wind. As Liebreich predicts, we will then store it in massive underground caverns near the central nodes of our power grids, where it can be fired up at short notice during lulls in direct electricity generation. Hydrogen is thus the plug-in technology to make the overall project of electrification and decarbonization possible.That’s huge. It also means that, while some of today’s investments in hydrogen will flop, others will pay off spectacularly. And part of their return may be saving our planet.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andreas Kluth is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-11-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I didn’t ask a soul about Donald Trump or Joe Biden. For the two months I spent crossing the country along the Lincoln Highway by Winnebago, talking with Americans and hoping to reach San Francisco by Election Day, I never brought up the campaign. Sometimes I knew how people felt — occasionally they would say, though usually not. But it didn’t matter. I wasn’t running a focus group. I was trying to catch glimpses of a more enduring spirit, the kind that has transcended parties and generations, the kind that lives, as Lincoln said, in the better angels of our nature. And maybe those glimpses could help us see more of ourselves in each other, and in the land we share.On the morning my wife Laurel and I left New York City, Sept. 11, we biked from the World Trade Center to the Cooper Union, where in 1860 Lincoln delivered a speech that catapulted him to the presidency. There in the shadow of the Great Hall, beneath an outdoor sculpture known as the Cube, slept a fellow city resident, lying under a bedsheet on a flattened cardboard box. The image stayed with me as we saw more people living on the street along the Lincoln Highway, including tent encampments that were roiling local politics in Philadelphia and Denver. But it wasn’t until we arrived in California that the problem seemed to overtake cities.In Stockton, a port city for the state’s massive agricultural industry, which produces two-thirds of America’s fruit and one-third of our vegetables, I saw more homeless people outside a shelter and soup kitchen under the freeway than I did people walking downtown — there was hardly a pedestrian in sight on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Two blocks from the shelter, a large dirt lot beside the city’s children’s museum was dotted with tents, as well as an old motorhome. Homelessness was a major issue in the mayor’s race. A Republican named Lincoln was challenging incumbent Democrat Michael Tubbs, with Lincoln advocating an increase in mental health and substance abuse services, and Tubbs advocating more affordable housing.We need more of both, Marie Baxter had told me a few days earlier in Reno, Nevada. She’s the executive director of Catholic Charities, which runs a meal program, thrift store, food pantry and sober living facility — all of them working to connect people to housing, employment and independence. On the Sunday morning I drop by, a steady stream of people walk along the Lincoln Highway, some wearing backpacks or pushing shopping carts, turn down a lane to St. Vincent’s Dining Room, and pick up a meal tray. They come mostly by foot, but also by wheelchair and even one car — a late ’80s Toyota Camry in need of a new muffler. One man — middle-aged, neatly dressed — notices our license plates.“Are you from New York?”“Yes.”“Where?”“The city.”He says he’s from Long Island and misses New York. “The food here” — he furrows his brow and crinkles his nose — “is terrible. I’m not talking about this” — he points to his tray. “There’s no good food in this city. They don’t know how to make pizza. You can’t get a good bagel anywhere.”He smiles, wishes us well on our travels, and returns to his three dining companions sitting on the curb. It’s a conversation like a hundred others we’ve had along the route, a reminder that the face of poverty often defies stereotypes. I had seen similar faces earlier in Canton, Ohio, on the main thoroughfare in the center of town, where I mistook a homeless 20-something for a young professional on a lunch break. A few steps down from him, Anthony Ware, Black and not yet middle age, was dressed to the nines: brown suit, blue shirt, yellow tie, black loafers, flat cap and dark sunglasses. He said he’s been homeless since splitting from his wife in 2016: “Just because I look like this doesn’t mean I live like this.”In Reno, Baxter has seen the faces change since the onset of Covid-19, from chronically homeless to working poor: “We’re seeing a lot more folks that were two-income families that are now a one-income family, and to stretch their dollars, they’re coming and getting a meal or coming and getting food baskets.” She also sees more young people seeking services — a trend that predates Covid: “Our clients that were in our sober living facility before tended to be slightly older men who were alcoholics, long-term alcoholics. Now they tend to be younger men, like 20s, late teens — the ones that are more of the harder heroin addicts or opioids or methamphetamine.”Still, she is optimistic and sees hope out their front door, on the Lincoln Highway. “Ten, fifteen years ago, it was all low-income motels. There was a high level of prostitution, not legalized prostitution, but prostitution. And it was just, it was so sad. I wouldn’t have even driven down 4th Street as a young woman.” Now there are three craft breweries on the block, along with other new shops. “We’re bringing in new businesses and we’re really trying to help people,” she says.West from Stockton, California, the Lincoln Highway skirts the Altamont Raceway — often called the place where the ’60s died by those who forget that assassinations, riots and war defined the ’60s more than Woodstock did. The highway moves through leafy commuter communities before heading into Oakland, where the streets turn tougher, more depressed. At Lake Merritt in the center of the city, a homeless encampment has taken over the community tennis courts. The host at the restaurant across the street says it hasn’t been much of a problem, except that customers are staying away from their main dining space, an outdoor patio. “People don’t like the view,” she says.Around the corner, another encampment is the scene of abject squalor: tents surrounded by heaps of trash and old furniture strewn across a dry dirt lot. Continuing on East 12th Street, the south side is lined with old motorhomes. On the north side, tents fill the median under the highway overpass, the area littered with debris and garbage. Makeshift plywood and pallet shanties, with tarps for roofs and walls, stand nearby — but barely. The line of shanties ends in ash and blackened wood.This last mile of driving, so close to the end of the line, is the most depressing of the whole trip. It’s the dark side of the camping and RV boom happening across the country, and it began long before Covid-19 hit.Robin Smith manages one of Oakland’s three Safe RV Parking sites, home to 44 RVs whose occupants receive free water, electricity and propane for heat, plus two meals a day. There’s a waiting list of about 30. I ask about the biggest challenge she faces. “Just trying to get them to follow instructions, because many of them have been homeless for a long time,” she says. “Hoarding is a big issue.”There are no mental health services at the site, which Smith says is an ongoing problem: “The last situation I had — by the time the police came they got to wait for the sergeant, then they got to wait for the mental health people, it was about 30 minutes. So by the time they got there to her, she had calmed down. And they were like, ‘There’s nothing we can do.’” Getting residents into permanent housing is another challenge. “Some of them are really not looking to move outside of their RV. They’re going to get whatever they can from the program and then move on.”Outside San Francisco’s City Hall, five miles from the end of the Lincoln Highway, sits one final statue of Old Abe, facing the homeless encampment across the plaza. At the center of the encampment is the city’s Pioneer Monument, one of the few things to survive the 1906 earthquake. For decades it stood as a symbol of the city’s resilience, but it has come to be seen as something else: a paean to white supremacy. In 2018, the city stripped it of a scene depicting a priest and cowboy standing over a fallen Native American, and the rest of the monument largely ignores the role of Mexicans, Chinese and Native Americans in California’s growth and development. One of the reliefs still there, facing out at the tents, is of a homesteading family.In 1862, President Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, one of the most consequential pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress. It offered 160 acres to those who built a home and farmed the land for five years. Nearly 800,000 people obtained title to 270 million acres — six times the size of New England. At a catastrophic cost to Native Americans, it offered access to government’s most valuable asset — opportunity — and benefited generations.I saw one example of that legacy outside of Reno in Fallon, Nevada. Rick Lattin — an owner of Lattin Farms, known for their cantaloupe and corn maze — told me how homesteaders founded his county: “We don’t have very many farms that are more than a couple of hundred acres. It’s all broken up from those days, because people came in and they took 40 acres, 80 acres, 120 acres. You can go 60 miles to Yerington and they have a lot of 1,500-, 2,000-acre farms, because they weren’t homesteaded. They came in and over time they got bigger, bigger. Ours are small farms.”The Homestead Act was a natural extension of Lincoln’s belief in the purpose of government. In his message to Congress on July 4, 1861, he wrote of the Civil War: “It is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men; to lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.”That struggle did not end with the Civil War. And now, as the hours of Election Day slowly tick past, Laurel and I arrive at Zeitgeist, a punk rock bar in San Francisco’s Mission District. Nothing says “punk” like a patio with picnic tables separated by Plexiglas with signs warning “Do not write on, sticker, or tag glass. Violators will be removed immediately.”Roll over, Joey Ramone. The returns are about to start coming in and we all wanna be sedated, but there will be no alcohol served without food, by order of the governor. There is just one outdoor television, and our table has a good view. Too good.“Can you slide over?” a waiter asks. “We’ve got another couple that wants to watch the debate.”He can be forgiven for mixing up the night’s featured event, but he is grievously mistaken about our willingness to share a table with strangers. Fortunately, we have two friends arriving shortly and he lets us be. I read later that the bar staff is known for its gruff service, but they seem friendly to me. Maybe I just miss New York.Last call is 8:45 p.m. — punk has never felt so prim. We walk down Valencia Street to a block party hosted by drag queen Afrika America, who is belting out Whitney Houston and Tina Turner to the mostly deflated crowd watching CNN on a Jumbotron. At 10 p.m., with no winner called and the mood tense, the party ends with “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang.The trip across the Lincoln Highway is over, but the election’s thin margin means it is ending as it began: with an overriding sense of uncertainty about the future.

2020-11-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Going by sales and stock prices, is everyone buying and making cars in China again? Not quite.A quick review of the numbers: Passenger vehicle sales rose 9.5% in October from a year earlier, and have grown every month since May. Green cars, like hybrids and pure electrics, are standouts: Sales are up more than 50%. Stock prices for companies like BYD Co. and NIO Inc. have more than doubled this year. New model launches have boosted sentiment as local automakers incline toward carbon-free. Beijing wants such cars to account for 20% of all sales by 2025.There’s no doubt that the path is toward a greener future, where electric cars and even more expensive hydrogen-powered vehicles dominate. But here’s the reality right now. Gasoline-powered auto sales are rising, too, around 6%, with 1.9 million manufactured domestically sold in September.(1) This segment accounts for around 90% of passenger cars sold monthly in the world’s largest market, where over 20 million autos were sold last year. Sport utility vehicles and other traditional-engine models that were beginning to find favor pre-slowdown aren’t seeing a big rebound yet. Electric car sales – though surging – are rising from a low base and the numbers are small relative to the size of the market, with around 160,000 green autos sold in October. Commercial and passenger new energy vehicles more than doubled last month from a year earlier. However, for the 10-month period, they fell 7.6% to around 875,000. That’s partly because some government subsidies were withdrawn or made harder to get last year. Penetration remains low, at around 6%, according to Jefferies Group LLC analysts.In recent months, Beijing has released incentives to ease the purchase and financing of electric vehicles for fleets, leading to a faster uptake. Production volumes are up – 70% or 167,000 cars in October, but that’s still down 9% for the whole year, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. analysts. Battery installations tell a similar story.The top-line numbers and optimism shouldn’t give the illusion that the issues clouding the green dream are gone. For now, the ownership and charging infrastructure costs remain huge barriers. Investors should probably take their enthusiasm down a notch, consider that we’re not there yet, and temper future expectations.Read About: A $6 Trillion Barrier Holds Back Electric CarsThe companies that succeed will be those that were conservative and realistic all along.In a recent Toyota Motor Corp. earnings call, President Akio Toyoda responded to a question about Tesla Inc. by opining that Elon Musk's company hasn’t yet created a real business in the real world, “but they’re trying to trade the recipes, and the chef is saying that, well, our recipe is going to become the standard of the world in the future.” Toyota, he continued, has “a real kitchen, and we have a real chef, too” serving actual dishes to picky customers. Not to be a complete Debbie Downer, but think about these facts: Top-end automakers with incomparable manufacturing prowess like BMW AG are grappling with battery fires. Tesla recalled 30,000 cars in China. While electric vehicles and consumers need government incentives – which are increasingly being given – there’s something to be said about safe, reliable cars that people want to drive.(1) Latest available data for cars sales broken down by fuel type.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

Think Again
2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an anecdote often attributed to President John F. Kennedy’s father, the moment he knew to get out of the 1920s stock market boom was when he started receiving share tips from his shoeshine boy. You can make a similar argument about the moment that leading equity indexes finally give their blessing to an up-and-coming stock. The latest and most dramatic instance of that will happen next month, when the S&P 500  will admit Tesla Inc. through its club doors for the first time.Take Yahoo Inc. The archetypal dotcom business found its way into America’s prime share index in December 1999, just four months before a collapse in internet stocks that took the U.S. more than a decade to recover from. New admissions in the mid-2000s were rich with real estate plays such as CBRE Group Inc., Boston Properties Inc., and Kimco Realty Corp. Those companies were then hammered by the subprime and 2008 financial crises. Is this time really going to be any different?To be sure, it looks like Tesla is on more solid footing than two years ago, when regulators were lobbing fraud charges against Elon Musk and the company was, in his words, “single-digit weeks” away from bankruptcy. Its elevation to the S&P 500 had been predicted ever since second-quarter results chalked up a fourth consecutive period of profit, passing one crucial criterion that keeps a lot of startups out of the index.Looked at from the more exacting perspective of operating cash, it’s doing even better. The $2.4 billion inflow in the third quarter alone was more than total operating cash in the decade through September 2019. The auto industry as a whole seems to be performing remarkably well in the grip of Covid-19, with the S&P’s automobile and parts sub-index Monday hitting its highest level in more than two years.Tesla is already the 11th-largest company by market capitalization on U.S. exchanges, worth about as much as the world's three biggest carmakers Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. put together. Casual investors are likely to see their index-tracking funds turn them into indirect Tesla shareholders whether they like it or not. So what’s not to like?The lingering question is around valuation. Tesla is past the point where it’s at imminent risk of demise, but it’s still very hard to justify the price put on the stock. Returns on equity are only just pulling even with the broader automobiles sub-index. Even analyst estimates that they’ll rise north of 20% over the coming years will only bring them in line with what were, until recently, considered normal levels for an industry that’s been out of favor with investors for years.That sort of pedestrian financial performance is hard to square with Tesla’s eye-wateringly expensive stock. The median price of S&P 500 constituents is 20.89 times blended forward 12-month earnings. Tesla’s price-earnings ratio is 113, which would be enough to give it the richest rating on the index after Under Armour Inc., Boeing Co., and SBA Communications Corp. Comparing forward Ebitda to enterprise value, just six companies have higher valuations than Tesla’s 49.51 times multiple.It’s very hard to see how Tesla will be able to justify those valuations in the long term. That’s the case even if you agree with the most bullish analysts and assume the company will be producing about $10 billion a year of net income by 2022 or 2023, compared with $556 million over the past 12 months. On those numbers, a 20 times price-earnings multiple would produce a business worth not much more than half of Tesla’s current $387 billion market cap.That’s the true lesson for newcomers to the big indexes. For every Yahoo or AOL Inc. that turns into a parable of market excess, there’s a Kimco or CBRE that survives but never recaptures the magic that propelled it into the limelight. Yahoo’s 1999 hype ultimately fell victim to the better search technology being developed by a then little-known startup called Google. The race to dominate electric vehicles over the coming decade will scarcely be less competitive. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc., Elon Musk’s 17-year-old upstart carmaker, took a giant step toward blue-chip respectability, getting named to one of the world’s most famous stock indexes in an action that will greatly broaden its investor base.The announcement on Monday that Tesla will enter the S&P 500 on Dec. 21 follows months of speculation, and one temporary setback, after the stock failed to make the cut during the index’s quarterly rebalancing in early September. The anticipation has helped drive a nearly fivefold rally in the stock this year to almost $390 billion, making the electric vehicle pioneer the biggest company ever to be added to the gauge. It will also be one of the index’s most influential constituents with a weighting that falls around those of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble Co.It’s so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seeking feedback from the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate pieces. The company that Tesla is to replace in the index will be named later, the index provider said.Tesla shares jumped 13% in early trading Tuesday to $460 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York. The stock is up about 450% this year.The news of S&P 500 inclusion “will of course likely drive a rally in the stock today,” JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha wrote in a note to clients before the market opening. “We think there is still upside,” he said, adding that Tesla should be valued like other “category killer” companies such as Apple Inc., instead of compared with other car companies. Osha reiterated his market outperform rating and price target of $516. “This was a little unexpected happy day for me,” said Ross Gerber, chief executive officer at Gerber Kawasaki Inc. Tesla is the top holding for the Santa Monica, California-based wealth management firm, with approximately 130,000 shares worth about $55 million as of Monday’s close.After analyzing the index just last week, “it was just kind of mind blowing that Tesla still wasn’t in the S&P,” Gerber said in a telephone interview. “So sure enough, here it is.”While entry into the benchmark is a rite of maturity that may dim some of Tesla’s cult stock appeal, membership comes with benefits, including forced purchases by index-tracking investors and mutual funds. The inclusion and the rapid rally over the past few months mean money managers overseeing passive funds will have to sell tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in their existing S&P holdings to make room for Palo Alto, California-based Tesla. On the other hand, longtime investors looking to exit their positions may now try to get out, knowing that index funds have to buy.These crosscurrents may mean more trading volatility, though that is not new for Tesla. Ever since going public in 2010, the company’s popularity with Musk acolytes and legions of day traders has made it one of the more volatile stocks of its size in America. A steadier, more institutional ownership base could help to eventually ease those swings.Unorthodox StyleTesla has solidified its position as the leading electric carmaker globally, even though competition is slowly heating up. It has overcome challenges including sometimes-severe production snarls, a massive cash burn rate and concerns about the demand for battery-powered vehicles in an industry dominated by gas-powered cars. In mid-September, Tesla reported a fifth consecutive quarterly profit, quieting critics who questioned its ability to make money.Indeed, all it had taken was Musk hinting at the second-quarter profit -- the company’s fourth consecutive profitable quarter -- in a letter to employees in late June to trigger a 66% surge in the stock over a span of 17 trading days, since the results checked off the last requirement for S&P 500 inclusion.Tesla’s sky-high share price also prompted a 5-for-1 stock split, a move aimed at making it more accessible to individual investors. The shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on Aug. 31.“We believe the sustained profitability trajectory as evidenced in the September quarter was the final straw that got Musk & Co. into the S&P 500 this time around,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors. He has a neutral rating on the stock.Joining one of the world’s most exclusive clubs is a validation for Musk and his unorthodox management style. His chief lieutenants are little known and rarely made available to the media or investors, and Musk courts controversy like few other corporate captains. He has picked fights with securities analysts, smoked marijuana during an interview and been sued for fraud by securities regulators for tweets claiming he had “funding secured” to take the company private.He also has complained more than once that Tesla’s stock price is too high. But that hasn’t deterred investors.Tesla has tapped into that investor goodwill with multiple secondary share offerings over the past decade, raising $14 billion through February and another $5 billion in September. That’s helped it fund new vehicle development and rapidly expand manufacturing capacity.Global AspirationsMusk’s latest mission is to make Tesla more of a global player in markets such as Asia and Europe. The automaker recently opened a plant in Shanghai and is building a factory in Berlin, which Musk visited last week for meetings with local officials. Tesla also has a second U.S. plant under construction near Austin, Texas, which is expected to expand the company’s model range to include a pickup called the Cybertruck.Musk is intent on cementing first-mover advantage in the market for EVs as the entire auto industry shifts to embrace electric powertrains, and his company’s valuation has topped Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. combined.While Tesla is being rewarded by investors for dominating the global electric-car market, demand is still a small fraction of new vehicle sales -- amounting to less than 3% of U.S. sales last year. That presents plenty of growth opportunity, but illustrates the challenge of making battery-powered cars more of a mainstream choice.Still, the company’s recent success and its burgeoning valuation has also forced a spotlight on the entire electric vehicle space, sparking a surge in shares of several new entrants, some of whom still have a ways to go before production begins. Shares of China’s Nio Inc. rose 44% in October, and the company currently commands a market value that is bigger than GM.(Updates with opening shares Tuesday in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tesla to Join S&P 500 Next Month as Largest-Ever New Member

2020-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has spent years mocking the idea of using hydrogen fuel cells rather than electric batteries to power next-generation green vehicles. “Fuel cells = fool sells,” the boss of the world’s top electric-car maker tweeted in June.China, the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles, isn’t so quick to dismiss the alternative to batteries. Officials are promoting the development of hydrogen-powered cars, trucks and buses, with Beijing offering to reward cities that achieve adoption targets.In a 15-year plan for new-energy vehicles released on Nov. 2, China’s State Council said the country will focus on building the fuel-cell supply chain and developing hydrogen-powered trucks and buses. President Xi Jinping in September set a 2030 deadline for China to begin reducing carbon emissions.“Hydrogen is expected to play a much more important role to drastically decrease the country’s greenhouse gas emissions,” Kevin Jianjun Tu, a non-resident fellow at the French think tank Ifri, wrote in a report published in October.China is targeting to have 1 million fuel-cell vehicles in operation by 2030, according to an energy savings vehicle development plan drafted by authorities, despite only 2,700 such cars selling in the country last year.The nation’s renewed interest in hydrogen could put it further ahead of the U.S. in next-generation autos even as President-elect Joe Biden tries to promote clean-car development.Read more: How Hydrogen Is and Isn’t the Future of Energy: Andreas KluthIn theory, fuel cells are an ideal alternative to the internal combustion engine, since their chemical reactions of hydrogen and oxygen emit no carbon. Powering vehicles with hydrogen can be expensive, though, and most of China’s supply comes from burning fossil fuels. The difficulties of storing and transporting hydrogen add to the cost.Trucks, BusesAs the supply of hydrogen generated by solar and wind power grows, the economics may improve. One utility is spending more than $3 billion on a wind and solar farm in Inner Mongolia that would produce as much as 500,000 tons of hydrogen a year, with operations expected to begin in 2021.State-owned oil refiner Sinopec said Oct. 29 it’s investing in hydrogen production, transportation and fuel cells and is building hydrogen vehicle refueling stations.The new infrastructure will likely support hydrogen-powered trucks and buses, with lithium-ion batteries remaining dominant for cars. Hydrogen makes sense for commercial vehicles since a fuel-cell automobile can go for longer on a single tank of hydrogen versus a battery-powered one on a single charge of electricity, according to Wang Chaoyun, the chairman of Anhui Mingtian Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., a startup that develops fuel-cell stacks and other inner workings for hydrogen vehicles.Filling up the hydrogen tank also is much faster than recharging an EV battery.China’s annual sales of fuel-cell vehicles will rise 10-fold over the next five years to 50,000 units before hitting half a million by 2035, says Wang, who predicts China will become the No. 1 market within three years.Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp. said in September that it plans to launch 10 hydrogen vehicles by 2025.Beijing SinoHytec Co., which develops hydrogen-fuel-cell engines, raised about 1.4 billion yuan ($213 million) in an initial public offering in August and is one of five Chinese companies that in June teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp. to develop fuel-cell systems for commercial vehicles.Read more: ‘Hydrogen Wars’ Pit Europe v. China for $700 Billion BusinessThe Japanese automaker sees the market dominated by hydrogen-powered trucks and buses rather than cars, said Chisato Yoshifuji, a project manager at Toyota. “China is concentrating on commercial vehicles and that aligns with Toyota’s thinking,” she said. “It’s a huge trend supported by the government.”Beer DeliveryOther foreign-backed companies see opportunities in hydrogen trucks, too. Hyundai Motor Co. on Nov. 5 announced agreements with five Chinese partners to promote the development of hydrogen fuel-cell commercial vehicles.“Hyundai believes China has a massive potential for hydrogen powered commercial vehicles,” said In Cheol Lee, Hyundai’s executive vice president and head of commercial vehicle division. Hyundai and its regional partners aim to supply some 4,000 fuel cell electric commercial vehicles in China by 2025.The Asian subsidiary of beverage giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, meanwhile, added four hydrogen fuel-cell trucks to its fleet, the company announced Sept. 28. It plans to deliver beer using the trucks, making China the first nation where the company has deployed such vehicles for beer shipments.“Pure electric vehicles and fuel cell-powered automobiles are equally important in our new energy vehicle development strategy and will coexist in the long run,” Wan Gang, who is a vice chairman of China’s national advisory body for policy making and often called the father of the country’s electric-car movement, said in January.Many skeptics do share Musk’s misgivings. Fuel cells are less efficient than batteries and the cost of building supporting infrastructure like refueling stations is much higher, according to a report published this month by IDTechEx, a research firm from Cambridge, England. Fuel-cell vehicles will “continue to be a commercial failure for the next two decades,” it said.And for now, Chinese leaders may be keeping their options open as they wait to see how the technology develops.“The limited details in this plan suggest, at the national level, policy makers are still deliberating over the role of hydrogen in China’s energy economy and the country’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060,” BloombergNEF analysts Siyi Mi and Jinghong Lyu wrote in a report published Nov. 13, with reference to China’s 15-year plan for new-energy vehicles.ReFire, a Shanghai startup that manufactures fuel-cell engines, is one company that’s nonetheless preparing for a surge in demand. It makes about 1,000 engines a year for Chinese producers of trucks and buses and expects annual capacity to soar to 20,000 as early as 2024. The competitiveness gap with EVs will shrink as hydrogen gains acceptance, Chief Executive Officer Robin Lin said.“There’s a great chance for a dramatic drop in hydrogen prices,” he said. “As long as hydrogen power is cheap enough, it’ll be a natural choice.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Defies Elon Musk’s Warnings and Pushes Ahead With Hydrogen

The company has no sales so far and is not projected to have them for at least the next two years. Still, it has a market cap of $8.135 billion.
The big question is, how did Nikola stock gain so much traction in such a short period of time? Well, you can chalk that up to industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Elon Musk’s billion-dollar baby generates a lot of hype, and the industry is benefitting as a result.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
However, not every company in the sector is a Tesla that is looking to burst through. Tesla’s overwhelming dominance in the industry results from many things, some of its own doing and some not. But it’s lightning in a bottle situation that is tough to replicate.

A Closer Look at Nikola Stock

Undoubtedly, a lot of the EV sector at the moment is built on perception. That’s why Tesla is doing so well.
Its recent Battery Day announcements further cement its position as the preeminent automaker in the space, a fact that is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.
The company is doing all it can to make sure its battery technology becomes more cost-effective to compete with traditional gas-guzzling cars.
That makes the comparisons between Tesla and NKLA a stretch for the most part. The pace of innovation at Tesla is astounding, and it will take years for other players in the market to catch up. Tesla is on track to deliver 500,000 cars this year, while Nikola doesn’t have any sales at this point.
Meanwhile, legal issues for Nikola are on the rise. In September, Hindenburg Research issued a report titled: “Nikola: How to parlay an Ocean of Lies into a Partnership with the Largest Auto OEM in America.” The report was scathing in nature, accusing the electric-vehicle company and its CEO, Trevor Milton, of overhyping its truck’s capacities.
The aftermath hasn’t been pretty. Naturally, the company came out with its own set of defenses. But the markets didn’t buy them, nor did analysts. Newly-minted CEO, Mark Russell, is doing all that he can to stabilize the business. However, the reputational damage is done.
Last week, the Financial Times reported that Nikola and its founder had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York concerning the fraud allegations made in the original short-seller report. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company said legal costs surrounding the allegations are now $5 million.
The dollar figure isn’t important. It’s the level of trust the investors lose as a result of these charges.
Competition Is Ramping Up
Because of outsized valuations, every automaker wants to have a piece of the EV sector, but companies operating in niches are in a better situation to play the market. One has to realize they can lose the impetus pretty easily in a fast-moving environment unless they remain vigilant.
Nikola pretty much had a monopoly in heavy-duty fuel cell trucks. It still does, but companies like Tesla and Toyota (NYSE:TM) are not going to give in that easily.
Tesla and Nikola are already at loggerheads, with the latter accusing the former of stealing its truck’s design for the Tesla Semi, launched in 2017. Tesla has filed a countersuit alleging Nikola of stealing the design for Nikola’s electric truck from Croatian car company Rimac Automobili.
Meanwhile, Toyota, along with part-owned Hino Motors (OTCPK:HINOY), is launching a hydrogen-fueled semi-truck in 2021. That will bring it into direct competition with Nikola’s hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, set to launch in 2023.
It goes without saying that this is a David vs. Goliath battle. Toyota’s net revenue from 2012 to 2020 is approximately equal to $278 billion. Hino generates $16 billion of revenue per year. Nikola reported $36,000 in revenue in its most recent quarter. I wouldn’t call it a fair fight, but there you have it.
Nikola Stock Has an Unrealistic Valuation
For a company that has zero sales, a valuation of $8.135 billion doesn’t make sense. Hino, in comparison, has a market value of $3.8 billion, despite selling close to 200,000 trucks a year. Part of that goes back to the Hindenburg Research report’s argument; that Milton’s tall claims led to Nikola stock exploding to unrealistic levels.
While I can’t say anything about the allegations, I will say that there isn’t enough on the books to justify the stock trading at 87.14 times forward enterprise value to sales. The only saving grace is the company’s partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM).
CEO Mary Barra has kept nothing off the table concerning the automakers burgeoning EV business. In case GM decides to spin off its EV segment to NKLA, the latter will have a lot to gain. But then again, is that enough to warrant a buy decision?
It’s better to go ahead and sell this one before the securities investigation uncovers something further damaging.

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Carmakers that signed up for President Donald Trump’s war with California over auto emissions are now being pressured to join a peace plan brought on by the election of Joe Biden.The automakers had split a year ago over a plan by the Trump administration to roll back gas mileage rules put in place by President Barack Obama and revoke California’s permission to set its own standards on tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions.General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV backed Trump. Rivals, including Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, reached an agreement on higher standards with California that angered Trump so much that his administration initiated a brief antitrust investigation.On Monday, a top Ford executive urged his company’s competitors to join the California agreement in a letter sent ahead of a board meeting on Tuesday of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies for domestic and foreign-owned car manufacturers in Washington.“Given the outcome of the election, and the pressing issues that extend beyond fuel economy and the scope of these standards, it would be an enormous value for the industry to be able to pivot quickly and move forward with a single standard,” Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president of the Americas and International Markets Group, said in a letter to other automakers seen by Bloomberg News.That followed a message from GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra to environmental groups last week that said the company would withdraw from Trump’s legal battle with California because company’s goal of speeding adoption of electric vehicles is aligned with Biden’s support of cleaner cars.Biden said in a statement that the Detroit company’s decision “will have a positive ripple effect as our nation strives to out-compete our global competitors, create good-paying union jobs here at home, and reclaim our place as leaders in innovation and manufacturing.”“To demonstrate real leadership, automakers should also announce their support for the voluntary agreement led by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW, and Volvo, and begin to work with the President-elect,” Delaware Senator Tom Carper, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement Tuesday.Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles and fuels at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said “Without the cover of the Trump administration gutting these standards, automakers are realizing they don’t want to be left alone on the wrong side of history.”John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement after his group’s board meeting on Tuesday: “The long-term future of the auto industry is electric.”“We recognize that regulation and policy will help set the terms for that future and that near-term regulatory issues will need to be resolved in a way that benefits the economy, the work force and the environment,” he said. “To accomplish that, the association looks forward to engaging with the incoming Biden administration on an aligned nationwide program to advance the shared goals of reducing emissions and realizing the benefits of an electric future.”According to a person familiar with the Alliance’s meeting, the automakers discussed how to prepare for the more stringent regulations expected to be coming from the Biden administration, but they didn’t reach a consensus on accepting California’s clean-air rules.The administration and California have battled over gas mileage rules since the earliest days of Trump’s presidency.Obama RulesIn 2018, the administration announced its intention to ease stringent Obama-era gas-mileage rules that would have required fleets averaging nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025. It also proposed a freeze in the mandate after 2020 and moved to revoke California’s right to set its own emission standards that are ensconced in the Clean Air Act, touching off a fierce battle with California, which helped craft the Obama-era rules.Thirteen states and the District of Columbia, have adopted California’s mileage rules, meaning automakers could be left with one set of rules for a quarter of the country and another set for the remaining states unless the federal government and California can come to an agreement.California reached an agreement with Ford and four other automakers in 2019 to voluntarily increase the average fuel economy of their fleets from 2021 levels by 3.7% per year, reaching an average of nearly 50 mpg by 2026. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into that agreement, but the probe was later dropped.Trump’s proposal called for reducing the required annual fleet wide average mpg increases for carmakers for model years 2021-2026 from the original 5% under the Obama administration’s rules to a less stringent 1.5%. President-elect Biden has included auto emissions in his proposals to address climate change.Other automakers initially resisted pressure from Democratic lawmakers to join the voluntarily agreement with California, but then GM dropped out of the lawsuit.After GM’s move last week, Toyota Motor Corp. issued a statement that said, “Given the changing circumstances, we are assessing the situation, but remain committed to our goal of a consistent, unitary set of fuel economy standards applicable in all 50 states.”Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV hasn’t said whether it will continue or commented on Ford’s letter.Katherine Garcia, deputy director of national policies for the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign, accused automakers who sided with Trump in the gas mileage fight previously of “blatant hypocrisy,” but she said it is a good sign that manufacturers appear to be coming around now after Biden’s win.Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization in Washington that advocates for environmentally-friendly policies, chided Fiat Chrysler and Toyota for declining to join GM in backing the California gas mileage agreement after Biden’s victory.“What are they waiting for – another recount?” he said. “By continuing to support this futile fight, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler are signaling their disregard for cleaning our air, curbing the climate crisis and saving motorists millions at the gas pump.”(Updates with auto lobby statement, starting in the 10th paragraph, and new environmentalist statement, in the 22nd paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Biden Win Is Pressuring Carmakers to Unite on Tailpipe Rules

2020-12-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Business disruption in 2020 wasn’t just about the global pandemic. This was also the year when investors reconfigured the $2.7 trillion auto industry.Electric-car companies are suddenly worth half of the total market capitalization of the world’s 10 most valuable automakers. That’s because money managers sized up the convergence of government policies and people’s preferences combating climate change and made alternative energy their biggest bet.Much was achieved by Tesla Inc., the Palo Alto maker of the S, X, Y and 3 model vehicles, giving it a market capitalization of $539 billion, or more than Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp., Germany’s Volkswagen AG and Detroit’s General Motors Co. combined. Tesla was barely 26% of Toyota’s value at this point last year. None of the industry’s Top 10 exclusively manufactured EVs in 2015; this year the list included Shanghai-based Nio Inc. and Guangzhou-based XPeng Inc., EV upstarts in the world’s largest market.Tesla and its Chinese competitors accounted for only 8% of the value of the Top 10 in 2019 — still a huge leap from zero percent in 2016. The three EV makers reported annual sales of $30.5 billion, or about 3% of total sales for the 10 largest companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Commentators and short sellers, who profit when a security’s price declines, predict that the companies’ shares will plummet before long because the companies’ values are far out of proportion to their more modest profits and revenues.Since its initial public offering in June 2010, Tesla revenue increased 241 times as revenue for the rest of the industry rose 19%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla shares appreciated 170 times when the comparable figure was three times for global peers. None of which persuades numerous Tesla detractors, who insist the company will fail as soon as the legacy automakers determine that EVs are profitable. That moment arrives this month when Tesla joins the S&P 500 as its record-breaking largest new member.The doubters’ refusal to relent has cost them billions of dollars. Short seller James Chanos said in April that he was more bearish than ever before Tesla shares rallied 523%. Yahoo Finance said on May 28, 2019: “Tesla is now doomed. Here’s how its EV dream will soon come crashing down.” Tesla has since advanced 13 times. As recently as Sept. 17, U.S. News and World Report cited “3 reasons to be short” Tesla, before it climbed 34%.Other investors know better. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation exchange traded fund, championing Tesla since the fund’s inception in 2014, is frequently No. 1 among 690 funds with at least $1 billion in assets. She equates Tesla overtaking Toyota in July as the most valuable automaker with another disruptive company: Amazon.com Inc. In 2006, nine years after its IPO and a few years after it became profitable, Amazon was similarly disfavored by 85% of its analysts, who didn’t recommend the shares when they traded at $32 apiece. Amazon now trades above $3,200, or 100 times what it fetched in 2006.In China, where EV incentives are part of the government’s goal to become carbon neutral by 2060, Nio’s annual revenues have tripled since its September 2018 IPO. Nio shares surged 665% during the same period as global peers were gaining 47%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. XPeng’s 2020 third-quarter revenue is 4.4 times the amount during the same period a year ago. After the company’s August IPO, the shares rose 269% when global peers gained 29%.These unprecedented valuations come at a point when the fossil fuel industry is reporting record losses, including Exxon Mobil Corp.’s $20 billion write-down this month. The market for zero-emission electric vehicles, meanwhile, is poised to become explosive, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2019, 2.1 million cars, or 2.5% of the cars sold worldwide were electric. By 2030, 26 million EVs will be sold, or 28% of total sales worldwide, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By 2040, 54 million EVs will be sold, or 58% of the global market, the analysts predict.“China will continue to lead the global EV market, despite the short-term slowdown due to Covid-19,” said a May 19 report by BloombergNEF. “Much of the growth is driven by supportive central and municipal government policies in the short term, such as extended purchase incentives, fuel efficiency regulations, and the New Energy Vehicle mandate, and city restrictions on ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. Increasing automaker commitments and large amounts of investment in charging infrastructure will speed up mass-market adoption over the next 10 years, solidifying China’s leadership position. We expect China’s passenger EV (both battery electrics and plug-in hybrids) adoption to reach 20% of sales in 2025, 47% in 2030 and 71% in 2040,” according to the report by Colin McKerracher, the head of transport analysis at BloombergNEF.XPeng’s revenue will grow 160% in 2021, followed by Nio’s 87% and Tesla’s 47%, when the average for the top 10 automakers will be 36%, according to the analyst estimates. They predict that XPeng, Nio and Tesla sales will increase another 94%, 68% and 28%, respectively, in 2022 when the Top 10 average will be 22%.Joining the S&P 500 index is especially propitious for Tesla. Among more than 1,200 mutual funds worldwide using the S&P 500 as their benchmark, $4.7 trillion, or 93% of them, disclosed no ownership of Tesla shares in their most recent regulatory filings. If Tesla represents 1% of the index, it could easily receive $47 billion from the passively managed assets tracking the benchmark.That’s another reason Tesla shows no signs retreating.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew A.

2020-12-04,"It seems that Tesla (TSLA) has sucked all the air out of the automotive sector, leaving no room for interest in other auto stocks. In a time of ultra-low interest rates and growing sales for cars, trucks and motorcycles, no one can seem to get past a niche electric-vehicle (EV) maker that sold just 500,000 cars last year. General Motors (GM) did that in the second quarter, with sales down 34% due to the lockdown.
The point is, there are bigger opportunities — and dangers — out there than just one cool company with a brilliant CEO.
The big companies may not be sexy, but they build the vehicles that everyone drives and will drive for many years to come. Remember, there’s little national infrastructure for huge amounts of electric vehicles.

Tata Motors (NYSE:TTM)

Auto Stocks to Watch: Nio (NIO)

During the first week of January this year, this Chinese EV maker was trading around $3.50 a share. Today it’s trading around $45.
Why? Because it’s “China’s Tesla.” Like Tesla, it started with a high-performance model that it could sell to high-net-worth individuals that were early adopters and could afford a collectible.
Now, its product line is expanding to more types of vehicles for the broader market — sedans, SUVs and compacts.
What makes NIO unique is its Battery as a Service (BaaS). Simply put, it has designed a subscription battery service that comes with the charging equipment and battery pack. The battery pack is swapped in and out easily, so you can have an extra charged pack at the ready if you need one quickly. Also, the plan automatically upgrades your batteries when improved batteries come out. And all packs are universal, so you can swap between cars.
It’s an interesting model. But remember there are 400 EV makers in China, and that doesn’t include U.S. and European carmakers.
Yet we know that in the Digital Age, the first to the front can have a significant advantage over the competition, even if some of that competition is superior.
NIO still looks strong, even after its quadruple-digit return this year. It currently has an “A” rating in Portfolio Grader.

How does a company that produces a limited number of vehicles a year that are certainly not environmentally focused end up on the buy list of vehicle makers?
Because RACE sells a lifestyle as well as cars. It has a significant line of clothes and accessories to go along with its ultraluxury cars. That helps keep cash rolling in, especially on the Formula One circuit where fans buy gear like they do for their favorite football team.
But it’s the cars that make the money. And RACE reported in early November that sales were up again, after lagging in Q2. The company does about $1 billion in annual sales, but it has a $53 billion market capitalization, which gives you an idea of how powerful the brand is.
The other unique aspect of this company is that fact that its client base isn’t usually hurt by economic vagaries. These high-net-worth individuals aren’t usually financing these cars.

RACE stock is up 25% in the past year and things are looking even better for 2021. It currently has a “B” rating in Portfolio Grader.

On the other end of the spectrum from RACE is GM. This cornerstone of the old Big Three is all about variety and volume.
GM sold almost 2.9 vehicles in 2019. And nearly 70% of all the vehicles it sells at this point are SUVs and trucks. If you look at the sticker prices for those types of vehicles, that’s where there are significant margins as well.
Nowadays, a well-appointed truck will run you as much as or more than a luxury sedan. What’s also driving vehicle sales, which are rising, is low interest rates and longer terms.
Boats were traditionally financed almost like houses, with 10-year loans or more. It’s getting to the point where the same thing is happening with vehicles. And that works well for GM.
Also, the real money in selling vehicles isn’t the sale, it’s in the servicing. And the more vehicles sold, the more servicing gets put on the books.
GM is up nearly 25% in the past year and 51% in the past three months. All the trends are GM’s friends at this point. This stock currently has a “B” rating in Portfolio Grader.

Toyota Motors Corp (TM)

Having crashed the Big Three party — and eclipsed most of them — many years ago, TM is another blue-chip carmaker with a significant global footprint.
However, TM stock isn’t getting the love that other global vehicle makers are getting. Some of that has to do with the pandemic in Asia and its loss of the U.S. and Chinese markets for a while.
Other challenges include the sheer volume of competitors it has across all markets. And if it becomes the premium maker of low-maintenance vehicles, it’s hard to see where it makes the service revenue.
TM certainly has been active with EVs, and its trucks are legendary from the Sahara to Afghanistan’s mountains to farms in Iowa. But there are few car cultures like in the U.S. where Toyota made its mark decades ago.
The stock is down 1.4% in the past year, but it has maintained its dividend unlike its U.S. peers. It now sits at a decent 3.1% yield. You don’t have to sell it today, but there’s no real reason to buy it here, either.


					7 Value Stocks That May Come Back into Style After the Pandemic				

TM currently has a “D” rating in Portfolio Grader.

Harley-Davidson (HOG)

In late 2006, HOG was trading at all-time highs around $70. By early 2009, it was trading at $11. A lot of people were talking about the demise of this iconic American motorcycle maker. But when you’ve been around since 1903, resilience is no longer something to look for, it’s genetically ingrained.
HOG stock got near those highs again about six years ago, but it has had trouble defining its place in the vehicle market. The folks that used to buy Harleys for recreation are now buying trucks. And younger generations aren’t as taken by the massive bikes and are looking for eco-friendly alternatives.
Harley-Davidson is showing that it understands these trends, and the company is now making new lines of electric motorcycles and sport bikes for urban and suburban commuters. It has a cult following for its classics in countries around the world, but in the U.S., it’s also looking for ways to keep its long-time fan based engaged as they age, as well as bring in a whole new generation.
The stock is up 11% in the past year and 40% in the past three months. That strong run should continue into 2021. For that reason, HOG currently has a “B” rating in Portfolio Grader.

Tata Motors (TTM)

This automaker has been around since 1945, so why haven’t you heard of it? Because it’s an India-based carmaker that has dominated that market and others in Asia for decades.
But it wasn’t until relatively recently that it looked to expand its empire. Instead of building out dealerships and parts distribution channels, it went the efficient route. It bought existing brands with those footprints already in place.
TTM owns both Jaguar and Land Rover. It also has joint ventures with established brands in countries across Asia, including Indonesia.
Another aspect of the business has always been TTM’s close relationship with the Indian armed forces. It is one of key contractors for the military’s vehicles because India has always chosen to remain as self-sufficient as possible when it came to buying military hardware.
It has done a very good job of improving the quality and reputation of its high-end global brands while also remaining a strong regional player. But its global footprint isn’t that big, and its regional markets generally opt for smaller cars in high-density populations.


					7 Value Stocks That Could Make You the Next Warren Buffett				

The stock is up nearly 15% in the past year, and it’s an under-the-radar choice. It should get stronger as the global economy recovers but it’s not a rush out and buy, either. It currently has a “C” rating in Portfolio Grader.

Ford Motor Co (F)

In Q2 of this year, Ford trucks outsold Toyota trucks by 127,000 units — in a bad quarter. Its F-150 remains the leading pick-up truck in the U.S., with GM in a close second.
The crazy thing is, Telsa’s market cap is about 15 times higher than Ford’s market cap at this point. Yet TSLA’s entire sales are barely half of Ford’s truck lines. That doesn’t even include Lincoln brands or any of its other vehicles.
But TSLA isn’t about sales as much as it is momentum. It’s seen as a brand for the future whereas Ford is seen in the rearview mirror. It isn’t sexy. And it has a big challenge in turning a legacy company into a nimble EV competitor.
Ford has a lot more going for it in the EV sector. And its new Bronco coming to market should prove decent competition for TSLA and others. But it’s all in the execution.
The stock is up 5% in the past year and is closer to a buy here than a sell, but don’t be in a hurry. Currently, Ford has a “C” rating in Portfolio Grader.

But it’s not just business smarts that got TSLA its meteoric valuation. Though the novel coronavirus pandemic has been a terrible event overall, it did fortuitously market some of the core attributes of the EV platform. Primarily, EVs have fewer moving parts than internal combustion engine cars, thereby making them simpler to manufacture. Certainly, when the pandemic disrupted the global automotive supply chain, Tesla was better insulated than the competition.
Of course, this translates to the consumer experience as well. Drivers that made the switch to EVs no longer have to deal with oil changes. Because of the fewer moving parts, they’re inherently more reliable, all other things being equal. Plus, end-users can charge their EVs at home. Just over a relatively quick timeframe, EV drivers can expect to save a conspicuous amount of money. Naturally, this is a huge benefit to TSLA stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar
Yet in spite of the many successes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is apparently worried. According to a CNBC report, Musk “sent an e-mail to employees on Tuesday warning them that they need to control their spending in order to continue squeaking out quarterly profits.”
Specifically, he warned that “investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that’s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!”
Is it time to get concerned about the sharp lift in Tesla stock? Or is this another one of Musk’s eccentric antics, right before TSLA shoots to another impossibly high plateau?

A Possible Bubble in Tesla Stock
Electric car makers are in a stock market bubble. That’s according to Bloomberg contributor Chris Bryant, who recognizes the potential of EV mainstream integration. However, he’s concerned that investor sentiment might be getting overly exuberant. Bryant wrote:
The electric revolution is real and the shift away from combustion engines is accelerating. From a climate perspective, it’s great that investors are allocating capital like this. Still, valuations look mighty bubbly. The potential for disappointment is massive, particularly for the newest crop of EV makers that are yet to generate meaningful revenue.
Like all financial bubbles, this one is driven by dreams of enormous wealth. Elon Musk has overtaken Bill Gates as the world’s second-richest person. Scottish investment manager Baillie Gifford & Co., an early Musk backer, recently cashed out billions of dollars in Tesla stock but retains a 3.7% holding worth about $20 billion.
Ultimately, one of the most important cautionary takeaways that Bryant provides is that not all EV makers will be at the finish line. Frankly, that’s good advice. But I don’t think that this warning should apply to just the EV upstarts.
No, I’m not suggesting that you short Tesla stock. Clearly, the underlying company has established a dominant brand in the EV space that will be difficult to unseat, much like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and smartphones. However, there’s a possibility that TSLA is reaching a peak at the current technological threshold.
No matter how great EVs are, with present battery technology, they represent a compromise. For people who drive in the city or who make frequent stops around town, EVs are awesome because of attributes such as regenerative braking.
But for longer trips, such as the highway driving that men prefer, EVs (again with current battery technology) fall short to their combustion counterparts on the convenience scale. Basically, EVs are always on so constant use without the benefit of regenerative activities is a drag on their total capacity. However, with combustion cars, they run more efficiently in highway conditions.
It’s a science problem that will turn off at least some people from making the transition. And that could make investors question the premium on Tesla stock, especially if the company doesn’t deliver the earnings goods, as Musk alluded to.

Can Covid-19 Boomerang Back and Hit TSLA?
Earlier, I stated that the novel coronavirus offered a counterintuitive catalyst for Tesla stock. While traditional automakers were dependent on the global auto supply chain, Tesla’s platform required fewer parts. This equated to greater insulation from the pandemic’s impact.
But if battery technology doesn’t improve quickly, the Covid-19 outbreak can also turn into a headwind for Tesla stock. That’s because an increasing number of people have reconsidered life in major metropolises and have headed toward the suburbs or more rural areas. Thus, such a transition translates into longer driving distances (i.e. highways), which doesn’t suit EVs particularly well.
Finally, let’s just end on the obvious impact: Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales disappointed this year, which isn’t surprising. But that also means the crazy valuation that we’ve seen not just in Tesla stock but in many other names and sectors is suspect. The economy may not be as great as the equities market suggests that it is.
Therefore, the best solution might be to wait this one out. Again, I’m not saying that Tesla will fail. But even giants need a breather every now and then.

2020-12-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. sold its self-driving car division to Aurora Innovation Inc. and took a stake in the startup, pulling back from its vision for a fleet of autonomous taxis to focus on turning a quarterly profit next year after the pandemic crushed revenue.The deal will value Aurora at $10 billion, according to people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified discussing private information. In exchange for investing $400 million in Aurora, Uber will get a 26% ownership stake in the company. That number increases to 40% when counting the stakes held by the employees and investors of Uber’s autonomous driving division. Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi and one other yet-to-be-named person representing Uber will join Aurora’s board.The price tag is a comedown for Uber, whose self-driving division, Advanced Technologies Group, raised money last year at a $7.25 billion valuation. The agreement with Aurora values the unit at just $4 billion, following Uber’s investment. The deal, expected to close during the first quarter, also guarantees that when Aurora releases its self-driving vehicles, they’ll launch on Uber’s network.Shares of Uber fell were mostly unchanged in after-hours trading Monday. The stock closed at $53.80 in New York and has jumped 81% this year.By adding Uber’s self-driving car unit, Aurora will gain hundreds of engineers and access to one of the world’s largest ride-hailing networks. For Uber, which has slashed high-profile cash-burning initiatives this year in a push to turn a profit in 2021, the deal will give it a significant stake in one of Silicon Valley’s most promising autonomous driving startups.In recent months, the unit’s long time frame and high costs concerned Uber’s investors SoftBank Group Corp., Benchmark and others, who have been privately urging Khosrowshahi to reconsider the autonomous driving strategy. During ATG’s short history, it has made progress building and testing autonomous driving systems, but also struggled amid a damaging lawsuit brought by Waymo, a tragic pedestrian fatality caused by one of its autonomous cars and the sector-wide reckoning that even the most basic self-driving vehicles will take significantly more time and money to develop than previously expected.The deal is similar in structure to one Uber made earlier this year with Lime. Uber offloaded its cash-burning Jump bicycle division to the scooter company and invested $170 million in Lime to ensure a payout if, some day, the company becomes profitable.Aurora and Uber announced the deal in a joint statement after markets closed Monday. The companies said the group will focus on driverless trucking first and later turn to more complicated light vehicles carrying passengers.“It works well for both of us,” said Aurora CEO Chris Urmson. “We’re excited to have them team with us, and we’re excited to have Dara join our board.”Aurora’s co-founders have a deep history in the self-driving industry. Urmson previously led Google’s self-driving team, which became Waymo. Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson directed Tesla Inc.’s autopilot efforts. And Chief Technology Officer Drew Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, was part of the 2015 academic exodus that formed the Uber’s ATG team. Bagnell left ATG to co-found Aurora.Aurora earlier this summer expanded testing on public roads from California and Pennsylvania to include Texas with an initial focus on completing long-haul, commercial trips instead of the more complicated urban maneuvers where there are more variables and opportunities for failure.Having raised $765 million from investors including Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Hyundai Motor Co., Aurora was valued at more than $3 billion last year, according to research firm PitchBook. Amazon.com Inc., which purchased its own self-driving startup, Zoox, earlier this year, is also an investor.Aurora has roughly 600 employees, while Uber’s ATG group has about 1,200 employees, many of them based in Pittsburgh, long an epicenter of robotics thanks to Carnegie Mellon University.Khosrowshahi had sold about 14% of ATG to partners SoftBank, Toyota Motor Corp. and Denso Corp. for $1 billion in 2019, but the unit was burning roughly $500 million a year and was set to exhaust funds by the end of next year, people familiar told Bloomberg this fall.Even after combining forces, Aurora and ATG face stiff competition from more developed and better funded rivals. Waymo, which has logged tens of millions of miles in more than two dozen cities, announced earlier this year it had raised money from auto manufacturers and private equity groups to expand to new locations.TechCruch earlier reported that Aurora and Uber were discussing a deal.(Updates with context starting in first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Uber Sells Self-Driving Unit to Aurora, Takes Startup Stake"

2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. is selling off its flying taxi division to Joby Aviation and investing in the startup, marking the second time this week Uber abandoned a side project as it aims to turn a quarterly profit next year.Joby will acquire Uber Elevate, the company’s division that imagined a future where air taxis shuttled people above traffic-jammed highways. Uber Elevate had also operated a helicopter service in New York City, but it suspended flights during the pandemic. As part of the deal, Uber is investing $75 million in Joby, after a previously undisclosed investment of $50 million in the startup in January.The deal follows the playbook Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has used this year to shed multiple divisions as the company turns away from its science fiction-type ambitions and focuses on trying to make money. In May, Uber led an investment round of $170 million in the scooter rental company Lime, and gave the company its Jump bike-sharing business. Earlier this week, Uber sold off its self-driving car division to Aurora Innovation Inc. and invested $400 million in the startup.In November, after Uber reported deepening losses in the third quarter, Khosrowshahi sought to assure investors the company has a path to making money, even as the coronavirus pandemic has hammered revenue. Uber is aiming to deliver a quarterly adjusted profit by the end of next year.Uber’s deal with Joby brings the total money raised by the startup to $820 million. Joby was valued by investors at $2.6 billion earlier this year, according to research firm PitchBook.Joby said it intends to operate its electric flying taxis as soon as 2023 and that the two companies will integrate their services into each other’s apps. Uber had touted its Elevate division over the years, hosting summits in Dallas, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., for industry leaders to discuss how to turn its Jetsons-like vision into reality. The unit has fewer than 100 employees, Uber said.“We’re excited for their transformational mobility solution to become available to the millions of customers who rely on our platform,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement about the Joby deal.California-based Joby’s backers include Toyota Motor Corp., which invested $394 million in the startup earlier this year; Capricorn Investment Group; and the venture capital arms of JetBlue Airways Corp. and Intel Corp.The company said its all-electric vehicle can fit four passengers and a pilot, and fly up to 150 miles on a single charge. Its prototype vehicle looks like a cross between a helicopter and a drone.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Uber Sells Flying Taxi Division to Joby in Broader Retrenchment
2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For all the enthusiasm around full battery-powered electric cars, we’re still only halfway there. In reality, the hybrid will own the electrified side of the road for some time to come.Investors have run up the stock prices of electric car companies and their valuations far higher than the businesses really warrant. Electrics amounted to just 2.6% of total vehicle sold in 2019, and made up only 1% of all automobiles on the road. The share of sales is projected to rise to 6.6% by 2040.On the other hand, hybrids, which use powertrains combining internal combustion and electric motors, are finding increasing favor with consumers. Sales peaked in 2013 in the U.S., coinciding with the year Tesla Inc. initially said it planned to start deliveries of its Model S full-electric sedan. But purchases of hybrids have ticked up over the last couple of years, and they’re now penetrating global auto markets at a far faster pace than pure electric vehicles.Earlier this month, Toyota Motor Corp., which introduced the Prius a generation ago, said that hybrids will account for a quarter of its sales in 2021. Such vehicles account for an increasing share of cars sold by Japanese automakers. Think of the Honda’s Insight or Civic. Globally, several firms are making hybrid versions of their models (such as the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Impala or Lincoln MKZ), chipping away at Toyota’s global share of this sub-segment to around 30% from 80%. Part of this is policy, part the cost of battery technology. As policy makers realize that the dream to go green with cleaner, full-electric vehicles is at least a decade away, they’ve started accommodating hybridization. The mixed-power vehicles can cut carbon dioxide output by 10% to 30%, getting governments at least some distance toward their climate  goals. China will now include hybrids in its going-green vehicle regulations, based on their fuel efficiency, after previously excluding them. In keeping with that, Mercedes Benz AG-owner Daimler AG and China’s top domestic car maker, Geely Holding, announced last month that they’ll join forces to develop a hybrid powertrain to be manufactured there and in Europe.The fact is that automakers are still finding the cost of electric vehicle and battery technology tough to digest, especially after industry sales tanked over the last year thanks to Covid-19. Despite all its corporate governance troubles, Nissan Motor Co. is an electric car bull and its Leaf model is well-liked. Even so, the company thinks electrics will reach the profitability of gasoline-powered models only by 2030, “citing such a target for the first time,”(2)  according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts. To get there, battery costs will have to fall to $65 per kilowatt hour from $150 to make them relatively affordable for consumers.All the while, regulators are pushing more stringent fuel-economy standards. In the U.S., the new Biden administration could use higher fines to encourage manufacturers to electrify their fleets, Nomura Holdings analysts say. But setting up such incentives with electric cars and pushing regulation too fast can backfire. Hybrids are one compliance solution, if not necessarily the technology transition that consumers might have chosen. They’re cleaner, not clean, and some are dirtier than others. The plug-in type, for instance, has been dubbed by Greenpeace as “the car industry's wolf in sheep's clothing.” Others hold more promise, such as strong hybrids versus the mild type whose weaker motors can’t power the vehicles on their own.Given the gritty details of the clean technology curve, investor expectations lie too far into the future. Hydrogen fuel cells? Even more expensive. Get used to it: We won’t all be driving electric cars soon. Your next ride might simply be electrified.(1) It doesn’t account for government subsidies, or price premiums over internal-combustion engine cars.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-12-10,"Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) is using second-generation fuel cell stacks from its 2021 Mirai passenger car for internal testing in production-intent Kenworth Class 8 trucks. Meanwhile, the Japanese automaker is handing off heavy-duty fuel cell trucks revealed in 2019 to customers for demonstration use.The new fuel cell electric system adapts a Kenworth T680 chassis for a more compact hydrogen storage cabinet containing six hydrogen tanks behind the cab. A more powerful lithium-ion battery pushes the driving range to more than 300 miles with an 80,000-pound load.""Our first prototype trucks proved that a fuel cell electric powertrain was capable of hauling heavy cargo on a daily basis,"" Andrew Lund, Toyota Motor North America research and development chief engineer, said in a press release Thursday. ""These new prototypes allow us to start looking beyond drayage into broader applications of this proven technology.""Said Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons: ""We have to run a little bit of a demo kind of burn in on these. We have to see how this new fuel cell stack and this new design functions in a real-world environment. Drayage is such a great opportunity to accelerate your evaluation.""Project Ocean Toyota and Kenworth collaborated on a program internally called Project Ocean. The name slyly refers to water vapor is as a fuel cell's only emission. The more formally named Zero and Near Zero Emissions Freight Forwarding (ZANZEFF) project was funded by a California Air Resources Board (CARB) grant. It used $41 million from cap-and-trade fines for excessive vehicle pollution.After showing the trucks at the Port of Los Angeles in April 2019, Toyota quietly began port testing three trucks. Each accumulated thousands of miles in drayage runs. All three returned to Kenworth in Renton, Washington, for tweaking ahead of customers getting them.""It is kind of expected on any early version like this that you're going to need to make some upgrades from time to time,"" Brian Lindgren, Kenworth director of research and development, told FreightWaves.Software, new parts for 48-volt direct-current-to-direct-current (DC-DC) converters, motor seals and transmission shifting all received attention.""We learned quite a bit,"" Lindgren said. ""They are all running much better now. We didn't design these to go over the [sometimes treacherous Interstate 5] Grapevine. But for running in the LA area and the Inland Empire, they are working really well.""Toyota Logistics Services and drayage operator Southern Counties Express are getting the first two trucks followed in 2021 by three more for Toyota Logistics, three for United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) and two for Total Transportation Services.""We have been involved with Toyota's hydrogen truck project since the beginning, and we are excited to see the latest models now being released for further testing,"" said Gordon Reimer, president of Southern Counties Express.PACCAR brands exploring Toyota is developing the next-generation ""Gamma"" trucks on its own dime instead of relying on state support. It continues to use the T-680 as the host body for the advanced fuel cell technology. Lindgren was careful to avoid giving the impression Kenworth is planning fuel cell trucks in the near term. ""We're not ready to put these out for sale yet,"" he said. ""And it might be some years yet before we're ready for commercial sale. But we're certainly working toward that.""Kenworth parent PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR) sees fuel cells as a long-haul trucking play, CEO Preston Feight said on the company's most recent analyst call. Electricity-dependent hydrogen fuel is expensive compared to batteries. But it avoids the weight and cargo-reducing penalty created by having thousands of pounds of batteries on board.PACCAR's DAF Trucks subsidiary is working with startup Hyzon Motors on fuel cells in Europe, where cabover models present packaging challenges.""They've got a lot more space constraints than we do here in the states,"" Lindgren said. ""They're challenged to get the full range they want in the space they have. They're looking at some pretty novel ways to store fuel.""Toyota's quiet approach In addition to working with Kenworth on retrofits, Toyota plans to demonstrate fuel cell trucks from its Hino Trucks subsidiary in North America in 2021.The internal testing of the second-generation fuel cell won't get a lot of attention, any more than the Project Ocean trucks did in the 20 months since they were revealed.""Some people have the impression that we have slowed down or stalled,"" Toyota spokesman Ed Hellwig said. ""As typical for Toyota, we like to announce things after they have been validated. These projects have not slowed down at all.""Toyota is all-in on fuel cell powertrains. It continues to develop fuel cells ahead of battery-electric vehicles, though the Japanese automaker practically created the hybrid-electric car market with its Prius.Related articles: Hino, Toyota bringing fuel cell truck to North America next yearSingapore spinoff Hyzon Motors makes US fuel cell trucking playCES 2020: Toyota plans fuel cell-powered city of the futureClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Mnuchin Would Not Fave Made 0M Loan To YRC  * UPS Begins Nationwide Shipping Of Vaccine Kits(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the headline-making drama surrounding Elon Musk and his brainchild Tesla Inc., investors were rewarded handsomely for their patience this year.Now that the company is maturing into blue-chip status with its addition to the S&P 500 Index this month, what happens next may boil down to some simple questions: What type of company is Tesla exactly? And how should the stock be valued? Wall Street’s answers, however, are wildly different -- Goldman Sachs has a price target of $780, while JPMorgan Chase’s is $90.“It’s whatever people want to believe Elon Musk is touting,” hedge fund manager Jim Chanos told Bloomberg TV earlier this month.Of course, investors who have bought into Musk’s ideas have done a lot better with the stock than Chanos, who said he recently reduced the size of a “painful” short position in Tesla that he’s held for five years at his firm Kynikos Associates. The electric vehicle maker has now reported profits for five straight quarters, accompanied by a more than seven-fold increase in its share price this year and a whopping return of almost 18,000% since the 2010 initial public offering.Investors who believed in Musk’s vision to transform the century-old automobile industry and stuck with it through the years had to look past production troubles, delivery missteps, mounting losses, volatile stock moves and an erratic chief executive prone to land himself in trouble with tweets.Yet as the scrutiny intensifies on the company that will command one of the top weightings in the S&P 500, investors are struggling to make sense of this auto manufacturer that is trading far above the lofty valuations typically enjoyed only by technology companies with vastly different business models. Tesla’s shares currently trade at nearly 1,000 times earnings, compared with a paltry 14 times for General Motors Co. and 54 times for the NYSE FANG+ Index.Therein lies the dilemma. Is Tesla an automaker? Or is it a technology company? Or is it some sort of an amalgamation of both? The company plans to deliver about half a million cars this year, a 36% jump over last year’s levels, but slower than the 50% increase it achieved in 2019. Wall Street analysts estimate revenue will grow 26% this year, accelerate further in 2021, and then taper off into 2022. Estimates for earnings in 2020 and 2021 have barely budged over the past two years.The most bullish analysts and investors, however, say that selling cars is only one of Tesla’s many potential endeavors. Active exchange-traded fund manager Ark Investment Management, a shareholder and one of the most ardent bulls on the stock, estimated before the company’s August 5-for-1 stock split that its share price would reach $7,000 by 2024. That calculation assumes Tesla will not only make electric cars much more efficiently than traditional ones with internal combustion engines, but also operate a fully autonomous taxi network.Right now, Tesla is not only the biggest automaker in the world by market value, it is worth more than GM, Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and BMW AG combined, which leads to the question: How exactly are investors valuing this company?Musk himself said back in May that Tesla’s share price was “too high,” and earlier this month warned employees that the stock can “get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer” if investors at any point conclude that it cannot achieve the profits they are expecting it to deliver in the future. Tesla did not respond to a request to comment for this article.Below are the edited excerpts from interviews with two major Wall Street analysts on how they are valuing the company. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock and a price target of $540 -- almost $70 below its current price. Meanwhile, Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan rates it the equivalent of a sell and has a $90 target.Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan StanleyHow do you view Tesla’s present market capitalization and how are you valuing the stock?Tesla is a car company in the way Apple is a phone company. As the car becomes connected to the internet, that opens up a lot of other addressable markets that historically were never available to car companies, and even today -- from the way most car companies design their cars -- those markets are still not available to them. Tesla is moving people away from valuing and analyzing the company by just using the number of units sold and the price of the car, and bringing into account the installed user base and the software and content services offered to those users. In the process, it takes you away from comparing Tesla to car companies and should rather be compared to software-as-a-service companies.Out of our $540 price target, $254 is attributed to the core auto manufacturing business, $154 to the network-services business opportunity, $58 to the potential of becoming a supplier of batteries and powertrain to third parties, $38 to the mobility and ride-sharing business opportunity and $25 to the insurance and energy business.Do you think Tesla deserves its current valuation or has the stock run up too fast too soon?By order of magnitude, it largely deserves its valuation. But with a story moving as fast as Tesla and with a scarcity for investors to otherwise express that view, the stock will certainly trade above any analyst or investor’s fair value estimate.Apple used to be seen as expensive at 15 times P/E and now is seen as quite cheap at 30 times P/E. That happens when you change the narrative, and change your business model from selling devices and hardware to also include the stickiness of the platform.What is your advice to investors who are wondering whether to buy Tesla ahead of the S&P 500 inclusion?I did not include any S&P 500 inclusion implication in my valuation at all.Which company or companies can be a good comparison for Tesla?It is not comparable to automotive companies. Think of Tesla as an ESG or climate-change innovation ETF. For its energy business we look at the solar companies, for the car business you can look at Apple when it was growing really fast or the valuation of the SPACs, and for the services business we looked at SaaS companies.Ryan Brinkman, analyst at JPMorganHow do you view Tesla as a company and how are you valuing the stock?At the end of the day, investments are worth the discounted value of their future cash flow. When we tried to reverse engineer Tesla’s current market value to go see what assumptions might be embedded in it, we found it requires revenue and margin that are really difficult to envision. Tesla’s valuation now is nearly two times that of Toyota and Volkswagen combined, but those two companies together sold 22 million vehicles last year. They generated $40 billion of earnings before interest and taxes. So is Tesla going to grow to approximate something like two times the earnings of the two largest automakers in the world today combined? ... Something like this could actually be embedded in the shares.We have a $90 price target on the stock and that still implies a market value for Tesla that is bigger than GM. It is only a low price target compared to the current share price.GM today sells 6 million vehicles and Tesla sells 500,000. Yet the perception is that I have such a dour view on the company. I think I have a dour view on Tesla only relative to the super enthusiastic view that the market has about the company.Do you think Tesla deserves its current valuation or has the stock run up too fast too soon?The stock has clearly run up too fast too soon. I think this company is going to be hugely bigger in the future, but they will need to be growing even so much more to justify the current share price.Investors should be braced for share-price depreciation rather than appreciation, and that can happen despite the company getting much larger and much more profitable. Because it is not a question of whether they can double or triple, as they need to do much more than that.What is your advice to investors who are wondering whether to buy Tesla ahead of the S&P 500 inclusion?I would ask them to take a view on the fundamentals by working back from the current share price, and to try to think about what future unit volume, revenue, and margin estimates may be embedded in the stock price already, and to really ask themselves if they find those assumptions reasonable and probable. If they do find them probable, then they can buy at these levels. But perhaps by first doing the analysis, they may come to believe, as do I, that the stock’s valuation has become detached from the fundamentals. At a minimum, potential new investors in Tesla should understand that there is a speculative fervor at the moment and that the stock is heavily influenced by emotion and psychology and so bound to be very volatile.Which company or companies can be a good comparison for Tesla?In terms of what this company may look like in the future, I see it primarily as an automaker, although one which derives a minority of its revenue from additional potentially faster growing end-markets. From an automotive end-market perspective, it may possibly approximate in the coming decade the size and profitability of a Daimler or BMW. That doesn’t mean it should trade at Daimler or BMW multiples right now, of course, given its faster growth and additional end-market optionality.(Corrects to say Ark price target was set before the stock split in August.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Wall Street’s Dilemma: What Are Tesla’s Shares Worth?
2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For more than a decade, companies like Apple Inc. have entertained the idea of evolving away from China-based supply chains to have their devices made in lower-cost locales like India, Vietnam and Mexico.The challenge of such decentralization became brutally evident last weekend with an uprising at a factory operated by Taiwan’s Wistron Corp. that makes iPhones in India. Workers at the plant in Narasapura, 40 miles from the tech hub of Bengaluru, were reported to be fed up with delayed and underpaid wages and ransacked the factory, destroying equipment and burning vehicles. Local police responded by swinging lathis — long batons that are used for crowd control — to quell the dawn protest. Over 100 people were detained, local authorities were cited as saying. Wistron said Monday that those involved were not company workers, but didn't provide evidence. A Toyota Motor Corp. unit has also had recent trouble in the same state, Karnataka.Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen ought to be worried.Cook, who headed operations before taking over the top job, is among global leaders searching for alternatives to the stability and reliability of a Chinese workforce that still makes the lion’s share of the world’s gadgets. But costs there are rising, and this year’s pandemic has highlighted the trade and security risks from having too much of the supply chain in one place. India is one obvious choice. Its population is almost as large, wages are far lower, and its governments — local and central — are willing to offer incentives to lure manufacturing. New tariffs on imports and requirements imposed on Apple to procure locally have further strengthened the need to produce in India. Tsai is equally eager to wean Taiwan’s companies off China’s business as her government faces down growing threats from Beijing. India has its own growing list of issues with China, including border clashes this year that led New Delhi to ban apps and other products made by China’s biggest companies. Relations between Taiwan and India have been growing closer.Taiwanese companies have been among the most public supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India  campaign. In 2015, Foxconn Technology Group founder Terry Gou dined with Modi during a trip that included an announced plan to invest $2 billion  — the iPhone 11 went into production in India this year.Yet the largest investors in Indian electronics production, chiefly Taiwan stalwarts such as Foxconn, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron, are also highly wary of pitfalls. Whereas Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in China during the peak iPhone season at facilities in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou, it’s less keen to deploy that mega-factory model in India.The reason is labor. A senior Foxconn executive once told me that the the company would like to cap India plants at 10,000 workers. Any bigger, and they’d be at the mercy of unions and local politics. A handful of such smaller factories would spread the risk and reduce reliance on any single facility or jurisdiction.Although labor protests have broken out at electronics manufacturers in China, including the 2012 riots caused by the iPhone “scratchgate” saga, they’re relatively rare given the size of the overall workforce. Central and local governments in China brook no dissent, allowing operations to run relatively smoothly, even at the expense of workers’ rights.  Many times, where protests have occurred, they’ve been with the tacit approval of authorities.But India is democratic. Its unions are vocal, and local politicians have to be responsive. Foreign companies eager to tap the large domestic market and vast labor pool will need to adjust to the reality that workers may be more quick to stand up for their interests. And Cook will need to get used to his company’s name alongside words like riot and uprising. In many respects, it’s unfair to pick on Apple — the latest complaints appear aimed squarely at Wistron — yet the U.S. company is the client and wields the power to force change, something it’s done in China over the past decade.Tsai also better hope Taiwan’s companies adapt quickly. While she exerts limited control over private firms or their operations overseas, any dispute involving one reflects badly as she seeks to build alliances. She can ill afford to see the Taiwan brand tarnished.As the world struggles to devolve away from China in a search for supply chain security, political and corporate leaders need to find ways to accommodate a global workforce that wants its own security, too.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

In the UK, its engine plant in Deeside, Wales, will close from Tuesday and its vehicle plant in Burnaston from Wednesday. Both were meant to shut on Christmas Eve until Jan 4, which is still the scheduled re-opening date. The three plants employ almost 8,000 staff in total. The Japanese car giant operates a tight system known as “just in time”, where car parts are delivered just four hours before they are needed, meaning any slight disruption could prevent cars being made. Toyota said the decision was to “ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”.

2020-12-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For obvious reasons, 2020 will not go down as a good year. At the same time, it has brought more scientific progress than any year in recent memory — and these advances will last long after Covid-19 as a major threat is gone.Two of the most obvious and tangible signs of progress are the mRNA vaccines now being distributed across America and around the world. These vaccines appear to have very high levels of efficacy and safety, and they can be produced more quickly than more conventional vaccines. They are the main reason to have a relatively optimistic outlook for 2021. The mRNA technology also may have broader potential, for instance by helping to mend damaged hearts.Other advances in the biosciences may prove no less stunning. A very promising vaccine candidate against malaria, perhaps the greatest killer in human history, is in the final stages of testing. Advances in vaccine technology have created the real possibility of a universal flu vaccine, and work is proceeding on that front. New CRISPR techniques appear on the verge of vanquishing sickle-cell anemia, and other CRISPR methods have allowed scientists to create a new smartphone-based diagnostic test that would detect viruses and offer diagnoses within half an hour.It has been a good year for artificial intelligence as well. GPT-3 technology allows for the creation of remarkably human-like writing of great depth and complexity. It is a major step toward the creation of automated entities that can react in very human ways. DeepMind, meanwhile, has used computational techniques to make major advances in protein folding. This is a breakthrough in biology that may lead to the easier discovery of new pharmaceuticals.One general precondition behind many of these advances is the decentralized access to enormous computing power, typically through cloud computing. China seems to be progressing with a photon method for quantum computing, a development that is hard to verify but could prove to be of great importance.Computational biology, in particular, is booming. The Moderna vaccine mRNA was designed in two days, and without access to Covid-19 itself, a remarkable achievement that would not have been possible only a short while ago. This likely heralds the arrival of many other future breakthroughs from computational biology.Internet access itself will be spreading. Starlink, for example, has a plausible plan to supply satellite-based internet connections to the entire world.It also has been a good year for progress in transportation.Driverless vehicles appeared to be stalled, but Walmart will be using them on some truck deliveries in 2021. Boom, a startup that is pushing to develop feasible and affordable supersonic flight, now has a valuation of over $1 billion, with prototypes expected next year. SpaceX achieved virtually every launch and rocket goal it had announced for the year. Toyota and other companies have announced major progress on batteries for electric vehicles, and the related products are expected to debut in 2021.All this will prove a boon for the environment, as will progress in solar power, which in many settings is as cheap as any relevant alternative. China is opening a new and promising fusion reactor. Despite the absence of a coherent U.S. national energy policy, the notion of a mostly green energy future no longer appears utopian.In previous eras, advances in energy and transportation typically have brought further technological advances, by enabling humans to conquer and reshape their physical environments in new and unexpected ways. We can hope that general trend will continue.Finally, while not quite meeting the definition of a scientific advance, the rise of remote work is a real breakthrough. Many more Zoom meetings will be held, and many business trips will never return. Many may see this as a mixed blessing, but it will improve productivity significantly. It will be easier to hire foreign workers, easier for tech or finance workers to move to Miami, and easier to live in New Jersey and commute into Manhattan only once a week. The most productive employees will be able to work from home more easily.Without a doubt, it has been a tragic year. Alongside the sadness and failure, however, there has been quite a bit of progress. That’s something worth keeping in mind, even if we can’t quite bring ourselves to celebrate, as we look back on 2020.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As Bitcoin soared to above $28,000 over the weekend, talk resumed about the promising and dramatic future of cryptocurrency. The chief global strategist of Morgan Stanley Investment Management even suggested that Bitcoin could replace the dollar as a global reserve currency.Cryptocurrency serves some useful purposes. But there are some pretty wild speculations going around. One of the more fundamental problems is that crypto assets can be either useful hedges, or useful forms of payment — but not easily both.There is a demand for a non-intermediated, direct payment asset, and crypto can serve that function. That is why stablecoins, such as crypto assets pegged to the dollar, have proven of enduring interest. People want to transfer something dollar-denominated but with crypto-like features. Yet the very stability of these coins means they have to create institutional layers to preserve their value. For the foreseeable future, the institutions building dollar-linked stablecoins will be riskier, less transparent and more difficult to deal with than the dollar-based system itself, including the surrounding banks.If you hold or trade with a stablecoin, you incur several risks. First, the stablecoin peg to the dollar may someday be broken, an old problem with pegged exchange rates that Milton Friedman often warned about. Second, to the extent stablecoins and other crypto assets become a major part of the financial system, they will attract more regulatory interest. That in turn will limit many of their advantages over the traditional bank sector. The U.S. government does not want a financial system that evolves outside the purview of the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other regulatory institutions.Third, the formal banking sector will improve, for instance by moving to more rapid clearing, or by introducing electronic reserve currencies. With the latter, you could transfer your electronically-based dollars within the accounting system of the central bank, and achieve a non-intermediated transfer without resorting to crypto. It is not obvious that crypto will be the market winner once more mainstream institutions learn some lessons from the success of crypto.Alternatively, consider crypto assets, such as Bitcoin or ether, which are not pegged to major national currencies. They are useful hedges and speculation vehicles, but you probably would not want to use them as your dominant means of purchase. If they can go up in value so rapidly, they can fall too, sometimes precipitously. That’s OK if you’re using crypto assets for a modest portion of your purchases. But it’s too risky to make them the bulk of your checking and savings accounts. The dollar, euro or, for that matter, the Mexican peso are not nearly so volatile.Imagine that virtual reality takes off, and there are economies inside virtual reality, spanning many nations. A crypto asset might be a more convenient means of payment within those networks than the dollar, if only because of the cumbersome reporting requirements for larger dollar transfers. Still, the motive for using that same crypto asset to purchase your next Toyota, or to borrow from your bank to start a restaurant, is less than clear.Some enthusiasts postulate a world where crypto transactions are not transparent to governments, allowing buyers and sellers to live outside the tax system. Such anonymity is technologically possible, and the current black- and grey-market uses of crypto (for instance, getting funds out of China) are likely to continue.But if most of your economic life is in the physical world, and if you own wealth within a country, such as real estate and registered equity shares, the idea that you would be able to evade most taxes is a myth. If anything, the trend is for major technology companies to cooperate with tax collection, and at any rate governments can always change from taxing transactions to taxing wealth. Crypto tax evasion is better suited to be a fringe rather than mainstream endeavor.The recent run-up in crypto values seems to be driven by the possibility that major corporations will start adding them to their balance sheets. If you imagine crypto being treated like gold, and constituting say half of a percent of many balance sheets, that would imply a high price for the major crypto assets. Yet these corporations will want institutionalized, mainstream crypto assets, and they will not mind the notion of more heavily regulated crypto assets and crypto-linked financial institutions.The more utopian scenarios for crypto, whether proponents realize it or not, rely on the notion that crypto remains simultaneously fringe and mainstream. That will be a hard trick to pull off.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-12-29,"The first two acts in Mark Duchesne's manufacturing career came at buttoned-down Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM): 22 years adhering to process-driven, box-checking principles. Then came five freewheeling years at Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) where every day was an adventure.""We didn't necessarily know what we were doing from one day to the next,"" he said of life in Elon Musk's world of robots named for comic book heroes and a parking lot assembly tent to meet demand and expectations for electric cars and SUVs.Now Duchesne is on to Act 3, overseeing the construction of Nikola Corp.'s (NASDAQ: NKLA) $600 million manufacturing plant in Coolidge, Arizona. He is also keeping an eye on the pre-production Tre heavy-duty battery-electric trucks Nikola is building in an Iveco plant in Ulm, Germany. Duchesne had no role in Nikola's decision that led to the cancelation of its biggest order, an agreement with Republic Services to build 2,500 electric refuse trucks. Nikola found the refuse trucks couldn't be made on the same chassis as the Tre. Fulfilling the order would have cost $200 million more than expected and required a new chassis.The latest setback for the startup electric truck maker is one less distraction for Duchesne. His task is completing the first phase of the plant and assembling Tre models from kits of parts imported from Germany and a couple of fuel cell trucks by the end of 2021. On Tuesday, Duchesne leads a team raising the factory's first steel beam.Duchesne talked with FreightWaves about how his manufacturing experience influences his current project. Here are excerpts from the conversation edited for length and clarity.What were the differences in getting manufacturing started at Toyota and Tesla? Starting up a new facility, no matter what company you're doing it with, it's super challenging. You're bringing thousands and hundreds of thousands of points together, and you're bringing them all together so that at the right time, you can actually start producing a vehicle. At Toyota, you're working with a group of hundreds of thousands of people all around the world. And you're bringing all of those experiences together. And everybody's got a little piece of the pie. Everybody's following a system that is really well defined and almost a guarantee for success. At Tesla, we didn't have any of those systems. We didn't have the support of anybody else. And we didn't necessarily know what we were doing from one day to the next.What does that mean for Nikola manufacturing? Nikola's a little bit more like Tesla in the fact that we're moving very, very quickly. We don't have the rule book that we have to follow. We are making it up as we go. And I think the difference [from] Tesla is we recognize that we have to move towards those systems. Those systems are what's going to ensure our future success. But for right now, we're moving with people who know which big check items we have to do for sure and which ones can we rely on on our knowledge to get past?You describe it as a numbers game. How? If there's 200,000 checked items on a Toyota project, there's 2,000 that you really must do. And out of those 2,000, there's 200 that are really going to cause you problems if you don't do them properly. And then out of those 200, there's 20 that are going to kill you if you don't get them right.Is there a way to balance the two approaches? I learned everything I know from working in the Toyota system. I'm a huge fan of it. The cautionary tale is what people naturally do when they're posed with a problem is study how the system failed. Conversely, at Tesla, we had the greatest problem solvers in the world. We were so good at firefighting and coming up with unique solutions that it became addicting. The problem is, if you don't try to recognize why the fire started and who started it and try to resolve that problem, you'll never get better. The plan for Nikola is to find that sweet spot in between.How has the pandemic affected timing in Germany and Arizona? If we were in full production and running and trying to navigate through this pandemic, I think it would be a horrible experience. But we're not trying to run operations. So, we don't have to manage that part of things right now. I would never say the word lucky in the middle of a pandemic. But if we have a chance to work our way through, now's a good time for us to do this.How does building a fuel cell truck different from a diesel or a battery-powered truck? There's no engine. But there is a motor. So there's fewer parts. However, there's maybe a little bit more precision involved in installing those parts. But the differences in building a fuel cell truck over a battery truck over an [internal combustion engine] are not great. One of the phrases I learned at Toyota is called monozukuri. A loose translation is, ""the art of making things."" It's not really so important what you're making.What do you mean that the first phase of the Arizona factory is a pilot plant? We're going to build the pilot line with a capability of up to 10 trucks a month. And those will be  mostly done by hand. Part of the reason for that is it gives all these new people that we're bringing on board a chance to understand how the vehicle is built before we are under the pressure of production volume.Can you successfully assemble trucks while the plant is being built around you? It'll be a bit of mayhem out there because we'll be in one or two buildings doing actual production work. And we'll be surrounded by construction building out the rest of phase one. I'm targeting to try to have some of these early trucks as soon as the second quarter next year in very, very low volume while we get the rest of [the plant] ready to go.Related articles: Republic Services cancels refuse truck order from NikolaDespite Nikola's woes, electric truck plant progresses in ArizonaNikola pilot plant to speed electric truck productionClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Republic Services Cancels Refuse Truck Order From Nikola(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- On a day that Saudi Arabia jolted the oil market with an output cut it called a “gesture of goodwill,” the kingdom’s de-facto ruler took center stage in a mirrored concert hall, ready to resolve a different crisis.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had presided over the rift with Qatar for more than three years. But now there were just two weeks before a new U.S. leader took office, and President-elect Joe Biden had promised to treat Saudi Arabia as a “pariah.” Combined with threats from Iran and a weakening economy, the prince’s calculation had been shifting: reconciliation looked better than conflict.Gulf Arab States Agree to Restore Qatar Ties in U.S.-Backed DealSo on Tuesday, as television cameras rolled in the northwestern Saudi town of Al Ula, Prince Mohammed hugged Qatar’s ruler and ended the split, casting himself as a peacemaker. Hours later, Saudi Arabia announced it would cut oil production by a million barrels a day to support prices for fellow producers -- a directive that the energy minister said came straight from the crown prince and which sent the shares of U.S. energy companies soaring.With those moves, Prince Mohammed underscored his public presence with a conciliatory tone - at least for now. Since the 35-year-old prince rose to power in 2015, the world’s largest crude exporter had entered into a series of uncharacteristically high-risk ventures: a war in Yemen, partially cutting ties with Canada, waging a bitter oil price war with Russia, and flirting with a trade war with Turkey.New ApproachOne Gulf-based diplomat, who asked not to be named discussing Saudi internal politics, described Prince Mohammed as attempting to pull two levers of influence at the same time. With one, he’s eking out whatever gains he can squeeze from the Saudi-friendly administration of Donald Trump. This has been done by drawing on the desire of special adviser Jared Kushner, who attended the summit, to also project himself as a peacemaker. With another lever, he’s positioning himself as a leader that Biden can’t afford to alienate or ignore, especially by appearing to be constructive.“This is an effort to take a leadership role, to try and gain some diplomatic advantage with the incoming Biden administration, and a realization perhaps that the last four years allowed too much foreign policy adventurism,” said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.Trump was close to Saudi Arabia, taking his first foreign trip as president there, driving a hard line against its arch-enemy Iran, and shielding Prince Mohammed from repercussions for the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.Costly ConflictsIt’s not just Biden driving the new tone, though - the terrain Prince Mohammed treads has also shifted. His plan to diversify the economy and wean it off oil faces major setbacks, and the kingdom’s reputation has taken a dive after a series of scandals. The coronavirus pandemic increased the urgency of challenges at home.‘Back to Square One:’ Saudi Arabia’s Double Crisis Hits HomeDuring much of last year, Prince Mohammed took a step back from the public sphere and hunkered down on the Red Sea coast in Neom, one of his signature futuristic mega-projects. It was the finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, and King Salman -- Prince Mohammed’s father — who addressed the country, warning citizens of tough times.At Tuesday’s summit, King Salman was absent and Prince Mohammed was the star. The setting reflected the prince’s ambitions, highlighting his plan to turn Al Ula into a world tourism destination. After the meetings, he took Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad on a tour. They rode in a white Lexus with Prince Mohammed at the wheel.The image would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when the prince’s closest advisers regularly disparaged Qatar. Saudi Arabia and its allies have accused the wealthy Gulf state of interfering in their internal affairs, supporting extremism and using its influential media channels as propaganda weapons against neighbors, charges that Doha denies.Global CloutRegional dynamics were key in prompting the mending of ties, including Saudi Arabia’s desire to focus on Iran, said Hesham Alghannam, a political scientist and senior research fellow at the Gulf Research Center. Biden has said he’ll look to rejoin the nuclear deal with Iran that Trump abandoned, an outreach viewed with trepidation by Saudi Arabia that’s also provided added incentive for it to mend ties with Arab neighbors.“Saudi wants to be the referee of the disagreement between Gulf states, instead of being part of these conflicts,” Alghannam said.The output cut was another demonstration of the kingom’s regional and global clout. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, an older half-brother of the crown prince, said it showed Saudi Arabia leading the oil world and helping others suffering from lower oil prices, including Iraq.But even that move highlighted a change in Saudi Arabia’s oil policy under King Salman and Prince Mohammed. After decades of priding itself on putting oil above politics, the royal palace has become more interventionist, and its energy machinations more politicized.To that end, Prince Abdulaziz described the production cut as a “political, sovereign” step rather than a “technical” one. It will be costly, too. At current prices, it’ll cost the kingdom $3 billion a month in lost oil revenue, according to Bloomberg News calculations although the actual figure could end up smaller.But its global impact was immediate. Crude prices jumped to a 10-month high above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is allowing Russia to boost output, a first, and less than a year after their price war. It’s another sign that the kingdom isn’t looking for confrontation for now.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Saudi Prince Hits a New Year Reset by Making Allies Not Enemies

2021-01-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Nidec Corp., the world’s top supplier of motors for everything from hard drives to power plants, is betting it can make a key component for Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles cheaper and better than anyone else, possibly including its chief executive officer, Elon Musk.“I very much want to have a top-level discussion with Elon Musk,” Jun Seki, Nidec’s president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. Without an outside partner, Tesla won’t be able to achieve Musk’s goal of producing 20 million EVs a year by 2030, he said.It’s an audacious overture to a company that flirted with being the world’s most valuable last week, making Musk the richest man, but Nidec isn’t just any ordinary parts supplier.The manufacturer is a quiet behemoth in the global electric-motor industry. Although the vast majority of people who use the company’s products don’t know its name, Nidec’s motors are used in about 85% of the world’s hard drives and it controls almost half of the global market for brushless motors found in everything from air conditioners to factory robots. Nidec is Japan’s ninth-largest enterprise, with a market value of about $82 billion on Tuesday, after climbing 2%. The stock rose 73% last year.That’s made CEO Shigenobu Nagamori Japan’s fourth-wealthiest individual with a net worth of $10.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He poached Seki from Nissan Motor Co., where Seki had come up through engineering to becoming vice-COO, a year ago to embark on a bet-the-company pivot. The goal? Turning the manufacturer Nagamori founded in a shed in Kyoto 47 years ago into the world’s top supplier of motors for electric vehicles. Nagamori, 76, is backing the effort with a pledge to invest close to $10 billion over the next five years to grab a market share of 40% to 45%.With Japan, California and other major automobile markets mandating that all new car sales be electric over the next two decades, the global EV traction motor market is on track to reach about $29 billion by 2026, according to consultancy firm Shibuya Data Count. Up until now, much of the industry’s focus has been on building out the capacity to produce enough batteries, while improving technology to make them more efficient and expand the range of EVs.After batteries, traction motors are the most expensive component of an EV, meaning the segment is ripe for claiming if a company is able to mass-produce a disruptively cheap product. Combining the motor, gears and electronic components, traction motors are also used in electric trains; they must be able to withstand mechanical stress and cool efficiently because of the high power levels involved.“As we move forward with mass-production, costs will come down and it’ll be easier to win out against rivals,” said Seki, 59, who traveled abroad several times during the 2020 pandemic to secure deals with automakers, seeking to edge out Bosch Corp., ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Dana Inc. and other competitors.Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, is just one of the many carmakers in Nidec’s sights. The Japanese manufacturer has already reached agreements to provide EV motors to 22 automakers, including China’s Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and France’s Peugeot SA, according to Seki.Whether it’s a traditional auto manufacturer, or an electric-truck startup or Apple Inc., which is said to be planning a self-driving electric car, “any new company entering into the realm of electric vehicles is a chance for us,” Seki said. Through its joint venture with Peugeot, Nidec also has a “big opportunity” with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, as the automaker is set to merge with Peugeot, he added.Nidec’s pitch to automakers is its “E-Axle” system, which combines motors, gears and inverters into a single package. As EV makers seek smaller and more efficient powertrains, that will give an edge to manufacturers that are able to design high-precision durable gears and cool them effectively, all while keeping costs down.To secure the technologies and resources needed, Nidec is ready to spend as much as 1 trillion yen ($9.7 billion) on mergers and acquisitions, Seki said. He singled out gear and inverter manufacturing as two industries ripe for growth.If Nidec’s vision plays out, it will be able to offer Tesla and other EV makers a traction motor that’s less than $1,000 in under five years, down from the standard today which can run up to $2,000 or more. While batteries make up about a third of a typical EV’s cost, a basic motor makes up about 10%.Why Building an Electric Car Is So Expensive, For Now: QuickTakeNidec sees Europe and China as relatively quick adopters of EVs. As such, it has invested heavily in the latter over the past three years and is planning to inject some 200 billion yen into its European operations. The company is looking at Serbia as the top candidate for a new EV motor factory it’s looking to build in the region.For now, Seki is laying the groundwork to be able to meet a spike in demand that’s anticipated in the decade after 2025. Thanks to greater investment, battery costs are coming down, making EVs more affordable. At the same time, a number of governments including Japan and the U.K. have said they will ban the sale of new gasoline vehicles.By 2035, annual EV sales are projected to exceed 48 million units, up from roughly 2 million this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. To clinch a share of that, Seki is counting on adding Tesla as a customer. Although Nidec’s U.S. representatives have approached the EV maker, whose market capitalization now exceeds that of Toyota Motor Corp. and Japan’s six other major car manufacturers combined, no deals between the two have been announced.Despite its outsized valuation, Tesla made about 500,000 vehicles last year, or less than a 10th of what Toyota will produce. Tesla is believed to mainly design and manufacture its own traction motors for the Model S, X, Y and 3. With new factories being built in Texas and Germany to add to plants in California and China, Musk struck an optimistic tone in September that Tesla will hit his lofty goal.Seki said there are also a number of storied automakers that won’t consider diverging from in-house production of the important electrification technology. Nissan, for one, will equip future EV models with its own dual electric motor “E-4orce” system. General Motors Co. is also designing proprietary e-axle systems.While Nidec is a relative newcomer to the EV motor sector with much left to prove, the manufacturer is betting that its plunge into the technology can be modeled after its success in hard-drive motors, where it invested early and built production capacity to drive down costs.The company is regarded as a bellwether of manufacturing trends, picking up early on shifts such as the growth of factory automation. Today, Nidec produces more than 3 billion motors a year, and is betting that the automotive business will make up a growing portion of the 10 trillion yen in annual net sales that Nagamori aims to reach by fiscal 2030.The next move Nidec is considering after traction motors is to offer nearly complete EV platforms. There will be demand for such packages from new entrants in the sector that would prefer to focus on a vehicle’s interior and styling, Seki said.With the wave of electrification hitting the automotive industry “this kind of creative destruction is already happening,” he said.(Updates with shares in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The World’s Top Maker of Mini Motors Bets It Can Win Over Tesla
2021-01-12,"(Bloomberg) -- More than a year after its outbreak, the coronavirus keeps finding new ways to hit carmakers.After first wiping out auto demand, the virus is now hindering parts supply: chips used in vehicles are harder to come by because semiconductor manufacturers allocated more capacity to meet soaring demand from consumer-electronics makers such as Apple Inc.The shortage risks dragging on, with lockdowns and travel restrictions prompting housebound consumers to snap up more phones, game consoles, smart TVs and laptops to get online. Lower down in importance to chipmakers, auto manufacturers from Toyota Motor Corp. to Volkswagen AG risk not getting enough goods to fuel a fledgling recovery in their own industry.“Customers can’t build because they can’t get parts,” Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of car-component supplier Aptiv Plc, said in an interview. “We’ve avoided a situation where we’re shutting down customers, but we’ve been impacted.”Semiconductor shortages may persist throughout the first half as chipmakers adjust their operations, researcher IHS Market predicted on Dec. 23. Automakers will start to see component supply gradually ease in the next two to three months, China Passenger Car Association, which groups the country’s largest carmakers, said Monday.Chipmakers favor consumer-electronics customers because their orders are larger than those of automakers -- the annual smartphone market alone is more than 1 billion devices, compared with fewer than 100 million cars. Automaking is also a lower-margin business, leaving manufacturers unwilling to bid up chip prices as they avoid risking their profitability.And while the newest cars require more chips, so do the latest consumer gadgets. Smartphones using so-called 5G connectivity require 40% more semiconductors than older 4G versions. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported record fourth-quarter revenue last week, with new 5G iPhones taking up a large chunk of capacity.The auto-chip shortage stems from overly conservative demand estimates made early last year as car plants closed to cope with the onset of the pandemic, De Vos said. Once the plants re-opened, vehicle sales rebounded more strongly than anticipated after governments unleashed stimulus packages and commuters avoided public transport.At the same time, foundries such as TSMC, United Microelectronics Corp. and Globalfoundries Inc. as well as chip assemblers like ASE Technology Holding Co. weren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for consumer gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also in Xboxes and Playstations and even certain iPhones. The foundries are responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors and serve automotive-chip companies such as NXP Semiconductors NV, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp.The Trump administration’s move to blacklist China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December drove customers to seek alternatives and further constrained the global chip supply. Some semiconductor buyers have also been building up inventories to hedge against future shortages or disruptions.“It’ll take some time,” De Vos said, “but we’re climbing out of it.”Auto-chip companies cut orders with Taiwanese foundries significantly in the first half of 2020 and when they wanted the capacity back in the second half, the contract chipmakers had allocated it to others, a person familiar with the matter said.General Motors Co. has asked for the Taiwanese government’s help to secure chip supply, and Taiwanese officials have helped to relay the request to foundries including TSMC, according to the person. The European Union has also approached Taiwanese officials about the same issue, the person said.There’s no guarantee such requests will yield results -- smartphone and gadget customers contribute more to foundries’ revenue and profit and are willing to shell out more.“Consumer-electronics companies are ready to pay more for chips to ensure their gadgets will get to market on time,” said Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities. “Carmakers are less inclined to do so.”Meanwhile, it’s not simple to boost semiconductor supply. Chipmakers need to spend years and billions of dollars to build fabrication plants capable of cranking out silicon for a wide range of products. They tend to err on the side of conservative planning because of the risks involved -- and the enormous potential losses.At least one major automotive chip supplier is having a significant volume of its orders turned away by TSMC because of lack of capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are no signs of the situation getting easier for carmakers, the person said. A TSMC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company will discuss automotive chips at its investor conference on Thursday.Such setbacks have left some carmakers with no option but to cut production.Toyota said Tuesday it’s partially halting production in China while Honda Motor Co. is reducing output at five factories across North America as it becomes harder to procure chips.Toyota, the world’s No. 2 automaker, said the impacted lines were at its factory in Guangzhou, in China’s south. The suspension could result in a cut in January’s output of as much as 30% depending on how long it drags on, the Nikkei reported earlier Tuesday, without attribution. Toyota jointly operates the site with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. Toyota is additionally lowering output of a pickup made in Texas.Honda, which had to scale back output at its U.K. plant last week, said it will reduce manufacturing of the Accord, Civic and Insight sedans, as well as the Odyssey minivan and Acura RDX, a crossover sports-utility vehicle. The Japanese automaker is also reducing output by about 4,000 cars at a domestic factory, while Nissan Motor Co. is adjusting production of its Note hatchback.VW said last month it would have to change manufacturing plans. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is temporarily closing a Canadian plant and delaying the restart of output at a Mexican Jeep factory until the end of January.“The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions,” Ford Motor Co. said in an emailed statement. The carmaker is working to prioritize key vehicle lines, “making the most of our semiconductor allocation.” In North America, Ford is idling a SUV factory in KentuckyCarmakers’ predicament is exacerbated by the fact that chips are crucial for the latest features they are touting, be it assisted driving, large displays or connectivity. Semiconductor-based components are set to account for more than 50% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030, up from about 35% now, according to a report by China EV 100 and Roland Berger.“Chips are getting more important for the upcoming software-defined cars,” said Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “They are essential to all cars, not just electric ones.”(Updates with detail on Toyota, Honda cuts in 19th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories Worldwide
2021-01-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence, quantum computers and autonomous vehicles are among the fastest-growing areas of technology, with American companies often in the lead, according to a new study of U.S. patents issued over the past five years.International Business Machines Corp. received the most patents in machine learning and quantum computers, while Ford Motor Co. is the most active in areas of vehicle navigation and control systems, according to the analysis by Fairview Research’s IFI Claims Patent Services.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 352,013 patents last year, a 1% decrease that’s likely attributable to work-flow changes because of the coronavirus pandemic, said IFIClaims Chief Executive Mike Baycroft. IBM topped the list of patent recipients for the 28th year with 9,130 patents, while Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea was second with 6,415 new patents issued last year.Of the top-10 fastest growing fields, IBM also was No. 1 in areas of quantum computers, machine learning and computer systems using neural networks that imitate how the human brain works. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also ranked in the top five of those three areas.“We are focused on areas where we think it will keep IBM competitive in the future,” said Kathryn Guarini, chief operating officer of IBM Research. “We see cloud, AI and quantum as the trifecta of technologies for the IT industry.”The company, based in Armonk, New York, has integrated artificial intelligence into all areas of its business, she said. One of its new patents is for ways AI can understand conversational tones, such as when a person contacts customer service. It’s just one example that backs up a Brookings Institution report that AI is likely to transform white collar and higher paid jobs.“It’s never our intent to replace the human,” Guarini said. “Our hope and our intent is that it makes all of us more efficient and improves productivity.”Quantum computers, which use the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can’t handle, could create new ways for drug and agriculture companies to discover new compounds and financial service companies to improve encryption.With the classical computers, “we’ve made tremendous progress, making it more efficient and secure,” Guarini said. “But there has not been a revolution in how the technology works, for decades and decades. Quantum is on a whole new level.”Other fast-growing areas include display technology, with Samsung Display Co. in the lead; data transfer technology in computer design led by Intel Corp. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co., and plant and seed development led by Bayer AG’s Monsanto.In the two areas involving autonomous vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp. and LG Electronics Inc., were the next highest recipients behind Ford.The second-fastest growth area, albeit with a small number of overall patents, was in the area of electrical smoking devices with Philip Morris International Inc. as the top recipient over the past five years.“Patents are a significant mechanism for companies to develop intellectual property assets,” Baycroft said. “This is how you compete in the global market.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","IBM Leads in Quantum Computing, Ford in Driverless Car Patents"

2021-01-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Near-sighted planning, supply-chain complexities and a tradition of keeping inventories low caused the semiconductor shortage that is now forcing carmakers to idle production lines and straining their relationship with chip manufacturers.Seeds of the imbroglio were sown almost a year ago as the virus outbreak led to plunging car demand, prompting auto-chip companies to slash orders. But when they wanted to increase supply toward the end of 2020, they struggled to secure capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other contract chipmakers that were busy servicing a boom in demand for gadgets that help housebound consumers stay connected, according to people familiar with the situation.While publicly assuring the problem is solvable, in private the parties are pointing fingers. Chipmakers say car companies’ preference for low inventories hurt their planning, while auto and part manufacturers say the supply chain is thrown into disarray as semiconductor makers drag their feet. Automakers also contend chipmakers are prioritizing consumer electronics because those devices provide the bulk of their sales and profits. Chipmakers deny they are playing favorites. The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Volkswagen AG as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength is metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.“Even if the OEMs say they didn’t over-correct, they may not have been thinking far enough ahead,” said Tor Hough, founder of Elm Analytics, a supply-chain research firm based in the Detroit area, referring to automakers, or original equipment manufacturers in industry parlance. “They’re also very wedded to ‘lean manufacturing’ -- so keeping low inventory to be more cost efficient.”Autos vs. SmartphonesCarmakers don’t deal directly with TSMC and other contract chipmakers. Instead, they work with auto-part suppliers like Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG, which in turn deal with automotive-chip designers including NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG.While those two European chipmakers both make some parts in-house, they outsource a significant portion of production to TSMC and other foundries. It’s difficult for automotive-chip designers to get their orders prioritized by foundries because their volume is dwarfed by their consumer-electronics peers.Because of carmakers’ “just-in-time” manufacturing model, their suppliers worried about quick inventory buildups and canceled orders originally planned for foundries in the first half of 2020, the people said. At the same time, foundries began seeing a surge in demand for gadget chips after Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Chinese brands prepped an avalanche of 5G devices including the iPhone 12, which require as much as 40% more silicon content as 4G handsets.One contract chipmaker notified all its customers in the third quarter that it might be time for them to place more orders as it anticipated a rebound in demand, but automotive clients demurred and ended up being the last ones to seek more capacity, one of the people said.Appeal to GovernmentsTSMC’s automotive customers continued to decrease demand in the third quarter, and the chipmaker only began to see sudden recovery in automotive orders in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said in an earnings call earlier this month. By contrast, makers of consumer electronics and other hardware quickly built up chip inventories above the usual seasonal level, and are continuing to do so as they fret about potential future supply disruptions.The shortage has been exacerbated by a lack of capacity at assemblers including ASE Technology Holding Co., a person familiar with the matter said. Chip assemblers like ASE represent the critical final stage in finishing and preparing a chip for use, but the company’s production expansion has been hindered by an equipment supplier’s tardiness in delivering new gear, the person said. A further squeeze to the global supply was caused by the Trump administration blacklisting China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December.Once European and U.S. carmakers realized they had a problem, they appealed to officials in Taiwan, home to TSMC and other leading foundries including United Microelectronics Corp., for assistance in stabilizing their chip supply.The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents major U.S. car companies, sought out the Taiwanese government for help, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition, General Motors Co. spoke to Taiwanese officials, and got them to help relay its request to TSMC, Bloomberg News has reported. The European Union has approached Taipei about the same issue, and Volkswagen has separately reached out as well, according to a person familiar with the matter.“We have requested that the U.S. government help us find a solution to the problem because it will diminish our production and have a negative impact on the U.S. economy until it’s resolved,” Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in an interview.Scaling Back OutputBecause chip production requires a lead time of about three months, the impact will last throughout the first half and could bleed into the third quarter, Blunt said. His organization is working with the Biden administration on the issue, he said.Ford, Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., VW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- now a part of Stellantis NV -- are among global carmakers that have scaled back output due to a lack of chips required for a wide range of components, from brakes to windshield wipers.With vehicles adding entertainment and autonomous-driving features, the amount of chips required is increasing and the supply chain becoming more complex. A car from a premium brand can require more than 3,000 chips, and even if just one is missing, the vehicle won’t get completed.“There are more chips, more varieties of chips. It’s not one batch of chips that went bad and they’re struggling with recovering that one chip,” said Hough at Elm Analytics. “The ecosystem upstream of the OEMs stopped purchasing the chips they used in production as the manufacturing went down.”Another bottleneck lies with smaller automotive-chip designers which supply critical chips to the whole industry and depend entirely on foundries. They often lack bargaining power to secure timely production because of their modest sizes.While automotive supply-chain managers are adept at containing short-term crises like the explosion in the northern Chinese port of Tianjin in 2015, they tend to be slower in making bigger changes that would help them deal with potential long-term disruptions, Elm Analytics’ Hough said.Foundry Spending SurgeBosch, the German car-parts maker, said its chips supply has been significantly diminished because a chipmaker’s expansion and production increases were delayed by the pandemic. In an emailed statement, Bosch said it is in daily contact with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact.The shortage may start to ease as TSMC boosts its spending to a staggering $28 billion for 2021, with the foundry pledging this month that automotive chips will be a priority. The company has begun to offer more capacity in recent days to at least one automotive chip designer, although the volume still isn’t enough to satisfy demand, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.The situation isn’t as devastating as last spring’s car-plant shutdown that spanned the globe, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler.“This will be more sporadic, a plant here or a plant there, for a shorter period of time, as opposed to a full industry shutdown,” Huber said. “This will not have anywhere near the impact of the production losses we saw last year.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",A Year of Poor Planning Led to Carmakers’ Massive Chip Shortage
2021-01-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers in Japan, where almost 30% of the population is 65 or older, are taking the lead on adapting cars so the nation’s legions of elderly drivers can feel more confident -- and be safer -- behind the wheel.A run of accidents involving older people behind the wheel has upped the pressure from regulators to standardize advanced features. Automatic brakes will be required for all new vehicles sold domestically from this year, for example, and companies from Toyota Motor Corp. to Nissan Motor Co. are employing smart technology to make cars more user friendly for older people.It’s also becoming more of a priority as public railways in rural areas disappear, worsening an isolation crisis made only more stark by the coronavirus pandemic. Without any means of getting around, elderly people in Japan are increasingly confined to their homes, their lives shrinking as transport options evaporate.A recent high-profile fatal accident spotlighted the issue. In February last year, Japanese prosecutors indicted 89-year-old Kozo Iizuka on a charge of negligence resulting in death and injury after a crash in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro district. The former senior bureaucrat was on his way to a French restaurant with his wife in April 2019 when his Toyota Prius plowed through a crossing, killing a toddler and her mother and harming several others.The accident made headlines, not least because of Iizuka’s high-ranking government position. Public sentiment swiftly turned against Iizuka, who is back in court this week after pleading not guilty in October. The incident also sparked a national debate about the swelling ranks of elderly drivers on Japan’s roads. After the event, the number of old people opting to park their wheels for good soared. According to the National Police Agency, 350,428 people 75 or over returned their driver’s licenses in 2019, the highest on record.“Young people tell us seniors to return our driver’s licenses, but they aren’t around,” says Hideaki Fukushima, 90, whose wife returned her own license around the time of the accident. The couple’s children live in Nagoya, a two-hour drive away. In Takamori where they live, a small town in Japan’s central mountainous area, trains operated by Central Japan Railway Co. only come about once an hour. “There’s nothing you can do without a car,” Fukushima says.Last year, Toyota upgraded its Safety Sense offering. The technology is designed to prevent or mitigate frontal collisions as well as keep drivers within their lane. By using high-resolution cameras on the windscreen and bumper-mounted radars, it can detect oncoming cars or pedestrians — or even bicycles in daylight hours — and give audible and visual alerts. If drivers fail to respond, automatic braking may be deployed. The new software also has intersection functionality to help detect oncoming obstacles if a car is making a turn from a stationary position.Other Toyota Safety Sense features include the correction of unintentional lane departures, automatic toggling between high and low-beam at night depending on surrounding traffic, and the detection of slower-moving cars ahead on a highway and automatic maintenance of a pre-set distance. Road-sign assistance technology detects stop and speed signs as they’re passed and displays a dashboard alert in case drivers have missed them themselves.“A society in which the elderly can drive safely is crucial for their active social participation and healthier, fuller lives,” Toyota said. “Our ultimate goal is, of course, to have zero casualties from traffic accidents.”Subaru Corp.’s aspirations are similar; it wants to eliminate all fatal accidents by 2030. Like several other automakers, it’s using stereo cameras, which have two or more lenses with a separate image sensor for each, providing the ability to capture three-dimensional images. Dubbed EyeSight, the technology looks ahead and alerts drivers to any danger. Subaru says Eyesight-equipped vehicles are involved in 61% fewer accidents and 85% fewer rear-end crashes. Pedestrian-related injuries are lowered by 35%.“It would be impossible to eradicate all fatal accidents without utilizing artificial intelligence,” says Subaru’s Eiji Shibata, who oversees the development of EyeSight. To reach its ambitious target, Subaru plans to combine its stereo cameras with AI, assigning meaning to each object and trying to accurately infer risk.That’s not without its challenges, according to Shibata. “It’s a technologically tough area,” he says. Stereo cameras are harder to install in mass produced cars, partly because they convey more information than other sensors and require more complicated back-end support. “Equipping the technology in cars that people ordinarily use is a huge task.”An upgraded EyeSight X that uses autonomous technology debuted in August in the second generation of the Subaru Levorg. The model, which went on sale in Japan in November, has 360-degree sensing and like Toyota’s upgraded tech, has an intersection assist function that can autonomously steer cars away from an impending collision. Using EyeSight X, vehicles can even change lanes on their own and slow down for toll booths.Nissan has a similar offering called ProPilot that it expects to have in at least 20 models in 20 markets globally by the end of 2023.Takuya Matsunaga, who lost his wife and child in the 2019 accident, admits it’s a good start but adds that dealers, when selling cars, should stress these technologies aren’t failsafe. “Anyone can cause an accident,” he says.Matsunaga has become a member of Aino Kai, a support group for bereaved families from traffic collisions. Aino Kai also plays a lobbying role, urging government officials to expand public transport networks in regional centers.“I don’t want to see divisions like the young and the elderly hating each other,” Matsunaga says. “We need to think about the people who are suffering: the elderly in rural areas.”(Updates with fresh headline.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Car Crashes in World’s Oldest Nation Spur Changes by Automakers

2021-01-22,"For a while last year it was fun to trade Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock indirectly using Nio (NYSE:NIO). They often moved in lock-step which made it a cheap way of trading Tesla. Nio is a rising star in the fleet of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers who are trying to topple internal combustion engines (ICE), the transportation method of choice since the commercialization of cars. Though we’ve had EVs since the 1880’s, they failed to gain popularity until now. Tesla’s mind-boggling ramp on Wall Street is proof that EVs are here to stay. Source: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com Nio stock being up 1,078% in a year is testament that this EV is a legitimate contender to own. This is not an overnight success and it will take decades to unfold. There is a lot of runway for the supplier of e-cars and trucks to produce many winners. Hundreds will fail but Nio will make it. And therein lies today’s conclusion, which is to own it for the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla is out of the woods for good and well on its way to becoming a giant. Nio is not far behind, especially since they could be getting the helping hands of their government. Part of my thesis is to avoid the pre-revenue entrants into the EV space. Much of the supply will likely come from the current giant auto manufacturers, Tesla and Nio. If the 80 million machines the world produces are going to become electric, it’s the legacy ICE suppliers that are switching types. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day The likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (XETRA:VOW.DE) will flip their production efforts to whatever the market demands. Most of the new-comers will fail or remain niche companies. Tesla has Elon Musk, Nio has the Chinese resources and they both have strong momentum already. Most of the rest are missing these key ingredients. Nio Stock Is a Viable Vehicle to Bet on EV Revolution Source: Charts by TradingView Fundamentally Nio stock is not cheap. They earn a lot but they pretty much blow it all away. This alone is not a reason to cut the stock loose because growth companies should not be profitable. Imagine if Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) pinched pennies, say, six years ago. We would not have had “the cloud” come to life. Doing great things requires spending a lot. Investors in Nio will need a strong stomach. The critics will be loud and I was one not too long ago. I stopped fighting the tide a while back unless trading specific short-term chart patterns. The thesis behind the concept of electric cars is just too broad to kill this early. It’s got momentum and that will play into the hands of NIO investors. Starting new positions into speculative stocks is scary on any given day. Doing so while markets are at all-time highs makes that task even scarier. If a new investor needs to own it today I’d make that a starter position. Taking a full bite the first time is reckless. Taking ownership in tranches leaves room to manage the risk during bad stints. There will be dips and those would be better opportunities to buy Nio stock. For example, there is proven support anywhere above $42 per share. If for whatever reason the stock falls close to that I’d pounce. Closer to the current price Nio also has supports at $55 and $51 per share. These will come into play for faster traders. Momentum investors would probably want to chase the breakout above $60 per share. If that happens it could develop enough tailwind to set new highs again. I favor using options especially when investors are eager to own the shares. Instead of buying Nio stock outright, I’d sell puts. This would get me long today and leave a huge room for error. For example, instead of risking $5,800 to own 100 shares now, I sell the Nio August $39 put. For this almost $600 goes into my account today because I commit to buying Nio stock at $39 between now and mid-August. This is a win/win situation because if Nio falls below my strike I get to buy it for 32% cheaper than it is now. If the price doesn’t fall then I would have generated the equivalent of a 10% rally from now.

2021-01-25,"(Bloomberg) -- As China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.Taiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.Taiwan’s role in the world economy largely existed below the radar, until it came to recent prominence as the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S. and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.The auto industry’s pleas illustrate how TSMC’s chip-making skills have handed Taiwan political and economic leverage in a world where technology is being enlisted in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China -- a standoff unlikely to ease under the administration of Joe Biden.Taiwan’s grip on the semiconductor business -- despite being under constant threat of invasion by Beijing -- also represents a choke point in the global supply chain that’s giving new urgency to plans from Tokyo to Washington and Beijing to increase self-reliance.By dominating the U.S.-developed model of outsourcing chip manufacture, Taiwan “is potentially the most critical single point of failure in the entire semiconductor value chain,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the technology and geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. The Trump administration exploited that pinch point to deny Beijing access to technology. By banning access to all U.S. chip technology including design, it was able to cut off the supply of semiconductors from TSMC and other foundries to Huawei Technologies, hobbling the advance of China’s biggest tech company.It also negotiated with TSMC to establish a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a $10 billion facility in Austin, Texas.The “CHIPS for America Act” introduced to Congress last year aims to encourage more plants to be established in the U.S. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, plans to reintroduce the bipartisan bill this year with a view to securing $25 billion in federal funds and tax incentives. McCaul said in a statement he’s working with colleagues in the House and Senate “to prioritize getting the remaining provisions of CHIPS signed into law as quickly as possible.”News that Intel Corp., the onetime industry leader, was considering outsourcing production of some chips to TSMC under its former CEO underscored the need for a U.S. player that can fabricate at the leading edge, said a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee staff who is not authorized to speak publicly.The European Union aims to bolster the bloc’s “technological sovereignty” through an alliance armed initially with as much as 30 billion euros ($36 billion) of public-private investment to raise Europe’s share of the global chip market to 20% (without a target date) from less than 10% now.It’s also encouraging Taiwan to increase investments in the 27-nation bloc, with some success. GlobalWafers Co. -- based in TSMC’s hometown of Hsinchu -- just boosted its offer for Germany’s Siltronic AG to value the company at 4.4 billion euros, an acquisition that would create the world’s largest silicon wafer maker by revenue.That’s not to say Taiwan is the only player in the semiconductor supply chain. The U.S. still holds dominant positions, notably in chip design and electronic software tools; ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands has a monopoly on the machines needed to fabricate the best chips; Japan is a key supplier of equipment, chemicals and wafers.But as the emphasis shifts to ever smaller, more powerful chips that require less energy, TSMC is increasingly in a field of its own. And it’s helped Taiwan form a comprehensive ecosystem around it: ASE Technology Holding is the world’s top chip assembler, while MediaTek has become the largest smartphone chipset vendor.Tokyo, too, is attempting to attract TSMC to set up in Japan. With 110 billion yen ($1 billion) earmarked last year for R&D investment and another 90 billion yen for 2021, some of that may go to a TSMC facility, which reports have said the company is considering setting up in Japan.“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”China, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.But with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.Taiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.Fellow analyst Linda Kuo said the Taiwanese government was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018 and had announced plans for some $500 million to help the industry become more aware of cyber security issues.The greater worry is that TSMC’s chip factories could become collateral damage if China were to make good on threats to invade Taiwan if it moves toward independence.TSMC's capital spending of as much as $28 billion for this year suggests it's going to stay out in front.“Taiwan is the center of gravity of Chinese security policy,” said Mathieu Duchatel, director of the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne in Paris. Yet while Taiwan’s status in the global chip supply chain is a “huge strategic value,” it’s also a powerful reason for Beijing to stay away, said Duchatel, who’s just published a policy paper on China’s push for semiconductors.Assuming Taiwanese forces were to be overwhelmed during an invasion, “there is no reason why they would leave these facilities intact,” he said. And preserving the world’s most advanced fabs “is in the interests of everyone.”For all the moves to reel back domestic chip fabrication, it’s optimistic to think the supply chain for such a complex product as semiconductors could change in short order, Peter Wennink, ASML chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV. “If you want to reallocate semiconductor build capacity, manufacturing capacity, you have to think in years,” he said.In the meantime, geopolitics means chip shortages could become a more regular occurrence, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.“This is going to move on to the point where actually because of export controls, because of governmental intervention, there will be all of a sudden supply chain disruptions not just because of capacity problems,” he told Bloomberg Television. “So better get prepared.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for Semiconductors

2021-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. plans on selling more bonds in 2021 after announcing its first issuance in more than a year.The pace of issuance will keep up with maturities, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. Last year’s hiatus, the first since the 2008 financial crisis, had to do with the low amounts of debt coming due, Goto said, without commenting further.SoftBank has about 817 billion yen ($7.9 billion) of bonds maturing by Dec. 31 and roughly another 872 billion yen the following year. The company has so far revealed plans to sell about 100 billion yen of hybrid notes, compared to 1 trillion yen it raised in domestic bonds market in 2019. The sale will be priced this month.Masayoshi Son’s conglomerate is one of Japan’s biggest borrowers with a debt load second only to Toyota Motor Corp., excluding financial institutions. SoftBank’s creditworthiness came under scrutiny in March, when Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the company two notches after Son announced plans to buy back as much as 2 trillion yen of its own stock in response to a pandemic-driven market rout. In a rare public spat between a Japanese blue-chip company and one of the leading authorities on corporate debt, SoftBank accused the firm of “bias” and asked Moody’s to withdraw the rating.The conflict with Moody’s has had no impact on the company’s ability to raise debt so far, nor is it likely in the future, Goto said. While Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings have junk ratings on SoftBank Group, Japan Credit Rating Agency has an A- investment-grade score. S&P on Tuesday revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative on expectations that management will prioritize “financial soundness,” while keeping the rating unchanged.“Given Moody’s own publicly stated rating criteria, it was a judgment lacking in rationality and fairness,” Goto said in the correspondence with Bloomberg. SoftBank is “continuing to strongly demand a withdrawal of this unsolicited rating,” Goto added.Moody’s reiterated in an e-mailed statement that its coverage of SoftBank is in line with established policies.Read more: SoftBank Clashes Again With Moody’s Over Credit RatingFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Group Plans a Bond Market Comeback After a Rare Pause

2021-01-28,"Japan's Toyota Motor Corp overtook Germany's Volkswagen in vehicle sales last year, regaining pole position as the world's top selling automaker for the first time in five years as the pandemic demand slump hit its German rival harder.  Toyota said on Thursday its group-wide global sales fell 11.3% to 9.528 million vehicles in 2020.  Automakers have suffered as coronavirus lockdowns have stopped people from visiting car showrooms and forced manufacturing plants to reduce or halt production.",Toyota beats Volkswagen to become World's No.1 car seller in 2020
2021-01-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. overtook Volkswagen AG in 2020 to become the world’s top-selling automaker, the first time the Japanese group has clinched the position in five years.Toyota’s group sales, which include those of its subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co. and Hino Motors Ltd., for the year were 9.53 million units, the company said Thursday. That compares with VW’s 9.31 million, announced earlier this month.The victory for Toyota came despite a painful year for automakers. Although demand for cars recovered marginally toward the end of 2020, industry-wide factory and showroom shutdowns in the spring were enough to drag sales down 14% from 2019, according to an estimate from IHS Markit.It was also a topsy-turvy year in which the gravity of automakers’ losses was largely determined by their level of exposure to the regions most disrupted by the virus.VW has a strong footprint in the European Union, where passenger car sales fell an “unprecedented” 24% to fewer than 10 million units in 2020, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The German carmaker’s sales fell 15%, its worst performance in close to a decade.VW Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess initiated a strategic shift after he took over the top job in 2018 to focus on lifting profitability rather than chasing sales growth. VW’s return on sales has been lagging behind Toyota for years and the market slump triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic a year ago exposed the German manufacturer’s relatively high costs.Toyota, on the other hand, has a bigger presence in the U.S., where total car sales in the nation fell 15% in 2020. The Japanese automaker’s global sales were down 11%. Although the U.S. has the most Covid deaths and cases, there haven’t been the same lockdowns as in Europe.“Naturally the number of units sold was lower than in the previous year because of the spread of coronavirus,” Toyota spokeswoman Chisato Yoshifuji said Thursday. “But because Toyota and its partners were able to thoroughly implement measures to combat the spread of the virus, we were able to continue our corporate activities and keep yearly declines at the level they were,” she said.Prior to 2020, VW outsold Toyota in every year since 2015. But the two companies’ results last year may be indicative of a longer-term trend, according to analysts.While VW is expected to temporarily surpass Toyota again in 2021, Toyota is projected to pull ahead each year through 2025, IHS Markit said. VW’s push to produce more electrified vehicles should lead to a sales spike this year, but prolonged lockdowns and shop closures in its domestic market will continue to have an adverse impact, analyst Yoshiaki Kawano said.Kawano said Toyota will continue to enjoy strong sales in its core markets of Japan and the U.S. In China, the world’s largest car market, it should “put up a good fight” by pushing out more EVs and SUVs in line with local demand, he said.Although a number of factors such as the continued spread of the virus and a global chip shortage will persist in 2021, IHS Markit estimates auto sales will recover steadily to 84.4 million units from 76.8 million in 2020. Global car sales are expected to touch 94.8 million in 2025.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Volkswagen Loses Title of World’s Top-Selling Carmaker to Toyota

2021-01-29,"QuantumScape (NASDAQ:QS) may sit smack dab in the ultra-hot electric vehicle sector. Even though that shouldn’t turn QS stock into a lightning rod, that is exactly what happened this month. Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com On Jan. 22, Thornton Law Firm announced it had filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of QS investors who bought the stock between Nov. 27 and Dec. 31, 2020, citing misleading statements made by senior executives to investors regarding its solid-state battery technology. If only that were the single, solitary legal action out there. Bernstein Liebhard LLP is also suing QuantumScape, as well as the Klein Law Firm, all the firms making essentially the same allegations over the exact same time period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The shot across the bow that started it all? A Jan. 4 article in Seeking Alpha, where Brian Morin laid out a case in painstaking scientific detail for why making a solid-state battery “is hard — very, very hard. So hard, in fact, that nobody has done it.” 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times Now I did go back and forth on the company that funded QuantumScape through a reverse merger, Kensington Capital Corp. Still, Kensington’s Form 425, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of QuantumScape going public, set off my Spidey Sense. I said so in early November: “When I peruse an SEC filing with as many charts and hyperbolic language as this one, I immediately get suspicious. Yes, the document serves as a sales pitch of sorts to brief key investors in Kensington Capital stock. But think about that. If I brief such purse-string holders on my progress — let’s suppose I’m selling shares of Lou here — I’m not going to go deep into the pitfalls and significant challenges.” If I was right, and all these lawyers prevail, those who own QS stock face some frightening propositions. Like: Will anything the lead plaintiffs get from a successful suit make up for what they stand to lose in the meantime? Or: If the charges turn out to be unfounded, do they still point to red flags investors can no longer ignore? Worst of all: What are the chances the company could go down in flames? What Could Sink QS Stock Investors will have until March 8 to join the Thortnon suit, which lobs some pretty serious charges against QuantumScape. It alleges that the company violated federal securities laws, specifically through two actions that, if true, will rattle even the staunchest supporters of QS stock. Thornton contends first that QuantumScape executives “significantly overstated” success related to its solid-state battery power, battery life and energy density. The suit also maintains that “QuantumScape is unlikely to be able to scale its technology to the multi-layer cell necessary to power electric vehicles.” QuantumScape has claimed its products will increase energy density by 88 percent when compared to lithium-ion batteries and deliver a fast charge of 15 minutes to reach 80% capacity. That appears consistent with what other solid-state battery projects hope to achieve. Morin himself praised the company’s science as “very good.” But no matter how one slices, dices, spins or reads it, the class action suits are damning stuff. The contentions don’t have to be true to give QuantumScape a black eye. And, as an observer, I take no delight in that whatsoever. The company claims Bill Gates, the Megalith of Miscrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as a high-profile backer. And if things skew in the right direction, QS stock will catch a sub-sector updraft. Solid-state battery tech is getting a heavy workout at two of Japan’s biggest automakers. But therein also lies a 15-megawatt problem. If automakers can figure out the solid-state battery puzzle on their own, do they really need an outside company to supply the goods? Assessing the State of Solid State Insofar as Toyota (NYSE TM) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) are concerned, in-house solid-state will do just fine, thanks. Both companies have the Japanese government backing them on their respective projects and Toyota could unveil a solid-state EV prototype this year if all goes well. They want this, bad: Toyota does not currently offer a battery-powered vehicle in the United States. Sure, QuantumScape has an automotive partner, but it’s Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), the eco-deceptive company that brought the world Dieselgate and even bragged back in 2010 that its Golf TDI concept car ran on “Clean Diesel.” As of June, the Volkswagen emissions scandal cost VW $33.3 billion in fines, penalties, financial settlements and buyback costs. That’s equivalent to three-quarters of what Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) is worth. (Its market capitalization is $45 billion.) For QuantumScape, it’s a very strange and questionable choice of dance partners, if you ask me. Now the German automaker is working with a battery company under a legal cloud. It all raises a hypothetical, hyperbolic question that perhaps is worth asking anyway: Is VW-QuantumScape a case of like attracts like? Regardless, I think the good people who’ve put their money behind QS stock deserve some answers. A Quantum Escape Before It’s Too Late This is the part of the Lou Stock Market Show where I usually dive into the numbers and talk about analyst projections and the like.

This investment isn’t any better than putting one’s money into disreputable EV maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), which hasn’t made a working anything either.

They worked just fine at fooling the investor types who watched the film and assumed a good ol’ engine powered that there jalopy. At least Nikola is trying to move on with its unethical founder gone.

2021-01-29,"FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL), which is a top developer of hydrogen-fuel systems, has been one of Wall Street’s darlings lately. Since late October, FCEL stock has surged from $2 to $23. Its market capitalization is now $7.4 billion. Source: Kaca Skokanova/Shutterstock Of course, the overall fuel-cell sector has been on fire. Just look at other players in the space like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) and Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE). Wall Street thinks that the fuel-cell market will be big enough for multiple large companies. So last week, we got the latest details on FuelCell’s performance, as the company reported its fourth-quarter results. Its earnings were actually mixed. While its revenue shot up 54% year-over-year to $17 million, its sales were up only about 17% for all of 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips That’s an indication of the choppiness of its business, which relies on large contracts. The company’s backlog fell 2.5% last year to $1.29 billion. FuelCell also continues to post substantial losses. For 2020, it was $89 million in the red. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The company has certainly aggressively expanded its infrastructure. Here are a few of its Q4 highlights: It completed a 2.8 megawatt (MW) biogas power platform in Tulare, California. FuelCell has nearly finished a 8.8 MW power platform for the U.S. Navy in Groton, Connecticut and a wastewater treatment facility in San Bernardino, California. The firm started building a 24.5 MW project in Yaphank, New York and Derby, Connecticut. The project includes a system for Toyota (NYSE:TM). In the meantime, the company has been working hard to raise capital. It has received several grants from the U.S. Department of Energy. FuelCell also raised $156.3 million with a new secondary offering of its shares. Industry Transformation The long-term outlook of hydrogen and other forms of alternative energy does appear to be robust. Alternative energy is getting more powerful and cost-effective. Of course, it’s also cleaner. Hydrogen is particularly clean when it’s produced with electricity generated by solar and/or wind energy. Such hydrogen is also renewable. The Biden administration is certainly positive for the sector. Already it has rejoined the Paris Agreement in an effort to fight climate change. That move will provided a boost to the hydrogen industry. According to FuelCell CEO Jason Few: “Based on the initial policy objectives outlined by the incoming White House administration, we expect clean energy and climate policies in the U.S. to begin to match the pace of advancement seen in other markets such as Europe and Asia, and to be favorable toward development of the growing hydrogen economy.” However, I think investors should temper their expectations. The fact is that the Biden administration’s main priority is the Covid-19 pandemic and dealing with it will involve a great deal of time and substantial resources. The Democrats also only have the thinnest possible majority in the Senate. As a result, it could be tough for them to muster support for multiple ambitious programs. Besides, in light of the nation’s huge budget deficits and debt, the government may not have enough resources for many such initiatives anyway. The Bottom Line on FCEL Stock FuelCell Energy will certainly be a beneficiary of the new energy revolution. But the valuation of its stock is a very real concern. As a result, many Wall Street analysts are generally bearish on FCEL stock. Take a look, for example, at JP Morgan’s Paul Coster. In a recent report, he downgraded FCEL stock to the equivalent of a “sell” rating, even though he increased his revenue and earnings projections for the company. And he has a $10 price target on the name, so he anticipates a drop of more than 50% from the shares’ current level. Note that no analyst has a “buy” rating on FCEL stock. As for analysts’ average price target on the shares, it is $13.60. Of course, Wall Street analysts are far from perfect. But then again, their average outlook on FuelCell is quite negative. And with the shares trading at 67 times the company’s trailing revenue, it will really be tough for the stock to maintain its strong momentum.

2021-02-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Speculation that Apple Inc. is seeking a partner to develop its own electric vehicle swept through South Korea and Japan, where shares of major car companies climbed on reports of discussions with the maker of the iPhone.Kia Motors Corp. is talking to potential partners about a plan to assemble an Apple-designed car, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Separately, the Nikkei newspaper said Apple was in discussions with at least six automakers. Conjecture around Apple’s secretive project to design and sell its own car re-emerged in December after a hiatus of several years, with Kia’s part-owner Hyundai Motor Co. mentioned as a potential partner.The key question is how serious Apple is about taking on Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle makers, and whether it has determined it will need a established manufacturer to be able to roll out its own product. The Cupertino, California-based company is said to have a small team of engineers developing drive systems, as well as designers, but with development work at an early stage, any roll out probably won’t happen for another five years.Read more: Apple Self-Driving Electric Car Is at Least Half a Decade AwayTatsuo Yoshida, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that Japanese automakers are usually too busy with their own development, manufacturing, sales and customer service to take on a task like working with Apple. However, Nissan Motor Co. or Mitsubishi Motors Corp. “don’t have much work, and are somewhat idle, so they might sign up,” he said.When asked if they were approached, Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. said they couldn’t comment, the Nikkei said. Mitsubishi Motors said it was not contacted and Nissan declined to comment, according to the report. Subaru Corp.’s chief financial officer said on an earnings call that he hadn’t heard anything about an Apple car.Kia shares rose 1.5% in Seoul, adding to gains from earlier this week on a local media report that Apple would invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) as part of a collaboration with the automaker on making EVs. In December, Hyundai backed away from a statement that said it was in talks with Apple.Read more: How Apple Can Tackle $230 Billion Luxury Car Market: Alex WebbThe Journal reported a deal between Apple and Kia will involve a multibillion-dollar investment, with assembly to take place in the state of Georgia. This week, CNBC reported that Apple is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to build an autonomous EV at Kia’s U.S. plant. No agreement has been reached, but they are tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, the news channel said.A representative for Kia declined to comment.Hyundai has developed a new EV-dedicated platform, and plans to build 23 EVs, beginning with the Ioniq 5 in March in Europe, followed by a Kia model later this year. EVs made on the platform will be able to charge up to 80% capacity in 18 minutes and add as much as 100 kilometers (62 miles) of driving range in just five. They’ll have a top range of 500 kilometers on a single charge.

2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Aurora Innovation Inc., a Silicon Valley-based autonomous-driving startup with at least a $10 billion valuation, has agreed to a long-term strategic partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. and its supplier Denso Corp. that aims to mass produce autonomous vehicles and launch them on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s, over the next few years. The first model that will be equipped with the Aurora Driver, the company’s hardware, software and sensor suite, is the Toyota Sienna minivan, with testing of an initial fleet to begin this year. Toyota, which overtook Volkswagen AG as the world’s top-selling automaker in 2020, is also an investor in Uber Technologies Inc. and has a formidable brand that has long been associated with high volume manufacturing and safety. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Toyota will gain an observer seat on Aurora’s board. “This is a really exciting set of developments,” said Sterling Anderson, Aurora’s Chief Product Officer, in an interview. The company is a key player in the intensely competitive self-driving vehicle industry. “We’re partnering with the largest automaker and the largest ride hailing network. It’s not just the development of the vehicle, but development of the service.”Aurora is one of several leading startups racing to commercialize its self-driving technology, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, which was later renamed Waymo, Amazon.com Inc.-owned Zoox Inc. and General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC. Toyota, which has long preferred to develop new technology in-house, has been coy about its autonomous ambitions. The Japanese carmaker struck a similar agreement with Chinese driverless startup Pony.ai Inc. in 2019, which it firmed up last year with a $400 million investment.“Toyota is dedicated to creating and realizing mobility for all by focusing on technology that will move people safely and responsibly, a vision Aurora shares with us,” Keiji Yamamoto, operating officer of Toyota and President of Connected Company, said in a statement. Aurora is testing on public roads in California, Pennsylvania and Texas, with an initial focus on completing long-haul, commercial trips. The company’s three co-founders have a deep history in the self-driving industry. Chief Executive Officer Chris Urmson previously led the autonomous team at Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, which was later renamed Waymo. Anderson directed Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot efforts, and Chief Technology Officer Drew Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, was part of the 2015 academic exodus that formed Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group.The startup has struck several deals in recent months. In December, it acquired Uber Technologies Inc.’s autonomous division. The merger boosted Aurora’s employee count to about 1,600, including hundreds who are based in Pittsburgh, an epicenter of robotics thanks to the talent pipeline at Carnegie Mellon University. Aurora also entered into a strategic partnership with Paccar Inc., the maker of light, medium and heavy-duty trucks, last month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Aurora Partners With Toyota in Bid to Bring Autonomy to Masses

2021-02-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is closing in on an agreement to make electric vehicles in India for the first time, opening up a new growth opportunity after setting up production in China.Tesla has picked Karnataka, a southern state whose capital is Bangalore, for its first plant, the state’s chief minister said over the weekend. The automaker has been negotiating with local officials for six months and is actively considering car assembly in the suburbs of Bangalore, people familiar with the matter said.Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment and did not confirm the minister’s statement.The company is conducting due diligence for office real estate in the region and plans to set up an R&D facility, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Tesla has focused on Bangalore because it’s shaping up to be a hub for electric vehicles and aerospace manufacturing talent, they said. Tesla has incorporated its Indian unit and registered offices in downtown Bangalore.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk all but confirmed Tesla would enter India in January after months of speculation. The world’s richest man on Jan. 13 tweeted “as promised” in response to a report on a Tesla-focused blog that the automaker was in talks with several Indian states to open an office, showrooms, a research and development center -- and possibly a factory.That revelation sparked euphoria from locals, such as Nikhil Chaudhary, a 20-year-old student at the University of Delhi who helped start India’s Tesla fan club in 2019.Despite the hype, Tesla’s foray into India may well prove challenging. The country hasn’t yet rolled out the welcome mat for EVs like neighbor China, where Tesla set up its first factory outside of the U.S. and now dominates sales of premium EVs.EVs account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, according to BloombergNEF, compared to less than 1% in India.“Considering the price of a Tesla, Elon Musk probably won’t be able to sell an EV to most of the population in emerging economies,” said Pedro Pacheco, a Munich-based senior research director at Gartner Inc. “However, looking at the size of the population and the potential for economic growth, Tesla will probably target a fast-growing group of affluent individuals that, in absolute terms, compares quite favorably to what we see in many developed countries.”Charging SpotsPalo Alto, California-based Tesla may also use any Indian factory as an export base, leveraging several markets at the same time, Pacheco said.The expensive cost of a Tesla is viewed as a sticking point by other market watchers, too. Mumbai-based Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt, noted that the “size of the luxury car market in India is minuscule with brands like BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar Land Rover accounting for just 30,000 to 50,000 sales annually.”Read more: Jaguar Going All-Electric Marks New CEO’s Turnaround PlanAnd despite India’s broader potential, charging infrastructure remains another impediment to large-scale EV adoption.According to the International Energy Agency, around 60% of the world’s public slow- and fast-charging spots are in China. As Chinese carmakers roll out competitive EV models and develop a diverse ecosystem, the country is “heading toward disrupting the current global auto industry landscape,” UBS Group AG analysts wrote in a report last month.India has been making similar moves, but not yet on the same scale.In 2015, it launched a Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) plan, with a 9 billion rupee ($123 million) commitment to subsidies that cover everything from electric tricycles to buses, according to the IEA. A second generation of the FAME program introduced in 2019 was larger, with 100 billion rupees to encourage EV purchases and build out charging infrastructure.India also cut the goods and services tax on EVs to 5% from 12%, effective August 2019, much lower than the levies of as much as 28% slapped on other motor vehicles, which have attracted criticism from companies like Toyota Motor Corp.Read more: India Has 150 Million Drivers and Only 8,000 Want Electric Cars(Updates with analyst comment in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Tesla to Start Making Cars in India, Targeting Vast Market"

To prevent the collapse of their networks, suppliers from North Dakota to Texas are instituting rolling power cuts for the second consecutive day. The deep freeze is forecast to remain until Wednesday at least.Occidental Petroleum Corp., the second-largest oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, told buyers it would be forced to curtail oil deliveries due to complications from the historic freeze in the region.Officials have reported two people dead, likely from cold, according to the Associated Press. Medical centers are rushing to administer vaccines before they go bad. Flights are grounded. More than 2 million barrels a day of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of gas production are shut and massive refineries have halted gasoline and diesel output.The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed national banks and federal savings associations to close offices affected by emergency weather. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Texas, making more resources available to help.Read More: How Extreme Cold Turned Into a U.S. Energy Crisis: QuickTakeAll time stamps are EST.Austin Utility Warns Residents of Prolonged Blackouts (2:45 p.m.)The municipal utility in the Texas capital of Austin warned residents that power outages may persist into Wednesday.Although the state’s grid operator “says conditions are improving, we want customers to know this a dynamic situation,” Austin Energy said in a tweet. “Customers should be prepared to not have power through Tuesday night and possibly longer.”Occidental Declares Force Majeure as Cold Shuts in Permian Oil (2:19 p.m.)Occidental said that weather disrupted transportation facilities and forced delays in the receipt and delivery oil by carriers, according to a force majeure notice to customers seen by Bloomberg. Occidental also expects curtailments of shipments downstream because of limited deliveries into Midland, Houston and Corpus Christi in Texas.The force majeure is the first to surface among the oil giants of Texas’s Permian Basin and underscores the deepening crisis across America’s energy complex as a result of an unprecedented cold blast that began Thursday. More than two million barrels oil production a day has been halted due to well freeze-ups, icy roads and power losses.U.S. Energy Regulators to Open Inquiry Into Grid’s Performance (2:19 p.m.)The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation will open a joint inquiry into operations of the bulk-power system during the current winter weather conditions in the Midwest and South, FERC said in a statement.“In the days ahead, FERC and NERC will formally begin the inquiry, which will work with other federal agencies, states, regional entities and utilities to identify problems with the performance of the bulk-power system and, where appropriate, solutions for addressing those issues”Cargill ‘Voluntarily’ Cutting Energy Usage (1:42 pm.)Cargill Inc., the world’s largest crop commodities trader, said it’s “voluntarily” cutting its energy use “to help states get through this cold snap,” according to a statement.The company said it’s working with suppliers and customers to minimize disruptions but declined provide details on which businesses are reducing energy usage.Texas Governor Asks LNG Exporter to Limit Gas Intake (1:11 p.m.)The Texas governor’s office has asked the Freeport liquefied natural gas export terminal to dial back operations in accordance with the state’s disaster declaration amid a polar blast.To minimize gas and power consumption, Freeport will shut down LNG production units 2 and 3, which will result in unplanned flaring, the company said Tuesday in a regulatory filing.Arctic cold in the central U.S. has left almost 5 million customers without electricity and has wreaked havoc on the gas and power markets. Gas production has tumbled to a three-year low as the frigid weather triggers blackouts and causes liquids to freeze inside pipes, forcing wells and processing plants to shut.LNG exports climbed to a record late last year as more terminals began sending an abundance of U.S. shale gas to customers overseas. But the current deep freeze is likely to call LNG’s role in the energy market into question amid concern that exports are contributing to a shortage of gas for consumers during extreme cold.Texas Electricity Supplies Keep Falling (12:13 p.m.)Texas’s power supply declined further Tuesday morning even as the state’s grid operator said it hoped to start restoring electricity to some homes.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s main grid, supplied less than 44 gigawatts of power as of 11:53 a.m. on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from 47 gigawatts earlier in the day, and less than at the same time on Monday.Power Plants Shut Down After Instruments Froze, Ercot Says (11:00 a.m.)Frozen instruments at natural gas, coal and even nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas, are the main reasons behind the blackouts in Texas, according to Dan Woodfin, a senior director for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s power grid.One of the reasons power is coming back slower than expected Tuesday is “natural gas pressure,” he said. While some wind turbines in West Texas shut down, that’s been the least significant factor in the blackouts, said Woodfin. Strong winds helped boost output from the turbines that remained in service, offsetting some of the losses.Texas lost about 30,000 to 35,000 megawatts of generating capacity in recent days as bitter cold swept across the region, he said. On Tuesday morning, the grid was unable to meet about 18,500 megawatts of demand. A megawatt is enough to power about 200 homes.Ford, GM and Toyota Plants Lose Shifts (10:18 a.m)Several automakers, including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Co., were forced to idle production at U.S. plants in the center of the country as a winter weather pattern caused power outages and other disruptions.GM canceled the first shift Tuesday at its factory in Arlington, Texas, after shutting down Monday due to rolling blackouts and workers having difficulty getting to the facility in the snowstorm. The automaker has not made a decision yet on whether it will operate a second shift, a spokesman said.Blizzard Cuts U.S. Oil Output by Over 2 Million Barrels a Day (10:06 a.m.)U.S. oil production has plunged by more than 2 million barrels a day as the coldest weather in 30 years brings havoc to key producing states that rarely have to deal with frigid Arctic blasts.Oil traders and company executives, who asked not to be identified, lifted their forecasts for supply losses from an earlier estimate on Monday of 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels. They said the losses were particularly large in the Permian Basin, the most prolific U.S. oil region, which straddles West Texas and southeast New Mexico. Output cuts were also significant in the Eagle Ford, in southern Texas, and the Anadarko basin in Oklahoma.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Permian Giant Occidental Curbs Oil Deliveries: Energy Update

2021-02-18,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser, Brian Deese, has sought the Taiwanese government’s help resolving a global semiconductor shortage that’s idling U.S. car manufacturing plants, according to a letter reviewed by Bloomberg News.In the letter, Deese thanked Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, Wang Mei-hua, for her personal engagement on the microchips shortage and relayed concerns from U.S. automotive companies.Deese’s letter shows that top White House officials have become involved in trying to resolve the shortage, which has presented an early challenge to Biden’s administration. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are both personally engaged in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies’ supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.The spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private. Wang told reporters Thursday that she hasn’t received a letter from Deese and reiterated that Taiwan’s chipmakers are trying to resolve the supply constraints.The administration is engaging with international partners and allies to encourage them to take steps to address the shortage, but all sides recognize it’s not a short-term crisis, the White House spokesperson said. More will have to be done to prevent similar shortages in the future, the spokesperson added.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeTaiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views the island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson said.‘Reasonable’ AsksThe formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S.“We think those are reasonable things for the government to ask,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). “This is going to be a problem for the first half of the year.”Administration officials in the State and Commerce departments have previously sought meetings with Taiwanese government and industry officials to press them to ramp up the supply of semiconductors.Thousands of American autoworkers could face cuts to their hours and wages as plants halt production while awaiting new shipments of automotive-grade semiconductors from Taiwan and South Korea -- chips that won’t even be manufactured for three to four months. Companies have provided the White House with the job impact data, people familiar with the matter said.That prospect threatens to undermine Biden’s efforts to energize a sputtering economic recovery, hitting hardest in political battleground Michigan, as well as Texas and Kentucky.IHS Markit estimated this week that nearly 1 million fewer light vehicles will be produced in the first quarter of 2021 because of the semiconductor shortage. The projection was a revision of an earlier estimate of 672,000 fewer cars coming off production lines in the first quarter that was issued by the group on Jan. 29.The chip shortage first hit the auto industry in December, coinciding with a tumultuous transition of power, an impeachment trial, the ongoing pandemic and the urgent push for an economic stimulus. By the time Biden was sworn in, former President Donald Trump’s administration had only made preliminary efforts to fix the problem.Senior Biden administration officials have identified semiconductors as one of the strategic areas for domestic investment to compete with China and ensure the U.S. is no longer dependent on other countries. Biden plans to sign an executive order in the coming weeks to demand a review of supply chains, though no imminent action is expected to result from it.Taiwan DependenceLeaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy of Taiwan, which is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly due to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.Taiwan’s role in the global economy was largely below the radar before the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.But there’s a question about how effective cooperation can be in a time when every allied country wants to move away from its dependence on China and build their own capacity at home.U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.Exacerbating the U.S. shortages, power failures caused by brutally cold weather in Texas have shuttered semiconductor plants clustered around Austin.NXP Semiconductor NV, one of the largest makers of chips used by auto companies, has idled two plants in the Austin area, the company said early Wednesday. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second largest semiconductor maker, also closed down production at its Austin site, the South Korean company said. Infineon Technologies AG, another large supplier of chips to the automotive industry, said its Austin plant has been shut down because the power was turned off.(Updates with comment from Taiwan minister in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Biden Team Pressing Taiwan, Allies on Auto Chip Shortfall"

2021-02-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is in discussions with multiple suppliers of self-driving car sensors known as lidar, according to people familiar with the matter, a key milestone toward development of its first passenger vehicle.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is in active talks with a number of potential suppliers for these laser-based sensors that allow a car’s computer to “see” its surroundings, said the people, who asked not to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions. The company has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system.As it’s done with the iPhone, Apple is looking to outside vendors to supply critical hardware for a planned autonomous vehicle, the people said. The ongoing discussions are a sign that Apple has yet to settle on a preferred supplier for lidar and that it’s likely mulling a range of options, including a heavily customized version of the sensors, as it moves toward developing a car design. That’s an indication that a finished product is still several years away.An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Read more: With Robotaxis Still a Distant Dream, Lidar Makes Itself UsefulAt least a half-dozen lidar companies have gone public via reverse merger in recent months -- raising hundreds of millions of dollars by seizing on investor appetite for a bet on future demand for high-tech cars. The laser sensor technology is used by many top-tier players hoping to commercialize driverless vehicles, including Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and General Motors Co.’s Cruise division.Shares of lidar makers jumped on Bloomberg’s report. Luminar Technologies Inc. rose as much as 8.9% to $35.75, reversing earlier declines. Velodyne Lidar Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% to $21.89. Apple shares rose 0.8% to $130.71 at 11:03 a.m. New York time.Benjamin Lyon, a key Apple manager who oversaw work on self-driving car hardware, left the company earlier this week for a space and satellite startup. It’s unclear what impact that may have on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.Off-the-ShelfApple has been testing its robotaxi technology on public roads in California since 2017. The first version of its test cars, modified Lexus SUVs, used a lidar stack made up of off-the-shelf parts, though this has become a more bespoke effort recently.The company explained in a white paper issued in 2019 how its sensory perception technology is supposed to work. “The sensing component is able to determine where the vehicle is located in the world and can identify and track surrounding objects, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists,” Apple said at the time. “This is accomplished using a combination of sensors, including lidar, radar, and cameras, and provides high-resolution 360-degree 3D coverage around the vehicle.”Reuters reported in 2019 that Apple was talking to lidar makers, but the autonomous vehicle project was fully rebooted afterward. Apple is now in discussions for next-generation lidar that will be considered cutting edge four to five years from now -- another indicator of the company’s timeline, said people familiar with the discussions.Cars aren’t Apple’s only foray into lidar: The company launched an iPad Pro embedded with the laser sensor tech last March, and it expanded the feature to the iPhone 12 Pro line last fall. The technology enhances low-light photography and augmented reality applications in the consumer devices; using it to detect driving conditions and obstacles in the road is a more complicated feat.Five-Year TimelineThe iPhone maker has a team of car interior, body, drivetrain and battery experts working toward eventually launching a car. Inside the company, staff believe that such a launch is at least five years away, Bloomberg News has reported.Apple’s self-driving car system has improved from a few years ago, but is still lagging the competition. Last year, Apple test cars drove more than 18,800 miles in California with a human driver having to take control every 145 miles. That compares to Waymo, which drove 628,839 miles and needed a human driver to take over every 30,000 or so miles, and Cruise, which drove 770,000 total miles with a disengagement every 28,520 miles.Even as Apple seeks suppliers, it also is in talks about potential manufacturing and other outsourcing partnership deals with several different automakers. It has discussed car manufacturing options with Hyundai group sister companies Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp., but those discussions paused several weeks ago. The two carmakers recently said they are not in talks with Apple.Read more: Who Will Build the Apple Car?

2021-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group will develop an electric vehicle with Fisker Inc., part of the manufacturer’s efforts to boost its automotive capabilities at a time when technology companies including its main customer, Apple Inc., are looking to expand in vehicles.The car will be built by Foxconn, targeted at multiple markets including North America, Europe, China and India, and sold under the Fisker brand, according to a joint statement from the companies Wednesday. Production is set to start in the fourth quarter of 2023.Fisker is looking to break new ground with its second planned model. The startup plans to make a vehicle that doesn’t fit into an existing segment, like a sedan or SUV. Its partnership with Foxconn, a Taiwanese smartphone maker which is new to the auto business, is pinned on hopes that the collaboration will bring innovative manufacturing.“The auto industry is very stale,” company founder Henrik Fisker said in an interview. “We still talk about adopting the Toyota manufacturing system,” referring to a production and logistics concept that was developed decades ago.Fisker plans to design and market the vehicle while Foxconn will supply the skateboard chassis and manage supply chain and assembly. That’s asking a lot of a company that has never built cars in large volume before.“I have full confidence that they can do this and maybe have ideas that are outside the box,” Fisker said.Shares of Fisker rose 39% to a record of $22.58 at the close in New York. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the main listed arm of Foxconn, advanced as much as 5% in Taipei.Foxconn in October introduced its first-ever EV chassis and a software platform aimed at helping automakers bring models to the market faster. This month, Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu said two light vehicles based on the Foxconn platform will be unveiled in the fourth quarter. Foxconn is also planning to help launch an electric bus around the same time.The Taiwanese company is expected to build more than 250,000 vehicles annually for the Fisker partnership, according to the statement. Foxconn may choose to make some of those cars in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said. Following Wednesday’s memorandum of understanding, the two sides said they will enter a formal agreement in the second quarter of 2021.Fisker is the second battery-powered car venture founded by its namesake founder, a longtime auto designer. Its debut model, the Ocean electric SUV, is scheduled to start production in late 2022. Henrik Fisker’s first venture, Fisker Automotive, filed for bankruptcy in 2013.The model built by Foxconn will be an all-new type of vehicle, Fisker said. He wouldn’t classify it as a sedan or an SUV. Its design will defy segmentation the way the Volkswagen AG did with the Beetle and BMW AG did with the all-new Mini that came out in 2001, he said.Fisker got the idea of the planned vehicle when he was reading about Apple’s plans for a car. He said he began sketching what he thought a tech company would build if one went into the car business.“It will be like nothing you’ve seen before,” Fisker said.Foxconn is the second major manufacturer Fisker has announced a partnership with since reaching a deal to go public last year. In October, the EV startup said Magna International Inc. would help it build the Ocean SUV.In January, Foxconn signed a manufacturing deal with embattled Chinese electric-vehicle startup Byton Ltd. with the aim to start mass production of the Byton M-Byte by the first quarter of 2022. A week later, Foxconn and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. announced they were joining forces to provide production and consulting services to global automotive enterprises.Amid reports of Apple’s car project gaining momentum, Foxconn has bulked up its automotive capabilities that could make it a major contender to make cars for its largest customer.With development work still at an early stage, Apple will take at least half a decade to launch an autonomous electric vehicle, people with knowledge of the efforts have told Bloomberg News. That suggests the company is in no hurry to decide on potential auto-industry partners.(Updates with Hon Hai shares in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Partner Foxconn to Form EV Partnership With Fisker

2021-03-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son has come to dominate Silicon Valley. Now his company is increasingly dominating Japan’s markets, with SoftBank Group Corp. rising to become the largest-weighted stock on the country’s Topix index.SoftBank pulled ahead of Toyota Motor Corp. in pole position on the benchmark gauge last week, and sat as the highest weighting, albeit by a fraction, as of market close on Wednesday. That’s ended an almost 13-year streak for the automaker as the largest stock on the index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The change is further evidence of SoftBank’s own winning run. While Toyota trades little changed in 2021, SoftBank stock is up over 30%, rallying past a two-decade record to a new high, backed by a surging stock market which has lifted the value of its portfolio companies.Masayoshi Son Just Pushed SoftBank Shares Past Dot-Com PeakToyota, meanwhile, has been impacted by production outages due to earthquakes in Japan and freezing temperatures in the U.S., concerns over the global semiconductor shortage, and fears it’s losing out in the red-hot electric vehicle market.“It’s good news for the Japanese equity market, which has traditionally been dominated by manufacturers that have very low valuation,” said Mitsushige Akino, a senior executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. “If Toyota continued to remain the top weight, then there’s limit to how high the index can go. It’s a historic turning point.”Shares of SoftBank rose 2.1% on Wednesday, beating a 0.5% gain in the Topix gauge and a 0.6% advance in Toyota’s stock.Changing TimesAnother reason for SoftBank’s dominance is the makeup of the Topix. The index is weighted by market value, where Toyota still dominates. But that value is adjusted by a “free-float weight ratio,” based on the number of shares actually available to be traded in the market. The opaque measurement ignores stock that’s locked up by major shareholders, treasury stock or cross-shareholdings held by units or firms with business dealings.A recent review in January trimmed Toyota’s ratio to 50% from more than 55%, with Keiichi Ito, chief quants analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., noting that Toyota is impacted by its vast series of cross-shareholdings. SoftBank has a ratio of 60%.SoftBank’s dominance in Japan’s markets is becoming more pronounced. It’s the second-largest weighting on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after Fast Retailing Co., as well as the second most valuable company in the country by market value.“Changing times demand different companies,” said Ito.With Toyota having lost its crown as the world’s most valuable automaker to Tesla Inc. last summer, it may soon discover that SoftBank also outranks it in Japan too. While SoftBank’s market value trails Toyota’s 25.9 trillion yen valuation by around 4 trillion yen, that gap has narrowed by more than two-thirds in the past year.(Adds Akino’s comment in the fifth paragraph, updates prices throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Takes Top Spot on Topix From Toyota as Clout Grows

2021-03-11,"Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM) President Akio Toyoda cautioned Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) of its ambitious auto venture. He said that just the technology would not suffice, and there’s more to the business of selling cars, Bloomberg reports. “Anyone can make a car if they have the technical ability, but, once they make a car, I hope they’ll recognize they have to steel themselves for 40 years of responding to customers and to various changes,” Mr. Toyoda said at a Thursday news conference, the Wall Street Journal reported. Although Apple might take at least five years to launch its planned autonomous EV, the company continues to impact the car industry as it approached a bevy of automakers for a vehicle partnership. Apple’s foray into the car market has triggered fear among some legacy automakers over the company’s disruptive nature, leading to backtracking by Hyundai Motor Co (OTC: HYMTF) and others. Other automakers, including Toyota and Volkswagen AG (OTC: VLKAF), also remained aloof. However, Volkswagen dispelled concerns over Apple’s overnight takeover of the auto industry akin to the tech industry. Toyoda added that customers should be prepared to assume responsibility for the entire vehicle life cycle from maintenance to eventual scrapping. He previously credited his company for experience in manufacturing over 100 million cars, something that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) lacked and did not subscribe to the products manufactured by Elon Musk-led company when the latter overtook as the most valuable automaker in 2020. Apple could opt for contract manufacturing for the EV akin to iPhone production as it could not strike a deal with other automakers.

2021-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Renesas Electronics Corp.’s top executive warned that a global shortage of auto semiconductors may persist into the second half, joining other industry leaders in bracing for a chip crunch to snarl production of cars and gadgets well past the summer.Industry giants from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits thanks to unprecedented Covid-era demand for everything from cars to game consoles and smartphones. Renesas is running its most critical plants at full capacity to try and sate demand but there was no way of telling when the market might balance out, Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata told Bloomberg News.“Supply will remain tight through the first half of the year,” Shibata said this week. “And the way things look now, the situation will continue into the second half. But it’s anyone’s guess.”Chipmakers like Renesas and its partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are at the forefront of a global effort to plug a shortfall in supply of chips, the building blocks of a plethora of consumer products. Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning and are expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone.Some analysts say shortages could get mostly ironed out in coming months. But the concern is that tight supply in certain segments -- such as in more mature semiconductors where it takes time to build capacity -- could eventually throttle the broader consumer electronics industry and jack up prices if it persists. Semiconductors are now near the top of official agendas from Washington to Brussels.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeRenesas, which vies with NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG to supply automakers, is a prime barometer for the sector. It gets about half its revenue from car chips and counts all the major automakers among its clients, including Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. It also outsources some production of more advanced chips to TSMC, the world’s largest contract manufacturer.The company’s 200-millimeter wafer line on the southern island of Kyushu is operating near full capacity while its 300-millimeter fab in Naka, north of Tokyo, is in “overdrive.” For every 40-nanometer microcontroller it makes at the Naka fab, it orders six from TSMC, a proportion that hasn’t changed with the shortage, Shibata said.Both plants make chips used in automotive and industrial applications and are a better representation of the tightening supply than the 60% overall factory utilization Renesas reported last month. The Kyushu line makes mid- to low-end microcontrollers while the fab in Naka also makes 40-nanometer microcontrollers and system-on-chip devices, and 90-nanometer analog chips for car applications.“Nothing can be done about those,” Shibata said. “They are running at the limit of their capacity.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSubaru, Honda and Nissan may suffer output losses due to chip shortages while Toyota looks set to experience less impact, leading to performance differences between Japanese carmakers in coming months. Mitsubishi Electric and Renesas may see little impact but supply of chips from foundries including TSMC could struggle.- Tatsuo Yoshida and Masahiro Wakasugi, analystsClick here for the research.It’s not yet clear whether Renesas will emerge as a beneficiary of the supply crunch, but one broader benefit is a deeper appreciation of the importance of the tiny devices to the global economy, Shibata said. That recognition is long overdue, he said.“Cars are increasingly turning into electronic devices and it’s breaking the traditional supply chain models,” Shibata said. “That much has been made clear. Now that everyone has noticed, maybe we can have a constructive conversation about this.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Carmakers’ Chip Shortages May Last into Late 2021, Renesas Says"

2021-03-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. warned it’s grappling with the fallout from a “serious imbalance” in semiconductors globally, becoming the largest tech giant to voice concerns about chip shortages spreading beyond the automaking industry.Samsung, one of the world’s largest makers of chips and consumer electronics, expects the crunch to pose a problem to its business next quarter, co-Chief Executive Officer Koh Dong-jin said during an annual shareholders meeting in Seoul. The company is also considering skipping the introduction of a new Galaxy Note -- one of its best-selling models -- this year, though Koh said that was geared toward streamlining its lineup.Industry giants from Continental AG to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Innolux Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than-anticipated deficits thanks to unprecedented Covid-era demand for everything from cars to game consoles and mobile devices. Volkswagen AG said this week it’s lost production of about 100,000 cars worldwide. In North America, the silicon shortage and extreme weather have combined to snarl more production at Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. The fear is the crunch, which first hit automakers hard, may now disrupt the much larger electronics industry.“There’s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,” said Koh, who oversees the company’s IT and mobile divisions. “Despite the difficult environment, our business leaders are meeting partners overseas to solve these problems. It’s hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100%.”Read more: Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and ConsolesSamsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, is working with overseas partners to resolve the imbalance and avert potential setbacks to its business, its co-CEO said. Its shares slid 0.6% in Seoul on Wednesday, while suppliers and Asian chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix Inc. also fell.Chipmakers like Samsung and TSMC are at the forefront of a global effort to plug a shortfall in supply of semiconductors, the building blocks of a plethora of consumer gadgets. The deficit has closed auto plants around the world and now threatens supply of other products. While the Korean company is the leading maker of made-to-order silicon after TSMC, it relies on external suppliers and manufacturers for certain parts like power management and radio chips.Larger-than-anticipated Covid-era demand for smartphones has also stretched stores of Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon chips, the go-to processors for mobile devices. Qualcomm designs the chips, known as app processors, but relies on Samsung and TSMC to produce them and the Taiwanese chipmaker’s capacity has been strained.“The tightened supply of Qualcomm AP chips produced by TSMC is affecting everybody except Apple,” said MS Hwang, analyst at Samsung Securities. “PCs will soon be hit due to the short supply of display driver ICs, and the profitability of TV will be affected by soaring LCD panel prices.”The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeCompounding matters, Samsung’s own production got sideswiped last month. Its fab in Austin, Texas -- which makes chips both for internal and external consumption -- was sidelined in February by statewide power outages and hasn’t resumed full production. The resulting shortfall in production of Qualcomm 5G radio frequency chips could reduce global smartphone output by 5% in the second quarter, research firm Trendforce estimates. But the outage there is likely to affect Samsung’s mid-tier phones and laptops more than its top-of-the-range models or server chips, said Greg Roh, a senior vice president at HMC Securities.“If Samsung is publicly talking about future products, you know that the silicon crunch is serious,” said Avi Greengart, analyst and founder of consultancy Techsponential.Carmakers got hit first by the chip crunch in part because of poor inventory planning and are expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. Honda Motor Co. on Wednesday said it will temporarily suspend some production next week at a majority of U.S. and Canada plants, underscoring the deepening crisis.Some analysts say shortages could get mostly ironed out in coming months. But the concern is that tight supply in certain segments -- such as in more mature semiconductors where it takes time to build capacity -- could eventually throttle the broader consumer electronics industry and jack up prices if it persists. Semiconductors are now near the top of official agendas from Washington to Brussels.At the same time, China’s insatiable appetite for chips -- fueled in part by its rapid recovery from the pandemic -- and inventory stockpiling by local companies is fueling demand. Sales for the country’s chip industry climbed 18% to 891.1 billion yuan ($137 billion) in 2020, China Semiconductor Industry Association Chairman Zhou Zixue told a conference in Shanghai Wednesday.“The IC shortage will be a problem to frustrate the supply chain in next six months,” said Charles Shum, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.See, Carmakers, the Chip Shortage Isn’t Personal: Tim CulpanOn Tuesday, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. -- the assembler of most of the world’s iPhones -- joined a chorus of industry executives stressing it’ll take time to resolve imbalances in demand and supply.“We see a shortage, we feel it. But the impact for most of our customers is not that big,” Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu told reporters in Taipei. “For certain customers that have better than expected orders, then there’s some impact. For major customers that plan well, where there’s no big surge on orders, those customers are doing fine.”Koh said Samsung may decide not to introduce its Galaxy Note during 2021’s second half, breaking a years-long streak of annual launches for the marquee line. The Note series contributed roughly 5% of Samsung’s smartphone shipments over the past two years, IDC estimates, but accounts for a more significant chunk of revenue because it’s one of the priciest in the lineup.“Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” he said. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release Note model in 2H. The timing of Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.”(Updates with analysts’ comments and details on cutbacks from the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Samsung Warns of Severe Chip Crunch While Delaying Key Phone
2021-03-17,"Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC) would suspend production at some plants in the U.S. and Canada next week due to supply chain problems triggered by the pandemic, chip shortage, and severe winter weather, Bloomberg reports. The automaker would stop work at plants in Marysville, East Liberty in Ohio, Indiana, Alabama, and Ontario, possibly for a week without disclosing the volume impact. Honda manufactured 1.45 million vehicles in North America last year, down 20% year-on-year. The Japanese company had 12 manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada. A lower supply of petrochemical products impacted Toyota Motor Corp’s (NYSE: TM) U.S. and Mexico production due to the cold winter leading to the temporary halt of some lines, shifts, and potentially entire plants for several days in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Mexico. Both Honda and Toyota already scaled back output earlier this year due to the global chip crisis. Morgan Stanley Securities expected the crisis to reduce Honda’s output by 300,000 units while offering some immunity to Toyota based on its self-reliance. “In some way, all of our auto plants in the U.S. and Canada will be impacted, with most of the plants temporarily suspending production during the week of March 22. Since this is a fluid situation that requires flexibility, the timing and length of production adjustments could change.

2021-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- The indictment of a 21-year-old Swiss hacker who claimed credit for exposing the flaws in a surveillance camera company’s system is likely to stir debate about whether attacks by activists for social or political causes are criminal behavior.Tillie Kottmann, who uses they/them pronouns, was indicted Thursday in Seattle and charged with crimes including wire fraud and identity theft. Kottmann made headlines last week when they claimed credit for gaining access to the 150,000 security cameras sold by San Mateo, California-based Verkada Inc. While the charges don’t involve the Verkada incident, Kottmann previously said they hacked Nissan Motor Co., and leaked documents from chipmaker Intel Corp.Kottmann, in a previous interview, said their hacking is inspired by an anti-intellectual property and anti-capitalist world view. For decades, underground hackers have pushed the limits of the law under the banner of “hacktivism,” pursuing a variety of leftist and anti-authoritarian ideals. In some cases, the U.S. government has been overly aggressive in their prosecution of those hackers, said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who has extensively researched hacker culture.“The hammer went down on hackers so heavily from the ’80s to the present, so the hacker community has this in mind,” Coleman said, adding she expects Kottmann to garner even more support in hacker circles following the indictment.Coleman said the Verkada break-in may be viewed differently than the hacks included in the indictment because Kottmann spoke to a journalist to publicly expose the video cameras’ flaws.“Some people would see that they did something in the public interest, and some of the escapades from prior were sort of useful hacking escapades,” Coleman said. “A lot of security researchers working for big name companies can identify with that, because their past was also about exploring these systems, and messing around, and sometimes messing up, as well.”Prosecutors in Seattle, however, sharply rebuked the view that the hacks had any redeeming quality.“Stealing credentials and data, and publishing source code and proprietary and sensitive information on the web is not protected speech -- it is theft and fraud,” Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman said in a statement announcing Kottmann’s indictment. “Wrapping oneself in an allegedly altruistic motive does not remove the criminal stench from such intrusion, theft, and fraud.”The U.S. accused Kottmann of hacking dozens of companies and government agencies, and said Kottmann operated a website, called “git.rip,” that published the internal documents and source code of more than 100 entities. The named victims include the state of Washington and the Washington Department of Transportation, as well as a microchip processor or manufacturer and a maker of tactical equipment.According to an archive of the “git.rip,” website, it included leaks from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Toyota Motor Corp., Adobe Inc., General Electric Co., GitHub and more. The site now displays a message stating it has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Scott Nawrocki, a 21-year FBI veteran who investigated cybercases, said the charges against Kottmann are serious whatever the motivations.“These kinds of individuals have to be held responsible,” said Nawrocki, now managing director of digital investigations and cyber defense at investigations firm Nardello & Co.. “Regardless of ideology, this is not white-hat hacking,” describing those who report computer bugs to companies so they can be fixed. “This is potentially inviting others to conduct hacking operations. To me, that’s criminal activity.”Nawrocki said there probably would be efforts to extradite Kottmann, and the indictment could limit Kottmann’s travel outside Switzerland because U.S. allies would arrest them.Swiss lawyer Roman Kost said it’s unlikely Kottmann will be sent to face criminal charges in the U.S., citing Swiss law that allows its citizens not to be extradited without their consent, but they may be punished inside Switzerland.Swiss hackers “can be tried in Switzerland if there is sufficient suspicion and evidence, and if they are found guilty, they can be punished,” Kost said in an email.Prosecutors allege that Kottmann sold hacking inspired merchandise, and that they sought contact from journalists in order to promote their data leaks and themselves. Kottman’s T-shirts included the phrases: “venture anticapitalist,” “no gender, only crime,” and “I would never do cybercrime.”Kottmann, citing the advice of their lawyer, declined to comment on the indictment. Swiss lawyer Marcel Bosonnet confirmed he represents Kottmann, but declined to comment further. The Justice Department also declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Swiss Hacker’s Indictment Spotlights Ethics of Activist Attacks
2021-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Renesas Electronics Corp., one of the biggest makers of automotive chips, said a fire halted production at one of its Japanese plants. The incident may exacerbate a shortage of semiconductors that has already curbed vehicle output across the industry.The company said it’s still trying to ascertain the amount of damage in the clean room of its N3 building in Hitachinaka, Ibaraki Prefecture. There were no casualties. Clean rooms are designed to keep impurities from contaminating semiconductors, so fire damage has the potential to severely disable production.“While there was no damage to the building, we confirmed damages to some of the utility equipment,” the company said in a statement. “We have been unable to confirm the safety of the clean room, which is the site of the fire, we have been unable to enter the clean room and determine the cause of the fire.”The accident is another blow to automakers that have already had to slow production and are missing out on billions of dollars in sales due to a shortage of chips. Renesas makes a variety of chips used in vehicles including sensors, components that manage power and batteries and parts that power dashboard displays.Renesas has production facilities at six sites in Japan. The N3 building is home to 300 mm wafer production, which would make it one of the company’s more advanced lines. In 2019, Renesas was the third-largest maker of automotive silicon. Toyota Motor Corp. is one of its biggest customers, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.The company, which gets almost half of its revenue from the automotive market, did not specify which products are made in the building.After cutting orders and forecasts last year in the pandemic, carmakers have struggled to secure enough electronic components to meet a rebound in orders.The collapse of the Texas power grid this year made the situation worse. NXP Semiconductor NV, the largest maker of automotive chips, idle two plants in the state. Samsung Electronics Co., the second-largest semiconductor maker, paused production at its Austin site and Infineon Technologies AG, another large supplier of chips to the auto industry, said shut a facility there.While those plants are up and running again, semiconductors go through a three-month fabrication process which is vulnerable to disruption and cannot be easily restarted.On Friday, Infineon said it will take until June to return to per-shutdown production levels in Austin and that it won’t be able to recover lost production due to “tight market conditions” and a “fully loaded” facility.(Updates with more details from statement in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Automotive Chipmaker Renesas Says Fire Halts Production
2021-03-19,"China’s autonomous driving start-up, Momenta, secured $500 million from SAIC Motor, Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), and auto parts supplier Bosch for an undisclosed valuation. The company has crossed over $700 million in total funding, marking an important step towards the firm’s international expansion, Reuters reports. Other investors in the funding round include Daimler AG (OTC: DMLRY) (OTC: DDAIF), Temasek, Yunfeng Capital, and Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: TCEHY). Momenta reportedly exceeded $1 billion in valuation in two years. Momenta’s Chinese rivals Pony.ai amassed over $1 billion within five years, and WeRide.ai raised over $500 million by capturing investments from big automakers. Pony.ai raked $5.3 billion in its November fundraising round. The former Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) executive, Cao Xudong-led firm, tested autonomous cars in Beijing and Suzhou and owned a research center in Germany’s Stuttgart. Momenta worked with automakers to develop mass-production vehicles with self-driving functions to gather real-time data for fully autonomous driving technologies for future products. Momenta aimed reduction of billions of dollars in expenditure by crowdsourcing data from auto partners. Momenta expected all of its vehicles to go driverless in 2024 by which it expects to significantly reduced labor costs and accomplish a positive operating margin per vehicle. Multiple customers are expected to commence mass-producing mid-to-high-end cars equipped with Momenta’s software by 2021 end. Momenta’s solutions could be powering millions of vehicles by 2024 or 2025. Toyota last year partnered with Momenta to develop a high definition (HD) mapping platform in China for autonomous driving vehicles.

2021-03-19,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are down nearly 25% since the company announced it invested in Bitcoin on Feb. 8. TSLA stock hasn’t made a new high since it hit $900.40 back in January. It’s now back down below $700. Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com Sure, TSLA stock is cheaper than it was a month or two ago. But anyone who is tempted to “buy the dip” in Tesla should keep some perspective on the stock and its valuation. Since mid-2019, TSLA stock has been caught in a stock market mania that has been fueled by a flood of new retail stock traders and three rounds of government stimulus payments. During periods of market mania, investors flood into a stock like Tesla all at once. When the stock deflates, however, the share price trickles back down one or two drips at a time. The million-dollar question for Tesla investors is what exactly is a fair value? Over the past two years, the stock has traded as high as $900.40 and as low as a split-adjusted $35.40. Where does Tesla’s true valuation fall in that massive range?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Analysts Take On TSLA Stock Bank of America analyst John Murphy upgraded Tesla stock back in August. But he’s still cautious on the stock after its parabolic run in the past two years. “TSLA’s future growth is still contingent upon its ability to fund additional product development, capacity expansion, and other initiatives, and we believe the company has yet to prove itself as truly self-funding while still in aggressive growth Phase,” Murphy says. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing He’s referring to Tesla’s inability to turn a profit without relying on regulatory credit sales. Analysts expect those sales to completely dry up in coming years. “Simply put, in our view, TSLA is a new disruptive (Auto) company that may/may not be dominant in the long-term, but that does not matter as long as it can keep funding outsized growth with almost no-cost capital, which justifies a high stock price,” Murphy says. Bank of America has a “neutral” rating and $900 price target for Tesla stock. Morningstar analyst David Whiston says Tesla stock currently trades based on CEO Elon Musk’s claims that the company can produce 20 million vehicles a year by the late 2020s. That production rate would be roughly double the current rates of Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). “We believe the stock trades on the option value of what it may look like years from now rather than on fundamentals and free cash flow generation, so we think investors should consider the upside and downside risks should they want to chase momentum,” Whiston says. That’s a very diplomatic statement. However, Whiston’s “sell” rating and $349 price target speak louder than his words. Tesla As An Auto Stock Analysts can’t agree on where Tesla stock is headed next, so let’s compare it to its auto peers. Looking at Toyota, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) are a good starting point for valuing Tesla. The legacy automakers have an average forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.35. They have an average price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.86 and an average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.69. They have an average price-to-free cash flow ratio (P/FCF) of 21.41. In the latest quarter, GM reported 21.7% revenue growth. Ford reported a 9.4% drop in revenue and Toyota reported an 8% increase in revenue. Tesla reported a 45.5% revenue increase. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 118.22 and a PEG ratio of 32.71. Its P/S ratio of 19.88 is nearly 30 times higher than the legacy automakers. Its P/FCF ratio of 106.84 is also more than five times higher than the other automakers. But I’m guessing Tesla investors don’t like this comparison very much because they say the company is more of a disruptive tech growth stock like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Tesla As A Tech Play Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have an average forward earnings multiple of 44.4 compared to Tesla’s 1050.1 multiple. Tesla’s P/S of 19.88 is about three times the big tech average of 7.02. Tesla’s P/FCF of 106.84 is more than 2.5 times the big tech average of 42.08. In the past four quarters, Tesla has averaged 27.9% year-over-year revenue growth. Facebook, Amazon and Google have averaged 23.5% growth. That growth rate is the primary reason many Tesla stock bulls insist tech growth stocks are a better comparison than auto stocks. For the sake of argument, let’s just assume that’s fair. Tesla’s revenue growth is roughly in-line with these big tech peers. It is still extremely overvalued based on all the other metrics. By averaging out Tesla’s 295% forward earnings multiple premium, its 190% PS premium and its 158.6% FCF premium, Tesla may be overvalued by about 214%. But before I get a bunch of angry Tweets, I’m not calling for Tesla stock to hit a $244 price target any time soon. I have no idea where that crazy stock is headed in the next week, month or year. I also believe Tesla is more a hybrid of a tech stock and an auto stock than a pure tech stock. There’s no way Tesla will ever be able to sell cars at margins anywhere close to the profit margins of Facebook or Google. However, Tesla is clearly outgrowing its auto peers, so I think a valuation somewhere in the middle would be most appropriate. How To Play It A stock like Tesla can trade at a ridiculous valuation for as long as its investors are willing to pay ridiculous prices. But I will say it’s difficult to find an example of a stock that trades at a ridiculous valuation indefinitely. The market may stay irrational for another year or two. In the meantime, there are plenty of much more attractively valued investments out there, including all the other auto stocks and tech stocks I mentioned above.

2021-03-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese automaker shares fell Monday after a fire unexpectedly halted one of chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp.’s largest plants, exacerbating a growing global shortage of automotive semiconductors.Renesas slid as much as 5.4%, while customers from Toyota Motor Corp. to Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. also fell in early trading. One of the biggest suppliers of car chips, Renesas was forced to halt a Japanese plant Friday after a fire broke out in one of its clean rooms, critical areas designed to keep impurities from contaminating semiconductors.Toyota said Monday it’s trying to gauge the fallout from that unexpected halt, which could ripple across an industry already struggling to keep assembly lines operating during a severe shortage of chips. The Renesas fire will likely worsen a crunch that stemmed from booming demand for home and work gadgets during the pandemic, estimated earlier this year to cost global automakers about $61 billion in lost sales in 2021.Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata warned the plant could be sidelined for a month and cost the company 17 billion yen ($156 million) in revenue.“I’m concerned that this will have a very big impact,” Shibata said at a news conference on Sunday, following the fire.Renesas, which posted 715.7 billion yen in revenue last year, gets about 6.6% of its sales from Toyota, according to Bloomberg’s Supply Chain Analysis. The Japanese automaker also warned that cold weather-induced semiconductor shortages will force it to suspend a factory in the Czech Republic for two weeks. A Toyota representative said it’s investigating the potential impact from the Renesas stoppage but had nothing more to share at this moment.“This is turning into a negative story,” said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at independent researcher Carnorama. “Production is shrinking, not increasing, so the balance between supply and demand is only getting worse.”Read more: Fire and Ice Aggravate Chip Supply Headache for Car IndustryRead more: Fire and Ice Aggravate Chip Supply Headache for Car IndustryShibata had told Bloomberg News earlier in March that shortages could persist into the second half, joining other industry leaders in bracing for a chip crunch to snarl production of cars and gadgets well past the summer.“This is terrible for the automobile supply chain; they might have to move toward holding more inventory,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi said of the Renesas fire.Renesas has production facilities at six sites in Japan.

2021-03-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Many of the world’s biggest automakers are suspending operations at their factories in Asia, Europe and North America due to a persistent shortage of semiconductors that was exacerbated by a fire at a key chip-producing plant over the weekend.Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co. are among those affected by problems with the supply of semiconductors, which are used in vehicles to manage and monitor everything from engine and driving performance to air-conditioning and entertainment systems.“Production is really vulnerable right now,” Bloomberg Intelligence auto-industry analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said. “Any kind of abnormal occurrence causes parts to run out.”The shortage initially came about as rising demand for cars coincided with a boom in the market for devices such as laptops, webcams and gaming systems as people spent longer at home due to the pandemic. That diverted chips away from the auto industry, which had earlier slashed orders after Covid-19 caused their sales to collapse. Winter storms in the U.S. also affected semiconductor supplies, and then the situation worsened this week after a fire damaged a plant run by Renesas Electronics Corp., a top provider of automotive chips.Analysts at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. already estimated in January that the shortage would reduce global vehicle production by 1.5 million units, with Japanese automakers accounting for roughly a third of that total.Here are some of the latest stoppages by automakers:Hyundai Motor Co. is suspending extra work on the weekend to adjust production of brands including Kona, Avante, Grandeur and Sonata, the Seoul Economic Daily reported.Honda is suspending production at six factories in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, citing the chip shortage as well as congestion at ports and cold weather.Volvo AB is implementing stop days across global truck manufacturing operations, saying it sees a “substantial impact” from the global semiconductor shortage.Ford has halted production at a factory in Ohio and dropped one shift at another in Kentucky, both until March 29. It said F-150 trucks and Edge SUVs will be assembled in North America without certain parts and shipped to dealers once electronic modules that contain chips are available.Nissan Motor Co. is adjusting production across its operations in the U.S. and Mexico.Operations at Toyota’s Kolin plant in the Czech Republic, which makes the compact car Aygo for the European market, have been suspended for two weeks from March 22 after cold weather in the U.S. disrupted chip production.Volkswagen is halting production at a plant in Portugal from March 22-28.Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is reducing domestic output of vehicles by 4,000-5,000 units in March and reviewing production plans for April.With the exception of Volkswagen, the share prices of all of those automakers have fallen this week, tracking declines in the S&P Supercomposite Auto Parts & Equipment Index, which is down 10% from a March 17 peak.The Renesas fire will halt a production line for 300mm wafers for at least a month and probably have a big impact on the car industry, Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata said during an online news conference Sunday. Underscoring the severity of the outage, Toyota and Nissan dispatched workers to help in recovery efforts.“The automotive industry is key in Japan, therefore any incident that impacts it has a broad effect on the economy,” said Roman Schorr, a director at Fitch Ratings. With the added variable of a chip crunch, “it’s certainly striking that so much right now hinges on one factory,” he said.Shibata will join executives from Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Kioxia Holdings Corp., as well as representatives from the auto sector, at meeting with Japan’s economy ministry later Wednesday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The Global Auto Plants Now Idle as Chip Supplies Dry Up

2021-03-28,"(Bloomberg) -- A global semiconductor shortage has upended the supply of everyday devices from smartphones to gaming consoles to tech-dependent cars. With companies warning the issue may last into the second half, the fallout threatens to weigh on share prices for months to come.Since news broke in November that Apple Inc. faced a shortage of chips for its latest iPhone, warnings about the impact have been coming thick and fast. Truckmaker Volvo Group and electric-vehicle company Nio Inc. last week joined a long list of auto producers that have idled assembly lines.The lack of chips has been caused by booming demand for tech gear, in large part because of the pandemic, and winter weather in Texas and a fire in Japan have added to the problem. It’s been a boon for companies such as Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp. that produce the equipment semiconductor makers need to boost output.Here’s a look at the companies with the most at stake as the global chip shortage rages on, and how their stocks have been affected:AutomakersAuto stocks have come roaring back from their pandemic lows. Now both the chip shortage and concern over a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic have pulled a Bloomberg index of global manufacturers down 14% from its Jan. 25 record high.Volvo Group slumped 7% Tuesday after saying it will have to suspend production due to the lack of semiconductors, while China’s Nio slid 4.8% Friday when it said it will stop output at a factory in Anhui province.A fire March 19 at a Japanese factory operated by Renesas Electronics Corp., one of the biggest makers of automotive chips, hit the industry hard. It triggered a 6.7% drop in General Motors Corp. shares over three days last week. In Japan, shares of Toyota Motor Corp., which touched a six-year high March 18, slumped 6.1% in the subsequent four sessions.“The automotive sector has arguably experienced the greatest level of disruption, with more and more OEMs either slowing production or closing manufacturing plants on a temporary basis,” said Thomas Fitzgerald, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management Ltd., referring to original equipment manufacturers.China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. slid 19% over three days last week after reporting disappointing earnings. Daiwa Securities cited the chip shortage in downgrading the stock and cutting estimates for this year and next. China is dealing with unrelated chip-supply issues of its own.READ, Chip Shortage May Put Market-Beating Rally at Risk: Taking StockSmartphones, Consumer ElectronicsBeyond the auto industry, it’s harder to tease out the stock market impact on companies that depend on semiconductors. Shares of Apple, for example, didn’t react in November to the impact of the shortage, and they’re up more than 5% since then. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. slumped 4.4% Thursday after warning that parts shortages could slow its growth for the next few quarters.One positive aspect of the chip shortage: With demand for consumer electronics as strong as it is, it gives companies the power to raise prices and pass on higher costs, said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “The share prices haven’t reacted particularly negatively to the news, and I think that’s because the important part is that you’re seeing a snapback in demand for these goods,” he said.Lenovo Group Ltd. said in August that its profit margins took a hit from the chip shortage, and in November it said it couldn’t fill all customer orders due to the lack of components. Still, demand for the company’s laptops is soaring because of purchases by people working at home, and the stock has doubled since August.Sony Corp. said last month it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks. The stock touched a 21-year high in February, though it’s dipped 8.2% since then.While Samsung Electronics Co.’s foundry business making chips for other companies benefits from the favorable supply-demand equation, the South Korean firm also has its own line of consumer products that are hurt. Samsung this month warned of problems, including the possible cancellation of the launch of its new Galaxy Note, one of its best-selling smartphone models.Makers of networking equipment also have been feeling the pinch. Analysts at Oddo BHF flagged a DigiTimes report that the lead times for deliveries of networking chips are extending to as long as 50 weeks, suggesting that the chip shortage has also reached the networking segment and will likely last into early next year.ChipmakersWhile automakers have struggled, the flip side of the semiconductor shortage is that the companies supplying those chips could see a boost to their business. Most semiconductor companies should report strong results for the first quarter and give good guidance for the second, said Janardan Menon, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd.“This is all great news for the semiconductor vendor,” Liberum’s Menon said by phone. “This kind of tightness -- of capacity utilization, rising prices, very, very strong demand -- invariably means that their results are very, very strong.”However, Menon cautioned that share prices may not follow, given the market is now worried that the peak of the semiconductor cycle is approaching.European auto chip supplier Infineon Technologies AG is up 12% for the year while STMicroelectronics NV has gained just 5.6%. In the U.S., Texas Instruments Inc. is up 15%, while NXP Semiconductors NV and ON Semiconductor Corp. have done better, up 25% and 24% respectively, versus the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 11% rise.There are also broader winners from the shortages in the semiconductor industry, with chip foundries such as leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. running at close to full capacity to try to keep up with the surge in demand. TSMC shares are down 12% from their record set Jan. 21 but are still up 11% on the year.Semiconductor-Equipment ManufacturersThe makers of equipment used to produce semiconductors are benefiting from the supply crunch as chipmakers rush to add capacity to their factories and governments concerned about national security risks are looking at measures to encourage local production. The combination has created a spending environment that some analysts say will benefit the industry for years.Applied Materials, the biggest equipment maker, has seen its shares double in the past six months, while Lam Research has gained 77% over the same period, nearly twice the return for the Philadelphia semiconductor index. ASML Holding NV is up 74%.TSMC committed to as much as $28 billion in capital spending in 2021, up from $17 billion the year before, while Intel Corp. unveiled a plan on March 23 to pour billions of dollars into production facilities.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Here’s How the World’s Chip Shortage Is Playing Out for Stocks

2021-03-29,"(Bloomberg) -- In a booming global bond market, there are few segments that are growing quite like the money-minting machine for green bonds. So eager are investors to buy up these notes that they’re willing to pay a premium -- and accept lower interest payments -- for the privilege.The risk is that in this mad rush they’re letting a feel-good label obscure the reality of their investments. At the forefront of concerns among a small but growing contingent of bond buyers is greenwashing: the possibility that governments and companies are exaggerating or misrepresenting their environmental credentials or sustainability bona fides to tap feverish demand, lower borrowing costs and boost their reputation.Any signs of deception could undercut efforts to marry making money with making progress in the fight against climate change and inequality at a critical time -- and derail one of Wall Street bankers’ fastest-growing cash cows. So even as sales of green bonds and the related universe of debt tied to broad concepts of improving the world notch record after record, a nascent investor rebellion is finding its voice.Fund manager Aberdeen Standard blacklisted Indonesia’s green debt from its ESG funds due to deforestation risks. NN Investment Partners dumped its holdings of Poland’s green bond, citing the country’s unclear climate policy. In the corporate market, Actiam passed on a bond to finance eco-conscious renovations at Amsterdam’s airport because plane travel is inherently polluting. And Toyota Motor Corp.’s sale to fund safety research was rejected by Impax Asset Management, which figured that was something carmakers do anyway.“What greenness you’re getting from those assets can really vary,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management, which oversees about 148 billion pounds ($204 billion) of assets. “We want to put more money into green assets in the long term, but do it in a smart way.”It’s a quandary that’s drawing a fresh look from regulators too as the market tops $2 trillion. A new generation of environmentally conscious and socially aware consumers has already embraced clothes made with organic cotton, coffee harvested with fair-trade principles and carbon offsets that promise to wipe away the guilt over jetting off to the beach, even as critics see many of the efforts as ineffective. Investors with the same goals must now parse a whole rainbow of eco-friendly debt, from bonds that fund windfarms to those helping polluters transition to cleaner tech -- even if most simply see these bonds as “green.”A $2 Trillion Rainbow of Ethical Debt Sows Investor ConfusionThe European Union is working on a set of standards that will require more rigor and accountability from issuers, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created a task force focused on rooting out misconduct in so-called ESG investing that considers environmental, social and governance issues.There’s certainly a lot to scrutinize. Offerings of green, social and sustainability debt make up more than one in five sales in Europe this year, up from just 7% at this point in 2020. Latin American borrowers have been even more aggressive -- they’re already 80% of the way toward 2020’s record $10.8 billion of ESG debt deals.Part of the increase in sales is due to borrowers rushing to issue debt before global interest rates increase any further. But a global explosion of fixed-income exchange-traded funds and mutual funds dedicated to meeting sustainable investing mandates has turbocharged the boom. Retail cash has flooded in, netting fees for portfolio managers, while also often making it cheaper to sell ESG debt instead of conventional bonds.Estimates for the so-called greenium vary, with Bloomberg Intelligence ESG analyst Simone Andrews finding only a “modest” advantage while Citigroup Inc. sees it as high as a quarter of a percentage point. For Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that translated into paying the same to place 20-year sustainability bonds in February as for conventional debt of half that maturity.“There are more ESG mandated assets than there are ESG securities,” said Andrew Karp, head of investment grade capital markets at Bank of America Corp., who sees the torrent of demand supporting borrowers’ price advantage.But if borrowers are going to save money by offering green bonds, buyers increasingly want to be sure they’re getting what they pay for -- namely securities that make the world a better place.Ethical Debt Glossary: ESG, SLB, SLL, KPIs and More: QuickTakeIt’s a tall order. James Rich, a senior portfolio manager at Aegon Asset Management, estimates about a third of bonds designated as eco-conscious contain elements of greenwashing, up from as much as 20% a couple of years ago.When Indonesia sold $1.25 billion of debt in 2018, it was the largest green bond that was compliant with Islamic law. The move was widely lauded, allowing the country to pay less than its initial price guidance to the market.Yet there were red flags beneath the green surface. The Oslo-based Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research at the time noted a “possibility that some eligible green projects include an element of deforestation.” That was a warning sign that merited further investigation for Aberdeen Standard Investments, which excluded it from its ESG funds in the second half of last year.“We look for transparency above all,” said Kate McGrath, an ESG analyst at the firm, noting Indonesia didn’t provide investors with a specific list of projects it was seeking to fund.In Europe, Poland was penalized by NN Investment Partners, which said in September that it sold its green bonds partly because it’s the only EU country that has refused to sign on to the bloc’s 2050 climate neutrality goal at a national level.A spokesperson for Poland’s finance ministry said it wasn’t aware of any other investors selling its green debt because of similar concerns. Indonesia’s green bond issuance is carried out “very transparently” and was approved by a second-party reviewer, said Luky Alfirman, director general of budget financing and risk management at the finance ministry.Money manager Tony Trzcinka of Impax Asset Management passed on sustainability bonds from Toyota, whose Prius fueled the mass adoption of hybrid electric cars. The debt was marketed as “Woven Planet” notes. Using proceeds to make cars safer, while a noble goal, pushed the limits of what he considered deserving of a sustainability label.“It was an odd proposition,” Trzcinka said.Royal London’s Claxton says there are often cases in which a company she likes issues a green bond whose proceeds offer no added impact relative to regular debt, despite demanding a greenium. One example: Anglian Water Services Financing Plc.“It’s not necessarily greenwashing by Anglian, but we don’t accept just because it’s got the label that we have to buy it,” she said.A spokesperson for Anglian said even its non-green bonds benefit from its commitment to improving the environment. Here’s How to Tell Green Good Deeds From Greenwashing: QuickTakeFor other investors, the concern isn’t so much about the use of proceeds but the credentials of the issuer itself.Actiam’s Chris Brils was unpersuaded by green debt from Dutch airport operator Royal Schiphol Group, which includes Amsterdam’s airport, among Europe’s busiest hubs. The company wanted to “greenify” by measures such as improving the energy efficiency of its buildings.Trouble was, there was no plan to use the bond proceeds to tackle plane emissions amid terminal expansions. “So they will be responsible for more air traffic, not less,” the portfolio manager said.A Schiphol spokesman said the company financially supports initiatives for cleaner fuels and is aiming for a moderate and controlled expansion. Toyota’s press office said it was important to pursue “a safe mobility society.”This growing yet ultimately still niche investor skepticism may one day erode the greenium on debt seen to not offer a sufficient impact, but so far it’s hard to find solid evidence that the suspect bonds have been punished in the market. In the meantime, some of the world’s largest investors are going to unusual lengths to avoid being taken for a ride.Since 2019, Lombard Odier Investment Managers has hired three analysts with training in geospatial analysis, or interpreting large-scale satellite imagery. Taking their cue from charities and campaigners who have highlighted deforestation and other biodiversity threats in the past, Lombard Odier is developing proprietary models for assessing an issuer’s green credentials.“You don’t want to have greenwashers who are issuing nice green bonds with water biodiversity projects, but then they’re presiding over massive amounts of deforestation elsewhere,” said Christopher Kaminker, who leads Lombard Odier’s sustainable investment team. “We can now count trees from space. We know where deforestation is occurring. We’re engaging with issuers on the topic.”Even more diligence will be needed as the boom goes parabolic. The EU has announced issuance plans that would transform it into the biggest green debt issuer in the world, while the U.K. hopes to issue the first green gilt. Meanwhile, the U.S. could turn to the securities to fund a proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill. Corporate issuers won’t be far behind.The many new flavors of eco-friendly debt could help investors differentiate between these offerings, if enough capital flows in and gold standards emerge. One nascent variant -- sustainability-linked bonds -- could hold issuers’ feet to the fire by penalizing borrowers that fall short of stated environmental targets, but others are shunning labels altogether.“On green bonds, we only think they have merit to ESG investors if the issuance leads to issuers actually changing their behavior,” said Mark Dowding, BlueBay Asset Management’s chief investment officer. “If this criteria isn’t fulfilled, the green issuance is just cashing in on a trend -- at best -- and could be subject to criticisms of greenwashing at worst.”(Adds that it’s Aberdeen Standard’s ESG funds in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Bond Investor Revolt Brews Over Bogus Green Debt Flooding Market

2021-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Renesas Electronics Corp. said production at a semiconductor factory hit by a fire is on track to resume by mid-April, welcome news from one of the top providers of automotive chips amid a global shortage.One of the company’s most advanced lines at its plant in Naka, north of Tokyo, has been halted since a fire broke out late on March 19. Production will resume after about a month, as Renesas had previously projected, Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata said at a briefing in Tokyo on Tuesday.A recovery to full production may take 100 days, he said, though progress in the damaged clean room is ahead of schedule. About three-quarters of the work in progress was undamaged by the fire, he added.“We are increasingly confident in our chances of achieving the goal,” Shibata said in the online briefing.Booming demand for laptops, tablets and other electronics from people stuck at home during the pandemic triggered a semiconductor shortage late last year that has since snarled production of everything from automobiles to gaming consoles. Car manufacturers got hit particularly hard and are expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone.Renesas, whose chips are used by all the major automakers including Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., gets about half its revenue from car chips.The fire’s impact on the Japanese chipmaker’s sales may range between 17.5 billion ($160 million) and 24 billion yen, he said. The company, which had previously estimated the damage to be 17 billion yen, said it discovered an error in earlier calculations. The company last month forecast total annual revenue of 711 billion yen.“That’s about 3% of revenues at the highest projection,” Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, wrote in a note to clients. “Storm in a teacup!”The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeRenesas shares trimmed losses after the CEO’s comments and closed less than 1% lower in Tokyo.The fire at a production line handling 300-millimeter wafers blazed for five and a half hours, damaged 23 pieces of equipment and burned a 600 square meter production area, or about 4% of the clean room space. A plating machine caught fire due to an overcurrent, the cause of which remains unknown, the company said.The Naka plant makes chips used in automotive and industrial applications. Its products range from mid- to low-end microcontrollers, 90-nanometer analog chips for car applications and 40-nanometer microcontrollers and system-on-chip devices. The factory was running over capacity when the fire broke.“There won’t be any big departures from our plan of getting back to 100%,” Shibata said.(Updates with CEO’s comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Renesas Says Fire-Hit Chip Plant to Restart By Mid-April

2021-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers posted higher sales in the first quarter as General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and others benefited from strong demand for new cars and trucks in comparison with a year earlier, when the spread of Covid-19 shut showrooms.U.S. auto sales surged by more than 8% in the quarter, according to analysts’ estimates. The gain reflects buying as vaccination rates increase and more people return to their pre-pandemic routines. Increased confidence in the economy and worry about lower supplies of cars due to computer chip shortages also helped boost deliveries.Read more: Buyers Snap Up New Cars, Even If They’re the Wrong ColorMajor carmakers either met or beat handily a consensus forecasts of analysts, most of whom projected quarterly gains due to the disastrous performance in the first quarter of last year.“Everybody is up because March last year was a train wreck,” Judith Wheeler, Nissan’s vice president for U.S. sales, said in an interview. “For the overall industry, we expect it to be a very good year.”SUV Split-DecisionGM’s sales increased 3.9% in the quarter, led by demand for sport-utility vehicles such as the midsize Chevrolet Traverse and full-size Cadillac Escalade. Strength in deliveries of those models helped offset lower sales of vehicles such as the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain compact crossover SUV that have been impacted by temporary shutdowns of plants in Ontario and Mexico.Despite semiconductor scarcity that is prompting factory closures, GM expects a solid year of growth. It projects the annualized selling rate for the industry will hit 16.7 million vehicles, which is above the average analysts’ estimate of 16.5 million.“Consumer confidence and spending will continue to increase due to stimulus, rising vaccination rates and the progressive reopening of the economy,” Elaine Buckberg, GM’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Auto demand should remain strong throughout the year.”Stellantis NV, formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, posted a 5% gain for the quarter while Ford Motor Co. saw a slight 0.6% uptick. Both automakers benefited from strong demand for their pickups and SUVs. Stellantis’s Ram 1500 pulled ahead of the rival Silverado model from GM for bragging rights as the best-selling truck behind Ford’s industry-leading F-150.Ram outsold the Chevrolet Silverado by more than 22,000 units after Chevy won the No. 2 truck spot in 2020. That may be a matter of supply -- Chevrolet has been eliminating truck options from its assembly lines to keep production going, and Stellantis has plenty of extra inventory of its Ram Classic, the older, more affordable version of its Ram 1500.All three Detroit automakers have struggled to hoard enough chips for their most profitable models. Stellantis said last week it would close half its plants in North America and Ford said Wednesday it’s being forced to idle a pair of F-150 factories.Dearth of ChipsThe global semiconductor shortfall is draining dealer lots of cars and trucks -- and forcing buyers to pay more to secure a new set of wheels. New-model inventory available at U.S dealerships fell 36% in March while average transaction prices rose 5% to an estimated $40,563, according to automotive researcher Edmunds.“The stronger sales results are bumping against ongoing production issues, creating what could be a volatile demand environment over the next few months,” Chris Hopson, manager of North America light vehicle forecast for IHS Markit, said in a statement.Sales of Toyota’s full-size Tundra pickup were flat in March compared with a year earlier, reflecting a prolonged shutdown of its assembly line at a plant in San Antonio, Texas. Never the most popular vehicle in the automaker’s lineup, the Tundra has borne the brunt of the semiconductor shortfall.But overall, Toyota reported a healthy 22% jump in quarterly sales -- including a striking 87% surge in March -- to 603,066 vehicles. Buyers flocked to its best-selling RAV4 crossover SUV and popular Tacoma midsize truck. The Japanese company’s Lexus luxury brand reported its second-highest volume ever for the first quarter and best ever for March, led by sales of the RX sport-utility vehicle.Read more: Toyota Quarterly U.S. Sales Jump 22% as Car Buyers Storm BackFleet Demand Recovery?The auto industry has retail buyers to thank, since multivehicle corporate clients largely disappeared at the height of the pandemic and have remained bit players in recent months. Fleet purchases -- often at discounted rates -- fell about 30% in the first quarter, according to analysts’ estimates.That reflected lower demand from rental car and other fleet buyers, as well as dwindling vehicle supplies as automakers prioritized higher-margin retail sales. But there are signs that the dearth in fleet business may be close to bottoming out.“I can tell the economy is starting to rebound because our rental car partners are really aggressively asking us for more vehicles,” Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor Co.’s top sales executive in the U.S., said in an interview. “So what that tells me is the rental car side of the business is really starting to pick up.”Hyundai’s deliveries rose 28% in the first quarter to 167,130 vehicles, with the Tucson compact SUV leading the way. But less than 10,000 of those went to fleet buyers.Nissan Motor Co. is also optimistic that multivehicle buyers will start to become more of a presence in the sales picture.“Fleet is definitely coming back. We will try to do our part to give them some inventory, but we’re going to focus on retail,” Nissan’s Wheeler said.Nissan Breaks FallThe Japanese automaker reported a gain for the first time in nine quarters, with a 10.8% increase to 285,553 vehicles. A 45% jump in deliveries of its Rogue crossover SUV accounted for almost one-third of total deliveries as the brand attempts to rebuild.

2021-04-06,"(Bloomberg) -- KKR-backed OneStream Software, a maker of programs for chief financial officers, raised $200 million in a funding round that values the company at $6 billion.The round was led by D1 Capital Partners and included investments by Tiger Global and Investment Group of Santa Barbara. OneStream plans to be ready for a public share sale next year, although actual timing may vary based on market conditions, Chief Financial Officer Bill Koefoed said in an interview. The Rochester, Michigan-based software maker had sales of $130 million in 2019 and hasn’t disclosed more recent revenue. It has been shifting customers to subscriptions that generate a regular sales stream — annual recurring revenue has doubled in the quarter that just ended and totals about $150 million, Koefoed said. The company sells software that helps a CFO’s office report financial information to regulators and investors, as well as manage financial and operational planning. Customers include United Parcel Service Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Capital One Financial Corp. It competes with Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Anaplan Inc. and Blackline Inc.The company, which was founded in 2010, is trying to help CFOs have a more up-to-date view of their numbers, moving from an earlier world where figures got tallied once a month to today’s goal of real-time information. The pandemic has made companies realize they can’t rely on planning that’s rapidly obsolete, OneStream Chief Executive Officer Tom Shea said. In the most recent quarter, bookings rose 200%, the company said. “What happened when the pandemic hit is anybody that was running a business realized their plans were pretty much garbage,” Shea said. “You had no idea what demand looked like, you didn't know if someone was going to pay you. The first thing that happened on, let’s call it March 9 of last year, is everybody started to realize that those that had invested in tools and had the information they needed to understand where they were at that moment — they were OK, and those that didn’t realized that they needed to invest.”The company, which KKR took a majority stake in two years ago, plans to use the funds to fuel research and development in the product and its expansion into the Asia Pacific region, Shea said.

The company, which restarted partial production at the plant over the weekend, had said previously it would need about 100 days to bring the factory back to full shipments.“I appreciate all the help from our partners that enabled us to restart the factory without falling behind,” said Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday.Shibata said the plant should be able to resume full production in late May and then reach its previous shipping volumes about a month later. He said it may take slightly longer than 100 days, by a week or 10 days.The company’s shares rose 4.3% on Monday.The incident hit as the global semiconductor industry is suffering through unprecedented shortages, leaving automakers in particular short of components that they need for their vehicles.

Representing the vast bulk of the total was the Prius, the favourite of Uber drivers and Hollywood environmentalists, which made battery-powered cars mainstream. Toyota labelled the Prius a “technological leap forward which evolved into a global phenomenon”. It was the first mass-produced car that combined an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. Launched in 1997, the Prius was not an all-electric vehicle with zero emissions. Instead, it had a battery that charged when the car braked, and its power helped the engine achieve better fuel economy and generate less pollution. It was a bold move from Toyota when the rest of the industry was still fuelled by petrol and diesel.

2021-04-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. has agreed to sell its self-driving division to a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp., joining Uber Technologies Inc. in stepping back from the costly driverless vehicle research once thought to be on the verge of revolutionizing ride-hailing.The deal is worth $550 million and will allow Lyft to turn an adjusted profit in the third quarter of this year, the company said Monday. Previously, Lyft was targeting profitability by the end of the year. The company estimates that selling the division will save it $100 million in operating expenses annually.Lyft shares gained about 2% in extended trading after closing at $63.06 in New York. The stock has jumped 28% this year.“Assuming the transaction closes within the expected timeframe and the Covid recovery continues, we are confident that we can achieve Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the third quarter of this year,” Lyft Co-Founder and President John Zimmer said in a prepared statement announcing the deal, which is expected to close during the third quarter.Lyft will sell the unit, called Level 5, to Woven Planet Holdings Inc., an extension of Toyota’s research division with a mandate to advance self-driving car technology. The deal is structured to start with a $200 million payout followed by $350 million in additional payments over five years.Lyft fielded interest from “a number” of autonomous vehicle companies before selecting Toyota’s Woven Planet, Zimmer told analysts during a call. A key element in the decision to sell the unit, Zimmer said, was recognizing that Lyft no longer needed to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology. Instead, he said, multiple partnerships with other companies working on the technology would deliver the highest value to the Lyft platform.“It’s important, at this point, not to get into an exclusive relationship,” Zimmer said.The sale comes as Lyft’s ride-hailing demand is rebounding after the pandemic slammed revenue by keeping would-be riders homebound. The lockdowns were particularly hard on Lyft, which operates only in North America and, unlike its larger rival Uber, does not have businesses like food delivery to off-set ride-hailing losses.But even as the ride-hailing industry shows signs of recovery, expectations for self-driving car development have been humbled. Long hailed as a technology that would be soon be ready to commercialize broadly and cheaply, its development is costing more and taking longer to safely deploy than initially expected.By selling its autonomous driving unit, Lyft follows Uber, which sold its self-driving group to Aurora Innovation Inc. late last year. Uber has been offloading a variety of pricey side projects as it focuses on turning a profit by the end of 2021.Lyft’s self-driving division will continue operating in Palo Alto with all 300 employees now joining Woven Planet. Jody Kelman, Lyft’s director of product and program management for the self-driving platform, will stay at Lyft, joining its two dozen or so product managers and engineers in San Francisco focused on making the company’s platform accessible and ready to work with all self-driving cars.After the addition of the Lyft staffers, the group at Toyota’s Woven Planet will consist of about 1,200 employees. “This acquisition marks the first in a coordinated strategy to consolidate leading technologies and talent to help realize this vision,” George Kellerman, head of investments & acquisitions for Woven Planet, said in a statement.Lyft also said Monday that it had reached agreements with Woven Planet to share data that could help further the automated vehicles the unit is aiming to develop.

2021-05-01,"At what point does a great idea — even a good idea — become a no-brainer? Source: Shutterstock We could come up with a few answers to that one, but I think the most basic is… It always all comes down to money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Electric vehicles (EVs) were already on the path to no-brainer status. And if you’ll pardon the pun, the pedal just got put to the metal. It’s the kind of hypergrowth trend I love. It has the potential to make you a lot of money … is virtually unstoppable… and its tipping point just got closer… Even if you like the idea of an electric vehicle, you wouldn’t pay 83% more for it, would you? A few people might. Most wouldn’t even consider it. But… what if the two were the same price? Or what if the electric vehicle were cheaper? That day is not too far in the future. In 2018, the average cost for an electric vehicle with a 250-mile range was $44,000, which is 83% more than the $24,000 price tag of a Toyota Camry. That’s a $20,000 difference. But by last year, that price gap was expected to narrow to $9,000 as the average cost for an EV dropped to $33,000. And within just the next two years, the average cost of a 250-mile range EV will fall to $24,000 — while the cost of the Toyota Camry rises to $25,000. The first time an EV is cheaper than the average gas-powered vehicle will be a major milestone. The breakthrough will push a lot of prospective car buyers to strongly consider an EV… and that day is coming quickly. By 2024, the cost is expected to swing greatly in favor of EVs. ARK Invest predicts EV prices will drop to $17,000 while the Toyota Camry remains constant at $25,000. This was the unstoppable trend before Joe Biden was elected president, but with increased attention and massive spending to increase the number of EVs, the future will get here faster. Part of the administration’s proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan includes $100 million to provide rebates to those who purchase EVs. Not a tax credit… a rebate when you by the car. That drops the price further and faster. Earlier this week in his first speech to Congress, President Biden talked about installing 500,000 charging stations “so we can own the electric car market.” Rebates would accelerate the trend, but even without them, EVs continue to get cheaper. How is that possible? Ongoing innovation and improvements to the battery. General Motors (NYSE:GM) is working on it. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is working on it. Volkswagen (OTCSMKTS:VWAGY) is working on it. Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM), too. And on and on. The stakes are huge. A few years ago, the battery made up about 57% of an EV’s cost. In 2019, that percentage fell to 33%. And by 2025, it is projected to be just 20% of the cost of the vehicle. Electric vehicles becoming increasingly more affordable is a big reason behind the eye-popping growth forecasts. The Energy Industry Administration calls for sales to more than triple to 6.5 million units by 2024. ARK Invest is even more bullish, predicting that 37 million EVs will be sold in 2024. That would be an amazing 79% compound annual growth rate and result in full-year revenue of $1.1 trillion. Even if we basically split the difference and EV sales increase to 20 million units in the next few years, it is an easy 10X opportunity for investors. Over the past decade, electric vehicle technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, and companies like those we just talked about are all in. Toyota expects to have a solid state battery prototype working this year, which is a big step forward. These batteries are lighter, last longer, charge faster, and are safer than lithium-ion batteries that are currently used. In addition to technology improvements, electric vehicles have governments on their side. Thanks to environmental concerns, governments in China and Europe are moving to phase out internal combustion engines and phase in EVs. We’re talking about an epic boom coming in EV sales. Bloomberg estimates that at least 50% of cars sold by 2040 will be electric. Breakthrough battery technology will power the electric vehicles of the future. This hypergrowth trend is well underway, but it’s still early. That means now is the time for smart investors to get in position for the biggest profits.

2021-05-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc., reporting quarterly results, said ride demand is rebounding as more people get vaccinated, and the company still expects to earn an adjusted profit by fall.The San Francisco-based ride-hailing company reported adjusted losses before tax, depreciation and other expenses of $73 million in the first quarter, narrower than the same period last year and beating analyst estimates, on average, of $143 million.Lyft shares gained about 5% in extended trading Tuesday after closing at $56.19 in New York. The stock has jumped 14% this year.Revenue declined 36% to $609 million from a year earlier -- before Lyft felt the brunt of the pandemic -- but was up 7% from the previous quarter, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected $557 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We had an extremely strong quarter,” Lyft Co-founder and President John Zimmer told Bloomberg. “We’re going to emerge on the other side of this pandemic stronger, leaner and more profitable than we were going in.” Zimmer also reiterated that the company was on track to become profitable by the third quarter.On a call with investors Tuesday, Lyft executives said airport rides were up 65% in April compared with January numbers, influenced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxing travel warnings for vaccinated people.The executives also said the company will have to spend more to recruit new drivers during the current three-month period, but that supply and demand should even out by the third quarter -- thanks to increased vaccination rates, decreased demand for delivery services and the expiration of unemployment benefits for drivers who stayed home during the pandemic.Reduced travel demand during the pandemic hit Lyft especially hard. Unlike its larger rival, Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft doesn’t operate a food delivery service or offer rides outside of North America. As the virus spread and ridership cratered last year, Lyft began laying off employees and cutting costs, stripping out $360 million of annualized expenses in 2020.Lyft said last month it would cut another $100 million of annual operating expenses with the sale of its self-driving division to a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp. The sale of the unit allowed the company to push up the time line for turning a profit to the third quarter, instead of the end of the year.The company said Tuesday it had 13.5 million active riders, compared with 12.7 million expected by Wall Street. Revenue per active rider was to $45.13, compared with $43.88 expected by analysts.Despite the pandemic receding, some worries remain for the company. The Biden administration is considering David Weil, the former administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor under the Obama administration, for the same job in the new administration, according to reports late last month. Weil has a history of criticizing gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft for not classifying their workers as employees, and his appointment could mean regulatory hurdles for the companies.“It really ups the ante in terms of risks to their model,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns shares of Lyft and Uber. “It’s really a dark cloud looming over both these companies.”(Adds Lyft executive comments starting in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Lyft Loss Narrower Than Estimates as Riders Start to Return

2021-05-06,"(Bloomberg) -- When automakers were first hit with chip shortages at the end of last year, they tried idling factories until the troubles blew over. But with the crisis stretching into its fifth month and getting worse, they’re getting creative to keep at least some production moving forward.Nissan is leaving navigation systems out of thousands of vehicles that typically would have them because of the shortages. Ram no longer offers its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots. Renault has stopped offering an oversized digital screen behind the steering wheel on its Arkana SUV -- also to save on chips.The crisis is an historic test for the century-old auto industry just as it is trying to accelerate a shift toward smarter, electric vehicles. For decades, carmakers moved steadily to include more and better advanced features; now, they’re stripping some of them out -- at least temporarily -- to salvage their sales.That rollback underscores the depth of the issues facing the industry. Just last week, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. all flagged worsening problems from chip shortages. A failure to secure critical supplies is a massive short-term setback -- millions of vehicle sales will be lost this year -- and bodes ill for the future as competition from tech-savvy internet and consumer-electronics companies intensifies.“This probably gets worse before it gets better,” said Stacy Rasgon, who covers the semiconductor industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. “It just takes a long time to bring this capacity online.”NXP Semiconductor NV Chief Executive Officer Kurt Sievers said the shift to electric vehicles is happening faster than anticipated, which has added to the increased demand for automotive chips. NXP plans to ship at least 20% more auto chips by revenue in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2019, even though car production has dropped about 10% over the period, he said.Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., cautioned the crisis is far from over. His company, which is the world’s most advanced chipmaker and will be critical to any resolution, will begin to meet auto clients’ minimum requirements by June, but expects the car-chip shortages could last until early 2022, he said in an interview with CBS.Automakers can’t just wait. One reaction to the shortage is to allocate the scarce components to more profitable and better-selling vehicles at the expense of other models -- something manufacturers like France’s Renault SA and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. are doing.Carmakers are also building vehicles with less technology. Peugeot is going back to old-fashioned analog speedometers for its 308 hatchbacks, rather than use digital versions that need hard-to-find chips. General Motors Co. said it built some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks without a certain fuel-economy module, costing drivers about 1 mile per gallon. Nissan is cutting the number of vehicles with pre-installed navigation systems by about a third, according to a person familiar with the matter.Why Can’t We Just Make More Chips?The Japanese manufacturer, which in early January became one of the first automakers to warn of an impending shortage, is also prioritizing chip supply to the two best-selling models in each major market, the person said. In one instance, Nissan flew chip supplies from India to the U.S. on a chartered cargo flight to help production move forward there. A representative for Nissan declined to comment.Buyers of Renault’s sporty Arkana now have to settle for a smaller display without a navigation map, and forgo an option for a phone charger by induction.Stellantis NV -- formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group -- has modified the Ram 1500 pickup so that the digital rearview mirror that usually comes standard is now available only as an upgrade option, according to a person familiar with the matter. The manufacturer is also using parts that don’t require chips from its more basic Ram Classic truck to keep the pricier version moving down the assembly line.“Given the fluid nature of this complex issue, Stellantis employees across the enterprise are finding creative solutions every day to minimize the impact to our vehicles so we can build the most in-demand products as possible,” spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said in an email.The car industry’s predicament dates back to poor planning during the pandemic and limited chipmaking capacity, but it’s been compounded by shrinking available cargo space as the global economy recovers from Covid-19. When automakers can secure orders, their chips often can’t ship.That bottleneck is compounded by the fact that major car-chip makers NXP, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp. account for just 40% of supply, with the remaining 60% split between tens of thousands of smaller designers. Those smaller players often lack the influence to get their chips manufactured at foundries when capacity is tight.In at least one case, carmakers are asking a major chipmaker to send microcontrollers that don’t meet standard specifications, a person familiar with the matter said. Those sub-standard chips wouldn’t jeopardize safety essentials, like brakes, the person said, but they could mean in-car entertainment or emissions monitoring systems are more likely to malfunction in extreme weather.Automakers and suppliers can accept whatever chips are available and rewrite the software to give them a new task, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler. Tesla Inc. said last week it alleviated issues by reaching out to new semiconductor suppliers and then quickly writing new firmware for those chips.Stellantis is working on more standardization across its vehicle lineup rather than having to use specific chips for some models, Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said on an call with reporters this week.“More standardization and flexibility, which is key when we have supply constraints,” he said. “We’re managing scarcity.”Manufacturers are also stocking incomplete cars, or “building shy” in industry parlance, to keep production lines humming. In Hamtramck, greater Detroit, an area stretching several blocks is filled with Ford F-150 pickup trucks sans some chips. General Motors said it is also storing unfinished vehicles while awaiting semiconductors.Meanwhile, behind the scenes, car suppliers are going to unusual lengths to try to secure chips. A Stellantis partner called JVIS-USA LLC tried to sue NXP in a Michigan court in April in a Hail Mary attempt to get more chips, but a judge rejected its request. Automotive supplier Visteon Corp. flagged that carmakers may seek compensation because of the shortages. In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda visited a Renesas plant that had suffered a fire to hasten its return to production.Yet no relief is in sight, with even Apple Inc., whose high-specification iPhones and aggressive demands typically place it at the front of the chip-customer line, saying last week it’s starting to feel the pinch. That may leave carmakers wanting even when chip manufacturers eventually manage to increase capacity.“This has the potential to be a longer-term issue,” said Anna-Marie Baisden, an automotive analyst at Fitch Solutions. “This will only be exacerbated as vehicles become technologically advanced and use more chips.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Chip Shortage Forces Carmakers to Leave Out Some High-End Features

2021-05-11,"Luminar Technologies (LAZR) and Toyota (TM) backed self-driving tech firm Pony.ai are joining forces to enhance safe autonomous driving in complex environments. By teaming up with a global leader in lidar hardware and software technology solutions, Pony.ai hopes to accelerate the development of autonomous driving technology. Pony.ai plans to use lidars made by Luminar in its robotaxis. Lidars, which are a key component in many autonomous vehicles, are laser-based sensors that perceive the surrounding environment as the car maneuvers through the streets. Pony.ai plans to use lidars made by Luminar in its robotaxis. Pony.ai has already provided more than 220,000 robotaxi rides. The company currently offers its services in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing in China, as well as in Irvine and Freemont, California. Pony.ai has also confirmed plans to deploy autonomous fleets across the globe, starting in 2023. The autonomous fleet will come integrated with a Luminar lidar and a slim profile, with the sensors protruding only 10 cm. off the car roof. Last year, Toyota invested $400 million in Pony.ai to accelerate the development of its autonomous driving technology. (See Luminar stock analysis on TipRanks) “Luminar is in a league of their own when it comes to lidar and shares our belief that delivering autonomous mobility globally will enable a safe and sustainable future. We’re excited to realize that vision together with them,” said Pony.ai CEO James Peng. In March, Northland Capital market analyst Gus Richard upgraded Luminar to a Buy from a Hold. The upgrade came on the back of the company unveiling a stack of software solutions as part of its strategic partnership with Zenseact. “Zenseact is supplying Volvo and Luminar will be the supplier for other auto OEMs. We believe this enhances the value of LAZR as most OEMs do not have the wherewithal to develop a full-stack software capability for hands-free highways,” said Richard. Richard has a $38 price target on the stock, implying 91.34% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $28.40 implies 43% upside potential to current levels.

2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. unveiled a 250 billion yen ($2.3 billion) share buyback and expects to return to pre-pandemic profitability in the current fiscal year as its ability to keep churning out vehicles amid a global shortage of automotive chips puts it in a prime position to capitalize on swiftly recovering demand for cars.The Japanese automaker forecast 2.5 trillion yen in operating profit for the 12 months that will end in March, compared with a 2.4 trillion yen profit in fiscal 2019, before the pandemic. Analysts were predicting, on average, an operating profit of 2.7 trillion yen.In a tumultuous period for the auto industry, Toyota quickly pulled ahead of the pack, straightening out its supply chain and ramping up production in order to meet rising demand for cars. The world’s No. 1 automaker now stands primed for the V-shaped Covid recovery eluding many of its peers, which are having to scale back because of the global chip shortage.“Toyota has overcome the chip shortage,” Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co., said. “The forecast is conservative and there could be an upward revision, maybe up to 3 trillion yen of operating income.”By maneuvering through the disruptions of the pandemic, Toyota rose to become the world’s largest automaker last year, wresting the title back from Volkswagen AG. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. by contrast reported an operating loss of 151 billion yen for the fiscal year on Tuesday. Honda Motor Co. is set to announce earnings Friday, with analysts predicting, on average, a profit of 549 billion yen, down about 13% from the previous year.Early MoverEarly implementation of infection-prevention measures and a timely ramp up of production in China, where virus-related disruptions dissipated relatively early, meant Toyota has been able to increase its global output above the previous year’s level each month since August.That allowed Toyota to meet demand for cars that rose swiftly in regions beginning to emerge from lockdown. Overall, unit sales for the fiscal year ended in March were down just 4% versus the previous year.Amid the gloom, Toyota’s results “stand out as particularly bright,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said. The company’s sales are proving sturdy, he said.Stronger-than-anticipated demand for cars threw the auto industry for a loop at the beginning of 2021 when many were hit with the realization they hadn’t ordered enough chips to raise their output. The failure to secure semiconductors, which are crucial to making tech-laden modern cars, is expected to result in millions of lost vehicle sales this year. Experts are saying the dearth will probably get worse before it gets better.The chip shortage is likely to impact 500,000 units of Nissan’s output this current fiscal year, though it aims to recover about half of those losses in the latter half of the year when the crunch begins to ease, said Nissan Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida, speaking at a briefing Tuesday.Toyota has emerged relatively unscathed up until this point thanks to its practice of monitoring small suppliers and stockpiling chips, although a fire that broke out at an automotive chip plant owned by Renesas Electronics Corp. in March still poses a risk to the whole of Japan’s automotive sector.U.S., China DemandToyota’s hybrid system of keeping inventory of some crucial parts gave it a leg up on other automakers depending heavily on the ‘Just-in-time’ manufacturing strategy of keeping a low stock of goods on hand.As the shortage drags on, Toyota still expects to have sufficient semiconductors for production in the near term, though the summer months get a little cloudier, Bob Carter, Toyota’s top sales executive in the U.S., said in a recent interview.Indeed, the company’s performance in the fiscal year just ended was impressive. Even though sales revenue dipped, net income increased on the strength of Toyota’s financial services business and margins rose to 8.3% from 6.8%.The company’s deep contingency planning is putting it in a good position to reap sales from consumers in the U.S. and China who are snapping up cars, emboldened by signs the pandemic is waning. Toyota’s global sales in March rose 44% to 982,912 units, an all-time record for a single month.Long HistoryThe company expects sales for the current fiscal year to touch 10.6 million. Electrified vehicle sales alone should reach 8 million units by 2030.Toyota recently announced plans to introduce 15 EVs globally by 2025, quelling to a certain extent concerns the automaker is falling behind rivals like VW in its development of electric cars.Something few realize is how long Toyota has been developing EVs, Toyota Chief Digital Officer James Kuffner said at a briefing Wednesday. With 25 years of experience developing EV components like motors and power electronics, “Toyota is strongly positioned to lead the world in the best, reliable, low-cost battery-electric vehicles,” Kuffner said.While any rebound may be delayed by the chip shortage, Toyota is likely to recover any lost sales when the situation eases to due to strong underlying auto demand in markets like China, Roman Schorr, a director at Fitch Ratings Ltd. wrote in a recent note. This could help accelerate the recovery in its operating performance and credit metrics to pre-pandemic levels, Schorr said.Toyota shares rose as much as 2.7% Wednesday, before closing up 2.2%, bringing gains for the year to around 7%. The company will do a five-for-one share split per the register as of Sept. 30. The purpose of the stock split is “to reduce the minimum investment price, thereby creating an environment where it is easier to invest in our shares,” Toyota said in its earnings statement.(Updates with executive comment in 18th paragraph, closes shares.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Toyota Roars Back With Robust Profit Forecast, Share Buyback"

2021-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- When American Eagle Outfitters Inc.’s in-person sales took a hit from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, the retailer decided to make a bigger bet on an emerging tool for reaching customers: augmented reality.Suffering from declining sales and mulling store closings, the retailer turned to Snap Inc.’s popular Snapchat video-sharing app to connect with teenagers who could no longer frequent the malls that make up American Eagle’s main business.The retailer of casual polo shirts, blue jeans and trendy swimsuits launched a virtual pop-up holiday shop on Snapchat, which allowed users to browse from among 15 to 20 pieces at a time. As shoppers physically moved their phones around their own rooms, they were also exploring different areas of the digital store, where they could tap on certain products to learn more about them and create a wish list. Then they were prompted to go to American Eagle’s website to finalize the purchase.By the end of the run, American Eagle had sold $2 million in products from the store and had 50 million engagements. The sales were a drop in the bucket for a company that closed the last quarter in 2020 with $1.3 billion in revenue, but represented a new way of reaching younger customers.“It was really a light bulb that, wow, this is a new way to consider not just engaging with Gen Z but also shopping with Gen Z,” said Craig Brommers, American Eagle’s chief marketing officer. “I think we’ll see an acceleration of this trend in the months and years ahead.”The Covid-19 lockdowns and quarantines that forced consumers to turn to websites for everything from food and household goods to clothes and office suppliers provided an opportunity for new AR advertising projects. Worldwide e-commerce sales grew from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.28 trillion in 2020, according to estimates from EMarketer.Bolstering that trend were advertisers who shifted their spending from traditional advertising mediums to social media platforms. Social media advertising revenue grew 16.3% to $41.5 billion last year, representing nearly a third of all digital advertising, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.“This is the next evolution of where e-commerce grows,” said Mark Shmulik, a senior technology analyst at Bernstein. “It just creates more categories that will enable me to either start or continue buying online that otherwise I might have felt less comfortable doing because I couldn’t kind of try it on.”Though Facebook Inc., Pinterest Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok are rolling out new ways to market using AR on their platforms, Snapchat is well positioned to work out the kinks of the augmented reality advertising boom. The app, which boasts some 280 million daily active users, first captured the attention of the under-24 set with disappearing videos and photos that could be enhanced with silly automated effects such as funky hair accessories or the ability to turn one’s face into a cartoon character.The company on Thursday introduced a slew of new services and technology upgrades to bolster its augmented reality-powered shopping experiences. Among the changes Snap is implementing is improving the visibility of its Scan feature, which works with industry partners to allow people to use the app’s camera to identify everyday objects and receive shopping recommendations for clothes.The number of Snapchatters engaging daily with augmented reality “lenses” grew more than 40% last quarter, outpacing the daily active user growth by more than 80%. While regular video advertisements still drive the majority of Snapchat’s revenue, augmented reality is increasingly becoming part of its growth strategy, according to Snap Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman.“The combination of that immersive behavior as well as that convenience of augmented reality are really critical for marketers,” she said. “This is AR’s moment. You have this huge community of people utilizing AR wanting to engage with it every single day and it’s a wide-open space for marketers.”Frito-Lay Inc. last February aired a Super Bowl spot that asked viewers to point a phone’s camera lens in the Snapchat app toward the screen to unlock a free bag of Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc. opened a new hair salon that uses augmented reality to allow customers to virtually try on hair colors and point their phones at products to learn more.NYX Professional Makeup, Lexus, Gucci and other brands all pushed out new immersive advertising experiences, allowing shoppers to explore their products without having to step a single foot into a store. Companies are launching AR try-on experiences on their own while also turning to platforms such as Snap, Facebook and Pinterest to reach new customers.More than traditional types of marketing such as magazine and television spots, customers who engage with augmented reality campaigns are actively choosing to explore a brand. Companies that utilize AR marketing are also abandoning older aspirational forms of advertising, based on Photoshopped models in idealized scenarios, in favor of encouraging customers to turn themselves into brand ambassadors. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amanda Diaz (@amandadiaz) In turn, those social media users may adorn their faces with a new makeup release or virtually try out a clothing line, and then share the outcome with their friends. On top of that, users who engage with try-on experiences on apps might be less likely to return the products they purchase, potentially reducing costs for companies.Augmented reality “stimulates the user more than a regular content,” said Antoine Vu, cofounder of the augmented reality design firm Atomic Digital Design. “You become the actor of the content you are listening to or you’re watching or learning [from]. You are kind of living the content.”The technology still has hurdles to cross before it becomes a major advertising strategy, according to industry experts. For starters, augmented reality is most popular among Generation Z, who are roughly between the ages of 10 and 25, and who may be more digitally savvy but lack the buying power of older consumers.And commerce innovations that might have seemed useful to shoppers who were trapped at home during the pandemic may become less attractive once they feel more free to return to brick-and-mortar stores. AR campaigns are also still viewed among some brands as expensive and onerous to produce.“The onus is on us to ensure that advertisers are clear that this is no longer an incredibly complex thing to build,” Snap’s Gorman said. “It doesn’t take a long time. It’s not terribly expensive and they can reach their most engaged audience with it.”Innovations in augmented reality will need to evolve if marketers want to extend the moment into a long-lasting and accessible advertising strategy. Most companies that are embracing it so far are beauty, clothing and furniture brands looking to take advantage of try-on experiences.Industry experts envision more robust adoption of other potential use cases, even for in-person shoppers -- such as labels on products in department stores that prompt potential buyers to use their phones to explore a brand’s story in augmented reality. Shoppers in furniture stores could change the wall color to see if a sofa they want matches their decor; restaurants could help diners envision how their food would look spread across their own kitchen tables.While Snapchat is a front-runner, the competition to sell AR advertising opportunities to brands is heating up. In 2018, Facebook started offering AR-enabled advertising capabilities, which were embraced by brands such as Universal Music Group and Michael Kors. Later, the company expanded AR try-on features to Instagram Shops, where users browse curated collections from brands, and plans to expand that capability to Facebook Shops. The social-media company is currently testing adding AR advertising to its Dynamic Ads service, which lets companies target customers who looked at a product online but didn’t buy it.In addition to Snap and Facebook, companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Pinterest, and Amazon are also making moves to push into AR-enabled products and services. As tech companies race to bring to market more advanced AR headsets and glasses, they will likely pave the way for companies to embrace even more creative types of marketing campaigns.Now on a subway ride, “you just see everybody sitting down with their necks down looking at their devices,” said Shmulik. “I think that the next wave is going to be a bit more heads up.”There are signs that at the very least AR advertising will outlive the pandemic. As the U.S. economy started to open up in late February more Snapchatters posted stories and engaged with the app’s interactive map. The following month, more users created new friendships and chatted more with the ones they already had, according to the company. Snapchat is betting that more user engagement on the app will translate into more engagement with AR campaigns.“This is, in my opinion, not a trend that is going backwards,” Gorman said.Last year, Snap reached out to Zenni Optical, an online-only eyeglass brand, about starting an AR advertising campaign. In October, the company launched a try-on experience with several of its glasses -- from designs wth polka dots to animal-print varieties --- and sample accessories, said Deanna Dawson, head of social media and content marketing.

2021-05-28,"(Bloomberg) -- A century after automakers showed the world the value of assembly-line manufacturing, a shortage of semiconductors is teaching the industry a painful new lesson in what it takes to build a car.For most of its history, the industry has relied on a distinct approach to buying car parts, procuring components from suppliers right at the moment they’re needed. It’s referred to as just-in-time manufacturing and is designed to streamline production and eliminate the costs of keeping warehouses stocked with parts waiting to be used.But the shortcomings of that system were made starkly clear this year as the automakers confronted a dearth of the chips they need to build advanced functions into their vehicles, and found themselves near the bottom of chipmakers’ customer lists because of their just-in-time approach. That shortage is threatening to cut $110 billion in sales from the industry, and forcing auto manufacturers to overhaul the way they get the electronic components that have become critical to contemporary car design.“Customers need to change,” said Hassane El-Khoury, chief executive officer of ON Semiconductor Corp., which gets more than a third of its revenue from the automotive market. “That just-in-time mindset doesn’t work.”Semiconductor makers are demanding guaranteed, long-term orders rather than the short-term flexibility the carmakers are used to. The chipmakers’ assertiveness, even under pressure from lawmakers, underscores the rebalancing of power from the companies whose logos are on the cars to those that provide the advanced technology that runs them.As these components play a bigger role in everything from in-car entertainment to self-driving functions, chip manufacturers say they’re willing to invest in expanding production to head off a repeat of shortages that have forced the industry to mothball factories and furlough workers -- if the carmakers give them orders that can’t be canceled and commit to long-term agreements.“Why would I have invested a single dollar when my customer can cancel within 30 days and it takes me two years to build capacity?” ON Semiconductor’s El-Khoury said.There are signs the industry is listening. Last week, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley indicated a new willingness to reverse decades of outsourcing for parts.“As the industry changes, we have to in-source now, just like we in-sourced powertrains in the ’20s and ’30s,” said Farley, who has shut down half his factories and seen his dealers’ lots emptying because of a dearth of chips.Most components used by the auto industry are part of a discrete food chain, and carmakers are at the top, able to orchestrate their suppliers’ actions in a system that delivers them a set of components that can be put together quickly and cheaply into a finished vehicle. Electronics makers, who’ve fared much better in the chip supply crunch, regard semiconductors as essential systems, and they work directly with chipmakers to secure products and often design their devices around the chips themselves.Automakers can no longer “assume the dominance of an 800-pound gorilla” in negotiations with chip companies and battery makers, said Mark Wakefield, head of the auto practice at consultancy AlixParters.Pioneered by Toyota Motor Corp. in the 1960s, just-in-time is a system where components suppliers are required to turn up with whatever the carmakers want at the last possible moment in a process that pares costs to the very minimum.That strategy has served the industry well, saving money and helping it organize a system for sourcing the 40,000 or so components that go into a modern vehicle, many of which can be made in a matter of days. But semiconductors -- the heart of sensors, engine management and battery controllers, infotainment and eventually systems that will pilot vehicles -- are created in a process that takes months. And building and equipping a factory to produce them requires years.Today’s cars contain an average of 1,400 semiconductors -- and that puts the chipmakers at an advantage. Ford’s Farley said he’s now negotiating contracts directly with chipmakers -- bypassing his traditional auto suppliers -- while building up inventory of the precious pieces and even redesigning models to accommodate the semiconductor companies.“We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components,” Farley told analysts last month as he announced Ford would lose half its production in the second quarter and take a $2.5 billion hit to earnings this year, citing a lack of chips. “We’re also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries and silicon and all sorts of other components that are really mission critical for our company.”Ford is not alone in seeking solutions that upend long-time industry practices. Automakers from General Motors Co. to Volkswagen AG to Tesla Inc. are looking for ways to get closer to the chipmaking process, which could include forming partnerships with semiconductor companies, bringing chipmaking in-house and even building their own foundries. Nothing is off the table.“Cars are only going to get more technical and they’re going to need more chips,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of vehicle forecasting at consultant AutoForecast Solutions. “All of the vehicle manufacturers are looking at every possible scenario for getting it solved for the long-term.”But according to some chipmakers, the auto industry has embraced new technology but failed to understand those that supply it.“There is a huge difference between manufacturing a car and manufacturing a chip,” said Kurt Sievers, CEO of NXP Semiconductor NV, the biggest maker of auto chips. “We’ve been working for years closely with the auto OEMs directly when it comes to R&D and innovation -- however, not at all for supply chain and volume forecasting.”Sievers said the chip industry wants specific forecasts that stretch out in years and binding commitments to buy chips that last that long. The way automakers, referred to as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs, and semiconductor vendors work together needs to change, he said.And the car companies have little choice but to do so. Consumers are increasingly choosing vehicles based on functions such as connectivity, entertainment and advanced automated safety features. The auto industry is steadily shifting away from gasoline to battery power. All of that requires more chips.“It’s no longer this subsystem that no one cares about,” said Victor Peng, CEO of Xilinx Inc. a chipmaker whose products are uses in advanced driver-assistance systems. “The electronics is really going to shape the customer experience.”The semiconductor industry has plenty of other orders to fill. In 2020 automakers bought almost $40 billion worth of chips, little changed from the prior year, even amid the crash of the pandemic. By comparison, the computer industry bought 17% more chips than it did in 2019, for a total of $160 billion. Phone makers, meantime, provided the chip industry with $137 billion in revenue, a jump of 12%.Earlier this year, automakers lobbied U.S. lawmakers to intervene to help them with the shortage, arguing that chipmakers were unfairly prioritizing customers building less important consumer electronics over cars. The automakers argue their industry creates more than 7 million jobs in America and is critical to national security. And they’ve found a sympathetic ear in President Joe Biden, who was supported by the United Auto Workers in the 2020 election, and is working to help the auto industry navigate the chip crisis.Still, consumer electronics buys $20 billion more chips a year than the auto industry, and Big Tech has plenty of clout in Washington, too.Chipmakers are also in no hurry to add new factories to meet this year’s chip rush. Though 2020 was a good year and 2021 is shaping up to be even better, they don’t have to look back very far to be reminded of the difficulties of matching supply with short-term fluctuations in demand. In 2019 industry sales shrank 12% as customers slashed orders to work through stockpiles.Many investors and analysts are already concerned that what now looks like insatiable demand is customers double-ordering: asking for twice the amount they need so they can at least get the number they want. In the past, such heavy ordering has proved to foreshadow industry gluts, with demand eventually easing and buyers tapping the brakes as they worked down accumulated inventory.“We came out of 2018 guns blazing, everybody hoarded, and then 2019 was an awful year of demand because they already had chips,” said ON Semiconductor’s El Khoury. “Here we are today with people looking at us and asking, ‘why haven’t you invested?’”The type of chip automakers want also works against them. Much of what they use -- things such as sensors and power regulators -- can be made on what’s called lagging nodes, or production technology that hasn’t been state-of-the-art for years. While that makes it cheaper, chipmakers are reluctant to expand capacity of technology that’s closer to being obsolete.“The chips that the automotive industry uses are older than the ones you’d find in your cell phones or in your video games,” said AutoForecast Solutions’ Fiorani. “That makes them less of a priority to the companies that produce them.”Fiorani said carmakers would be better served forming joint ventures with chipmakers to tap their expertise and lock down a dependable source of supply. But doing that would involve going around traditional suppliers such as Continental AG and Robert Bosch AG and turning back the clock to a more expensive time when companies like Ford had to deal with suppliers for raw materials.Some auto suppliers are already taking steps to make sure they don’t get cut out. Parts supplier Robert Bosch is opening a new chip factory in Dresden that it says is the first of its kind dedicated to manufacturing semiconductors for automotive uses. Still, some automakers are already talking openly about cutting out those middlemen in order to keep up with the speed of change.“We will be the one who has the commercial relationship with the chipmaker,” Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said at a mobility conference in Tel Aviv this month. “When we want a change and you have to talk to suppliers, it is too slow.”Ford’s Farley said he’s consulted with tech companies and discovered how common it is in other industries to keep “buffer stock” and to buy directly from chip manufacturers.“Even if the company still buys the components with chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal,” he told analysts, describing something that’s common practice for companies like Apple Inc. Ford learned that nine of its tier-one component suppliers rely on just one Renesas Electronics Corp. factory in Japan for chips, a plant that suffered a fire, he said.Some automakers have made rapid progress in understanding their newer suppliers and are negotiating long-term deals. Others are sticking to the belief that they can dictate how their suppliers should act, according to ON Semiconductor’s El-Khoudry.Learning from their current difficulties is the key to turning around the current crisis and avoiding the next, according to Xilinx’s Peng. Toyota, the inventor of just-in-time, said it expects to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability as soon as this year, helped by factories that continue to churn out vehicles because the company made the decision to accumulate stockpiles of chips.“People have to think differently or they’re going to be left behind,” Peng said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Carmakers Forced by Chip Crisis to Rethink Just-In-Time Ordering
