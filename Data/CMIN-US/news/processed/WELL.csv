2019-02-17,"One of the essential first lessons that investors learn is diversifying a portfolio reduces risk. That's because different assets often react differently to the same event. A downturn in one asset when interest rates rise, for example, may be counter-balanced by an upswing in another. By holding diverse assets, a portfolio becomes less sensitive to market swings.Diversification is recommended not only across asset classes, but across geographies. This is especially true for real estate, since the value of a property is largely determined by the local economy. A real estate investment trust (REIT) that performs poorly in the U.S. may generate good overall results from the performance of its European and Asian assets.Investors could be taking on unnecessary risk by limiting their holdings to US-centric REITs. Many large U.S. REITs recognize this threat and are diversifying their holdings across geographies. Global expansion not only trims geographic risk, but benefits overall performance by giving these REITs a foothold in faster-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, where an expanding middle class is fueling the creation of wealth.Here are 12 mega-sized REITs - many with rising dividends - that also offer diverse international exposure and generous yields. We've also included an extra real-estate play that's not organized as a REIT but is worthy nonetheless.

2019-03-28,"With the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting on pause, the search for yield continues with pace. Add to that, speculation that there may even be a rate cut by the end of the year, and it becomes clear that investors, especially those who need that dividend must find companies that have growing and stable cash flows to sustain and increase yields over time.With global growth slowing as well, it is critical that the companies are not cyclical or prone to severe revenue declines in the face of an economic downturn. The phrase &quot;demographics is destiny&quot; continues to be relevant.The U.S. population is aging. No surprise there. By 2029, more than 20% of the total U.S. population will be over the age of 65. This group will increasingly need to find healthcare facilities to support their needs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Mid-Cap Growth Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon or Netflix The trend of higher demand for specialized healthcare facilities and services is a secular one, and healthcare spending is a category that individuals simply cannot cut regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare REITs are primed to benefit. Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH)Source: Shutterstock Forward Dividend Yield: 13.2%*  Market Capitalization: $2.8 billionNow trading near its 52-week low and giving up the gains during the v-shaped recovery, Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH) provides an attractive entry point sporting a 13% yield.That yield just cannot be ignored in the current low-rate environment. There has been some weakness in the senior housing sector, but the diversity of its portfolio, especially in medical offices and life sciences, balance out the risk of a particular property type. SNH also has significant geographic diversity, with properties across 42 states and no more than 16% of real estate value in any one state.The major overhang on the stock has been the concern over Five Star Senior Living's (NASDAQ:FVE), which owns 184 of 304 total senior living centers. Five Star is the fourth largest senior living operator in the nation and still has a $100 million credit facility to draw on.In the meantime, SNH has worked with FVE to temporarily defer certain rent payments, which is better for the long-term relationship and outcome on both sides. This seems like an idiosyncratic risk overblown to the downside, giving opportunistic buyers a great window to pounce. Welltower Inc. (WELL)Forward Dividend Yield: 4.5%  Market Capitalization: $31 billionSource: Shutterstock Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) has been strategically expanding and acquiring with great success. The company has improved the quality of assets in its portfolio and the portfolio mix. They have restructured low performing assets, selling off when appropriate, and taken those funds to purchase properties across senior housing, outpatient medical, and health systems.In 2018 alone, WELL completed more than $4 billion of accretive investments. WELL's efforts to diversify and reinvest at higher rates of return are paying off. The Company increased current year guidance for net income attributable to common stockholders to $2.70 to $2.85 per share, while reaffirming their previously announced 2019 normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders of $4.10 to $4.25 per share.  * 5 Industrial ETFs to Consider for the Second Quarter As management continues to make accretive changes, I expect the quality of cash flow to improve along with private pay percentage to increase. This all bodes well for long-term value creation.

As such, they understand the future in the medical office building (MOB) lies off-campus.Prices are lower and to accommodate rapidly increasing demand, they will see higher usage. Given this continued shift toward outpatient, DOC is poised to benefit. Additionally, management has been very successful in improving profitability.EBITDA margins are up from 57% in 2015 to 70% over the last twelve months. It's an impressive feat with runway ahead.

2019-05-20,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips One of the painful but crucial lessons that the re escalating trade war has taught us is that anything can happen Just a few weeks ago a resolution between the U S and China appeared an inevitability Now,7 Assisted-Living Stocks to Buy Now
2019-05-20,"One of the painful but crucial lessons that the re-escalating trade war has taught us is that anything can happen. Just a few weeks ago, a resolution between the U.S. and China appeared an inevitability. Now, even the idea of getting together for talks is questionable. That said, not all stocks to buy are vulnerable to unexpected sentiment shifts.If you're seeking a market segment that will likely produce strong gains over the next decade, it's time to look at assisted-living stocks. Elderly care operates on two core principles. First, it's our moral and ethical obligation to help those that cannot help themselves. Second, aging happens to everyone. Therefore, these specialized-care facilities will essentially exist forever.Other fundamental factors support the case for assisted-living stocks to buy. The biggest tailwind is the sheer size of the baby boomer demographic. Between 1946 and 1964, the U.S. experienced 76 million births. By 2012, 11 million of this generation had died, but that still leaves 65 million survivors. That's a lot of folks that will seek care during their golden years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, advancing technologies in medicine and nutrition have noticeably increased our ability to extend our life. True, life expectancy is falling in this country. However, much of that can be attributed to the opioid crisis, which largely affects younger Americans. Overall, though, the point stands: healthcare innovations have had a net positive impact on baby boomers, which in turn affects assisted-living stocks to buy.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week Best of all, the demand exists irrespective of economic or market conditions. It's an area that politically, Washington power-brokers cannot simply gloss over. Unlike discretionary sectors, specialized care levers a very human face. With that, here are seven assisted-living stocks to buy: Welltower (WELL)One of the attributes that attracted me to Welltower (NYSE:WELL) was that it's among Fortune's most admired companies of 2019. From a PR perspective, that's a huge story. As you probably know, assisted-living stocks don't enjoy the greatest of reputations due to scandalous stories of senior abuse.But as an investor, WELL stock provides many other substantive points to chew on. Primarily, shares have performed admirably this year, gaining over 18% since the January opener. Not only that, WELL recovered quickly from last year's broader market selloff. It ended 2018 with a return of 15%, whereas many other companies floundered.If that doesn't convince you to put WELL among your list of stocks to buy, consider its dividend. With a 4.4% yield, this can provide comfortable support should the markets experience a downturn. Ensign Group (ENSG)If you want pure exposure to assisted-living stocks to buy, take a good look at Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG). Headquartered in Mission Viejo, California, ENSG stock is levered toward a robust local economy. Moreover, it offers comprehensive solutions for the elderly, including in-house therapy and hospice care.As with Welltower, ENSG stock exhibits tremendous resilience, even in the face of troubling market conditions. It absorbed a sharp blow during the broader selloff in late 2018. However, shares quickly bounced back. By the second half of February, ENSG had recovered all of its prior losses and then some.  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy That said, Ensign Group's equity is more representative of growth names than say dividend stocks to buy. For instance, ENSG is up 49% year-to-date, but only offers a miniscule 0.33% yield. Still, if you want to bet on extremely favorable demographics, Ensign is a great idea. Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI)Another strong name among assisted-living stocks to buy is Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI). After working through some operational issues, management started this year off on an aggressive footing. In the first quarter, Omega bought out MedEquities Realty Trust (NYSE:MRT), which should boost the operational profile of OHI stock.However, you wouldn't guess that Omega was running on less than 100% of its cylinders by looking at its chart. On a year-to-date basis, OHI stock is up slightly over 15%. Last year, shares returned 40%. As you might imagine, the company hardly blinked during the recent downturn.I expect more of the same should the economy go sour due to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. Recent quarterly revenues suggest that management is likely to overcome miscues from the past. Also, OHI stock pays out a very generous 7% dividend yield, which should attract shelter-seeking investors. HCP (HCP)A key advantage in acquiring assisted-living stocks to buy is their inverse correlation to current market conditions. For instance, while the benchmark S&P 500 index is down roughly 2% this month, senior-care specialist HCP (NYSE:HCP) has gained almost 7%.It was the same story last year. In the final quarter of 2018, the S&P 500 dropped 10%. On the other hand, HCP stock shot up just under 10% over the same time frame.I expect a similar dynamic if the markets slow down due to trade-war related complications. As with the other organizations in this segment, HCP stock will enjoy consistent, if not growing demand. Furthermore, HCP levers wider coverage of the healthcare sector, including life science, hospital and medical-office properties.  * 7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks for Industry Expansion Finally, HCP pays out a generous 4.7% dividend. Typically, income-generating companies fare better than pure growth names during a bear market. That's one more reason to put HCP in your list of stocks to buy! National HealthCare (NHC)Admittedly, some of the top names among assisted-living stocks represent speculation toward a corporate turnaround. What I like about National HealthCare (AMEX:NHC), though, is their &quot;steady as she goes&quot; financials. For instance, over the past four years, revenue for NHC stock has grown consecutively. This trend continued up to its most recent first quarter of 2019 earnings report.Granted, the growth rate isn't anything to write home about, which is essentially low single digits. But with the massive demographic tailwind that NHC stock benefits from, I'm not sure if they need crazy growth. Approximately 10,000 baby boomers retire each day, which will eventually translate to a robust clientele.Plus, National HealthCare pays out a 2.6% dividend yield. While the payout isn't as attractive as some of the other stocks to buy that I mentioned, the company's upwardly trekking sales is a significant positive. Capital Senior Living (CSU)While assisted-living stocks generally have a boring reputation -- how many of you got really jazzed about this segment? -- not all sector players fit that description. If you're the type to mix your gambling with elderly care, Capital Senior Living (NYSE:CSU) may be right for you.However, I don't want to mislead you in any way: CSU stock is one of the riskiest investments, both in assisted living and the broader markets. Last year was particularly awful for the organization, which suffered from slowing revenues and widening net-income losses. This dynamic was unhelpful to its overbearing long-term debt, to say the least.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio Still, some hope exists for a turnaround. Revenue in Q1 was in line with the year-ago haul, suggesting that the sales bleed has stopped. Also, CSU stock has stabilized since hitting rock-bottom in March. It's super-risky, but that's sort of the point. Brookdale Senior Living (BKD)Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE:BKD) is a contradiction. On one hand, it levers the fundamentals that should make BKD stock a top player in the markets. Despite many troubled years, Brookdale is still the nation's top senior-housing owner and operator.But on the other hand, we've got to talk about those troubles. Since 2016, Brookdale's annual revenue has declined consecutively. Even worse, its Q1 2019 sales haul of $1 billion slipped more than 12% year-over-year. It has a sizable debt load and its net-income losses have widened considerably over the years.As a result, BKD stock has fallen into the dumps. But if you're a diehard contrarian, Brookdale may have something for you. Again, it's the top senior-housing operator in America. When you factor in the baby boomer demographic wave, BKD might make some big surprises.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-20,"With U.S. population rapidly aging, it is not surprising that many prescient real estate investors embrace healthcare real estate investment trusts (REITs). Some REIT ETFs have been delivering sturdy performances this year, but not all traditional REITs are healthcare REITs.Look at the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. That index serves as the benchmark for the largest U.S. REIT ETF, but that fund devotes just 9% of its weight to healthcare REITs and four other REIT segments have larger weights in that fund.&quot;Health care REITs own and manage a variety of health care-related real estate and collect rent from tenants,&quot; according to Nareit. &quot;Health care REITs' property types include senior living facilities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne reason healthcare REITs are not heavily represented in traditional REIT ETFs is that just are not many of these type of REITs. There are just 18 healthcare REITs with a combined market value of $105.41 billion, according to Nareit data.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Here are some REIT ETFs to consider with hefty healthcare exposure. iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (REZ)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.48% per year, or $48 on a $10,000 investment.As its name implies, the iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:REZ) is a REIT ETF dedicated to residential real estate, the segment in which healthcare REITs reside. The $433.35 million REZ tracks the FTSE Nareit All Residential Capped Index and holds 44 stocks, nearly a third of which are healthcare REITs.Residential REITs are among the REITs most sensitive to changes in interest rates, but with the Federal Reserve not expected to boost rates this year and some market observers even speculating on a rate cut, REZ is up 16.65%.REZ has a three-year standard deviation of 13.84%, which is slightly higher than the category average, but that is a reflection of the aforementioned rate sensitivity. Residential REITs, including some healthcare fare, can carry lower dividend yield than traditional REIT funds as highlighted by the trailing 12-month dividend yield of 3.18% on REZ. Global X Longevity Thematic ETF (LNGR) Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.50%Admittedly, the Global X Longevity Thematic ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR) is a bit of a stretch as a healthcare REIT fund. It is not a focused ETF by any means, but it is a credible play on the aging population theme and LNGR does allocate over 8% of its weight to healthcare REITs. This thematic ETF, which recently turned three years old, tracks the Indxx Global Longevity Thematic Index.LNGR &quot;seeks to invest in companies positioned to serve the world's growing senior population through exposure to health care, pharmaceuticals, senior living facilities and other sectors that contribute to increasing lifespans and extending quality of life in advanced age,&quot; according to Global X.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Are Also Perfect for Retirement LNGR is more of a healthcare ETF in disguise than a real estate fund. Nearly 80% of the fund's 96 holdings are healthcare equipment, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals makers, giving investors some growth avenues in their quest for healthcare REIT exposure. iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (ICF)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.34%The iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (CBOE:ICF) tracks the Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index and is a focused REIT ETF with just 30 holdings. ICF is not a dedicated healthcare REIT ETF. The fund features exposure to seven REIT segments, including a 9.22% weight to healthcare REITs.ICF is one of the best-performing traditional REIT ETFs this year with a gain of 18.10% and currently resides near record highs. Specialized, residential and retail REITs combine for almost two-thirds of ICF's weight.The fund's standard deviation is less than that of the aforementioned REZ and ICF has a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.72%. Janus Long-Term Care ETF (OLD)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.35%The Janus Long-Term Care ETF (NASDAQ:OLD) is another thematic ETF dedicated to the aging population theme.OLD &quot;seeks exposure to companies globally that are positioned to profit from providing long-term care to the aging population. These include companies owning or operating senior living facilities, nursing services, specialty hospitals or senior housing, as well as biotech companies for age-related illnesses and companies that sell products and services to such facilities,&quot; according to Janus.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential OLD allocates almost 65% of its weight to real estate stocks and over a third of its weight to the healthcare sector. Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) and Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR), two of the largest healthcare REITs, combine for almost a third of OLD's weight and the fund features several other healthcare REITs among its top 10 holdings. In other words, OLD is one of the most credible healthcare REIT ETFs on the market today. SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.25%At just over 18 years old, the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:RWR) is one of the oldest REIT ETFs on the market. With 95 holdings, RWR features a deeper bench than some of the other funds highlighted here. Those holdings have a weighted average market value of $20.48 billion.Among traditional REIT ETFs, RWR's healthcare REIT exposure of 11.10% is pretty solid. The fund's one-year funds from operations (FFO) growth is 2.54%. FFO is the key REIT valuation metric used to assess the financial quality of REITs and the ability of those companies to sustain and grow dividends.Welltower and Ventas are among RWR's top 10 holdings. The fund has a dividend yield of 3.63% and is up 16.47% year-to-date. First Trust S&P REIT Index Fund (FRI)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.50%The First Trust S&P REIT Index Fund (NYSEARCA:FRI) is often overlooked in the REIT ETF conversation, but for investors that want healthcare REIT exposure under the umbrella of a traditional real estate fund, FRI is a sensible option.FRI, which recently turned 12 years old, devotes almost 13% of its weight to healthcare REITs, which is pretty solid among standard REIT funds. Welltower and Ventas are also found among the is real estate fund's top 10 holdings. Residential, retail and specialized REITs combine for about 52% of FRI's roster.  * 3 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Haul FRI is a decent fund, but there are cheaper real estate ETFs on the market, some with more robust healthcare exposure and some that simply outperform this product. Over the past three years, FRI is trailing the largest domestic REIT ETF by 120 basis points. Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.07%For cost-conscious investors, the Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) is one of the best REIT ETFs to consider because it is one of the least expensive. Plus, Schwab clients get the added benefit of being able to trade this fund commission-free.Home to 99 stocks, SCHH is a mostly prosaic approach to REITs, but there is nothing wrong with that. The $5.40 billion fund allocates 11.20% of its weight to healthcare REITs with the bulk of that exposure allocated to Ventas and Welltower, in that order.SCHH allocates about 40% of its weight to residential and retail REITs. Up 16.80% this year, SCHH yields 2.82%.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.Compare Brokers The post 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs appeared first on InvestorPlace.",7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- By all accounts, it was supposed to be a sleepy August for the U.S. corporate bond market. Three weeks ago, the thinking went something like this: Sure, the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark lending rate on July 31, in what Chair Jerome Powell would call a “mid-cycle adjustment.” But Treasuries were already pricing in such a move on the short end. Further out on the curve, the 30-year yield was about 2.6%, still more than 50 basis points away from its all-time low. Ten-year yields were about 2%, which seemed like a comfortable range for both buyers and sellers. For company finance officers, it had the makings of a sellers’ market but one that would be around once summer drew to a close.Then things got crazy. The 30-year yield lurched lower by 8 basis points on Aug. 1, then 13 basis points on Aug. 5, then another 13 basis points on Aug. 12. After a one-day reprieve near its all-time low of 2.0882%, it cruised through that level, tumbling to as low as 1.914%. The rally was so intense that the U.S. Treasury Department made an unusual, unscheduled announcement that it was again exploring issuing 50- or 100-year bonds. Companies clearly felt they couldn’t afford to pass up this opportunity. In the first full week of August, CVS Health Corp., Humana Inc. and Welltower Inc. headlined $35 billion of debt sales among investment-grade firms, easily surpassing estimates. Then in the week through Aug. 16, more than $22 billion went through, including a rarely seen offering from Exxon Mobil to the tune of $7 billion. Market watchers expected that would just about wrap things up until after Labor Day on Sept. 2.Some finance officers had other ideas. 3M Co. borrowed $3.25 billion on Monday to help finance its acquisition of medical-products maker Acelity Inc. In total, issuers sold $6.65 billion of investment-grade debt on Aug. 19, already topping some predictions for $5 billion this week. Then on Tuesday, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. priced $1 billion at the lower end of its expected yield range, along with a handful of other borrowers with multimillion-dollar deals.All this is to say, companies are simple: They see staggering low yields, and they issue bonds. Investors, for their part, can’t get enough of them. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index has returned 13.3% so far in 2019. Over the past 12 months, the index is up 12.5%, compared with just 1.5% for the S&P 500 Index. The average spread on corporate bonds has widened to 122 basis points, from 107 basis points at the end of July, but that’s just because they couldn’t keep up with the relentless rally in Treasuries, not because of a lack of buyers.  If Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen are correct, the demand in credit markets has lasting power. They say the $16 trillion of negative-yielding debt globally has left investors — and particularly those outside the U.S. — with few alternatives besides purchasing companies’ debt. “There is a wall of new money being forced into the global corporate bond market,” they wrote on Aug. 16. “Given the near extinction of non-USD IG yield, foreign investors are forced to take more risk.”Of course, buying investment-grade bonds hardly qualifies as a speculative endeavor. Exxon Mobil, in fact, has the same credit rating as the U.S. government from both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. On the other hand, Bloomberg News’s Jeannine Amodeo and Davide Scigliuzzo reported this week that three leveraged-loan sales that had been languishing in the U.S. market for weeks were pulled as investors sought higher-quality assets. Vewd Software became the fourth on Tuesday, scrapping a $125 million term loan due to market conditions. Leveraged loans, it should be noted, are floating-rate securities and so face weaker demand when the Fed appears poised to cut rates, as it does now. But for large, highly rated companies, their behavior in recent weeks is exactly what should be expected. Exxon Mobil issued 30-year bonds to yield 3.095%. In November, five-year Treasuries offered the same amount. 3M, rated a few steps below triple-A, priced 30-year debt to yield 3.37%, less than the going rate on long Treasury bonds just nine months ago. No matter how you slice it, they’re getting borrowing costs that seemed unthinkable around this time last year.Interestingly, these low yields should be encouraging governments to borrow more, too. I wrote last week that the bond markets were begging for infrastructure spending. However, it seems neither Germany nor the U.S. has any appetite for that sort of initiative. The German government is reportedly preparing fiscal stimulus that could be triggered by a deep recession, while President Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out a payroll tax cut to stave off any economic weakness.It’s certainly possible that U.S. yields will only fall further from here, and other companies can also borrow or refinance at rock-bottom interest rates. But the move in global bond markets in recent weeks could was extreme, to say the least. The weak demand for Germany’s 30-year bond auction on Wednesday, which offered a coupon of 0% at a yield of -0.11%, suggests there are at least some lines that investors won’t cross.For prudent companies, it was well worth delaying summer vacations to get their deals done.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-08-23,"[Editor's note: &quot;The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]If you're looking for consistent market success, the best thing you can do is to expand your time horizon. Chasing flavors of the week could profit you in the immediate frame, but too often, an unexpected event can derail your position. However, by picking ideas from the best long-term stocks, you improve your odds significantly.Primarily, a financially sound company's trading dynamics will replicate the law of averages. Nearer-term pressures and unfavorable news events can negatively impact the organization, but in the longer run, the fundamentals take over.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, time evens out the volatility. That's not the case for swing trades, where outliers can have a disproportionate effect.Moreover, genuine long-term stocks to buy usually have bullish arguments that extend beyond technical factors. A proven track record is a typically common attribute, as are other tailwinds, such as strong financial performances, or a robust, underlying industry.To better maximize these &quot;patient&quot; investments, investors should focus not just on corporate-growth prospects, but sector growth as well. In many cases, a rising tide lifts all boats, irrespective of individual performance.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip To that end, I present my top seven stocks to buy for the long haul: Wayfair (W)Some trends are significant but difficult to quantify. Others are patently obvious. A prime example is shifting consumer behavior toward e-commerce outlets.Source: Shutterstock Put simply, online sales represent an increasing share of total retail sales. This undeniable fact has always led me to recommend a longer-term position in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).I'm not backing away from that opinion. Amazon attracts all customers, but notably those in the middle-income bracket. It's also pushing into extremely lucrative markets like smart speakers.Its role in the economies of tomorrow is assured. But I don't want to keep talking about the same company  again . That's why I'm putting Wayfair (NYSE:W) front and center on my long-term stocks to buy list.Wayfair is an online retailer specializing in home goods such as furniture and decorative products. And business has been good, with W generating nearly 45% direct-retail sales growth last year.The problem? Its net income is negative. Coincidentally, that's always been Amazon's issue until a few years ago. So long as shareholders continue to see top-line growth, they appear willing to overlook the bottom line.Over time, Wayfair could end up becoming a smaller version of Amazon, which isn't a bad gig. FedEx (FDX)Being as diplomatic as possible, the Trump administration has been a mixed blessing for the economy. On one hand, Trump has reinvigorated domestic industries, with calls about putting American interests first. But on the other hand, he hasn't produced a great image abroad in the non-Russian part of the world.A sharp consequence of Trump's foreign policy is the ongoing tariff wars with China. With the Asian economic giant being an exporting power, international couriers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) felt the heat. As an example, FedEx delivered great results for its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings report. Unfortunately, investors panicked on FDX stock due to shipment-slowdown fears.That's a shame because I strongly view FedEx as one of the best long-term stocks to buy. Outside of the tariff issue, the courier, along with rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), benefits from the aforementioned e-commerce trend. Consumers are no longer shopping in brick-and-mortar stores in the same volume like prior generations. The positive tailwind for both couriers is readily apparent.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Critics may counter that Amazon is experimenting on their own delivery service. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the impact is likely overstated. The economies of scale involved in trying to take down a FedEx or UPS is enormous. Besides, the e-commerce sector will balloon to a size big enough for all current competitors. Welltower (WELL)You hardly think about this when you're younger. But as the earth continues to revolve around the sun, you get closer to the inevitability of old age. After enough complete revolutions, you're at a point where you may no longer physically take care of yourself.Source: Shutterstock Handling the challenges in senior-living solutions is Welltower (NYSE:WELL). Welltower is a real-estate investment trust that focuses largely on senior-housing and assisted-living facilities. The company also specializes in memory-care communities, post-acute care facilities and medical-office properties.The need for Welltower's primary business is obvious. Currently, Baby Boomers represent the largest living generation in the U.S. A significant number of this demographic are already retirement age, and soon, the majority will enter their golden years. That substantially boosts prospects for WELL stock, especially if you have a long-term strategy.Moreover, I believe Welltower's structure as a REIT is an advantage in this sector. Direct plays like Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE:BKD) appear enticing at first. However, look deeper at the financials, and you'll likely discover a flawed opportunity. Welltower better absorbs sector risk by spreading it across multiple properties. Rosetta Stone (RST)I dare say that most Americans take for granted that English is the uncontested international language. Everything that we consume has an English translation. Whenever we go to a foreign country, we can expect at least someone to speak some English.Source: Wesley Fryer via FlickrWe really don't think twice about this dynamic because of historical imperialism. Western values and culture are exported everywhere thanks to ubiquitous brands like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). But how long is this dynamic going to last? Even in our own nation, we're experiencing profound demographic shifts.Internationally, these changes are even more dramatic. Already, Chinese is the most spoken language in the world. Considering that China's population is roughly 1.4 billion, this fact will become further solidified.Here's the bottom line: Whether English remains the international standard, America cannot survive as a monoglot nation. That's where Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) comes in. As makers of language-education software, RST provides a critical solution to a growing need.RST has proven its worth in the markets, having jumped 50% so far in 2019. Still, it will require some patience moving forward. The company has had some poor sales and earnings performances in the era of Google Translate.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip However, learning languages isn't about merely translating words, but the meaning behind the words. Foreign language is a vital art that computers can't yet properly duplicate. If Rosetta Stone can sell that message, RST has the chance to consistently surprise. Carvana (CVNA)The previous  time I covered online car dealer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) was as part of a gallery featuring up-and-coming publicly traded organizations. I also mentioned that I was in the market for a new ride. I'm still searching, which has led me to some additional thoughts about CVNA stock.Source:  Carvana First, car buying is a real pain in the behind. I spend endless hours looking for the right vehicle. If I find a few that meet my interests, I then have to physically go to the dealership. I haven't gotten around to this step because a) I'm lazy and b) I know I'm in for bitter negotiations.That, of course, is just my personal feelings on the matter … but I'm not the only one who feels this way. According to Time.com contributor Ian Salisbury:&quot;It's long been a rite of passage -- if one that's universally bemoaned -- sitting at a car dealer's cluttered desk, dickering over the price of a new vehicle.But millennials -- used to purchasing everything from music to groceries to hotel stays online -- are starting to change that as a number of major care markers strike deals to sell cars at fixed list prices, according to a report in the Washington Post.&quot;This year, more millennials will be in America than members of any other generation. If millennials buy cars, they will increasingly choose the online route. Sorry, shady used-car dealers, but CVNA is about to eat your lunch. 51job (JOBS)Rooster's Lindsey Kline reported that millennials are giving corporate America the bird. But why do Kline and her fellow millenials feel so strongly about corporate employment?Source:  ***Karen via FlickrIn her words, she prefers companies cut the BS, and instead provide &quot;office kegs, pool tables, and air hockey.&quot; If today's employers can't get with the program, young workers will simply leave.Kline justifies this prideful attitude in that &quot;Millennials are the most educated generation in history. We grew up in the midst of a digital era, and consequently, we're the only generation that doesn't have to adapt to new technologies.&quot;Some of you might find this thinking process arrogant, and I would agree. However, don't fight the tape: This is how the working environment operates today. And this points to the reason why I'm long-term bullish on ShiftPixy (NASDAQ:PIXY), especially if the price is right.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip However, this trend isn't exclusively an American one, which is why I'm putting 51job (NASDAQ:JOBS) on my long-term stocks to buy list. 51job is a next-generation employment recruiter and human-resources solutions provider for the young and tech-savvy. Better yet, it's a Chinese company that levers the advantages of a labor force that is over twice the size of the total U.S. population! That's a figure you simply can't ignore. Albemarle (ALB)A few years ago, Goldman Sachs boldly stated that lithium is the new gasoline. Most insiders, though, would probably say that the vaunted financial firm is merely profiting from the obvious. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have long proven that lithium is indeed the next-gen fuel source.Source: fdecomite via Flickr (Modified)But try telling that to the markets. Tesla stock is down 33% so far in 2019, and the lone lithium-based exchange-traded fund, Global X Lithium ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT), is down sharply this past year. Fortunately, so too is domestic-lithium specialist Albemarle (NYSE:ALB).So what's causing this prolonged downfall? While lithium demand is higher, so too is supply. Indeed, as the lithium price soared, more producers wanted in on the action. As a result, Argentina, Australia and Chile have ramped up production to the point where supply greatly exceeds demand. From Economics 101, you know where that situation leads.But like any commodity, the ebb-and-flow is difficult to predict. Sure, oversupply exists today. Tomorrow, that situation can change on a dime. Given that the broader technology industry points toward increased lithium usage, not less, my money is on ALB rising. Consider this lull in Albemarle shares as a discounted opportunity on one of the best long-term stocks to buy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-22,"The end of the year is a time for investors to focus on diversification. Despite the major exchanges continuing to hit record highs, there are reasons for investors to be uneasy.The market continues to digest the impacts (real and perceived) of the U.S.-China trade war. Earnings reports, though basically strong, suggest some weakness may exist. Institutional investors are spurning the usually fast-growing ""unicorn"" stocks. And 2020 is an election year which introduces uncertainty into the market.With uncertainty comes volatility. If you're looking for investment strategies to diversify your portfolio, now may be a time to look at real estate investment trusts (REITs).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsREITs own, operate or finance income-generating real estate properties such as apartment complexes or retail locations. REITs are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications. They are legally required to pay at least 90% of their taxable income in dividends.REITs are often specialized in specific areas such as residential or commercial. But even within those two areas there are distinctions. For example some REITs focus on healthcare facilities, others focus on apartments, and others may focus on shopping centers.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market Here are three REITs that set up well for whatever hits the market in 2020. Sun Communities (SUI)Dividend yield: 1.89%Source: Shutterstock The first REIT I want to discuss is Sun Communities (NYSE:SUI). Manufactured homes are showing the highest percentage growth of all REIT sub sectors in 2019. Sun Communities is one of the leading REITs in this sector and focuses on the midwestern and southeastern United States.With a market cap of $14.96 billion, Sun Communities is a large REIT that has been on a steady rise since the depths of the global economic crisis and the housing crisis. With that said, the stock has been getting a lift recently from a strong housing market. SUI stock is up over 55% in 2019.On Nov. 19, the Commerce Department released information on the housing market that showed that it is getting ready to heat up even though the calendar says it's winter.Residential construction surged in October with permits at their highest level since May 2007. Housing stats were also up in October. Although slightly lower than estimates, the 1.314 million number is an 8.5% year-over-year increase.SUI should continue to have a catalyst going forward as many rental properties are still citing very low vacancy rates. Welltower (WELL)Dividend yield: 4.18%The next REIT for you to consider is Welltower (NYSE:WELL). This is the largest healthcare REIT. Its properties span a variety of categories across the spectrum of patient care. WELL owns over 1,517 properties including hospitals, outpatient clinics, assisted living, and skilled nursing facilities across the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.Healthcare will continue to be a hot sector with a number of catalysts. To begin with, the baby boomer generation is aging, and approximately 63% of WELL's net operating income comes from senior housing. This is the core of the company's portfolio.And despite the rhetoric about a single payer system and ""Medicare for all,"" approximately 94% of Welltower's revenues are private payers, so the stock is not exposed to that risk.Welltower's stock is up over 26% in 2019. In the second quarter, the company generated $1.3 billion in revenue with earnings coming in at $137.7 million.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That Have Ridiculous Possibilities It's fair to be concerned about a dividend that has not grown in three years. But while it may not be best in class, it's certainly not the worst. And with the stability you get from the recession-proof property mix, it's a stock that's worthy of consideration. Equinix (EQIX)Dividend yield: 1.76%Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a REIT with exposure to the growing data center segment. EQIX owns over 200 data centers. Their global customer base includes nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies.EQIX stock is up nearly 59% in 2019 compared to the S&P 500, which has returned 26.8%. But EQIX stock is not a one-year wonder. Over the last 10 years, Equinix stock has grown 640%, which crushes the 245% return in the broader market.Institutional investors are forecasting the company's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a 21.4% average annual rate for the next five years. If that pans out, and there's no reason to believe it won't, the company will continue to have solid growth in its funds from operation (FFO). A larger FFO will allow EQIX to increase its dividend. EQIX shares currently have a dividend yield of 1.76%.A catalyst for the data center segment is the organic growth that comes from recurring revenues. In the case of Equinix, recurring revenue accounts for approximately 94% of total revenues.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-02,"Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way for investors to gain access to assets such as apartments and office buildings while often collecting generous yields - had a disappointing 2018. With just a few days left to go in the year, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) had lost 13.5% compared to a 12% decline for the broader market. This contrasts with 10-year average annual gains of just more than 12% for the VNQ.Will REITs bounce back in 2019? Well, the same fear that hampered these real-estate plays in 2018 - rising interest rates - still is on the board for the coming year. And higher rates on bonds sometimes hamper the performance of REITs.However, these companies are not created equal. The best REITs for 2019 could benefit from other powerful trends in 2019. For instance, cloud computing's growth should continue to fuel robust demand for data storage services. A massive infrastructure spending bill could improve the fortunes of related REIT plays. And mobile-data growth, as well as the rollout of lightning-fast 5G technology, offers potential growth for cell-tower REITs.Here are the 13 best REITs to buy and hold in 2019. Not only should they benefit from broad trends that could help them outperform their brethren, but REITs as a whole are trading at much more palatable valuations lately. Moreover, average dividend yields in the space currently exceed 4%; all the more reason for investors to stick with REITs if market rockiness continues in the coming year.

2019-12-12,"Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - companies that invest in a variety of properties, from office buildings to apartments and self-storage buildings - built big gains in 2019.A prominent REIT gauge, the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index, gained 25.4% through Nov. 21 (including dividends), with many of the best REITs doing far better. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (used for comparison because the majority of REITs are smaller companies) has gained 18.9%.Of course, people don't ordinarily invest in REITs to beat the stock market averages. They invest in them for income. By law, REITs must pay out at least 90% of their net earnings as dividends. The average REIT in the FTSE index delivers a dividend yield of 3.6%, compared with 1.8% for both the bellwether 10-year Treasury note and the S&P; 500&#92;. When the yield of bonds and stocks are so low, REITs become extremely popular.Real estate also provides diversification. While REITs are still stocks, they don't always move in the same direction as the broad market.

2020-10-12,"(Bloomberg) -- By the end of the year, New York City will get three posh assisted-living towers offering seniors spa treatments, gourmet meals and chauffeured rides along with their daily care.The projects were built on a bet that a surging population of wealthy elders would pay hefty sums -- starting around $13,000 a month in Manhattan -- to stay near their grown children, in a vibrant urban center, when they could no longer live alone.Then Covid-19 upended it all.The virus, which disproportionately harms the elderly, spread quickly through senior-care facilities across the country. Indoor social events, such as wine tastings and other highlights of assisted living, have become untenable. The adult offspring of potential tenants haven’t yet returned to their Midtown offices and may even have moved to the suburbs. With Broadway shuttered and cultural attractions at minimal capacity, the city’s vigor, and the top rents it helps command, is indefinitely on hold.“New York really needs to be humming for this to work,” said John Kim, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers Welltower Inc., co-developer of Sunrise at East 56th, set to open in November. “I think it’s going to be very challenging to lease it up.”Just before the pandemic, assisted-living facilities in Manhattan reached record occupancy of 96%, the result of high demand paired with a 15-year period when not a single new unit was built, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care.The virus abruptly changed the equation. During the second quarter, when New York was locked down, occupancy fell to 88%, the lowest since 2010. A moratorium on move-ins, in the city and nationwide, meant residents who left, passed away or moved into higher levels of care couldn’t be replaced.“Certainly, it could take a little longer for the area to absorb that new product along with the decline in occupancy that the pandemic had wrought,” said Lana Peck, a senior principal at the Maryland-based nonprofit.New York’s luxury senior towers, where residents pay completely out of pocket for perks and modern design rivaling the city’s glitziest condo towers, were a new concept in 2016 when the first two ground-up projects were announced. With sales of high-end apartments slackening, and demographics pointing to a “silver tsunami” of aging boomers, developers sensed a new opportunity.Human Connection“Seniors deserve to have options and not have senior living be an afterthought,” said Bevin Littlehale, a New York-based managing director at Hines, Welltower’s partner on the East 56th Street project, which will be operated by Sunrise Senior Living.Opening such a property during a pandemic has its challenges, but assisted living can reduce the isolation that seniors are feeling as the virus keeps visitors away, according to Jenifer Salamino, chief operating officer at Sunrise. Even socially distanced activities provide some human connection, she said.“We have a full dining staff, housekeeping staff, 24-hour doorman and there will be 24-hour nurses,” Salamino said, adding that some activities, like art projects, can be brought into residents’ rooms. “When you are home alone, some people don’t even have a home health aide -- they are literally alone.”The partners wouldn’t disclose how many of the building’s 151 apartments have been leased, but said 95% of inquiries have been from New Yorkers already living nearby. Monthly rents start at $13,750 for assisted living and $21,000 for memory-care units.Virus SafetyCovid protocols will guide life at the senior towers for the foreseeable future. On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. and Maplewood Senior Living have installed air purifiers and ultraviolet light sanitizers at their tower, called Inspir.Residents will be screened daily for symptoms, wear masks in common areas, and events, like an improv comedy class or guided tour of the boroughs, will happen online.The property -- promising a bar with signature cocktails, a theater and a Mercedes chauffeur service -- is awaiting final approval by the state health department and could open by early November. Deposits have been placed for 75 of the Inspir’s 215 units, said Greg Smith, chief executive officer of Maplewood Senior Living.The partners are in contract to acquire a site for a second Manhattan project, and are pursuing one in London as well.“We’re still incredibly bullish on the urban markets,” Smith said.In Brooklyn, a nearly century-old tower has been reimagined as senior housing at Watermark at Brooklyn Heights, with an art gallery, a heated lap pool and a wood-paneled library featuring a whiskey bar. A ballroom from the property’s days as a hotel is now a restaurant, the W Room, and tenants will have wine storage on-site.Just over half of the 275 units at the project -- developed by Kayne Anderson Real Estate, Tishman Speyer and Watermark Retirement Communities -- will be allocated to seniors who can live independently. The rest will be divided between assisted living and memory care, at rents as high as $20,000 monthly, a spokesman said. As of last week, about 20% of the residences were leased. The property opened earlier this month.While the pandemic presents new challenges for luxury senior properties, their prohibitive costs remain the biggest hurdle to their success, said Jeffrey Langbaum, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who covers real estate investment trusts, including Welltower.But that might prove to be a selling point. As families again get comfortable placing their loved ones in assisted living, they’re likely to seek out pricier facilities, which have the resources to pay for expensive virus-protection measures, he said.“People who can afford this,” he said, “will look to these higher end, well-run, more efficiently managed facilities as a safer place for their parents.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",New York’s Luxury Senior-Living Towers Open to Covid-Era Reality

As part of the agreement, two Genesis Board Members, John F. DePodesta and Terry Rappuhn have relinquished their current positions.

Concurrently, Genesis intends to voluntarily delist from the New York Stock Exchange by March 25.

2021-03-30,"The senior housing segment is poised for a recovery this summer, with occupancy and margins poised for an upturn in the back half of 2021, according to BofA Securities. The Health Care REITs Analyst: Joshua Dennerlein upgraded the ratings for Healthpeak Properties Inc (NYSE: PEAK) and Welltower Inc (NYSE: WELL) from Neutral to Buy. He raised the price target for Healthpeak Properties from $34 to $35.50 and for Welltower from $73 to $78. The Healthpeak Properties Takeaways: The company has made “significant progress” on its exit from the senior housing segment by closing $2.5 billion so far and with “the balance under letters of intent or purchase agreements,” Dennerlein said in the Tuesday upgrade note. The analyst views the 2021 guidance given by Healthpeak Properties as conservative. “We see upside to its SS NOI assumptions, particularly within its life science segment,” he said. “Longer term, we like PEAK’s development pipeline which we think should create significant value,” he further added. The Welltower Takeaways: The cap rates on the company’s recent acquisitions “have been trending well above our prior expectations,” Dennerlein said. Welltower had suggested during the fourth-quarter earnings call that ""they are likely to be net acquirers this year,"" the analyst said. “We now expect acquisitions to be accretive to the bottom line unlike our prior view that near-term accretion would be very limited given their focus on broken development deals/projects in lease up.” Latest Ratings for PEAK DateFirmActionFromTo Mar 2021B of A SecuritiesUpgradesNeutralBuy Mar 2021Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight Dec 2020KeyBancDowngradesOverweightSector Weight View More Analyst Ratings for PEAK View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaKeyBanc Expects Texas Instruments To Outperform, 'Well-positioned To Service Upside Demand'Morgan Stanley Upgrades Johnson Controls On Commercial Buildings Potential© 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-04-16,"Income investors often look to real estate investment trusts, or REITs, as these stocks usually have very high yields. Looking more specifically at a certain part of the REIT industry, we feel that the corner of the industry devoted to healthcare REITs is very attractive for income investors. The population continues to get older in the U.S., with those over 80 expected to make up more than half of the country’s population by 2030. Many of those people will require housing and medical treatment as they age. Combine this fact with a shortage of healthcare properties, and the economic outlook for the major healthcare REITs is very promising.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio This article will rank the largest four healthcare REITs by total return potential over the next five years. These top funds are: Welltower (NYSE:WELL) Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) National Health Investors (NYSE:NHI) Healthcare REITs: Welltower (WELL) Source: Shutterstock Welltower has three business segments: senior housing, triple-net leases and outpatient medical. Welltower’s funds from operation, or FFO, have barely budged over the last decade. The growth rate is just 0.4%, but much of this is due to trust’s habit of issuing shares to fund acquisitions, something very common amongst REITs. Adjusted for share count, FFO has increased 8.6% since 2011. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hurt the trust’s business. Welltower is selling properties it doesn’t view as central to its future. Our estimated FFO growth rate through 2026 is just 1.2%. Prior to pausing its dividend growth in 2018, Welltower had increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years. This was no small feat, especially considering the increase in the share count. The trust was forced to cut its dividend, with shareholders receiving nearly 30% of the dividend in 2020 that they did in 2019. The stock currently yields 3.2%, a significant premium to the average yield of 1.4% for the S&P 500. Welltower trades around $75. We expect the trust to produce FFO of $2.94 for 2021, giving the stock a price-to-FFO ratio of 25.9. This implies that valuation reversion could be a sizeable impediment to total returns if the stock were to trade with our FFO multiple target of 13.5. We forecast valuation to be a 12.2% headwind to annual returns through 2026. Therefore, we view this particular stock as significantly overvalued. In total, we expect that Welltower will lose 7.3% per year over the next five years. We rate the stock as a sell, and it is the least attractive healthcare REIT today. We believe a low FFO growth rate and decent sized yield will be more than offset by valuation reversion. Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) Source: mTaira / Shutterstock.com Healthpeak Properties, formerly known as HCP, is the largest healthcare REIT in the country. The trust operates more than 620 properties, including those used for life sciences, senior housing and medical offices. Healthpeak Properties has undergone a momentous restructuring of its business over the past few years, divesting more than 150 properties over this period of time. This has led to several declines in its funds from operation, or FFO, which decreased at a rate of 3.6% since 2011. The trust does have some positives working in its favor. First, Healthpeak Properties remains the largest name in its industry even after selling non-core assets. The trust also receives nearly all of its revenue from private payer sources, meaning that it doesn’t depend very much at all on Medicare and Medicaid. Therefore, we anticipate FFO growth at 5% annually through 2026 off of our expected FFO of $1.58 per share in 2021. 10 Stocks at the Heart of Good Retirement Portfolios Healthpeak Properties has cut its dividend three times since 2016, so growing income from the trust is no guarantee. That said, shares yield 3.7%. With shares trading around $33, Healthpeak Properties trades at 20.9 times FFO estimates. For context, the stock has a price-to-FFO of 15.3 since 2011. Reverting to this valuation would reduce annual results by 3.1% for the next five years. We expect Healthpeak Properties to offer a total return of 5.6% per year over the next five years as a 5% FFO growth rate and 3.7% dividend yield are partially offset by a low single-digit valuation headwind. Healthcare REITs: Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) Source: Shutterstock Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (OHI) operates two business segments, skilled nursing and senior housing. Skill nursing contributes the vast majority of revenues. A growing need for healthcare services for aging populations will be a tailwind, though Omega isn’t as diversified as other names in this space as it has an overreliance on skilled nursing facilities. The trust did weather the COVID-19 pandemic rather well as it collected nearly all rent due in the most recent quarter. Omega’s FFO has compounded at a rate of almost 6% over the last decade but much of this growth occurred in the first few years. We feel that the trust is likely to grow its bottom-line at a rate of 2% per year through 2026 given choppy recent results. What likely makes Omega an attractive investment is its sizeable dividend yield, which stands at 7.1%. Even with a slight dividend reduction last year, Omega’s dividend has compounded at a rate of more than 5% since 2011. With Omega trading around $37, the stock is trading at 11.4 times our FFO estimate of $3.25 for 2021. The stock has traded with an average price-to-FFO ratio of 12 since 2011. Valuation could add 1% to total returns annually over the next half-decade. We forecast that Omega can provide a total return of 10.1%, driven primarily by a 7%+ yield with low single-digit contributions from both FFO growth and multiple expansion. We typically reserve our buy recommendations for stocks offering at least 10% annual returns. Therefore, we rate Omega as a buy. National Health Investors (NHI) Source: Shutterstock National Health Investors owns and operates independent living facilities, medical office buildings and senior living housing properties. The trust uses a variety of funding methods, such as joint venture and sale-leasebacks, to acquire assets. National Health is one of the more diversified healthcare REITs, which affords the trust some protection in case of difficulty in one area of its business. The variety of investment methods also allows for National Health to be creative when finding attractive properties for purchase. We believe that the trust will be able to grow its FFO by 5.5% through 2026 due to its business model. Unlike the other names on this list, National Health has not been forced to reduce its dividend. In fact, the trust has increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years. The dividend has a compound annual growth rate of 5% over the last decade, and the stock yields 5.9%. We forecast that National Health will produce FFO of $5.50 in 2021. With shares trading around $75, National Health has a price-to-FFO of 13.5. We have a targeted price-to-FFO of 13.8 for 2026, which would imply a small addition of 0.4% to total returns from an expanding multiple. Total returns for National Health are expected to be of 11.8% due mostly to FFO growth and dividend yield, though an expanding multiple will also be a factor. At the current price, National Health is not only a buy, but the trust is our favorite name in the healthcare REIT space.
