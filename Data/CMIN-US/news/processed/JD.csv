As of September 2017, JD.com’s platform, often referred to as the “eBay of China,” had more than 266 million active users, with a revenue of close to $50 billion. JD considers blockchain technology and its integration into mainstream use as the key to a new age of cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.&quot;Whole-process traceability is not a new concept but blockchain makes it really possible,” Yongli Yu, president of JD&apos;s supply chain research unit, said in conversation with 
<i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. &quot;Throughout the world, and particularly in China, consumers increasingly want to know how their products are sourced, and JD is dedicated to using technology to promote complete transparency.&quot; Six blockchain technology companies — CanYa, Bluzelle, Nuggets, Republic Protocol, Devery and Bankorus — have been chosen as members of the AICA accelerator’s first cohort. The program will start with a signing ceremony in New York, where JD is traded, and then the first cohort will be guided through the six-month international accelerator program from March 2018. Among other benefits, the companies in the AICA accelerator program will receive marketing, PR and international business development help from JD.com.CanYa, a blockchain-powered marketplace of peer-to-peer services that helps people find, book and pay for digital and home services, is one of the first members of the AICA accelerator program. The company strives to “accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency by providing a meaningful reason to spend cryptocurrencies on services.” According to its white paper, CanYa wants to be “the ultimate link between cryptocurrency and the real world.” The CanYaCoin (CAN), an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, can be exchanged in the platform and converted to real-world skilled labour. The token provides the CanYa marketplace with a decentralized, trustless and hedged escrow service; a bridge between fiat and a variety of cryptocurrencies; a rewards system to encourage network effects; and incentives for user curation and arbitration.The CanYa apps will be translated into Chinese, integrated with the JD platform and promoted to JD’s customers with a “CanYa Widget” for JD buyers to hire a local CanYa service provider to help with their purchases. For example, someone buying furniture could book a CanYa provider at checkout to assemble and install it in their home. “This is a validation of CanYa’s business model and global disruptive potential,” said CanYa co-founder and CEO John-Paul Thorbjornsen in a company statement. “JD is one of the most significant technology companies in the world, to have their full support and backing is huge for our platform and the acceleration of blockchain technology.”“JD.com is a global leader in making a meaningful change in the lives of consumers, and we are incredibly excited to see them embrace decentralized technologies and encourage their mainstream adoption,” added Thorbjornsen in conversation with 
<i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. “By creating a blockchain accelerator and working with blockchain startups with potential, JD is cutting through the hype and providing support where it is needed most right now: shipping technology to millions of users globally.”

## Fourth-quarter revenue expected to be $71.9 billion

Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release its fourth-quarter results on January 24. On average, analysts expect the company to report revenue of $71.9 billion. In October, Amazon set a goal to deliver fourth-quarter revenue of $65 billion–$72.5 billion, suggesting the company may beat analysts’ expectation.

## Upward trend

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Amazon’s revenue rose 38.2% YoY (year-over-year) to $60.5 billion, putting it among the fastest-growing large e-commerce companies. Alibaba’s (BABA), JD.com’s (JD), eBay’s (EBAY), and Etsy’s (ETSY) revenue grew 56%, 38.7%, 9.1%, and 23.7% YoY, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, while Groupon’s (GRPN) fell 3.5% YoY. Amazon’s revenue rose 29% YoY to $56.6 billion in the third quarter (ended September), 39% YoY in the second quarter, and 43% YoY in the first quarter.

## Retail, advertising, and cloud businesses driving growth

Gains in retail, advertising, and cloud computing have been behind Amazon’s healthy top-line growth recently. In the retail market, for instance, its acquisition of Whole Foods Market has allowed Amazon to expand in the retail food business, enabling the company to capture more household spending.

2019-01-07,"2018 was not a good year for the Chinese stock market. The Shanghai composite, the market's major average, fell nearly 25%, the worst performance of any Asian stock market. Most Chinese stocks declined: of 86 China-based stocks listed on U.S. markets, according to a finviz.com screen, just 10 rose more than 1% in 2018.

It's far from certain that 2019 will be any better -- at least initially. Trade war concerns aren't going anywhere. Investors across the globe still are fearful of recession, re-igniting long-running fears of a &quot;hard landing&quot; in the Chinese economy, and thus Chinese stocks.

  * 9 A-Rated Safety Stocks for a Grossly Oversold Market 



That said, there are some intriguing values in the Chinese stock market. Long-term, the movement of hundreds of millions of citizens into the middle class and beyond promises explosive economic growth. It may be a bumpy ride -- indeed, it already has been -- but a great deal of promise remains. These five Chinese stocks all look cheap relative to their potential. And after the Chinese stock market bottoms, they could be the biggest winners when the rebound comes.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### JD.com (JD)

Source:  Daniel Cukier via Flickr

E-commerce operator JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has had one of the steepest falls of any Chinese stock, dropping by nearly half in 2018. Investments behind the business have pressured earnings. The CEO wound mired in an ugly incident in the U.S. E-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has sold off -- albeit not the same extent -- adding to the pressure on second-place JD.com.

I've been a long-time bull on JD stock, which has been one of my favorite Chinese stocks. But amid the endless selling pressure, even I've waved the white flag. The &quot;risk-off&quot; attitude in the market and the lack of patience in JD.com's higher spending suggests it will take some time for investors to return to the bull case.

That said, I still believe that will happen at some point. JD.com has big-money partnerships with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the latter of whom took a stake in JD.com at over $40 per ADS, nearly double the current price. The e-commerce market in China will be big enough for two winners, at least. And JD's better supply chain could allow it to take share from Alibaba over the long haul.

JD stock seemingly has bottomed over the past six weeks, so a rebound may be at hand. Near-term, investors still need to be careful: if support breaks again, the downtrend can resume. But at some point, I still believe JD will rebound.

### Nio (NIO)

Electric vehicle company NIO (NYSE:NIO) closed the year up under 2% from the price at which it went public in September. In the context of the overall market -- and the Chinese stock market -- over that stretch, the performance certainly isn't that bad.

But a seemingly &quot;cheap&quot; price above $6 belies how expensive NIO truly is. This is a company still valued at over $8 billion despite the fact that it doesn't yet manufacture its own vehicles. (NIO contracts with a state-owned manufacturer, and aims to get a license at some point.) A 3x multiple to 2019 revenue estimates doesn't sound that big, but it's certainly high for an automaker. The only other company with a similar valuation is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), to which NIO is often compared.

That said, there's an intriguing long-term bull case here, as I detailed last month. The near-term risks, however, seem huge in this market. Another market downturn and/or further pressure on Chinese stocks without question is going to take NIO stock down. Put selling can create a hedged entry -- and for investors willing to try and time the bottom, might be the wisest choice.

  * 10 Oversold Stocks Due for a Bounce 



This seems like a story that could be huge -- but in this market, there also seems to be little reason to rush in.

### Huya (HUYA)

Source: Shutterstock 

Huya (NYSE:HUYA) is often referred to as China's version of video game streaming company Twitch, now owned by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Like NIO, Huya went public this year, with shares priced at $12. Unlike NIO, HUYA stock actually rose from those prices, closing the year above $15.

But that gain is small solace to most HUYA shareholders. The stock rose 300% out of the gates; it fell nearly 70% from highs above $50 to the end-of-year price. The chart still suggests a falling knife, and between competition from privately held Douyu and others, plus a 3x-plus multiple to 2019 revenue estimates, HUYA stock could have further to fall.

That said, here, too, there's a bull case worth buying. Video game demand in China continues to rise -- and should do so for years at a pace that exceeds even that of the U.S. The company has turned profitable already. And a buyout isn't out of the realm of possibility.

The risks here looks similar to those facing many issues in the Chinese stock market. The rewards, however, do not. A return even close to 2018 highs suggests huge upside for HUYA. And a heavy short interest, plus a thin float, means a short squeeze provides a potential catalyst once sentiment finally turns.

### PetroChina (PTR)

For a $200 billion company, PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) gets a surprisingly small amount of attention. What news there has been of late, however, certainly hasn't been good. PTR trades near its lowest levels in almost three years - and is only a few points away from touching a thirteen-year low.

It's not hard to see why that is. Oil prices are falling; the spike in natural gas is fading. Concerns about the Chinese economy are rising. If anything, it might seem surprising that PTR fell &quot;only&quot; 12% in 2018.

  * 10 Top Stock Picks From the Street's Best Analysts 



But those obvious risks also set up a potential case for a rebound. It's hard to think of any large-cap stock that could benefit more from a broad reversal in sentiment. If investor fear turns back to greed, oil bounces, Chinese stocks bounce and PTR could gain big. After all, the stock traded above $80 -- 30% or more above current levels as recently as early October.

### Baidu (BIDU)

Source: Shutterstock 

On this site in early November, Luke Lango laid out the value-based bull case for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Lango isn't alone: Wall Street analysts on average see over 50% upside for BIDU. And yet the stock has dropped another 20% in the last two months, closing out a year in which BIDU declined some 32%.

The bulls may not be wrong, however -- just early. The chart is ugly, and Baidu is going to need some help from the Chinese stock market to end its long decline. When that reversal comes, however, there's a lot to like here. BIDU trades at a mid-teen multiple to forward earnings despite heavy investments in the business and losses from iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ). Its search dominance seems assured. Like a lot of Chinese stocks, BIDU probably just needs some time for investor confidence to return.

As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bearish out-of-the-money options position in Tesla. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

## Stock downgraded and price target lowered

Morgan Stanley downgraded eBay (EBAY) stock to “equal-weight” from “overweight” last month, according to a note to investors cited by CNBC. At the same time, the firm cut its 12-month price target on eBay stock from $55 to $33. Before it upgraded eBay to “overweight” in April, Morgan Stanley had an “underweight” rating on the stock.

In downgrading eBay, Morgan Stanley noted that the company’s gross merchandise value (or GMV) growth was slower than it expected in 2018 and that it expects the slowdown to continue in 2019. For ecommerce companies, GMV measures the total value of items sold over a given period. eBay’s GMV was $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up 5.0% year-over-year. But the GMV growth slowed from 8.0% in the third quarter of 2017.

## Emerging revenue opportunity in payments and advertising

In addition to deteriorating GMV growth, Morgan Stanley also cited stiff competition in the ecommerce industry as another major challenge eBay faces. But the firm also noted that eBay has attractive emerging revenue opportunities in the payments and advertising markets. With more online shoppers beginning their product search on marketplaces, ecommerce platforms like eBay have taken on new significance as advertising spots for brands seeking to connect with consumers.

## eBay’s revenue rose 6.0%

eBay generated revenue of $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 6.0% year-over-year, compared to revenue growth of 58% at Shopify (SHOP), 54% at Alibaba (BABA), and 29% at Amazon (AMZN). JD.com (JD) grew its revenue 25%.

## Plans to open more Whole Foods stores

Amazon (AMZN) is planning to open more retail outlets under its Whole Foods brand, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Amazon gained more than 450 retail outlets when it acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

In addition to opening more Whole Foods stores, Amazon is planning to open more Amazon Go stores, its cashierless retail outlets. The company is targeting airport locations for more Amazon Go stores, according to Reuters. The global airport retail market was valued at $38 billion in 2016 and is poised to grow to $49 billion by 2021, according to GlobalData estimates.

## Speeding up deliveries

Amazon’s opening more retail locations is seen as part of its strategy to speed up deliveries. For example, opening Whole Foods stores where none currently exist could help Amazon extend its grocery pickup service to more customers. Amazon currently lets customers in more than two dozen cities pick up their groceries from a nearby Whole Foods store in as little as 30 minutes. The company is planning to roll out the pickup service to more markets.

A wider store network could also help Amazon cut the distance its couriers need to cover to deliver packages to homes, resulting in faster delivery.

## Online retailers expanding offline

JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) are two other major e-commerce companies that have been opening physical outlets or partnering up with traditional retailers to get closer to customers and speed up deliveries. 

As e-commerce companies seek to extend their offline reach, traditional retailers such as Walmart (WMT), which already boasts an extensive physical store network, are seeking to extend their online reaches. Walmart is one of the traditional retailers that have adopted Google (GOOGL) products, such as Google Express, to help them sell more online.

## JD Mall reorganized into three groups

JD.com (JD) has announced a restructuring plan that will see its main business, JD Mall, split into three groups, the South China Morning Post reported. One of the groups will be responsible for studying customer behaviors and market changes. Another group will be responsible for providing services that satisfy customer demands, likely building on the findings of the first group. The third group will handle everything from infrastructure building to risk management.

JD is betting on the restructuring plan to help it achieve quality growth and better position itself to serve customers in an ever-changing business environment. JD is in tight competition with Alibaba (BABA) for control of the ecommerce market in China—its domestic market. Overseas, JD is battling Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and a host of other rivals for ecommerce revenue.

## JD’s active customers decreased

JD exited the third quarter of 2018 with 305.2 million active customers, down from 313.8 million in the second quarter and marking the first time that the company registered a decline in its active customer base. Alibaba and eBay closed the third quarter with 601 million and 177 million active customers, respectively, both increasing from the previous quarter. Amazon doesn’t disclose its customer metrics. It only said last year that its Prime membership program had attracted more than 100 million subscribers globally.

## JD collaborating with Google

JD’s revenue rose 25% year-over-year to $15.3 billion in the third quarter. JD is collaborating with Google (GOOGL) to help accelerate its international expansion. Google owns a small stake in JD, following an investment of $550 million in the Chinese ecommerce giant in June.

## Whole Foods isn’t profitable yet

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report citing those familiar with the situation at Amazon (AMZN), the company’s Whole Foods business isn’t profitable despite its sales having increased since Amazon took over in 2017 following a $13.7 billion transaction.

The lack of profits for Whole Foods can be attributed to Prime discounts, which have hurt the business’s margins. However, given Jeff Bezos’s usual playbook, Whole Foods’ profitability may not be a big priority right now. The Amazon CEO saw the e-commerce giant through years of losses before it began making profits, which have been increasing in recent quarters. Amazon’s profit hit $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $256 million a year earlier.

Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY), and Etsy (ETSY) posted profits of $2.9 billion, $721 million, and $20 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2018. JD.com (JD) reported a profit of ~$400 million in the same period.

## Using Whole Foods to promote Prime

Amazon has been using Whole Foods to try to drive the uptake of its Prime membership program, which could create more profit opportunities for the company down the road. Prime members pay a $119 annual subscription fee and enjoy a range of benefits, including exclusive discounts on items, free express delivery, and video and music streaming services. Amazon disclosed last year that it served over 100 million Prime members globally. The company generated $3.7 billion in subscription services revenue in the third quarter of 2018, with the amount primarily coming from Prime membership fees.

## Company holding $6.2 billion in cash

JD.com (JD) is planning to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its shares over the next 12 months. The company intends to fund its share repurchase program with its existing cash balance. JD closed the third quarter of 2018, the most recent reported period, with $6.2 billion in cash.

JD announced the repurchase program after its stock plunged in 2018 alongside other major Chinese Internet companies amid a slowing domestic economy and grinding trade war with the United States. JD shares plunged about 50% in 2018. Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA) shares fell about 35% and 25%, respectively, in 2018.

## Chinese companies line up repurchase programs

In addition to JD, the other Chinese Internet companies that have lined up large repurchase programs include Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (TCEHY). Baidu announced a $1.0 billion repurchase program in June, and $513 million remained in that program at the end of September. Alibaba is planning to repurchase up to $6.0 billion of shares in the next two years. For its part, Tencent has board authorization to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares.

eBay (EBAY) is another ecommerce company that has lined up a generous repurchase program. The company had $4.7 billion remaining on its existing repurchase authorization at the end of September.

## JD’s revenue jumped 25%

JD generated $15.3 billion in revenue and made over $400 million in profit in the third quarter of 2018. Its revenue rose 25% year-over-year.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## EPS expected to be $5.53

In October, Amazon (AMZN) announced it was raising its US and UK workers’ starting wage, effective November 1. Higher wages can boost workers’ morale and productivity. However, they also mean additional costs, which can impact profits. How did Amazon’s bottom line fare in the fourth quarter after the company raised wages? We’ll find out when the company reports its fourth-quarter results. On average, analysts expect the company to report EPS of $5.53.

## EPS exceeded analysts’ expectation last year

Amazon made a profit of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, translating to EPS of $3.74 and beating analysts’ consensus EPS estimate of $1.83. Alibaba (BABA) and Etsy (ETSY) had EPS of $1.41 and $0.36, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, whereas eBay (EBAY) and JD.com (JD) posted losses per share of $2.51 and $0.10, respectively. Amazon made $2.9 billion in profit in the third quarter, translating to EPS of $5.75.

## Increased focus on profitability

Amazon’s fourth-quarter results are set to come out as the company is focusing on profitability. As we noted recently, Amazon is pushing brands to create product formats that it can sell profitably online. For many years, Amazon has been known for its strategy of prioritizing growth over profits. However, it now appears profitability is taking on new significance at Amazon, which may be necessary considering the company’s rising costs due to wage increases and delivery service expansion to include shipping from Whole Foods Market stores.

2019-01-08,"The Chinese economy is definitely losing momentum, as President Trump's tariffs continue to take a toll on it. Nevertheless, some Chinese stocks have reached bargain levels. Just look at Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which is one of China's premier tech operators. Since June, Alibaba stock has tumbled about 30%, making its valuation quite reasonable, especially given BABA's multiple businesses which are poised to benefit from strong, continuous growth trends.

### China Does Have Problems

There's no doubt that China's economy is facing meaningful headwinds. The country's central bank has been pursuing a loose monetary policy, but it is not having much of an impact.

For example, in December China's manufacturing activity fell from to 49.4 from 50 in November, representing the first drop since 2016. What's more, Apple's (NASDAQ:APPL) disappointing guidance was another ominous sign for China's economy.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



China's economy also suffers from excesses in real estate and construction that are not connected to the trade war with the U.S. But the selling of Chinese stocks may have been overdone. In other words, there are some interesting bargains emerging, including BABA stock.

In this environment, Alibaba stock is one name that investors should consider.

### Alibaba's E-Commerce Business Should Boost BABA Stock

BABA's e-commerce platforms continue to grow at a solid pace. In the third quarter, the segment's revenues jumped 56% year-over-year to $10.5 billion. The number of consumers who used the platform during  the previous year jumped 25 million versus Q2 to a total of 601 million. Finally, the unit's mobile MAUs (Monthly Active Users) surged 32 million to 666 million.

One key to BABA's growth has been its major investments in Taobao, its primarily consumer-driven, e-commerce website. The website's user interface has been revamped, making it easier for merchants and consumers to use it. Taobao has also increased its use of artificial intelligence and has improved its recommendation feed. Another one of Alibaba's consumer-driven, e-commerce websites, Tmall, has also been improved.

Long-term, continuous positive catalysts should drive BABA's e-commerce revenue higher, lifting BABA stock. These catalysts are expected to boost China's e-commerce spending from $470 billion in 2018 to $839.54 billion by 2021.

### Alibaba's Cloud Business Should Boost BABA Stock

BABA has emulated Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) expansion into the lucrative cloud- computing market. So far, it's been a big-time winner for BABA. In Q3, the unit's top line soared by 90% year-over-year to $825 million.

BABA has the advantage of hosting large numbers of merchants, which has been a critical factor in its development of hosting infrastructure. The company has also been investing heavily in adding new features to its cloud offerings. In fact, it added over 600 new features in Q3, including enhancements related to big data analytics, security, Internet-of-Things, and AI.

### The Valuation of BABA Stock

The slowing of the Chinese economy will definitely weigh on BABA's growth. But it does look like much of that reduced growth has already been baked into BABA stock. Keep in mind that the forward price-earnings multiple of Alibaba stock is 20. By comparison, rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is trading with a price-earnings multiple of about 39. And of course, BABA trades at a steep discount to AMZN's P/E multiple of 57.

So even if BABA's top-line drops meaningfully, by 10% or more, its valuation will still be reasonable. Besides, as noted above, BABA should continue to benefit from the strong, continuous megatrends of e-commerce and cloud computing. Meanwhile Wall Street analysts remain bullish on BABA, as their average price target on BABA stock is $202, representing upside of about 40% from the shares' current levels.

## Disgruntled investors pursued Alibaba

Alibaba (BABA) has entered into an agreement to settle a California class action lawsuit that alleges the company violated the United States Securities Act of 1933, a regulation that deals with transparency in the sale of securities to the public in the United States. The lawsuit was brought forward in October 2015, one year after Alibaba’s IPO in the United States.

The suit was brought on behalf of investors who had purchased Alibaba shares and felt that the company had failed to provide full public disclosure of its securities so that potential investors could make fully informed buying decisions.

## Alibaba to pay $75 million for the settlement

Alibaba agreed to pay $75 million to settle the lawsuit without admitting to any wrongdoing. The settlement covers investors who purchased Alibaba shares on or before October 5, 2015. Alibaba expects the court to approve the settlement by April so that it can put the matter behind it.

The settlement is unlikely to have a big impact on Alibaba’s finances, as the company said it anticipates the settlement payment to come from its directors and officers liability insurance. Alibaba is facing another lawsuit related to its IPO in New York, which remains unresolved.

## Alibaba’s revenue jumped 54%

Alibaba generated $12.4 billion in revenue in its second quarter of fiscal 2019, which ended on September 30. Its revenue rose 54% YoY (year-over-year) in the quarter. Etsy (ETSY), Amazon (AMZN), and JD.com (JD) grew their revenues 41%, 29%, and 25% YoY, respectively, in the comparable quarter. Revenue rose 6.0% YoY at eBay (EBAY) in the period.

## Fulfillment by Amazon fees set to increase

Amazon (AMZN) plans to raise the fees it charges sellers to deliver items to customers under its FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program, effective February 2019. The fee hike, which mostly applies to items weighing more than 10 ounces, is aimed at sellers in the United States. The company said it was adjusting the fees to reflect changes in fulfillment and transportation costs. In addition to raising shipping fees on items of a certain weight, Amazon has introduced separate fees for potentially dangerous goods such as flammable or aerosol substances.

## Accident at Amazon warehouse

The introduction of a dangerous goods shipping fee comes after dozens of Amazon workers became ill after a can of aerosol leaked at a warehouse in New Jersey, according to The Washington Post. The fee may be aimed at discouraging sellers from sending such items to Amazon’s warehouses or having sellers pay more to use the Amazon system to fulfill orders for dangerous items.

## Employees’ health cost

Amazon employed 613,300 people worldwide at the end of the third quarter, while rivals JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) had a workforce of 175,366 and 93,397 employees, respectively. To lower employees’ health costs, Amazon has teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on a health insurance program.

2019-01-09,"President Trump continues to dominate the attention of the global media, from his ongoing trade spat with China (and hopes of a looming deal) to the machinations of the U.S. government shutdown and his pledge to fulfill a campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border.

He was even partially responsible for the market unpleasantness in December, as he reportedly considered firing Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for his policy hawkishness. Things have appeared to calm in recent days, with Trump shying away from declaring a national emergency at the Mexican border in his first Oval Office address Tuesday night.

Perhaps the market is pricing in a loss of political capital, because a number of &quot;Anti-Trump&quot; stocks are moving higher, and quickly becoming stocks to buy again. They range all the way from Chinese tech giants to Mexican cement makers. I'm not making a political statement, but merely reporting the situation on the ground.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



With all of that said, here are five stocks to buy:

### JD.com (JD)

Shares of online Chinese retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are emerging from a three-month consolidation range that capped an epic decline of more than 60% from the highs last January. This came despite evidence of a deepening slowdown in Chinese manufacturing activity and falling retail activity by China's consumers. Perhaps the market is pricing in a trade deal between the United States and China, an indication Trump may be softening his stance to bag a policy win.

The company will next report results on Feb. 18, before the bell. Analysts are looking for a loss of 11 cents per share on revenues of $19.2 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 19, earnings of 80 cents per share beat estimates by 13 cents per share on a 25.1% rise in revenues.

### Cemex (CX)

Shares of Mexican cement maker Cemex (NYSE:CX) are rallying off of a three-month low that has capped a decline of roughly 55% from the highs seen in the summer 2017. It seems ironic that a Mexican maker of the stuff Trump wants to use to build the border wall -- beautiful and strong cement -- is rallying as the odds of such a barrier being built fade.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



Instead, the latest is that a steel slat barrier (or fence?) is the best outcome for him. Shares are benefiting from a general rise in emerging market stocks thanks to weakness in the U.S. dollar and signs of slowing in the U.S. economy.

### Alibaba (BABA)

Chinese internet giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is watching as its shares rally back over its 50-day moving average in another upside breakout attempt. The move marks the third bounce off of support at the $130-a-share level, which capped a near 40% decline from the summer 2018 high. Trump has in the past pointed to weakness in Chinese stocks as evidence he was winning the trade war. Unfortunately, the performance gap has closed in recent weeks. Strength in stocks like BABA will close the gap further.

The company will next report results on Feb. 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.38 per share on revenues of $17.3 billion. The company last reported results on Nov. 2, with earnings of $1.11 per share beating estimates by a penny on a 49.6% rise in revenues.

### Amazon (AMZN)

Tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been a frequent foil for Trump and his supporters amid accusations of bias against conservative voices as well as CEO Jeff Bezos' purchase and operation of the Washington Post, which is no fan of the President. Trump has frequently threatened to tighten regulation on these guys, including raising the cost of shipping via the U.S. Postal Service.

  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks Set to Charge Higher 



After a nasty 30%+ decline from its September high, AMZN shares are on the path to recovery and are making another challenge of its 200-day moving average. The company will next report results on Jan. 31 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.48 per share on revenues of $73.9 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 25, earnings of $5.75 beat estimates by $2.66 on a 29.3% rise in revenues.

### Facebook (FB)

Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the social media platform that has been plagued by privacy scandals and frequent criticisms of leaning against conservative media, have broken above their 50-day moving average for the first time since July. This move is beginning to unwind the decline of more than 40% from the highs seen in July.

The company will next report results on Jan. 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.17 per share on revenues of $16.4 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 30, earnings of $1.76 per share beat estimates by 32 cents on a 32.9% rise in revenues.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-10,"Shares of Huya (NYSE:HUYA) have been on fire over the past few weeks. It's not just Huya stock either, as a number of Chinese equities are starting to gain some bullish momentum. Of course, it helps that the U.S. and China are seemingly finding common ground in recent trade talks.  While the current trade spat may not directly impact a company like Huya or iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), it does impact the Chinese economy.

  * 12 2018 Winners That Will Be Big Ol' Losers in 2019 



As you may or may not have read at this point, the Chinese economy is stumbling a bit. Granted, its growth remains robust compared to many developed nations, but manufacturing and other industries are taking a hit. Some companies are moving production out of the country due to the trade war. As a result, that hurts Chinese workers, which hurts the economy. Auto sales -- which enjoyed two decades of growth -- are stagnating. There are numerous data points suggesting the slowdown.

I wouldn't say the sky is falling when it comes to the Chinese economy, but the nation is more vulnerable than many previously thought. The two countries have been hammering out talks for three days now, the last of which was unscheduled and suggests the meetings are progressing towards a solution. That presents both an opportunity and risk. While trade negotiations are playing the hero right now, they can just as easily play the villain. Should negotiations fall apart, look for it to deal a devastating blow to names like Huya, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), iQiyi, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and others.

That being said, should investors like Huya stock?

### Evaluating Huya Stock

Huya is sort of like the Twitch of China. For those that don't know what Twitch is, it's an online game-streaming platform owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Given the growth in gaming and e-sports, it's no surprise that Twitch and other streaming platforms are benefiting as well.

China's stance on video games is not as lenient as it is here in the U.S. Benefiting Huya was China's decision to ban Twitch. On the flip side, it also took a more strict approach to video games and which ones would be approved for consumers. Less games equals less streaming opportunities for Huya, which in turns hurts its growth.

But all is not lost. Last quarter the company reported earnings of 8 cents per share and revenue of almost $186 million. That doubled analysts' earnings estimates and topped revenue expectations by more than $7 million, which rose by almost 120% year-over-year. User growth also showed impressive marks, with monthly active users up 14.6% and mobile monthly average users up over 28%.

For the year, analysts expect earnings of 25 cents per share on revenue of $667 million. In 2019, estimates call for earnings to nearly double to 47 cents per share on revenue of $1.02 billion, up 53% year-over-year. If Huya can achieve those numbers, it's hard to imagine its stock trading below current levels.

Hint: here are 8 other Chinese stocks with promising long-term future.

### Trading Huya Stock

  
Click to Enlarge

Huya stock went public in May at $12 per share and hit $50 per share a month later. This quadrupling in share price obviously meant Huya stock needed to cool off, and that's exactly what it's down.

Shares have been trapped in a nasty downtrend for almost eight months. However, that came to an end a few days ago when Huya stock broke out over $16.50. Not only did the move propel Huya over the 21-day moving average, but also over downtrend resistance (blue line). It quickly tore higher, climbing 25% in five days and running into possible resistance near $20.

Now what?

Huya and other high-flying Chinese stocks have the potential to really rip if and when the U.S. and China put together an official trade deal. But until then, I'm still skeptical of the group, regardless of the breakouts.

  * 7 Tech Stocks That Can Lead a Sector Turnaround 



I am eventually looking for Huya stock to breakout over $20 to $21, which would put Huya over its 100-day moving average. But it wouldn't be the worst thing for the stock to pullback and/or consolidate for a bit now. Over the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, and the name is still attractive on the long side. It's imperative for the bulls to keep Huya over prior downtrend resistance and the $15 mark.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## A $24 billion repurchase authorization

As Facebook (FB) prepares to report its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018, we note that the company last month boosted its share repurchase program by an additional $9.0 billion. The increase brings the company’s repurchase authorization since 2017 to $24 billion, considering that in April 2018 Facebook added $9.0 billion to its repurchase program, which already had a $6.0 billion authorization.

Facebook had $3.5 billion remaining in its previous repurchase authorization at the end of September 2018, according to the company’s regulatory filing. Therefore, the latest addition means that Facebook now has $12.5 billion in its repurchase program.

## Companies have lined up fat repurchase programs

Besides Facebook, other Internet companies that have lined up fat repurchase programs include Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), and eBay (EBAY). In February last year, Alphabet announced an $8.6 billion repurchase program, and Alibaba is in the process of implementing its $6.0 billion two-year repurchase program. eBay had $4.7 billion remaining in its existing repurchase authorization at the end of September. JD.com (JD) recently announced a $1.0 billion repurchase program expiring in 2020.

## Repurchasing 86 million shares

With $12.5 billion and the stock trading in the $145 range, Facebook could repurchase more than 86 million shares, or 3.0% of its outstanding shares. Since repurchases reduce the number of shares in circulation, they can lead to companies posting higher earnings per share without actually growing profits.

2019-01-22,"Frankly, it's a bit surprising that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has held up so well. I was bearish on the company throughout 2018, and I'd argue fundamentals have continued to support my outlook. However, let's give credit where credit is due. Starbucks stock is still near 52-week highs despite a rocky market and various pieces of company-specific bad news.

That bad news should begin to weigh on SBUX in 2019 though. Among the worrisome signs, analysts are waking up to the increasing risk of Starbuck's aggressive China strategy.

Goldman Sachs recently dropped its buy rating for SBUX, suggesting that China is weak and could lead to a profit warning out of that region. A new competitor in China is gearing up for a major fight with Starbucks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On top of that, the domestic market continues to be sluggish as competitors like Dunkin Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN) keep pressuring Starbucks on the home front. Put it all together, and barring a major stock market rally in 2019, I don't see Starbucks stock advancing much beyond the $65 level.

### Luckin Coffee and Starbucks Stock

In my previous articles about Starbucks, I've warned that the company is betting too heavily on China.

In December, I noted that: &quot;In the most recent earnings report, same store sales from China grew by just 1%. They grew at a significantly better rate in both the United States and the rest of the world excluding Asia. Starbucks is making a worrisome bet on a region that doesn't like their main product and is showing anemic sales growth already.&quot;

Well, nothing has changed on that front. Starbucks is still pushing full steam ahead. Unfortunately, they're not the only company making a big play for the Chinese coffee market. Luckin Coffee launched in October 2017, but already is becoming a major competitor. Within a year, Luckin Coffee opened 1,500 stores and plans to open around 2,000 over the next year.

Luckin has several major differences from Starbucks, based on this analysis from leading China expert Jeffrey Towson. For one, Luckin concentrates much less on the highest-traffic/price real estate. Instead, it locates a block or two from major pedestrian areas. This allows it much cheaper overhead. That functions well, since Luckin is concentrated on take-out orders; many of its locations don't even have seating.

Luckin is going for a lower-price strategy, offering prices 20-30% below Starbucks. That still puts Luckin in the same affordable luxury category as Starbucks, but at a more accessible price point. Starbucks, for what it is worth, charges roughly the same prices in China as in New York City despite far lower incomes in China.

Additionally, Luckin has an advanced digital strategy. In fact, they don't even take cash; all orders must be done through their smartphone app. It remains to be seen how badly Luckin will hurt Starbucks, but with prominent backers, Luckin is a serious threat. It's rumored that Luckin will be launching its IPO soon, as well.

### Starbucks: Making Moves of Its Own

Bulls can counter the Luckin threat by suggesting that Starbucks has a cohesive strategy of its own. Starbucks' digital initiative appears to be paying off in the U.S. And in both the U.S., with Ubereats, and in China with Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA), Starbucks has established strong delivery options of its own.

This will keep Starbucks in the game when Luckin partners with the likes of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which has its own great logistics network, to fight for the delivery market.

It's important to note that Starbucks isn't just betting on China internationally. The company is coming up on 15,000 stores total outside of the U.S. Starbucks has around 4,000 stores in China now, meaning that almost 11,000 or so are not in China.

Many of these are in markets such as Latin America where incomes tend to be higher than in China on average, and there is also less local competition.

Starbucks made another big play last summer. It offered exclusive distribution rights for packaged Starbucks coffee to Swiss giant Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) for more than $7 billion.

While Starbucks gives up some upside from its consumer products, it gets plenty of other perks. For one, Nestle is a global leader in distributing consumer products and will undoubtedly get more shelf space for Starbucks in far-flung markets.

Starbucks still gets a solid revenue share of the products. And as management described it, this is a &quot;brand amplifier&quot; for Starbucks as it gets their products in front of a wider consumer base who may then visit the company's cafes.

### Starbucks Stock Verdict

It's not all bad news for Starbucks. The deal with Nestle in particular looks smart, and management is using the proceeds to buy back stock which will support the share price. The partnership with Alibaba could be enough to hold back competition in China as well; time will tell.

The majority of signs still favor the bearish perspective on Starbucks stock, however. At more than 21x forward earnings, investors are paying a high price for SBUX.

If it were still growing same-store sales quickly, that'd be one thing. But same-store sales both in the U.S. and China are quite weak. Starbucks has already raised prices repeatedly over the year, how much room do they have left to push that lever?

On the expenditure side, rising labor costs will hit margins in the domestic market. Throw in strong competition in various key markets, and Starbucks has some challenges ahead. If a recession should happen to hit, it's not hard to see Starbucks stock dropping back to $50 as consumers have to curtail their spending. At this price, SBUX stock comes with more risk than reward.

The bulls' view on BABA stock is rather simple: Alibaba is the unquestioned e-commerce leader in China.T hat's a market with a population nearing 1.4 billion people. Millions of those citizens are moving into the middle class - and into Alibaba's sweet spot - every month.

The bears' view is just as simple, however. China remains a Communist country. Given that fact alone, investors could logically decide not to own any Chinese stocks, let alone one valued at nearly US$400 billion. BABA stock carries many risks, one of which is the fact that BABA shareholders don't actually own shares of the company.

Alibaba stock admittedly seems almost obviously attractive. The Chinese e-commerce market already is huge, and it's going to grow by double-digit percentage levels for years, and potentially decades, to come.

Meanwhile, Alibaba has a dominant share of that market and no real challengers in sight. Second-place JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is scuffling. Western rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have limited or zero presence in the country. Between Taobao, Tmall, and Alibaba.com, BABA covers both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer channels.

Add to that the company's myriad other efforts. Its cloud business has real value and enormous growth potential. BABA holds stakes in dozens of other companies, including Ant Financial, Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), logistics provider ZTO Express (NYSE:ZTO), and many other public and private entities.

And yet BABA stock trades at 22 times analysts' consensus forward earnings estimate and even less when the company's net cash is subtracted from its share price. BABA is priced as though investors expect the company to grow at a moderate pace, but BABA's earnings can rise by at least 10% every year for some time to come.

The selloff of Alibaba stock - which is down 17% over the past year - seems more related to short-term worries about U.S.-China relations and other factors than to longer-term risks. BABA stock, from a long-term perspective, is available for a cheap price. Moreover, its opportunity is so obvious that the bear case seems almost laughable.

### The Bears' View on Alibaba Stock

That said, bears can point to just as many reasons to avoid BABA stock simply on principle, and Alibaba stock does pose real, material risks.

The company's accounting is notoriously opaque. There's little oversight of the company's spending, limited transparency, and essentially zero power for shareholders  who, again, aren't actually shareholders. Rather, they own a VIE (variable interest entity) which is entitled to a share of Alibaba's profits.

Alibaba does own 33% of Ant Financial, but as part of the transaction, BABA terminated a profit-sharing agreement with Ant. That agreement was instituted after Alibaba transferred the unit (then known as Alipay) to a company controlled by then-CEO Jack Ma. It's still not clear why or exactly how that spin occurred. Yahoo!, now owned by Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), owned a substantial stake in Alibaba at the time, but didn't find out about the transfer until five weeks after it had occurred.

Chinese economic growth certainly seems impressive, if you believe the numbers, which few do. China remains a single-party Communist state. And Ma - the country's richest man - is a member of the country's Communist Party.

While Ma has stepped away from running the company, the interconnections between the business and the government raise further questions about how shareholders, who are mostly from Western nations, might be treated going forward. As an attorney familiar with Chinese law told Barron's, &quot;Why anyone would invest in a vehicle that the Chinese government states is against the law is a mystery to me.&quot;

### What It Means for BABA Into Earnings

In the context of the dueling cases, the decline in BABA stock over the past seven months makes some sense. Investors have clearly become more nervous about risk and more nervous about China. Alibaba stock offers plenty of exposure to both.

And so the company's earnings, due next Wednesday, aren't likely to change the outlook of Alibaba stock all that much. The company's Q3 earnings, despite disappointing revenue, did propel BABA stock higher, but the advance reversed in December as trade-war tensions rose. Alibaba's actual numbers aren't going to do anything for investors who already believe that the numbers are fixed to some extent or that the corporate structure is untenable. They're not going to calm investors' fears that China's economy is heading for its long-awaited slowdown.

Alibaba stock, rather, is likely to move mostly due to external factors. Progress on the trade talks will help BABA; more bad news on that front will hurt BABA.

A Chinese recession will take BABA down with it. The numbers that are reported on Wednesday may have a short-term impact on BABA, but any impact will be fleeting. Investors who believe in Alibaba may be willing to ride out that volatility. Others, however, may seek out different opportunities.

The post Earnings Won't Answer the Key Questions Facing Alibaba Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Earnings Won’t Answer the Key Questions Facing Alibaba Stock
2019-01-24,"It was a rough 2018 for China e-retail giant JD (NASDAQ:JD). As the China economy slowed, JD slowed, too. A strong dollar didn't help things, either. Nor did escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Ultimately, JD went from a 40% revenue grower with expanding margins, to a 20% revenue grower with compressing margins. In the process, JD stock lost more than half of its value.

Calendar 2019 could be an entirely different story.

Signs have emerged over the past three months that the worst may be over for JD stock. Specifically, China's economy may have bottomed, and the U.S. dollar may have maxed out. If so, macroeconomic conditions in China will improve dramatically in 2019.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



And, if that happens, JD stock (which trades at anemic valuation levels with majorly depressed sentiment) will soar.

As such, now looks like a good time to buy the dip in JD. Things may not get better right away. But, signs indicate that things will get better in 2019. When they do, this stock could easily see $40 again.

### Positive Economic Developments

We've all seen the headlines by now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it had a rough holiday season in China. China's official GDP growth last year was the worst in nearly 30 years. Retail sales growth is at a 15 year low.

But, that's all backward looking data, and it confirms the obvious. China's economy slowed in the back half of 2018, and that slowdown caused once high-flying China internet stocks to fall off a cliff.

More important, signs are starting emerge which imply that 2019 could be the year when China rebounds. Consider the following:

  * U.S. and China trade talks are making progress, and global trade tensions have eased dramatically over the past few weeks. These trade tensions killed China consumer sentiment in late 2018, so easing of such tensions should boost consumer sentiment in 2019.
  * The U.S. Dollar has significantly weakened against the Chinese Yuan in 2019, after strengthening throughout all of 2018. Out-sized U.S. Dollar strength diluted the value of China internet stocks. Reversion to a normal dollar should enhance the value of China internet stocks.
  * The OECD's composite leading indicator for China (CLI) has increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November). Historically speaking over the past ~20 years, back-to-back months of CLI improvement after a multi-month streak of CLI deterioration has always indicated a positive inflection point in China's economy.
  * The OECD's consumer confidence index for China (CCI) has also increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November). Much like the CLI, back-to-back months of improvement in the CCI have historically signaled a turning point in economic trend for China.
  * Multiple companies outside of Apple, including Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG), said they felt no slowdown in the China economy over the past few months.



Overall, there were multiple positive developments in the last two months of 2018 and the first month of 2019 which, in sum, provide substantial evidence that the worst may be over for the China economy, and that 2019 could be a big rebound year.

### Relative Undervaluation Creates Opportunity

If the Chinese economy does rebound in 2019, that will spark a huge rally in JD stock for many reasons. Those reasons are as follows:

  * JD has dropped more than 50% off early 2018 highs due to slowing revenue growth rates amid the rapidly slowing China economy. Improvement in the China economic environment will recharge revenue growth rates, and help push JD way higher.
  * Margins have been hurt as the company has lost sales leverage. If revenue growth re-accelerates due to economic improvements, sales leverage will return, and margins will start heading higher again. This should push EPS estimates higher, and spur multiple expansion, a double tailwind which will send the stock flying higher.
  * JD currently trades at under 0.5X trailing sales, its lowest multiple ever as a public company. Thus, the aforementioned multiple expansion could be quite large, and we could reasonably see that multiple double under normal circumstances, implying $40 prices for JD stock in 2019.
  * Sentiment headwinds related to rape allegations against JD's CEO are now in the rear-view mirror.



Overall, if early 2019 signs are correct and China's economy rebounds this year, then JD is optimally positioned for a rip-your-face-off rally as improving fundamentals converge on a depressed valuation and depressed sentiment.

### Bottom Line on JD Stock

Calendar 2018 was a year to forget for JD stock. Leading economic signs suggest that calendar 2019 could be a year to remember. As such, now looks like a good time buy the dip in JD.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD, AAPL, and NKE.

With the harsh correction last year, many IPOs have gotten hit hard, but Nio stock had some other issues as well. Let's face it, Chinese tech stocks have been out of favor because of President Trump's tough talk on trade. The result is that major operators like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) have have seen steep drops in their stock prices.

But for Nio stock, there are also nagging concerns about competition. Consider that home-grown companies like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and Geely Automobile Holdings (OTCMKTS:GELYF) have been pouring resources into the EV category. And of course, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another formidable rival.

So all in all, Nio stock is quite risky, and it seems like a good bet that the volatility will continue. Yet despite this, the company has the opportunity to become a large company in China, which should represent a nice opportunity for investors -- at least for those who can stomach the twists and turns!

Here's a look at some of the positives for NIO:

### Nio Stock Advantage: Innovation

Nio is a relatively young company, having been founded in 2014. Yet it has made tremendous progress.

In 2017, Nio launched the ES8, a high-performance electric SUV. A 7-seater with an aluminum alloy body, it can go zero to 100km per hour in 4.4 seconds. The driving range is also 335km.

Then in late 2018, Nio came out with the ES6. It has dual motors, a state-of-the-art braking system and acceleration to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds. As for the structure of the vehicle, it includes aircraft-grade 7 Series aluminum alloy and carbon fiber. The combination allows for more strength but with less weight.

It's also important to note that Nio has been pushing innovation with its AI capabilities. For example, it has developed a speech interactive system, Level-2 autonomous driving and the ability to upgrade the systems via FOTA (firmware-over-the-air).

### Nio Stock Advantage: Execution

Over the years, many car startups have failed. One of the main reasons is the challenge of manufacturing. Even a few mistakes and miscues can lead to huge losses.

But as for NIO, the company has proven to be quite adept at scaling its operations. It probably helps that it has outsourced production to a Chinese manufacturer (although, NIO will eventually build its own plants).

Last year, the company delivered 11,348 ES8s, which exceeded its own forecast. There were also 3,318 deliveries in December alone. For the most part, NIO is showing strong traction.

According to NIO founder and CEO William Li: &quot;We will continue to focus on market penetration by delivering high-quality products and holistic services to our users and to improve the system efficiency of our development and operations.&quot;

### Nio Stock Advantage: Secular Trends

It's true that the slowing Chinese economy will probably be a headwind for Nio. But the long-term prospects for the auto market do look bright. This is especially the case for the premium segment. Based on research from Frost & Sullivan, the compound annual growth rate is projected at 12.4% from 2017 to 2022.

And yes, China has the largest market for EVs. Currently, the market share is about 4% of overall auto sales. But the Chinese government has an ambitious plan to take this to about 20% by 2025.

In other words, NIO is at the sweet spot of strategic market opportunity and so long as the company continues to execute, it is poised for durable growth.

2019-02-12,"While analysts debate whether the volatility and general market selloff are behind us, I would like to discuss why I am getting ready to take another look at the positive long-term prospects of three Chinese stocks: Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP).It's probably the understatement of the past 12 months to say that the trade wars between the U.S. and China have brought significant uncertainty to the global stock markets. As a result, most Chinese stocks were under pressure in 2018 and are now much cheaper than they were a year ago.But despite the negative sentiment toward these stocks, one thing remains true: Weibo, JD.com and Ctrip.com stock and many of the Chinese American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) listed in U.S. exchanges still offer investors the possibility to invest in the growing Chinese consumer economy. They were all darlings of investors and ranked among the best stocks in the market until the escalating war of words led to the start of various tariffs between China and the U.S in 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdding salt to the wound, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently warned that China, the world's second-biggest economy, has been slowing considerably.Even so, the wide-reaching economic implications of its political challenges and a potential cooling off in China shouldn't get in the way of a sensible, long-term investing strategy.The next several weeks may bring more volatility in WB, JD and CTRP shares. And I do not expect to witness a major favorable sentiment shift toward Chinese stocks. However, although short-term investors should expect daily price swings in these Chinese stocks as each company reports earnings in the coming days, long-term investors may see any further price declines as opportunities to go long.  * 10 Stocks That Every 20-Year-Old Should Buy With all of that in mind, here's a deeper look into why you should consider these three Chinese stocks to buy.    Source: Shutterstock  Weibo (WB)Weibo, a social media company with a popular micro-blogging website, is expected to report earnings on Feb 12.WB, which was spun off from Sina Corp (NASDAQ:SINA) in 2014, opened with an IPO price of $17 in April 2014. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) owns 32% of Weibo and is the second-largest shareholder after WB's parent company SINA (which owns about 46%).Chinese internet celebrity (better known as &quot;wanghong&quot;) accounts at Weibo, and the website's rich multimedia functionalities help make WB a much loved and somewhat indispensable social media company within China. Furthermore, WB's recent investments in live video streaming and fintech have already started contributing to the bottom line.The company's revenue comes from two main segments:  * Digital advertising (almost 80% of revenues)  * Value-added services (just over 20% of revenues)As a leading social media company, Weibo embodies Chinese consumers' love of social networking. Therefore, in addition to advertising income from Alibaba and Sina, it has been increasing advertising revenue from third parties, mostly thanks to being the website of choice for celebrity accounts.Weibo is still a high-growth company whereby I expect the earnings report to show that its revenue growth is still over 50%. This growth in revenue trickles down to the company's bottom line, improving its earnings-per-share. Its daily active users (DAU) is over 200 million and growing, a fact that contributes to its revenue.Moreover, WB has a quick ratio of 4.1, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. Therefore, the group would be in a robust position to weather any headwinds due to an economic slump.Although many analysts have expressed growth concerns regarding China, the country's economic fundamentals have vastly improved over the past decade; the internet population is still booming and money continues to pour into Chinese companies operating in this space -- factors that help support the long-term durability of WB stock.Yet, despite this longer-term strength, WB stock has had a difficult period in recent months. And this is despite its strong, proactive management, which has been successfully diversifying Weibo's advertising, broadening its social influence, especially among Chinese celebrities, and increasing its monetization.Over the past year, WB stock is down almost 46% and its 52-week price range has been $51.15 (Jan. 24, 2019) - $142.12 (Feb. 15, 2018).After investors' harsh response to the uncertainty over trade war threats in 2018, Weibo stock has suffered from a damaging technical picture. Its long-term technical chart still looks rather weak and it is pointing to the possibility for more choppy action, possibly between $50 - $65.When the company reports earnings on Feb. 12, investors will pay extremely close attention to the details in the company's quarterly results as well as any guidance on the health of the Chinese economy. The options markets are pricing in an approximate post-earnings move of 12% in either direction in WB shares.Any disappointment in the earnings statement could quickly send the shares back below $60.Weibo stock has a solid story in a country fascinated with social media, thus it remains a long-term growth play on a fundamental basis and it is still one of the best stocks to invest in China. However, in the near-term, there might still be a weakness in the WB stock price, a possibility that investors should factor in their investment decisions.    Source:  Daniel Cukier via Flickr JD.com (JD)JD.com, the largest Chinese online retailer out of Beijing, is expected to report earnings on Mar. 1.In addition to the online e-commerce operations, the group also has hundreds of warehouses and thousands of delivery stations as well as fresh food stores across China.JD stock has been in a downtrend for over a year whereby its 52-week price range has been $19.21 (Nov. 13, 2018) - $549 (Feb. 26, 2018). The downtrend came amid a series of company-specific and global macro events.In June 2018, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announced that it would invest $550 million in JD.com. Both companies stated that the combined synergies would enable them to collaborate on various e-commerce and technology related areas. Under the agreements, Google received &quot;27,106,948 newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares&quot; at a price that equated to &quot;$40.58 per American depository share.&quot; Although the cooperation between the two companies is likely to benefit both of them in the years to come, so far, JD stock hasn't reflected any benefit.On July 6, tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods came into effect and the selloff in Chinese stocks began. In August, JD.com's Q2 results gave a mixed message, hampering investor hopes that the downtrend might finally come to an end.September was also a difficult month for JD stock as in late August 2018, its founder and CEO Richard Li, who owns over 85% of JD.com's voting power, was arrested in the U.S. following sexual misconduct allegations. The troubling headlines caused a further selloff in JD stock.The selling intensified following the earnings report on Nov. 18, after which the shares hit a low not seen since June 2016.In summary, over the past year, JD stock is down over 43% and its long-term technical chart has not yet stabilized. Between now and when it reports earnings on Mar. 1, it is possible that JD shares will have a volatile reaction.JD.com competes aggressively with Alibaba in China's massive e-commerce market. When BABA announced its quarterly results on Jan. 30, the stock was up almost 7% on the day. Therefore, we might expect a similar positive reaction from JD.com stock if investors like what they hear in the earnings report.Otherwise, the shares could easily go down to re-test the November low of $19.21 before the stock price forms a healthy base.In the next few weeks, trading in JD stock is likely to be choppy with both widely up and down days. and any short-term up move is likely to meet resistance between the $25 - $30 levels.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months However, I think JD.com is still one of the best stocks China has to offer, and it could easily find a place in investors' portfolios … if they're in it for the long haul. Within two years, I expect JD stock to easily reach the lower $40's level, or the price Google paid for the shares in 2018.    Source: Thomas Galvez via Flickr Ctrip.com (CTRP)Ctrip.com, a travel services provider, is expected to report earnings on Mar. 13.The travel group has a history of beating earnings estimates and coming out with healthy financial numbers across the board. If the Chinese economy is indeed experiencing considerable headwinds, the next earnings report, however, may show a slowing of growth in the short term -- a result that may be followed by a drop in the price of CTRP stock.Currently, CTRP's revenue comes from four main segments:  * Accommodation Reservations  * Transportation Ticketing  * Packaged Tours  * Corporate TravelWhen CTRP reports in about a month, I would not be particularly surprised to see some concern over future guidance in regards to the corporate travel segment. A slowing Chinese economy would likely translate into falling corporate client demand, decreasing margins and slower revenue growth for Ctrip stock.On the other hand, the lunar new year celebrations of February 2019 are likely to have boosted demand for packaged tours as well as the personalized travel arrangements of the Chinese middle-class, where Ctrip.com's main focus lies.I also expect the earnings report to show that the management is pursuing different revenue streams and working to further its organic growth by reaching out to its young customer base, mainly under the age of 35.As China is becoming more urbanized, younger Chinese citizens are also beginning to spend more money on domestic and international travel, a trend that Ctrip is well placed to take advantage of.Over the past year, CTRP stock is down almost 25%, and its 52-week price range has been $25 (Nov. 13, 2018) - $51.91 (June 15, 2018). For those investors who pay attention to short-term technical charts, it has been forming a base between $25 - $35, a level that now acts as a support zone. Furthermore, Ctrip's technical momentum indicators, which describe the speed at which prices move over a given period, are currently in overbought territory. Although these indicators can stay overbought for quite a long time, short-term profit-taking is probably around the corner.The current short-term overbought chart follows several months of decline in the CTRP stock price, which has caused a damaging longer-term technical picture. Therefore, CTRP stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before another long-term sustained leg up can occur.When the company reports earnings on Mar. 13, any disappointment in Ctrip's earnings statement or future outlook could quickly send the shares back below $30. Thus, there might be weakness in the CTRP stock price in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate.Nonetheless, as travel demand in China grows due to demographic developments, Ctrip will be in a robust position to capitalize on its current market dominance. Within two to three years, investors who buy Ctrip are likely to be rewarded handsomely. As such, it is a standout among other stocks to buy for those with a focus on China.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-19,"Kudos to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) for trying, directly and indirectly. But Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) isn't even close to being dethroned as China's king of e-commerce. Alibaba is as secure there as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in North America.A couple of thousand miles south of China, though, it's a considerably different story. While its market is arguably less ready there than in other parts of the world, owners of JD.com stock can celebrate the fact that it's JD rather than Alibaba shaping the future of e-commerce in Indonesia and its geographical neighbors.It's certainly not the proverbial big Kahuna that China is. It's an opportunity for JD, however, that's bigger and better than most investors may realize.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Not AlibabaThe comparisons to Alibaba are understandable. Both were built on the back of burgeoning Chinese consumerism and bolstered by the advent of accessible internet service.JD and Alibaba aren't quite cut from the same cloth, however. Alibaba is a middleman, mostly, connecting buyers and sellers through its online Tmall platform, while JD.com stock is increasingly an investment in a retail logistics solutions provider. The two entities overlap to be sure, but they operate distinct business models.  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher The differences hardly end there, however. Unlikely to make a dent in Alibaba's dominance in China, JD.com has turned its focus southward, largely starting with Indonesia.The strategy started quietly taking shape in 2017 with a $100 million investment in then-startup ride-hailing service Go-Jek. Later that year, the company shelled out $500 million to develop Thailan-based fintech and e-commerce solutions. Last year it opened a cashierless store in Jakarta -- a la Amazon -- and just a few days later launched JD.ID, which is a virtual store-shopping experience. Indonesia consumers &quot;shop&quot; remotely using digital banners placed in a public space, and the ordered goods are delivered to that person's home.Alibaba has competed for access to the Indonesian market as well, pouring a total of $4 billion into Lazada as of early last year. Lazada is an e-commerce site established to serve the Indonesia market. Amazon even continues trying to carve out a piece of the southeast Asian market, using Indonesia as something of a toehold, committing $1.3 billion worth of investments there late last year.It's JD, however, that appears to fully have its finger on the pulse of the region's consumers even if Lazada is the biggest traffic draw. On the VergeIt's a smart move.As the growth of China's consumer class starts to cool, Indonesia's is still heating up. Last year's e-commerce spending in Indonesia reached $13 billion, according to Morgan Stanley, after growing at an annualized pace of 50% for the past two years. By 2023, the figure could exceed more than $50 billion. That would make it a bigger opportunity than frequently lauded India.It's not a terribly difficult outlook to fathom. Of the country's 264 million residents, only 195 million of them currently use smartphones, and only 30 million of them are online shoppers. The figures leave room for rapid growth, not unlike the evolution China's consumers made just a few years prior.Indonesia is also setting the standard, and pace, for neighboring countries' e-commerce industries to follow.The few JD.com stock holders that have been following the solidification of southeast Asia's e-commerce market will also likely know Indonesian authorities recently imposed new rules on companies doing business in the country. Operators will now pay income tax on profits earned there, and shoppers will pay a value-added tax on goods purchased. It's a development that could crimp the country's e-commerce growth right as it's hitting full stride.It's also a development, however, that may not weigh much on JD.com.As was noted, JD increasingly aims to become a logistics service provider rather than just a middleman, offloading some of that new burden to product and service providers. Indeed, almost as if scripted, Accenture managing director Mohammed Sirajuddeen said just last month that the one stumbling block preventing Indonesia's e-commerce market from soaring to a $300 billion industry by 2025 was its poor logistics network.  * Top 7 Semiconductor ETFs to Buy Now The problem plays right into the logistics-minded hand JD.com is holding. Looking Ahead for JD.Com StockJD.com is anything but a pure play on Indonesia, to be clear. Indeed, it's not even a pure play on the underserved and budding southeast Asian market. The future value of JD.com stock still greatly depends on how well it serves China's retailers.Nevertheless, JD's work and strategy in Indonesia has to be respected. The nickels and dimes Alibaba and Amazon are largely overlooking outside of China will soon be quarters, so to speak, and in some cases, a full dollar bill. Just as Alibaba and Amazon are tough to compete with where they're well established, JD.com will be tough to topple where it's making a point of establishing its new roots.It's a detail that will only become a bigger part of the JD stock story going forward.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-22,"Some of the concerns surrounding Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stem from a slowing down of the Chinese economy. The recent figures show 6.6% GDP growth rate in China which is the lowest rate in 28 years. More important, the forward estimates point to a further slowdown in the growth rate to below 5% in the next few years. However, Alibaba stock can still show bullish momentum as the company delivers 40% to 50% revenue growth rate using new services which are added to the platform.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrAlibaba stock will also benefit from a shift to organized retail and specifically online platforms in China.Alibaba's cloud platform has shown a growth rate of 84% in the recent quarter. The revenue share of this fast growing segment is 6%. Alibaba is also diversifying to other non-core commerce services and is expanding in international regions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns These initiatives should allow the company to report healthy growth rate in the near term. The valuation multiple of Alibaba's stock is still quite low for a company rapidly increasing the top line and bottom line. Slowdown in China's EconomyThere has been a gradual slowdown in China's economy in the last few years. The recent GDP growth figure is not surprising as most of the predictions were estimating growth of 6.5%. According to economists polled by Nikkei, the growth rate in 2019 could further fall to 6.2%.The OECD estimate for China's economy points to further deceleration. We can see from the above chart that the growth rate falls to below 5% by 2021-2022. This can lead to further concerns about the long term potential of Alibaba stock. However, the company's growth is quite detached from the growth rate in the broader economy.The growth in retail consumer goods was 9.0%. In a recent report, eMarketer has forecasted that the retail ecommerce sales will grow by 30.3% in 2019. This will increase the market share of online retail to 35% in the total retail segment.Alibaba's growth has consistently been greater than JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) which is main ecommerce rival of the company.Hence, the growth rate of Alibaba should easily exceed the broader online retail sales.  Other Growth OptionsAlibaba has been expanding into new services with massive investments. It has built a strong delivery service with Ele.me which competes with Tencent's (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) Meituan. Meituan has a market cap of $40 billion.Source: BloombergBesides food delivery, Alibaba is using the Ele.me platform to add new services. It has recently entered into partnership with Starbucks to deliver coffee. Alibaba has also entered pharmacy delivery segment which should allow rapid increase in transactions and sales. The international growth is an important part for future growth potential of Alibaba stock. The company has spent billions of dollars in acquiring and investing in different regions. Alibaba has acquired Lazada and Tokopedia which are the leading ecommerce platforms in Southeast Asia. It is also a major investor in Paytm which is the biggest digital wallet platform in India. In the last funding round in which Warren Buffet participated, Paytm was valued at $10 billion.  Alibaba and Cloud ComputingIn the recent quarter, Alibaba's cloud computing revenue increased to $962 million which was an 84% growth on a year-on-year basis. This also increased the revenue share of cloud computing to 6%. As the revenue base of this segment increases, it will have a bigger impact on the total revenue growth number. ValuationAlibaba stock still is quite cheap when we look at the revenue growth rate and future potential in various segments.We can see that despite trade tensions and tariffs, the forward revenue estimates of Alibaba did not decline significantly throughout 2018. The forward PE ratio of Alibaba stock is close to 30 which should be quite cheap for a company growing its revenue at close to 40%. Alibaba could also have an upside surprise on margins as the cloud computing segment is currently showing negative 4% EBITA margin. This is quite low compared to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS operating margin of 29.3%. As the cloud revenue increases, Alibaba should be able to get better pricing power which can increase margins rapidly.  Investor TakeawayWhile China's GDP growth rate is slowing, Alibaba has a number of growth levers to expand the revenue base as well as margins. Considering this, the valuation multiple of Alibaba stock is quite low. Alibaba should be able to add new services to its delivery platform. The revenue growth rate of Alibaba has been more than its main ecommerce rival, JD.com, for the past few quarters. A higher market share within the ecommerce space and rapidly expanding services should help in improving the long term growth potential of Alibaba stock.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-22,"The Chinese economy continues to grow faster than almost any other country in the world -- at an annual pace of roughly 6%. The middle class is expanding by millions each year, and that has led to a Chinese consumer who is spending instead of saving for the first time ever.Still, consumer-related stocks have come under pressure over the last year on fears of a slower economy. Add in the trade issues with the United States and Chinese stocks fell into a deep bear market last year.This created screaming long-term buying opportunities that still exist.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns There are many Chinese stocks worth keeping an eye on as bargain buys at current prices, but there are three in particular that stand above the rest. Let me tell you a bit about each … JD.com (JD)JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has had its fair share of issues in the last year, including both macro events and company-specific headlines. But even as the negative news continues to swirl, the company is still expected to increase revenue from $53 billion in 2017 to $81 billion this year.The e-commerce and online retail infrastructure provider is trading with a price-sales (P/S) ratio below 1 and is extremely undervalued at current prices. It is certainly worth watching as Chinese consumer stocks come back in favor. Alibaba (BABA)This is one of China's two leading technology companies, with the other being Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), an e-commerce and internet giant, has ties to nearly every aspect of the Chinese consumer from online shopping to banking and lending.The strength of BABA's brand alone makes it a benchmark for the Chinese consumer.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability BABA stock has taken a hit with the Chinese market in general, but as things begin to turn around I expect to see Alibaba as a leader. I view the stock as a core holding for any international portfolio. Ctrip.com International (CTRP)Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP) is an online travel site in China. Think about Expedia and Kayak. This is simply the Chinese version.CTRP stock has been under pressure due to widespread selling as well as several analyst downgrades over the past few months. But here again, the negative short-term view of the company has created a great long-term buying opportunity.The rising middle class in China yearns to travel, and CTRP will be a direct winner of an increase in both domestic and international travel in the months and years ahead.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-02-22,"Shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are showing new life -- along with a number of Chinese equities -- now that the U.S. and China are working toward a trade solution. Because of this improving rhetoric, BABA stock has been on the move, rallying just over 30% off its recent lows.Source: Shutterstock Can it keep going and possibly get back to its prior highs?Let's explore BABA stock and see if it's a good fit for certain investors. After doing some research, I've found that bulls can make a case for Alibaba stock based on three merits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trade Deal BoostWhy exactly did Chinese stocks like Alibaba, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and others fall out of favor so quickly? Admittedly, no company on this list is fundamentally perfect. But neither did they see any benefit when the U.S. and China started levying tariffs against one another, escalating a trade war between two of the world's largest countries.However, China appeared more vulnerable than initially believed and its economy has suffered markedly as a result. The U.S. hasn't gone unaffected, but the economy has handled the escalating trade war much better than many thought. That's left America in a favorable negotiating spot and as the two counties inch toward a deal, Chinese equities have been rallying.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability The knife cuts both ways. Any negative headlines or rhetoric about a trade deal falling apart will mean bad things for BABA stock and its Chinese compatriots. But so far, the sailing has been pretty smooth. Should a deal get done, these stocks will have a huge overhang lifted from them, allowing the stocks to be valued on their fundamentals rather than sold down due to country-wide concern. Strong Fundamentals for BABA StockThat brings us to fundamentals, which are very strong in the case of BABA stock. Weighing in with a $442 billion market cap, Alibaba is no small company. It's slightly larger than its domestic rival Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and just a bit smaller than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Still, Alibab's growth is virtually unrivaled, given its size. What other $400 billion-plus market cap company is set to grow revenue more than 30% this year? With that market cap threshold, the closest we get are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which are forecast to grow sales just under 20% this year.Alibaba though? Analysts are looking for 54% revenue growth to $55.5 billion in fiscal 2019, the last quarter of which Alibaba will report in May. Currently, analysts estimate that the company will grow sales another ~36% in fiscal 2020, vastly outpacing its mega-cap peers.The downside is that revenue growth is outpacing earnings expansion, which would suggest some margin pressure for Alibaba. That said, analysts are looking for 14.5% earnings improvement this year to $5.43 a share and an acceleration in fiscal 2020 to 23%. BABA stock trading at 31 times this year's earnings isn't exactly cheap, but where else can we find this growth at this size? We can't. Trading Alibaba Stock  Click to EnlargeBABA stock is now shaping up much better than we could have anticipated a few months ago. After a strong rally off the October lows, Alibaba stock was again slammed lower in December. I'm not going to lie, for investors who check their brokerage account frequently, it took some serious guts to hold onto these shares.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth Now above all of its major moving averages, Alibaba stock could have some clear skies ahead. It's got the fundamentals needed for a rally and all it really needs is the trade risk to be removed.This $168 to $175-ish area had been a strong buoy of support from the second half of 2017 through the first half of 2018. Once it gave way in September though, it turned to resistance, making the charts even more bearish. BABA stock is piercing through with authority, but it is starting to peak over this level.While the rally could always fizzle out, there's no doubt BABA stock is looking much healthier. Should we get a trade deal, this thing could fly and start to make its way back to $200. If this current zone acts as resistance, I would like to see shares hold up over the $160 to $165 area. Above it and Alibaba stock looks good. Below, not so much.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-02-22,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has become a contradiction. Given its valuation, one might think of it as a lower-cost alternative to those who bought Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) too late. However, the fact that BABA stock is not actually ownership in Alibaba bothers more risk-averse investors. Moreover, ties to China's Communist party along with murky accounting create other concerns.Source: Shutterstock However, Alibaba is also in the midst of a leadership change. Such transitions can become fraught with problems. In fact, BABA stock investors may have focused so heavily on the current risks that they may be ignoring a problem that makes any accounting or political issues irrelevant. Alibaba Stock is a ContradictionBABA stock frustrates some investors. On the one hand, it looks like a bargain compared to its U.S. peer Amazon. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio below 25, it compares well to Amazon's 40.6 (and falling) forward PE. Analysts also forecast 14.3% profit growth in 2019 and 23.2% in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConversely, BABA stock also holds risks not shared by AMZN. In previous articles, along with my InvestorPlace colleagues, I have mentioned the fact that owning BABA is not owning Alibaba. Instead, investors own a Cayman Islands-based holding company which receives a share of Alibaba's profits. Also, accounting practices also call the true financial condition of Alibaba stock into question. Beware the Conglomerate StatusHowever, the problem for BABA stock that receives less attention is Alibaba's conglomerate status. Yes, one can say the same about Jeff Bezos at Amazon. However, Bezos remains firmly entrenched in his CEO position. This is not the case with BABA. Now that Jack Ma has started to transition out of the company, the pressure will fall on new CEO Daniel Zhang. History shows that these types of firms fare poorly when handed to a successor.  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability The problem with conglomerates is they tend to become an entity that only the current CEO can manage. They then proceed to fall apart once they move to a successor. We saw this on the geopolitical stage when Yugoslavia's disparate culture groups tore the country apart in the 1990s after the death of Marshal Tito. This also occurred in American business with GE (NYSE:GE) following Jack Welch's retirement. Since Welch left, GE has continued to shed many of its businesses as they became unmanageable. It has seen its stock fall by more than 85% since Welch stepped down in 2001. America's Experiences Bode Poorly for BABADaniel Zhang inherits a comparable situation at Alibaba. Its core retail business acts as a wildly successful version of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). That has slowly begun to change under the competitive threat from JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which runs a more Amazon-like retail business. However, BABA followed Amazon's lead by building a successful cloud business. Alibaba also works in artificial intelligence (AI), online payments, digital media, and entertainment.Investors need to ask if Mr. Zhang can navigate all of these businesses at the same time. If the answer is yes, one can make a speculative case for Alibaba stock. However, other than Amazon in some areas, the experiences of American business with such firms indicate spinoffs could come in the future.In an attempt to combine retail with payments, eBay bought PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The online marketplace rethought that decision years later and today PayPal again operates as a separate company. In some ways, even Amazon's experience does not bode well. Though Amazon runs an entertainment arm through Prime Video, it continues playing catch-up to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Also, outside of the Echo, Amazon has done little with AI.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth These examples indicate that Mr. Zhang will face the same kind of challenges. Worse, if Zhang's time at Alibaba mirrors that of former CEO Jeff Immelt's tenure at GE, BABA stock may begin a gradual, multi-year decline. Final Thoughts on BABA StockDue to its new CEO, Alibaba's conglomerate status could create a danger separate from its political and accounting issues. Years ago, Alibaba ventured outside of its core retail business. It now works in fields unrelated to retail, such as entertainment and AI.Given his success, Jack Ma had a vision and saw what could work in these multiple, disparate industries. The problem with businesses like this is finding a successor with similar talent. Jack Welch's most significant failure at GE likely was an inability to find the younger version of him. Time will tell if Jack Ma can succeed where Jack Welch did not. Whether that answer is yes or no, investors need to weigh that threat when considering a position in BABA stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

This is an increase over the company's earnings per share of 4 cents from the same time last year. It was also a blessing to JD stock by blowing past Wall Street's losses per share estimate of 4 cents for the quarter.Net loss reported in the JD.com earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2018 comes in at $698.82 million. While this is a wider net loss than its $139.70 million from the same period of the year prior, it wasn't keeping JD stock down on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJD.com earnings for the fourth quarter of the year also include revenue of $19.61 billion. This is up roughly 22% from the company's revenue reported in the fourth quarter of the previous year.

2019-02-28,"It's another choppy session on Wall Street as investors react to better-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP data and try to interpret continuous trade-deal headlines that keep crossing the wire. All the while, individual stocks continue to put together big-time moves. Let's look at a few top stock trades to get see which are standing out the most. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: CelgeneShares of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) were under pressure Thursday, after a large investment manager in Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) expressed disappointment in the buyout deal. While investors are debating about the firm's voting power, it's still dampening the mood around the $74 billion deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Thanks to the headlines, it's left Celgene to fall almost 8% to just under $84. The action is quite disappointing for bulls, many of whom are desperately hoping this deal goes through. It's also disappointing as CELG stock way moving nicely, threatening to push through $92.Now what?With the stock's bounce off the lows, new-money longs have a solid risk/reward setup. The 200-day and 50-day moving averages stepped in as support, so investors who want to use a close below Thursday's low as their stop-loss are justified in doing so.Below $80 and CELG stock won't be looking too hot. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: BoxBox (NYSE:BOX) is also getting smashed on Thursday, down almost 20% after an ill-received earnings report. Box is my smallest portfolio position and while I'm disappointed in the move, I still like the stock over the long term.That said, this is the Top Stock Trades column, not the Solid Company but Weak Charts column. The situation is simple: the charts look bad for Box.The resiliency was astounding, with Box running from $20 at the start of this month to almost $25 ahead of the print. It's doing a good job of rallying off Thursday's lows, and north of $20 is encouraging. But still below the 50-day and this moving average could act as a clear hindrance to the bulls.Over this level and Box could run to $21, near downtrend resistance. Bears could either go short and use the 50-day (or downtrend resistance) as their stop-loss, or wait for a break below Thursday's lows to go short. Conversely, daring bulls who go long Box now could use the Thursday lows as their stop-loss, though it is admittedly a bit far from current prices.Both sides could give Box a day or two to digest the move. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: SquareSquare (NYSE:SQ) is a bit less extreme, but the bulls came to play. After selling off on SQ's fourth-quarter earnings, the chart is setting up nicely. With Thursday's bullish engulfing candle -- notice how the low-high range completely &quot;engulfs&quot; the prior day's range -- even more upside could be on the way.As great looking of a chart as this is, I actually do not love the action in SQ stock. Not because the reward isn't tempting enough, but because the risk is so exaggerated. Simply put, where does one put their stop-loss?At the prior day's close? How about at Thursday's lows?Ordinarily I would say the latter, but that's a long ways away from here and a bit too much risk for me. This one has upside potential, but bulls need to be careful and disciplined. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: JD.comWith JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) rallying to the 200-day moving average and pulling back after reporting earnings, I would love to see it consolidate between today's high and $26.This would give the stock a nice &quot;handle&quot; to accompany this big &quot;cup&quot; formation we have here -- hence the &quot;cup and handle&quot; formation. Then powering through the 200-day could trigger a big-time breakout. Below the 21-day is cause for concern, though. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: FitbitI am not a big fan of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) as the stock is too volatile for my liking. That said, bulls have a decent risk/reward setup on their hands after the stock's 14% post-earnings bludgeoning on Thursday.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism Investors who go long can use the 200-day moving average as their stop-loss, while investors comfortable with a wider trading range can consider using Thursday's low.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-01,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar is starting to wind down. Several key companies still report earnings next week, and more key earnings reports will follow later this month. But for the most part, earnings season has ended.And it's been solid. According to data from research firm Factset, as of February 22, 69% of S&P 500 components had surpassed earnings expectations, with 61% topping consensus revenue estimates. Investors have noticed: the S&P 500 index has gained 11% so far this year. The losses in an ugly December have been overcome.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven with earnings season near an end, there are intriguing earnings reports to watch next week, in three important sectors. But from a broader standpoint, the question for the market might be: what now? The key concerns that drove late 2018 weakness -- interest rate worries, tariffs, macro fears -- haven't exactly dissipated. Over the seven or so weeks until the earnings calendar builds up again, those risks may return to the fore.In that context, earnings next week for these three companies are important  because they could highlight the near-term direction not only of the stocks involved, but entire industries. A grocery leader will highlight the health of an industry where retailers and suppliers alike are struggling. A high-flying software play could show how focused the market is on valuation in tech. And a major retailer will give another data point on the impact of 'omnichannel' efforts in that competitive space.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 The earnings calendar may be winding down, but earnings next week still will matter to the market.Source: Shutterstock  Salesforce.com (CRM)Earnings Report Date: Monday, March 4, after market closeOn Wednesday, I detailed the importance of earnings from Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to not only CRM stock, but the market as a whole.The case here is simple. Salesforce.com operates a great business. The question is -- and long has been -- valuation. With CRM back at all-time highs, and trading at 60x forward earnings, there's an obvious concern that at some point, investors will start questioning multiples again. And that matters not just to Salesforce stock, but to other enterprise stocks who have returned to all-time highs, including Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK).Square (NYSE:SQ) was in a similar situation last week. And despite disappointing Q1 guidance, investors quickly bid that high-priced stock up as well. Similar treatment of CRM stock after earnings next week could suggest that the risk-on trade in tech is back for good.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Target (TGT)Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, March 5, before market openTuesday's Q4 release from Target (NYSE:TGT) is one of the biggest earnings reports for the company in some time. Target clearly is trying to keep pace with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as a legitimate brick-and-mortar rival to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Results for the key holiday season will show whether Target truly is competing -- or stuck in a distant third place.Guidance for next year (fiscal 2019) will be closely watched. Target has invested heavily in its 'omnichannel' capabilities in recent years and some of the initial benefits should start arriving in FY19. If Target can convince the market that these huge investments are driving growth, a 13x forward multiple leaves plenty of room for expansion.On the other hand, if Q4 results and 2019 guidance suggest Target is spending more just to stay in place, any hopes of TGT stock returning to September highs at $90 will be dashed.There are reasons for caution ahead of earnings next week. Walmart seemingly posted a blowout quarter last week -- and already has given back the gains that followed the report. As I wrote in late January, Target hasn't proven it's truly on the level of its two rivals.  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance Target earnings likely will have to be outstanding to move TGT stock higher. If they are, the reaction could show just how much faith investors have in brick-and-mortar retail. Right now, it appears there's still a fair amount of mistrust.Source: Shutterstock  Kroger (KR)Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 7, before market openThe grocery sector on the whole has struggled in recent years. And it was actually Kroger (NYSE:KR) that started the first leg down. In June 2017 -- the day before Amazon acquired Whole Foods, sending the space falling further -- Kroger's disappointing guidance rattled the sector.Kroger stock has rallied back to just shy of its levels before that report. The rest of the sector generally hasn't been so lucky. Margins continue to get squeezed amid deflation in key commodities -- and intense competition from Walmart, Aldi and others.That squeeze hasn't just hit grocery stocks. It's accelerated efforts by Kroger and others to drive private label sales. That in turn has hit brand operators, most notably Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), whose shares tanked after a disastrous earnings report of its own last month.So earnings next week from Kroger are going to be closely watched by not just peers, but food manufacturers. Can grocery store operators again start to drive successful margins? And how much will they have to pressure their suppliers to get to that point? Those are key questions for two important sectors of the market. Those questions will get some answers on Thursday morning.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

JD Beat Fourth-Quarter Earnings ExpectationsJD reported earnings yesterday, and it did very well. The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.07, beating expectations.Though the company did report a net loss of $698.82 million, which was an increase from the same time last year, the stock didn't suffer.I think there is enough positive sentiment around the U.S.-China trade situation to push JD higher on news of strong earnings, even with an increased net loss, and the technical picture is just as appealing. Support at 50-Day Moving AverageJD broke above its 50-day moving average (MA) at the start of 2019, and in January, that MA acted as support several times.

This should improve the bullish sentiment for BABA stock.Source: Shutterstock Analysts are also projecting much faster revenue growth by Alibaba in the next few quarters in comparison to JD. Currently, eMarketer has estimated 58.2% market share for Alibaba while JD's share has dropped to 16.3%.We should continue to see better performance from Alibaba in comparison to JD because of faster growth in segments like cloud computing. Alibaba has also invested heavily in international regions which should give BABA stock a better growth trajectory. If the market share decline in JD continues, it would be a much lower threat to Alibaba's ecommerce segment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips BABA Stock: Past Performance and Future EstimatesWe can see in the above chart that BABA has been able to beat JD in terms of revenue growth for the past several quarters. The direct impact of this is that the forward revenue estimates of Alibaba have grown much faster than JD. It should be noted that Alibaba and JD have a very different e-commerce business model. JD is very similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) because it controls the entire logistics and warehousing of goods. This has allowed the company to have a better check on the quality of goods and also limit fake items on the platform. On the other hand, Alibaba does not own the inventory, hence its revenue base is much lower than the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the entire platform.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever JD's business model is very expensive, which can be seen in the wafer-thin margins of the company. However, Alibaba produces a ton of free cash, which the company can then invest in other segments. This allows diversification of its revenue base and gives the company a longer growth runway. Alibaba has invested massively in its cloud segment and has opened new data centers in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and in the domestic Chinese market.  New RivalsIn the last report published by eMarketer, we can see that BABA has an overwhelming market share within China. JD has a market share of only 16.3%. However, there has been a rapid rise of a new rival. Alibaba is facing fresh competition from Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) which was started in 2015. In just three years, the company has been able to grab a decent market share. It is a group buying platform that allows buyers to get additional discounts for bulk purchases.PDD has seen faster growth in tier 3 and 4 cities. Customers in these cities have a greater preference for discounts and social buying experience. PDD has recently raised $1.5 billion in a secondary offering. This provides the company greater firepower to compete against Alibaba. Most of these additional funds will be invested in improving logistics and attracting new customers. In the last SEC filing, PDD claimed to have 232 million monthly active users. Alibaba has 699 million MAUs. PDD has the complete backing of Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), which should allow the company to add new features and take advantage of Tencent's ecosystem. Future Growth EstimatesDespite new rivals, BABA should be able to deliver decent growth in its core commerce retail for the near term. At the same time, growth in international regions, cloud segment and digital media provide the ability to diversify the revenue.The forward revenue estimates of Alibaba have been increasing rapidly. The revenue estimate for the two fiscal years ahead is close to $100 billion. Alibaba has closed the revenue gap with JD. Alibaba's Ele.me is adding new services to the last mile delivery platform. It is in direct competition with Tencent's Meituan, which has a market cap of $40 billion.Alibaba stock should see bullish sentiment due to strong growth in its subscription business on its Youku platform. Eventually, we could see Alibaba's subscription program become a big revenue generator for the company. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) subscription segment revenue in the trailing twelve months was $16 billion. Alibaba should be able to add more value to its subscription service by investment in content and delivery.The cloud segment showed revenue of $962 million in the recent quarterly earnings with a growth rate of 84%. At the current growth rate, this segment will be hitting the $10 billion revenue level on an annualized basis by next year.Alibaba has a number of growth options that should allow the company to deliver rapid growth in the top line over the next few quarters. This should help Alibaba stock in the near term.  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March Bigger market share within Chinese e-commerce will have a halo effect on other services offered by the company. Investors should look at the long-term market share trend of Alibaba to gauge the future growth potential in BABA stock. Bottom Line on Alibaba StockAlibaba has been able to deliver better revenue growth than its chief rival JD. This has increased the e-commerce market share of the company in China. It has helped in improving the ecosystem of new services, which are built around Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall platform. Having a high market share improves the pricing power of the company, which should help in expanding the margins.New rivals like Pinduoduo might take some of the market share lost by JD. However, Alibaba has proved that its business model is more successful in the domestic Chinese market. New growth segments like cloud and digital media should allow the company to deliver high growth rates in the near term.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-04,Q4 2018 JD.com Inc Earnings Call,Edited Transcript of JD earnings conference call or presentation 28-Feb-19 12:00pm GMT
2019-03-04,"Will Twitter Talk Transform into a Real US-China Trade Deal?Trade talks The United States and China have concluded four rounds of trade talks this year. The talks seem to be headed in the right direction, or that’s at least what US President Donald",Will Twitter Talk Transform into a Real US-China Trade Deal?
2019-03-04,"Whether it is the positive sentiment about the U.S. and China deal drawing near or the company's fundamentals, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has soared since the lows of 2018 and JD stock is up over 1% again this morning.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrLast December was brutal to stocks, especially the ones that are related to China. But unlike the rest of the stock market, JD set its lows in November. Then, when the S&P 500 bottomed on Christmas, JD set its double-bottom, which then became strong footing for this extended rally. Since then, JD.com stock is up more than 50%.Last week management delivered earnings and they beat the expectations. So investors rewarded them with another wave of buying. JD stock is not a cheap stock, so Wall Street gives it a lot of leeway, especially when the retail sector has recently come under fire. But JD is not the typical retail stock and it sits directly in the line of fire of the tariff war. So it is now riding the positive momentum on that front.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRegardless if it was sentiment, fundamentals or just the abatement of the CEO legal trouble headlines, JD now is a winning stock for those who are long it. They say don't fight the tape, so I wouldn't suggest shorting this healthy rally. For most, it has come too far too fast, so that makes it too dangerous to short and perhaps too scary to chase.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever So is it too late to buy it here? For the short term, the easy money is made. JD.com is in a mega rally since the December lows. While there is room for more upside, short-term traders need to be smart about it.From here, the bulls will need the help of the general stock market rally to help them extend the gains. This is not the same as saying to short the stock. This is a judgment of the technical chart setup. It has already reached several milestones off bullish patterns, which have already happened.Since the double bottom, JD stock has had several breakouts most notably from the necklines at $23.40 and $25.90 per share. Now as it approaches the $30 level, the lines get a little harder to read. Bottom Line on JD StockThe start of last September was a precipitous trap door and left an ominous collection of candles behind it. So the actual next trigger line is not as easy to read as the prior ones we've had so far this year.Long-term investors need not worry about these minute entry points as their thesis is long term so they can overlook the low time frame ticks. But from the short term perspective, those who trade JD have to trust in that the headline stream will continue to be positive on the tariff front and that the Chinese stock markets will also continue to rally. This is to provide JD with enough lift so it too can overcome the $32 per share cliff from which they collapsed at the end of last August.  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March Momentum stocks like JD.com stock pose a problem for most investors because of the speed with which they rally and fall. In this case, the stock looks overextended and due for a pullback. That alone is not a reason for it to correct, but it is definitely a reason to be cautious. Between $30 and $31 there are open gaps to fill, but they make for a tough slog for bulls. Waiting out those candles makes sense, especially for new entrants. These are spots where those who traded JD stock long from the bottom look to trim profits.When a stock recovers from a bottom and reaches its prior &quot;accident spots&quot;, both bulls and bears will want to fight over it again thereby creating congestion that could stall the rally. For now, those who are long JD stock can stay long, but those looking for a new entry position should probably wait out a few more candles. Otherwise, there are round number stop loss levels at $28, $27 and $26 per share below.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-11,"As I've written before, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is one of the more interesting stocks in the market. To bulls, the story is almost self-evident. BABA stock offers exposure to the enormous and still fast-growing Chinese market. And even with a 34% rally year-to-date, Alibaba stock isn't particularly expensive.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrTo bears, the risks are equally obvious. BABA shares don't include actual ownership of the company. As I noted earlier this year, the VIE (variable interest entity) structure may be against Chinese law.While China's population is huge and Alibaba's growth impressive, the company still operates in a nominally Communist country under a single-party government. Add in long-running accounting questions and for some investors, Alibaba stock is a firm &quot;avoid.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've generally leaned toward the skeptical side when it comes to Alibaba stock, for instance calling a top in BABA back in early December. That call was prescient in the near term, but since then Alibaba stock has reclaimed those levels and then some. After reaching a six-month high last week, however, the near-term outlook again looks questionable.The risks here clearly are rising which could lead BABA to again turn downward.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio  A New CEOOn this site last month, Will Healy made an interesting point about the CEO change at Alibaba. Founder and long-time CEO Jack Ma is leaving in September. And as Healy pointed out, conglomerates like Alibaba tend to struggle after management changes.Healy pointed to General Electric (NYSE:GE) since the departure of Jack Welch. And while, in retrospect, some of GE's current problems likely can be traced back to Welch's decisions (notably the mess at GE Capital), it's an interesting analogy.Alibaba truly is a conglomerate at this point, as it expands into cloud computing, entertainment, and other areas. New CEO Daniel Zhang will have quite a few proverbial balls in the air when he takes over. Zhang will have to be up to the task. Competition GrowsOne of Zhang's immediate challenges will be maintaining Alibaba's leading market share. Competition in the legacy business remains intense, with second-place JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) investing heavily in a bid to drive sales higher.So far, Alibaba is holding up just fine. Revenue in its &quot;core commerce&quot; category rose 40% in the fiscal third quarter (ending December), against a 22% rise for JD.com. The company incredibly had 636 million active customers on its platform in calendar 2018 - a figure roughly double the entire population of the United States.The question, particularly as BABA stock rallies, is whether that's enough. I've long argued that international expansion is a key part of the long-term growth story here. Outside China, Alibaba will face rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL).Alibaba has made a modest move into the U.S., announcing a partnership with Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) this week. Southeast Asia is a clear focus as well. But with still less than 10% of revenue coming from outside China, Alibaba will need more wins in more markets. China's Macro PictureChinese stocks on the whole remain below 2018 highs, in large part due to continuing worries about the health of the Chinese economy. Wayne Duggan dismissed those concerns, pointing out that the disappointing 6.6% growth in China's 2018 GDP is more than double that of the supposedly strong U.S. economy.The worry here isn't slowing growth, however. It's that the millions of empty apartments and the government's picking of winners and losers (including Alibaba) at some point will lead to a decline, if not a collapse, in the broader economy.Again, different investors can view the Chinese economy very differently. But with 90%+ of its sales coming domestically, the fate of Alibaba stock obviously is tied to that of the broader economy. Even modestly rising fears of a slowdown could cause investors to flee. That's what happened to Chinese stocks on the whole last year and I wouldn't be surprised to see a similar sell-off in 2019. The Stock Market and Alibaba StockAs 2018 trading shows, BABA stock also is tied to the performance of stocks on the whole. And there are some signs that investors' risk appetite is declining.Housing stocks have pulled back in recent sessions. Higher-debt stocks are struggling. The small-cap-heavy Russell 2000,which was the canary in the coal mine ahead of last year's broad market rout, dropped over 4% in the last five sessions.BABA stock hasn't been immune. It's pulled back in recent sessions as well, including a 3.8% decline on Thursday. Given the clear amount of risks here, Alibaba stock won't be a safe haven if the market struggles. If markets keep dropping, BABA likely will too.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Better market sentiment certainly has helped. And other Chinese stocks have rallied as well. iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), the so-called Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of China, has risen by two-thirds. Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS), in which JD.com owns a stake, has gained more than 50%. Fellow ecommerce play Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is up 39%.Still, JD.com has earned some of its gains on its own. Strong Q4 earnings for JD.Com helped the cause. Perhaps as importantly, JD.com management has clarified its story and highlighted the success of the core business. That rightly has helped investor confidence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally  JD Earnings and New DataJD stock already had been rallying into earnings, admittedly. But the Q4 earnings report certainly helped the stock for two reasons. First, headline numbers handily beat consensus, including a $0.11 beat in terms of EPS.But perhaps more important, JD gave investors some clarity as to the underlying business. For the first time (I believe), the company broke out operating income for its core ecommerce platform as well as new businesses. As Luke Lango pointed out in December, investors had become increasingly worried about the company's narrowing operating margins. But disclosures in the Q4 earnings report explained why those margins were coming down.For the core business, what the company calls JD Mall, the news actually looks pretty good. Operating income, in local currency, rose from RMB4.96 billion in 2017 to RMB7.05 billion in 2018. As the company detailed in its post-earnings slides, that implies a rise in operating margin from 1.4% to 1.6% - a huge improvement from a 0.2% print for the core business back in 2015.Investments are coloring the consolidated figures, though. The company's operating loss in efforts like third-party logistics, new technology, and overseas markets expanded markedly to RMB5.1 billion from RMB2.1 billion the year before.On the whole, operating income for the year fell by one-third. But with the new businesses broken out, that decline seems less concerning. In fact, it sounds rather familiar. JD.com StrategyJD.com's strategy makes more sense with those disclosures. Margins in the JD Mall business are thin - which isn't a surprise. The company is investing in customer acquisition and other efforts, which costs money upfront. The benefits come over time.Elsewhere, the company is losing money. But there, too, the payoff should come years down the line, whether it's the company's expansion into markets like Indonesia or the buildout of its logistics business. It costs money to move into new markets, and it's smart that JD is spending that money now. Spinoffs of its finance and logistics businesses are helping fund some of that spend.What's interesting about the strategy is that it's an echo of the American ecommerce leader, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). As many people have pointed out, it's JD.com, not Alibaba, that truly is the &quot;Amazon of China.&quot; And what the Q4 disclosures show is that the strategies are somewhat similar. Like Amazon, JD is trying to build an impenetrable moat through a world-class supply chain.And like Amazon, JD also is willing to spend now in new efforts with the hopes of adding new revenue and profit streams. Yet JD.com is much cheaper than Amazon: in fact, its market capitalization is about one-twentieth that of its U.S. counterpart. Is JD Stock Cheap?To be sure, this is not to imply that JD should be valued in line with Amazon or even close. And there are different ways of looking at JD stock even in the context of its strategy.Obviously, the Chinese market has its own risks. Like Alibaba, investors have questioned JD.com's accounting. The Chinese economy appears to be decelerating, and Alibaba presents a competitor that Amazon truly has never had.And while the Chinese market will be larger than that of the U.S at some point, there's also the question as to whether JD.com can penetrate Western markets. The company has started serving U.S. customers through its partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL). But that opportunity still is small - and JD.com has minimal presence elsewhere outside of Asia.Still, there's an intriguing case for JD stock, even with the YTD rally. The fears that drove JD stock to the lows last year may return. But from a long-term standpoint, JD.com's strategy looks much clearer and more successful than some investors may have realized. For China bulls, that may be enough to believe that the rally should continue.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-05,"A better-than-expected jobs report has stocks gravitating higher on Friday, as the S&P 500 continues to go higher. Let's see how our top stock trades are setting up after another broad market rally. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: SpotifyDespite the noise around Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) topping Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) for music subscriptions, the stock is actually trading pretty well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio SPOT is not only holding the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, but is also holding its breakout point over short-term downtrend resistance. Bulls have a low-risk entry at this point, with a potential $10 move up to the February highs and the 200-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Occidental PetroleumDepending on how one draws their trendlines, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is either breaking out or almost breaking out of its recent range.As long as oil prices hold up, OXY and the bunch can likely continue higher (here's our trade in Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) that's working on Friday too).A reasonable target for OXY? The 200-day moving and the $73 to $74 level. On the downside, a close back below $67 puts OXY back in its prior range, although the 50-day has been solid support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: InvitaeInvitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) has become a fascination among traders, as the high-flyer continues to make wild moves. Even though it was up 7% at one point on Friday, there was talk about an even further rally to new highs north of $26.With the intraday pullback, that didn't really work out for NVTA, but the bulls are still doing okay. Shares continue to grind up this 20-day moving average, with Invitae continually pulling back off $25 resistance.Short of a market-wide correction, this sets up the thesis of, &quot;the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to break.&quot; We said any pullbacks into this $20 to $21 area will be bought up and that's panned out thus far.So what now? Bulls can keep riding this momentum along the 20-day and look for a breakout over $25. Over $26 and this thing could really fly. Below uptrend support, the 20-day and $21, and we'll need to re-evaluate.   Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: JD.comEarlier this week we highlighted Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and boy has this one been trading really well, now at $185. Now it must be JD.com's (NASDAQ:JD) turn, as this one continues to climb too.It's knocking on $32 and wants higher. Should it get over this mark, it could run up toward $35. It might be too greedy to ask for another pullback, given that investors could have nabbed this one below $30 just a few days ago. However, keep an eye on $32. If shares push through it, see if $32 acts as support. That's a great buying chance, as would a pullback into the $29 area. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: StarbucksStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been an absolute beast. It was up in the fourth quarter and has continued higher in Q1 too. Not many names can say that, as SBUX is now up more than 56% from its summer lows.With this strong of a trend, it's hard to be a seller, even after such a big move. Shares are knocking on $75, wanting to push up. If they rally this into earnings later this month, it's hard to imagine much upside being left. That said, pullbacks into the 20-day are safe buying opportunities for now.  * Critical Levels to Watch in 3 Marijuana Stocks See that SBUX stays above $72.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-10,"The stocks of Chinese e-commerce firms like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) naturally interest many investors for an obvious reason: they're based in China. With a population over four times the size of the U.S., the Asian juggernaut has the world's largest consumer base. That alone makes JD.com stock intriguing.But more recently, JD.com stock has pleasantly surprised both speculators and casual onlookers. [ipm_internal_ad_list ipm_ad__post_id_1=&quot;1352558&quot; ipm_ad_copy_1=&quot;10%20Dow%20Jones%20Stocks%20Holding%20the%20Blue%20Chip%20Index%20Back&quot; ipm_ad_url_1=&quot;https://investorplace.com/2019/04/10-dow-jones-stocks-holding-the-blue-chip-index-back/&quot; /] InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrIn 2019, JD.com stock has skyrocketed nearly 54%. In contrast, our own Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up over 25% year-to-date. While that's not a bad haul, JD stock has gained more than twice as much as venerated AMZN  this year.Additionally, several other Chinese companies have rallied by similar amounts this year. For instance, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is up 38% YTD, while Momo (NASDAQ:MOM) has gained a whopping 76% so far in 2019. The  U.S.-China trade war, which might end soon, initially dampened the Chinese economy. However, it appears now that we're in the middle of a Chinese economic renaissance.Obviously, that has positive implications for JD.com stock. But President Trump has never truly eased his aggressive stance toward China. As a result, many American firms are rethinking their dependence on Chinese customers. Yet despite these fundamental headwinds, JD and many of its peers continue to thrive.Thus, many investors think that JD.com stock can clearly rise further. If the company didn't crumble under the frustrating geopolitical pressures, it probably won't do so now. Plus, it's in the interest of both the U.S. and China to resolve the trade dispute.And from a technical standpoint, the momentum of JD.com stock is very strong right now. Currently, JD stock is facing some resistance at the $32 level. But if JD gets past that level, it's conceivable that the e-commerce giant could eventually hit $40. Perhaps JD.com stock will even hit record levels soon.But despite the temptations, now is the time to be  cautious about JD stock. JD.com's Growth Is SlowingInvariably, whenever people discuss JD.com stock, China's population and population growth will come up. I've referenced that growth before, and really, how could I not? Over the next six years, several experts predict that China's middle class will grow to about 780 million.However, it's rare that a publicly-traded company will continue to rise based on a macro trend like that. And if you expect JD.com stock to be an exception, I have bad news for you: it won't be.In 2015, the company's  quarterly revenue rose by an average of nearly 55%.   In the first quarter of 2015, JD rang up sales of $5.87 billion. By the final quarter of that year, its revenue had jumped to $8.5 billion.But just one year later, its quarterly YoY growth averaged only 35%. In 2017, that metric improved, but only slightly, to 38%. Last year, the growth metric again slipped, reaching 31%.In Q4 of 2018, the company generated $19.5 billion of sales. However, JD's top line grew just 17% YoY, the lowest  top-line expansion that JD ever reported.Of course, as a company increases in size, it becomes harder for it to achieve dramatic growth. But in this case, it's likely that the pain of China's consumers is responsible for the slowing of JD's growth. Throughout 2018, China's retail sales noticeably deteriorated. Consequently,  anyone buying JD.com stock at its current levels is taking a risk.Additionally, I'm not sure if the outlook of Chinese consumers will improve unless the U.S. and China ink a trade deal. While the Chinese middle class gets the glory, America's middle class is the unsung hero. After all, someone has to buy the stuff that the world's second-biggest economy exports.In other words, without us, there is no Chinese middle class. JD Has Challenges in Another MarketA counterargument to my point is that, since JD's management team realizes that it can't beat Alibaba on their home turf, JD is looking elsewhere for opportunities.As InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley noted, JD has made significant inroads into Indonesia. On the surface, that's a very smart and potentially lucrative strategy. Because Indonesia is a genuine emerging market, it offers JD first-mover advantage and tremendous growth opportunities. Brumley wrote:Of the country's 264 million residents, only 195 million of them currently use smartphones, and only 30 million of them are online shoppers. The figures leave room for rapid growth, not unlike the evolution China's consumers made just a few years prior.But for now, Indonesia's growth  is largely more a matter of potential than reality. For one thing, the country's wealth gap is atrocious. An Oxfam report declared that Indonesia's &quot;four richest men now have more wealth than 100 million of the country's poorest people.&quot;That might work for JD stock if the underlying company specialized in exclusive, luxury goods. But it's striving to build a platform for the masses. And recently, the masses aren't buying with the same fervor as before. Thus, I'd approach JD.com stock with some caution right now.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-23,"Make no mistake about it. The big internet retail stocks have been absolutely on fire in 2019.Thanks to a series of data-points ranging from renewed consumer confidence to big jobs growth to robust online retail sales growth, it has become increasingly obvious that the fundamentals underlying e-commerce stocks have meaningfully improved in 2019. Broadly speaking, consumers aren't worried about a recession anymore, they are all employed, they are all getting raises and they are all shopping through online channels more heavily than ever before.Consequently, the Global X E-commerce ETF (NASDAQ:EBIZ) has rallied around 30% year-to-date. Which e-commerce stocks are the big winners in this rally? Can they all stay red hot through the end of the year?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Let's answer those questions by taking a looking at these red-hot internet retail stocks that have all staged huge, 20%-plus rallies so far in 2019. Internet Retail Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 30%Why It's Hot: E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been red hot in 2019 for several reasons. First, the company is the face of the growth trade, and the growth trade has come back in favor in 2019 as financial markets have stabilized. Second, rates have dropped, and that helps support the valuation of long-term growth stocks like Amazon. Third, concerns related to the great slowdown of Amazon's e-commerce business have increasingly appeared to be overblown. Fourth, Amazon's ramp in digital advertising is creating a huge tailwind for margins and profits.Why It'll Stay Hot: Amazon stock will stay hot for a few reasons. First, rates project to stay lower for longer, and that will help support the stock's valuation. Second, e-commerce growth rates should pick back up throughout the course of this year as broader economic and consumption fundamentals improve. Third, digital ad ramp will create a 2019 profit surge, which will further drum up investor enthusiasm. JD (JD)Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrYTD Gain: 39%Why It's Hot: Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD) has been on fire in 2019, mostly because China's broader economic fundamentals and outlook have dramatically improved. Specifically, at the end of 2018, China's economy was rapidly slowing, and that was dragging down JD's growth rates at the same time that margins were being pressured by growth investments. That double headwind killed JD stock. In 2019, though, the narrative has flipped. China's economy has stabilized, and even shown signs of improvement in some areas. This has brought investors back into beaten up China stocks, one of which is JD stock.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Why It'll Stay Hot: JD stock should stay hot in 2019 because it still has a lot of ground to make up, and will have the fundamental firepower to do just that. This was once a $50 stock. Even after the huge year-to-date rally, the stock is still just around $30. Thus, there's still more room for recovery. The stock should make that recovery in 2019, as the stock benefits from a double tailwind of improving growth rates and rising margins. Wayfair (W)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 66%Why It's Hot: Online furniture retailer Wayfair (NYSE:W) has roared higher in 2019 because the company is firing on all cylinders. Its domestic business remains strong, and the company continues to distinguish itself as the leader in the U.S. e-commerce furniture market. Wayfair is also scaling the international business at a very healthy pace. Margins are moving higher, and making progress towards their long-term goals. All in all, the story and numbers have simply been really good in 2019, and Wayfair stock has consequently risen over 60% year-to-date.Why It May Cool Down: Wayfair stock may cool down here for one simple reason: valuation. In short, the stock has sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the near term, and is due for some turbulence -- in fact, we have already seen some. Not too long ago, this was a $170 stock. Now, it's below $150. Thus, the stock has already had somewhat of a pullback. But historically speaking, this stock has pullbacks in the 20%-plus range. As such, recent weakness in Wayfair stock may last for a little bit longer before the stock ultimately reverses course. Etsy (ETSY)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 38%Why It's Hot: Online arts and crafts retailer Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has been on a monster run in 2019, mostly thanks to a strong holiday earnings report. Broadly speaking, the company reported robust holiday 2018 numbers that were strong across the board, from community growth, to sales growth, to margin expansion. Investors cheered those results, and bid up ETSY stock to fresh all-time highs.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Why It May Cool Down: ETSY stock has been cooling down for the past few weeks (more than 12% off recent highs), and will likely continue to cool down due to an overstretched valuation. The company has a well-defined niche in the secular growth e-commerce market. But, there's a ton of competition among internet retail stocks, and it's only a matter of time before that competition dilutes revenue growth. Meanwhile, EBITDA margins are already at 20%, and are only projected at 30% long term, so the margin drivers here aren't that great. Overall, then, once revenue growth slows, ETSY stock could drop in a meaningful way. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrYTD Gain: 67%Why It's Hot: E-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has been red hot in 2019 for a few reasons. One, the growth trade coming back into favor has certainly helped the stock, as have continued low rates and renewed consumer confidence. Also, coordinated economy trends in the e-commerce world have continued to gain momentum, and analysts have been sounding the bull horn on the stock amid positive channel checks. All in all, then, the bull thesis on SHOP stock has gained momentum and clarity, and the stock has subsequently soared higher.Why It'll Stay Hot: In the long run, Shopify stock is a winner powered by secular growth tailwinds in e-commerce, decentralization and cloud solutions. The stock may run into some near-term turbulence here as it's been so hot, that it's due for a minor pullback. But, the underlying trends here are powerful enough to offset any near term weakness, and will ultimately keep the stock on a long-term winning trajectory.  eBay (EBAY)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 30%Why It's Hot: E-commerce marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has staged a huge comeback in 2019 amid a flurry of operational improvements. First, the backdrop improved meaningfully, with financial market and global economic conditions improving in the new year. Then, activist investor Elliott Management wrote an open letter to management in January, disclosing a $1.4 billion stake in eBay while painting a path for big long-term gains. Investors rallied behind that letter -- and pretty good fourth-quarter numbers -- and the stock has gained 30% in 2019.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Why It'll Stay Hot: eBay stock could stay hot because it's still pretty cheap. The stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings. That's dirt cheap for an e-commerce player. To be sure, it's mostly because there's not much growth happening at eBay. Revenue growth is muted, and margins are maxed out. But, if the company can stabilize growth and margin trends (which is doable given the company's wide reach and the secular tailwinds in the e-commerce market), then the stock should easily trade at a market average 16x forward multiple. That implies good upside from here, both through profit growth and multiple expansion. PayPal (PYPL)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 27%Why It's Hot: Shares of e-commerce payment solutions provider PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have roared higher in 2019 as the company has benefited from a plethora of fundamental tailwinds. Economic conditions have improved. Consumer confidence and spending has bounced back. E-commerce sales growth has remained robust. Specific to PayPal, Venmo has gained a ton of momentum, the company scored a big partnership with Instagram on their new Checkout feature, and analysts have been upgrading the stock in bulk.Why It'll Stay Hot: PayPal stock will stay hot because the secular tailwinds here remain healthy, and the economic situation globally is only improving. As such, the numbers will remain good for the rest of the year, the long-term growth outlook will continue to support a robust valuation and investors will continue to seek market-leading exposure to digital payments. All three of these factors will ultimately keep PYPL stock on a winning path in 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, JD, SHOP, EBAY and PYPL.

2019-04-23,"Last week it was reported that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would exit its Chinese marketplace business in mid-July. One less competitor -- that's Amazon no less -- should bode well for a company like Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA), right? Of course, it helps that the news around BABA stock is improving, as are the charts.Source: Shutterstock Chinese e-commerce players like Alibaba and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are direct beneficiaries of a partial exit by Amazon. However, Chinese equities in general had been under heavy pressure as the trade with the U.S. and slowing Chinese economy both weighed on the share prices. That's true for Alibaba stock, but also names like iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and others.So is it off to the races now? No, not exactly. But Alibaba has plenty of positive potential catalysts and is one of the larger players when it comes to global e-commerce firms.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Valuing Alibaba StockAt least when compared to FAANG stocks, BABA stock quietly sports a massive market cap, weighing in at roughly $480 billion. Unlike some blue-chip tech stocks, Alibaba doesn't pay a dividend, but with its balance sheet, it could if management so chose.Alibaba has almost $32 billion in cash and $33.5 billion in combined cash and short-term investments. Total current assets of ~$41 billion is almost twice its total current liabilities of $21.65 billion. Even though long-term debt stands at $19 billion, current assets of $114.3 billion should ease any financial worries over BABA stock considering it's almost triple the $44.7 billion in total liabilities.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt If any worries do exist about Alibaba's financials, perhaps the company's growth can take care of that. Current estimates call for a whopping 55% revenue increase in 2019 and another 35.5% jump in 2020. That easily outpaces BABA's immediate peers, as well as its U.S.-based FAANG peers. Earnings growth is less impressive, but solid nonetheless. Estimates call for 15.6% improvement this year to $5.48 per share, while 2020 estimates call for an acceleration to ~23%.That leaves BABA stock trading at 33.8 times earnings, which doesn't exactly feel like a discount. On a forward basis, Alibaba stock trades at roughly 28x forward earnings. That's actually slightly below its five-year average of 29x forward estimates. Ultimately, some investors will feel uncomfortable paying 34 times current earnings and that's just the way it is.Alibaba has various businesses in one of the world's largest economies. While China is struggling through a dry patch economically, it's anything but done growing. For this strong of revenue growth and solid earnings growth, many will flock to BABA stock -- especially if its charts start to cooperate. Trading BABA Stock  Click to EnlargeShown above is a longer term, 30-month weekly chart of Alibaba stock. Below is a shorter term six-month chart, but both show a very similar setup for BABA stock. That is, a series of higher lows pushing the stock price higher while overhead resistance keeps a lid on any potential rally.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm On the monthly chart, we can see that $190 has played a role in the past as well. So long as BABA stock stays above the 10-week moving average and uptrend support, there's little reason to get overly bearish on the name.  Click to EnlargeOn the daily chart, we can see that short-term resistance is actually a little lower, near $188. For almost two months now, this level has stymied BABA stock, while shares have been trending higher for about four months now.Like the weekly chart, as long as BABA stock stays above uptrend support and its 50-day moving average, bulls are still okay. Below these levels and at the very least, Alibaba may need to reset, if not trade lower before becoming a buy again. A breakout over $190 could trigger a rally north of $200.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-24,"China's ecommerce powerhouse, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), has been a magnet for controversy lately. And this has certainly had an impact on the company's shares. From June 2018 to November, JD stock went from $43 to $19. But then there has been a powerful rally. Note that JD is now at about $30.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrNo doubt, one of the reasons for the volatility has been the company's founder and CEO, Richard Liu. About four months ago, while he was visiting Minneapolis, a student from China accused him of rape. Liu was arrested but the charges have since been dropped.But the controversy is far from over. The student has recently filed a lawsuit against Liu. There has also emerged a protest against him, with a petition signed by hundreds of people on social media platforms like Tencent's (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) WeChat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt It's far from clear what will happen with the suit. Yet despite the run-up in JD stock this year, there appears to be concern with he leadership of Liu. It also does not help that Liu referred to some of his workers as &quot;slackers&quot; and that they are not his &quot;brothers&quot; (yes, this is probably something that won't get good ratings on Glassdoor.com).This was in response to the emerging discontent in China regarding long work hours. It is called &quot;996,&quot; which is a six day work week that has a daily schedule from 9 am to 9 pm.Oh, and something else: JD.com appears to be in the midst of layoffs that could come to 8% of the workforce. There have also been departures of top executives, such as chief technology officer Chen Zhang and public affairs officer Ye Lan.Now a restructuring is probably a good move, as the logistics platform is costly. In light of this, the company has also been looking at automation like robots. Yes, this is similar to the strategy of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But then again, this company has the advantage of the hugely profitable AWS platform. JD Stock and GrowthAnother issue for JD is the slowing of the Chinese economy. President Trump's trade policies have taken a toll. It is also getting tougher for China's economy to churn out growth because of its enormous size.But it is important to note that JD has been experiencing a deceleration for quite some time. From 2015 to 2018, the revenue growth has gone from 55% to 31%. In fact, as of Q1, it has dropped to 17%.What's going on? Well, the ecommerce market in China is highly competitive. For example, this week Amazon.com indicated that it will close its Chinese online marketplace.However, JD.com's situation may be a case of execution as well. After all, even though Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is much larger, the growth ramp was still a sizzling 41% in the latest quarter. Bottom Line on JD StockI think the prospects for ecommerce in China remain bright. A big driver is the growth in the middle class, which is expected to hit a whopping 780 million within six years. And estimates are that the spending on ecommerce will jump from $470 billion in 2018 to $839.54 billion by 2021.So this should be great for JD stock, right? Yes, this is true, but the problem is that the company appears to be the in retrenchment mode, which is probably resulting in lower morale. What's more, the valuation is far from cheap, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple on 31X.  Note that the current stock price is essentially in-line with the Street's consensus price target.To put this into perspective, BABA is at 27.6X, even though it is growing much faster and has a more diverse set of revenue streams. In other words, if you want to play the ecommerce trends in China, BABA looks like the better option right now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-04-25,"Often, the biggest winners in the stock market have humble beginnings. They start off as small stocks that either many people don't know about, or simply write off as too risky. Then, these small, high-risk stocks &quot;grow up&quot;. They capitalize on secular tailwinds, drive robust revenue growth and equally robust margin expansion, and end up turning into huge companies with massive reach and enormous valuations.Source: Shutterstock With that in mind, I'd like to introduce investors to freshly public Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA). Jumia is Africa's e-commerce juggernaut. It hit public markets in mid-April at an IPO price of $14.50. Investors jumped on the stock. Less than two weeks after its IPO, Jumia stock is above $37, up more than 150% from its IPO price.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Clearly, some investors think this stock is a big winner.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Africa's Digital EconomyIt very well could be huge. Jumia is at the heart of the currently underdeveloped yet potentially enormous African digital economy. The expansion of this underdeveloped digital economy will be one of the market's most robust growth narratives over the next decade, much as the expansion of Asia's formerly underdeveloped digital economy was one of the market's most robust growth narratives over the past decade.The Asian digital economy expansion birthed several very, very large companies, such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD (NASDAQ:JD). Africa's digital economy expansion should produce the same, implying a bright future for Jumia, which is presently the most-relevant player in continent's digital economy, yet has a market cap of under $3 billion.In other words, Jumia stock is a high-risk, high-reward play on the expansion of Africa's digital economy. Because there are a plethora of execution and valuation risks here, Jumia stock is not for the faint of heart. But, for investors who have the stomach for volatility and risk, Jumia stock is an attractive pick, especially considering that in an &quot;everything goes right scenario&quot;, this is a multi-bagger in the making. The Africa Opportunity Is HugeIn the big picture, Jumia stock projects as a potential long term winner because of its robust exposure to the potentially huge African digital economy. Nigeria and South Africa are the largest economies in Africa with a combined GDP of around $750 billion, according to the IMF.The story here is pretty simple. Africa is the last great frontier of the tech revolution. Internet penetration rates measure around 36% throughout the continent, versus upward of 50% internet penetration everywhere else on Earth, including nearly 90% in North America. That 36% number won't stay low forever. It's only a matter of time before Africa catches up. That's the way technology revolutions works. You have the leaders (North America) and the laggards (Africa), and now it's time for the laggard to catch up.Over the next decade, Africa's internet penetration rate is going to surge higher, and that is going to spark enormous expansion in Africa's digital economy. The drivers here? Urbanization (only 43% of Africans live in urban centers, versus 80%-plus in North America), middle class expansion (Africa's middle class is projected to go from 355 million in 2010 to 1.1 billion by 2060), and favorable demographics (the average age in Africa is under 20, versus a global average age north of 30).Broadly, then, the continent of Africa is going to rapidly urbanize and digitize over the next several years. As it does, all aspects of Africa's digital economy will boom, from e-commerce, to digital advertising, to cloud services, so on and so forth. Because of this, its digital economy is a market that long term investors should start seeking exposure to now. Jumia Is The Leader In AfricaWhen it comes to exposure to Africa's digital economy, the best option at the present moment is Jumia stock.Jumia is the most relevant player in Africa's digital economy today. The heart of Jumia is an e-commerce platform called Marketplace. Jumia Marketplace, which operates in 14 countries throughout Africa, has 81,000 active sellers, 4 million active buyers, and reported nearly $1 billion in gross merchandise value in 2018. Those are big numbers for the still-nascent African e-commerce market, which in combination with the Middle East, only had around 70 million e-commerce shoppers in 2018, of which probably 50 million were from Africa, giving Jumia roughly 8% shopper market share.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains Over time, Africa's 50 million e-commerce shopper number will grow by leaps and bounds. The continent has 1.3 billion people, and is rapidly growing. The population could realistically measure closer to 2 billion within the next decade. In the U.S., roughly two-thirds of Americans are online shoppers. In China, the e-commerce penetration is nearing 50%, and rapidly expanding. Over time, Africa's e-commerce penetration rate should close in on 50%, too. Assuming this happens roughly a decade down the road when Africa's population is 2 billion, then that implies 1 billion e-commerce shoppers.If Jumia nabs roughly 10% of the shoppers, that implies 100 million buyers on Jumia's platform. That is a potential 25-fold increase over the next decade.In other words, the long-term upside potential in JMIA stock is enormous. At present, it's hard to quantify. But, in an &quot;everything goes right&quot; scenario, this company could nab 100 million shoppers at scale. In that scenario, Jumia stock is worth significantly more than $3 billion. Bottom Line on JMIA StockJumia stock is a largely undiscovered, hyper-growth e-commerce stock with multi-bagger potential, yet a plethora of execution, valuation, and visibility risks. Consequently, this is a high-risk, high-reward play on the African digital economy. JMIA stock isn't for the faint of heart, but it could pay off big in the long run.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JMIA, BABA, and JD.

2019-04-29,"One of the main attractions of NIO (NYSE:NIO) is that it is generally considered the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China. Yet this may rapidly be turning into a major negative trait for NIO.Source: Shutterstock Of course, Tesla stock has been in a tailspin, as its sales have plunged, and TSLA will likely have to raise more capital. There are also ongoing concerns about the leadership of Elon Musk.As for NIO stock, it has been on a similar bearish trajectory, although its decline has been more intense than that of Tesla stock. Since February, NIO stock has tumbled from $10 to $4.80. Consider that NIO is now below its Sept. 2018 IPO price, which was $6.26. NIO stock has struggled despite the fact that Chinese stocks, including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). have done particularly well latelyInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 U.S. Shale Oil Stocks to Buy as Prices Rise One of the reasons for the poor performance of NIO stock was its awful fourth-quarter earnings report, which came out in early March. NIO reported a loss of $509.5 million or 49 cents per share. Analysts' consensus estimate was 32 cents per share.The company's outlook was also disappointing, as its deliveries are expected to be light in the first half of this year. Partially explaining NIO's struggles, the Chinese economy has been sluggish and the Lunar New Year holiday adversely impacted its business. Additionally, the Chinese government has slashed subsidies for electric vehicles (some of the cuts were as much as 75%).This policy, though, does make sense. The Chinese government wants a more streamlined regulatory structure as well as a level playing field, which should encourage more innovation. The changes may also be connected to reforms related to the eagerly awaited U.S.-China trade deal. The Outlook of NIO Stock Isn't All BadFor the most part, strong, non-cyclical, positive drivers continue to be present in China. Keep in mind that the number of middle-class people in China is expected to hit 780 million within six years.Adoption of EVs has also been brisk in China, and that trend should continue over the long-term. China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and sales of EVs jumped 62% in 2018. The government wants EVs to be about 20% of China's total car sales by 2025.Yet perhaps the biggest catalyst for Nio stock is its ES6 crossover SUV, which is expected to hit the market in a month or so. Th ES6 is a five-seater that can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 4.7 seconds, and its range is 510 kilometers. So far, it looks like pre-orders of the vehicle are robust. The Bottom Line on NIO StockIn the near-term, NIO stock could easily rally. The fact is that investors' sentiment towards NIO is downright terrible. But the launch of the ES6 should spark interest in NIO and spur growth in the second half of the year.But given the extreme volatility of NIO, it is probably best to not hold onto NIO stock for long. After all, the company will likely need to carry out another capital raise.In other words, I'd look at NIO stock as a name to trade, but I wouldn't buy it as a long-term investment.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

Fast forward to today and the market's worries over trade concerns all but disappeared. IQ stock has grown 40% in the meantime.Source: Shutterstock Investors have many China-based companies to pick from, including Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU). What are some of the reasons to consider iQIYI as an investment opportunity? Strong Fourth Quarter for IQ StockiQIYI is still nearly a month away from reporting results, scheduled for May 23 after market close. But in the fourth quarter, the company reported a solid 72% year-over-year subscriber growth. It now has 87.4 million subscribers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 Within that, the membership business is driving much of the 76% revenue growth in the period. The company improved user stickiness and driving subscriber conversions by adding premium content.iQIYI added a number of popular theatrical movies to its platform. That also helped play an important role in driving subscription growth. Added by its joint membership program with JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), annual subscriptions came in steadily during the fourth quarter. Growth in AdvertisingiQIYI reported advertising revenue growing 9% year-on-year. By enhancing its advertising platform, the company sold vertical and interactive ads. This includes its first portrait mode short-form drama series, Ugh! Life!.Investors should expect the company creating more original content. This, in turn, will draw more advertisers. Over 50% of iQIYI's ad revenue was for original and licensed content.The company has two main categories of self-produced content. Variety shows are used mainly for advertising monetization. Drama series is geared towards driving membership. Here, the company does not emphasize the advertising business.Although the revenue stream can vary from quarter to quarter, revenue levels depend on the content. So long as the company releases one or two hit quality shows in the period, expect ad revenue growth in the double digits. Investing OpportunityiQIYI clearly demonstrated strong fourth-quarter results that suggest the upcoming quarter will please investors. While subscription grew, advertising improved and revenue was solid. But investors should notice that the company also burned through plenty of cash. In December 2018, the company sold convertible senior notes worth $750 million. This will diversify the company's financing options and investments.For the upcoming first quarter, iQIYI expects total revenue to be in the range of RMB6.8 billion to RMB7.1 billion. This represents an increase of 40% - 46% year-over-year. Cash Flow RisksiQIYI's cash flow growth could improve. Total cash flow is hurt by total content costs. As the company increases its percentage of original content, cash flow worsens because iQIYI needs to pay for all of the content. The medium to long-term benefit of this content purchase is that it could attract and retain more advertisers. Valuation and Target Price on IQ StockiQIYI has a manageable debt/equity of 0.47 times. The company is not expected to raise significant debt in the near-term. At a price/book of 6 times, the stock is inexpensive compared to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) at 21 times. Conversely, its P/B is above that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) the firm that owns YouTube.On Wall Street, only two analysts cover IQ stock and have an average price target of $24. According to Tipranks, though, the stock did not get any ranking updates in nearly a month. The lack of coverage could explain the stock peaking at close to $30 in February and drifting down to the $23 range recently. Your TakeawayThe downtrend in IQ stock could end at any time. Valuations are not favorable even after the dip but the stock's strong subscription growth cannot be ignored.Original content purchases are paying off and attracting plenty of advertisers. Investors can be assured that revenue will continue to grow in the solid high double-digits.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

These obstacles are comparable to those the U.S. faced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in which spurts of growth often alternated with economic depressions. However, despite its past and future struggles, JD.com stock will rise in the long run, making any temporary setbacks it faces good buying opportunities.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now  Internal, External Challenges Weigh on JD StockJD stock faces significant near-term challenges Though the equity has rallied in recent months, it trades about 40% below the January 2018 highs that it reached before the trade war with the U.S. began. China's  looming debt crisis could weigh on JD in the coming months and years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsControversy also continues to surround JD founder and CEO Richard Liu. Prosecutors in Minnesota declined to file criminal rape charges against him, but Liu faces a civil suit related to the incident. As InvestorPlace's  Tom Taulli mentioned, Liu also made derogatory comments about his employees, and a number of key executives have departed the company.The company's business model has also been controversial. Like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD invests heavily in vertical integration. The company's spending on infrastructure for purchasing, storage, transportation, and delivery of merchandise has weighed on its profits. Many point to Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) higher profit margins and consider it the better stock. JD Stock Is Not as Expensive as It AppearsHowever, I do see not believe that the forward price-earnings ratio of JD stock, which stands at 32.7 ,is expensive. Alibaba built its retail empire with an approach more like that of  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) than AMZN. BABA typically serves as a middleman, never owning the merchandise.Still, despite JD's high costs, its model has produced massive profit growth. Analysts predict that trend will continue, as they, on average, forecast a 65.7% earnings increase this year and a 58.6% surge in fiscal 2020. JD's infrastructure investments may lead to lower profit margins in the short-term. Still, I think these investments will serve it well in the long run.Moreover, JD remains focused on international expansion. It has already entered Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Furthermore, thanks to a partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), it will enter the U.S. market. The company has also added offices and warehouses in Europe.Like Amazon, JD is planning to open physical stores in its home market. It hopes to open 1 million convenience stores in China over the next five years. JD also intends to launch supermarkets and home-appliance stores in coming years. Concluding Thoughts on JD StockThe rise of JD will mirror the economic gains of Asia., so every significant pullback of JD stock creates a buying opportunity. The company's fortunes declined over the last year, due to the U.S.-China trade war and Liu's troubles. China's debt problems could weigh on JD stock going forward.However, the company will build on its massive growth by continuing to invest in  its infrastructure and add physical stores. JD's expansion into Southeast Asia, the U.S., and Europe will provide it with more growth opportunities.Not all of Amazon's ventures have succeeded. Similarly, I do not expect all of JD's moves to bolster JD.com stock. Macro economic competition and challenges could also disrupt its growth. Still, given JD's opportunity to expand its successful business model both at home and abroad, JD stock could become a quintessential &quot;buy on a pullback&quot; equity for years to come.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-06,"JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), one of the largest Chinese online retailers, has rewarded its shareholders extremely well so far in 2019. Year-to-date, JD stock is up over 34%.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrDespite the overall strength of JD this year, I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy it at this point. When JD.com reports its earnings on May 10, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Furthermore, yesterday President Trump tweeted that he was prepared to impose further tariffs on China, causing the markets to tumble today. Although I would not bet against JD stock, I expect JD to undergo volatility and possibly weakness this month. Here is why I believe that:  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio  JD Is a Growth Stock in a Dynamic E-Commerce MarketJD stock and many of the other Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges enable investors to benefit from growing Chinese consumer spending.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnline shopping represents about 35% of China's total $5.5 trillion retail market,and JD.com has a 25% share of the online retail market. Inevitably, a great deal of competition has arisen in such a large market. JD's main competitor is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), whose  Tmall and Taobao platforms are China's largest online business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer marketplace, respectively.In the past few years, new players have entered the internet commerce marketplace in China. One example is Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), a Groupon-style (NASDAQ:GRPN) retailer, which had its IPO in 2018. In addition to its online e-commerce operations, JD.com also has hundreds of warehouses and thousands of delivery stations as well as fresh food stores across China.JD's impressive growth has attracted the attention of U.S. tech giants, too. In June 2018, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announced that it would invest $550 million in JD.com. Both companies stated that they would collaborate on various e-commerce and technology projects. Under the deal, Google received 27,106,948 shares of JD stock at a price that equated to  $40.58 per American depository share. Although the cooperation between the two companies is likely to benefit both of them in the years to come, so far JD.com stock hasn't reflected any benefits from the collaboration.Although the Chinese economy may slow further in 2019 or 2020, China's GDP is still expanding at an average annual rate of at least 6%. In other words, China's growing middle class will continue to drive increases in the country's consumer spending and the expansion of China's e-commerce market. And when Chinese citizens have more money in their pockets, they can spend more money on online shopping sites like JD.com.However, since JD stock is a growth name, it trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. The markets are likely to continue to be choppy in May, especially since many other tech heavyweights and Chinese ADR's are expected to release their quarterly reports this month.The volatility of JD stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should be cautious about buying JD in coming weeks. JD.com Stock and Earnings Season JittersOn Feb. 28,  JD.com reported strong Q4 results, as its quarterly revenue increased by 22% year-over-year to $19.6 billion. Meanwhile, JD's active customer base reached 305.3 million in 2018. The stock has so far responded well to the earnings report.On May 10, in addition to the headline numbers, such as earnings and adjusted revenues, the owners of JD stock will pay particular attention to several other  issues.Recently, a U.S. college student sued Richard Liu, the founder and CEO of JD.com, over allegations that he raped her. Liu controls 80% of the voting rights of JD stock. Many analysts fear that these legal woes highlight important corporate governance issues at the company. Therefore, analysts are likely, when JD reports its results,  to try to determine  if the company is being adversely affected by Liu's personal legal issues.JD stock is momentum-driven, so it usually experiences big price swings after reporting its earnings. In other words, JD.com stock can easily gap up if its results are better than expected.  Alternatively, if investors are disappointed by the numbers or by upcoming legal challenges, JD can easily tumble.Options markets are pricing in an approximate post-earnings move of 7%-9% in either direction by JD.com stock. If the earnings report is well-received, my next price target for JD.com stock in the coming weeks would be between $31 and $34.On the other hand, if the Street is disappointed by JD's results,  JD could easily drop towards $25.Unless JD's earnings and 2019 guidance are exceptional, many investors may decide to wait for a pullback of JD stock before hitting the &quot;buy&quot; button. So Should You Buy JD Stock in May?I think JD.com is still one of the best stocks China has to offer, and it could easily fit in a diversified portfolio. Within two years, I expect JD stock to easily rise to the lower $40's which is the price that Google paid for the shares in 2018.However, in coming weeks, I think the JD.com stock price will be volatile.As a result of the recent impressive rise of JD stock, its short-term technical indicators have become somewhat overextended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that JD.com stock has become &quot;overbought.&quot; So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking in JD.com stock.After the company's earnings results, I would not fight the tape, and I would be willing to re-evaluate the technical outlook of JD stock in the coming days.If you already own JD stock, you might want to hold onto your shares. However,  you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5%-7% below the current price point.After the upcoming earnings call, if the price of JD drops, and you still believe in the bull case for JD.com stock, then you might consider waiting for a better time to buy, such as when the share price is around $25.As of this writing, the author did not own shares in any of the companies mentioned.

2019-05-07,"LONDON/BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - Nestle plans to launch a new line of baby formula in China this year under an existing brand, targeted at smaller cities, as the world's largest packaged food company tries to lengthen its lead in the world's biggest baby milk market.  The new line, discussed exclusively with Reuters, will focus on smaller provincial cities, often in China's western provinces, where greater shipping distances and lower incomes can make some imported brand goods unaffordable, though wealth there is growing.  Producers of many consumer staples such as soft drinks and soap had to seek growth in the less-profitable provincial cities years ago, as China's richer eastern markets matured.","Nestle, rivals vie for big baby formula prize in China's smaller cities"
2019-05-07,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips JD com NASDAQ JD stock is having a good year After JD stock surged 31 so far this year markets appear to believe that the online retailer of premium goods will report strong first quarter results,JD.com Stock Can Rally After JD’s Q1 Results
2019-05-07,"JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) stock is having a good year . After JD stock surged 31% so far this year, markets appear to believe that the online retailer of premium goods will report strong first-quarter results.And after JD built an incredibly resilient logistics network in China, the company's solid moat is sure to keep JD.com's profit margins fairly high, providing JD stock with a positive catalyst. Solid MoatSource:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrJD.com has a solid moat, thanks to its logistics network that lets the company make 90% of its deliveries in China within 24 hours. The retailer's addressable market is not limited to China alone. It is capable of shipping 85% of its goods abroad within a day. Its delivery speed is helped by the company's partnerships with Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOG) Google.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes In March, JD.com said it would use Google's e-commerce platform to sell 500 of its products. The move comes after Google invested $500 million in  JD last year. If the partnership gains traction, expect the collaboration to expand,  enabling JD.com's revenues to climb even higher. Momentum From 2018The proportion of Chinese internet surfers who have used JD jumped from 15% to 18.4% between 2017 and 2018. The company's net revenue grew 40% year-over-year in 2018 to $56 billion. By comparison, the revenue of online retailing giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) jumped 33% to $106 billion during that time. But JD stock has a market cap  of $44 billion, compared to the $942 billion market cap of AMZN stock. Although Amazon.com's EPS will grow five times faster than that of JD.com, the latter has more revenue growth potential.JD.com's revenue grew quickly partly because the sales of its general merchandise categories jumped more than 42% YoY. JD was successful last year because the company offered a more diversified, higher quality product selection than its competitors, along with great customer service. Higher ProfitabilityIn Q4, the profit margins of JD Mall and JD Logistics rose, lifting JD's gross margin in Q4 to 14.2%, up from 13% during the same period a year earlier year. For the full year, JD's gross margin topped 14.1%. If the company's investments in JD Mall, which lowered its Q4 profits,  pay off, the company's gross margins likely rebounded in Q1. JD is slated to report its Q1 results on May 10.JD increased its research and development spending  by 70% year-over-year in Q4, and 80% in 2018. JD has a good track record of making its investments pay off. Consequently, the company's recent addition of R&D staff, its investments in technology infrastructure, and its implementation of its AI-driven digital strategy are all likely to drive  its revenue higher. The Potential of JD StockManagement said on its Q4 conference call that JD's GMV and revenue would increase going forward, due to a favorable product mix and its investments paying off. And since its product mix will continue to be favorable, investors may be more willing to buy and hold JD stock.Meanwhile, JD.com's Logistics unit is still in the early phases of development. To attract major customers, it has been offering discounts. Now that the unit's customer base is firmly in place, JD's removal of those discounts will drive its gross margins higher, providing JD stock with an additional positive catalyst The Valuation of JD StockJust how much can JD.com stock rise? The 11 analysts who have a price target on JD.com stock think it's worth an average of $32.10, per share,  according to Tipranks.  That's less than 20% above the current level of JD stock Financial models that assume revenue growth in the range of 15%-25% over the next five years produce similar price targets for JD stock. The Bottom Line on JDChances are good that JD will once again issue strong Q1 results, and the company might even raise its 2019 guidance.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

To that end, Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) just completed a pretty good inning in its never-ending battle with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), boosting the outlook of BABA stock in the process.Source: Shutterstock Although BABA stock hasn't performed like a winner over the course of the past few days -- thanks to concerns that the  trade war with China may never end -- the dip of Alibaba stock may ultimately prove to be a fantastic buying opportunity.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites That's because BABA has finally forced Amazon out of China, leaving behind JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) as its only serious rival.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon Bows OutAMZN was never a serious contender in China.Though Amazon.com launched its e-commerce business in China in 2004 via its acquisition of Joyo and rebranded that venture as Amazon China in 2011, its best recorded market share was only a bit over 15%. Now, the Wall Street Journal reports, Amazon only controls 6% of China's e-commerce market, though research firms have put the figure closer to 1%.China is probably the biggest reason that Amazon's international arm is still bleeding money, and in April Amazon announced it would be shutting down its China operations. AMZN will still sell goods to China's consumers, but, to buy products from Amazon, they must shop on platforms intended for other countries and regions.The long-term owners of BABA stock who've paid close attention to the rivalry aren't apt to be surprised. While it looked early on as if Amazon had a shot at turning China into a key profit center, the company's business never synced well with the way China's consumers shop or with the way its domestic suppliers operate.Shoppers are able to order items directly from vendors through Alibaba's Tmall, often enjoying free shipping and one-day delivery of goods at prices lower than Amazon offered.Culturally, Chinese consumers may have also tacitly been aiming to support the local entity rather than its American competitor. BABA Is Opening More DoorsAlibaba is already positioned to capitalize on the vacuum that Amazon.com is about to create, boosting the outlook BABA stock in the process.In November of last year, BABA said it would look to import $200 billion worth of foreign goods and sell them to China's shoppers over the next five years. CEO Daniel Zhang commented &quot;We hope through globalization to use China's consumer market to bring the whole world's goods to China… especially some small and medium sized enterprises, they need to open their market in China.&quot;It will probably be easier  for China's consumers to buy products from a local middleman than an overseas one.In the meantime, Alibaba is positioning itself as a reliable partner that's capable of growth, while Amazon is being forced to retreat. For the first time ever, BABA's AliExpress will allow non-Chinese manufacturers to use its sales platform to sell goods to the more than 150 countries in which AliExpress operates.AliExpress is only being opened up to small and medium-sized businesses in Russia, Turkey, Italy and Spain. But, it's a start, taking shape at a time when small and medium-sized businesses are seemingly being discouraged from using Amazon's online-shopping platform. This alternative to Amazon.com has to have gotten the attention of smaller businesses whose only current option is Amazon. The Bottom Line on BABA StockAmazon's abandonment of its domestic China business is not necessarily a game-changer for BABA stock, and it will take awhile for Amazon's absence to meaningfully boost Alibaba and BABA stock.Nevertheless, the competitive shift absolutely bolsters the already-bullish outlook of BABA stock.More than anything, however, investors may be underestimating the depth of Amazon's trouble in China, which sets the stage for an expansion by BABA.AMZN's ability to use its websites based in other countries to sell products to Chinese consumers  will probably be limited. iResearch analyst Choi Chun explains that, &quot;cross-border e-commerce in China is not as consolidated as regular domestic e-commerce, (since) online shoppers go to different platforms for different overseas merchandises.&quot;  He concluded that,  &quot;I don't rule out the possibility that Amazon's cross-border business will follow the same path of Amazon's China domestic e-commerce business.&quot;In this case, anything that's bad for Amazon.com has to be good for BABA, BABA stock, and the owners of Alibaba stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-16,"We haven't even hit the halfway point of this year, and iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) is already exhibiting rollercoaster-like behavior. In the first two months of 2019, the IQ stock price gained over 78%, turning embattled stakeholders ecstatic. However, the mood quickly soared shortly thereafter. Right now, shares are up 48% -- a great haul, but no 78%.Source: Shutterstock Even worse, iQiyi stock has shown no sign of returning to its former glory. Part of that volatility has a very clear-cut explanation: after a noticeable thaw in U.S.-China relations, President Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese-made goods. In turn, the world's second-largest economy promised to retaliate. Not only did iQiyi fall, but so too did compatriots Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and many others.But in the case of the IQ stock price, the value drop presents a confusing look for investors. On one hand, Chinese companies look like names to avoid at this immediate juncture. On the flipside, contrarians may view this as an opportunity to grab a viable growth firm on the cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips I can appreciate the temptation. As the Chinese population grew in both size and wealth, Hollywood, along with every other industry saw dollar signs. And it's no understatement that Chinese moviegoers and content consumers have kept the lights on at many studios.That fact alone bodes well for iQiyi stock. As a content producer for the world's largest market, IQ stock should veritably moon.Still, IQ stock languishes. Outside of speculative trading, I'd stay away from this company. Here's why: Narrow Focus Hurts IQ StockTheoretically, iQiyi stock has a bulletproof-business plan: sell Chinese entertainment to Chinese people. In reality, the situation is much more complex. You only need to look at the technical charts to realize this.But why, with a billion-plus audience base, is the IQ stock price failing? This is a simple, but underappreciated risk factor: audiences are incredibly fickle and difficult to predict.Let's look at The Great Wall, a somewhat-controversial film that represented a joint effort between U.S. and Chinese movie studios. As you may know, the entire film centered on China and Chinese folklore. It also featured a heavy dosing of Chinese actors. The one rub was that Matt Damon starred in the film rather than a Chinese actor. Eventually, the movie would go on to bomb at home and abroad.Meanwhile, another U.S.-China co-production, The Meg, featured similar problems: an Asian-led research facility needs help, and the &quot;white savior&quot; archetype provides it, while also getting the (Asian) girl. The film featured almost all the tired, unoriginal stereotypes about Asians.It was a massive box-office success both here and in China.This strange dynamic tells me a lot about Chinese audiences, and by logical deduction, iQiyi stock.The Chinese want entertainment, and Hollywood knows how to deliver, not just in China, but in the rest of the world. Thus, I find iQiyi's near-exclusive focus on China as a liability, not an asset. Financial Metrics Say Everything about iQiyi Stock, UnfortunatelyQuarter-to-quarter, IQ stock's revenue growth is no longer impressive. More worryingly, the company's net-income losses have widened significantly over the same span. If they want to right the ship, they must produce content that appeals universally.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Ultimately, I think the mistake that investors are making with iQiyi stock is assuming the &quot;China factor&quot; has clout. It does, but it's not the main dish. You still must produce compelling content, compelling enough for viewers to open their wallets. That's not happening, which is why I'm avoiding this name.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AMC.

2019-05-16,"The trade war is back, and that's bad news for Chinese stocks. In late 2018, Chinese stocks and broader financial markets dropped as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated. But, in 2019, those tensions cooled off, and the tone from top trade officials from both countries was largely and consistently positive. In response, China stocks rebounded alongside a broad financial market recovery.Trade talks, however, took a sharp turn for the worse in early May. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that China &quot;broke the deal&quot;, subsequently raised tariffs on imported Chinese goods from 10% to 25%, and proceeded to have a trade meeting with China that didn't produce a deal. China has retaliated with its own set of tariffs. A full-blown trade war is now on the horizon.Chinese stocks have dropped big in response.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut, many market observers are unaware of one critical element about this latest round of tariffs: they have a grace period. This means that while tariffs have been raised from 10% to 25%, that raise will not impact goods that are already in transit. Importantly, the first tariff raise to 10% did not have this grace period. Thus, the grace period broadly implies that the U.S. is hoping to strike a trade deal with China over the new few weeks, before the 25% tariff actually starts impacting products.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week In that light, investors shouldn't expect these elevated trade tensions to persist. They should cool, and when they do, China stocks should pop. That's broadly why I'm positioning for a trade resolution in the near future, and am buying China stocks on recent weakness. JD.com (JD)Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrPerhaps the best Chinese stock to buy on recent trade-related weakness is China e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).Context is important here. JD stock was really beaten up in 2018 amid slowing growth and compressing margin concerns, both of which were happening against the backdrop of a slowing China economy. But, in 2019, JD stock has rallied in a big way as growth has stabilized in the 20%-plus range and margins have improved, against the backdrop of a Chinese economy that is picking up steam again.Now, JD stock is back to sell-off mode. Specifically, the stock is down more than 10% over the past month, despite reporting a robust double-beat quarter during that stretch which broadly confirmed that growth remains resilient and margins continue to improve.In other words, JD stock is selling off in a big way right now because of what could be, not what is. But, what could be might not come to be, if a trade deal is struck within the next few weeks. If that happens, all these concerns will fade away. Investors will re-focus on the numbers, which have been really good in 2019. As they do, JD stock will rebound in a big way. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Shutterstock Shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) have dropped 13% in the past week amid escalating trade tensions. This marks the stock's biggest drop of 2019, as well as the stock's biggest correction since the December 2018 plunge across global financial markets.But, the core growth narrative at Alibaba remains healthy. Revenue growth rates remain north of 40%, supported by continued expansion of the Asian digital economy, robust e-commerce growth, and a secular cloud services pivot. Also, trends have improved in 2019 amid renewed consumer confidence throughout China. These new tariffs won't impact consumer confidence so quickly. Instead, if a deal is indeed struck within the next few weeks, this new round of tariffs will never strike consumer confidence. Thus, Alibaba's numbers will look like nothing even happened.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio But, something did happen: BABA stock dropped nearly 15%. As such, a trade deal could spark a big reversal in BABA stock, and once again push this stock back toward all-time highs. Baidu (BIDU)Source: Simone.Brunozzi Via FlickrMore so than Alibaba, shares of Chinese digital search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) have been killed recently amid rising trade tensions, dropping nearly 20% over the course of the past month.The reason for the more pronounced sell-off is that the core fundamentals here aren't quite as good. Specifically, Baidu has been hit with a double headwind of slowing growth and falling margins over the past several quarters, and investors aren't sure exactly when these trends will reverse course. If trade tensions continue to rise for the foreseeable future, then these headwinds won't reverse course anytime soon. BIDU stock will continue to drop.But, if trade tensions cool and a deal is signed soon, then everything changes for BIDU stock. China's economy will continue to improve. The digital ad market will continue to expand. As it does, Baidu's growth rates should stabilize. Margins, too. Growth and margin stabilization on a stock that is 50% off its all-time highs should produce big returns. As such, BIDU stock could fly high on a potential trade deal. Weibo (WB)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to Chinese social blogging site Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), you have a hyper-growth company that has remained on a hyper-growth trajectory. But, WB stock has been killed on slowing macro China concerns. Thus, if those concerns hang around, the stock will continue to suffer. But, if those concerns disappear with a trade deal, then WB stock will soar.Broadly speaking, Weibo is China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). But, Wiebo has more users than Twitter, is more profitable than Twitter, and is growing more quickly than Twitter. Despite all that, Weibo has a market cap about half that of Twitter. Why? ARPU rates. Weibo monetizes its users less than Twitter. This is just a time issue. Over time, as Weibo pivots from growing its user base to growing its digital ad business, ARPU rates will rise. When they do, WB stock should rise significantly.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market The one thing holding WB stock back has been a temporary pause in the China digital ad growth narrative, which is the result of less enthusiastic enterprise spend amid slowing economic conditions. But, those conditions have improved in 2019, and will improve meaningfully if a trade deal is struck. Thus, if a trade deal is struck, Weibo's numbers should improve over the next several quarters. That improvement will spark a big rally in WB stock. Tencent (TCEHY)Source: Shutterstock China internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has fared better than its China tech peers during this recent round of tariff increases. As of this writing, TCEHY stock is less than 10% off its 2019 highs, while many of its peers are 10% to 20% off their 2019 highs.The relative strength in TCEHY stock can be attributed to the stock's favorable fundamentals. Tencent is the heartbeat of China's internet economy, from social media to digital payments to music streaming, and everything in between. A big piece of this economy is video games. In 2018, due to various regulatory issues, China put a freeze on new video game approvals. That really hurt Tencent's business. In 2019, that freeze has been lifted, and new video games are hitting the market for the first time in years.That's a big deal for TCEHY stock, and this positive development is mostly why the stock has fared better amid escalating trade tensions in early May. It's also why this stock could be a big winner if these trade tensions ease. If they ease, Tencent's two biggest headwinds of 2018 (trade tensions and a video game freeze) will be fully behind it. With those headwinds fully behind it, TCEHY stock, which is still 25% off its all-time highs, could soar. Ctrip (CTRP)Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrNatural losers in a slowing economy are companies associated with travel. After all, travel is most often seen as a luxury. Consumers travel when they are employed, confident and have extra cash. They don't travel when they are unemployed, lack confidence and don't have extra cash. That's why Chinese online travel site Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP) fell off a cliff in 2018 as China's economy slowed.It's also why CTRP stock has bounced back in a big way in 2019 as China's economy has stabilized and even improved. But, the rally has been hit hard over the past few weeks amid rising trade tensions. During that stretch, CTRP stock has dropped over 15%. The stock will continue to drop so long as these trade tensions hang around. That's just the nature of CTRP stock and its relation to China's economic trends.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far But, as is the case with JD, recent weakness in Ctrip is the result of fears surrounding what could be, not what is. The current conditions are very favorable for Ctrip. China's economy is improving, consumer confidence is back, and the company just reported a robust double-beat quarter with 20%-plus revenue growth and healthy margins. If a trade deal is struck, and these current favorable trends persist, then CTRP stock will bounce back in a big way from this recent selloff.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD, BABA, BIDU, WB, TWTR and CTRP.

2019-05-20,"This company is not without risks. Still, following earnings JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is sporting attractive fundamentals. The case for bullish investors looks compelling. Let me explain.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrIt hasn't been easy to be a JD stock investor. Shares topped out more than 16 months ago. And despite 2019's rally, JD is still more than 40% removed from those all-time-highs.But the winds of change are upon shares right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJD's most recent quarterly confessional delivered strong evidence that the multifaceted tech giant is making the right moves. China's other answer to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) easily beat Street top and bottom-line forecasts just over a week ago. But it's not just the headline beat which has our attention.First-quarter sales saw solid growth of 21%, which while slowing, is stabilizing, with management forecasting revenues for Q2 to grow by 19% to 23% annually. That's nice. And there's more. JD stock is also capturing higher gross margins with help from the company's expanding services business. That division grew by 50% and producing positive free cash flow courtesy of improved operating cash flow and project divestments.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Lastly, JD stock's strategic partnership with tech giant Tencent has also been renewed. That's good news too. In conjunction with JD's Walmart (NYSE:WMT) collaboration, the trio are taking on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), China's other but much larger e-commerce and cloud play. JD Stock Weekly ChartOf course, trade war risks remain for JD stock. And as we can see on the price chart below, an extended neckline and 38% Fibonacci level combine to form an area of challenging resistance. But there are reasons to be optimistic.First, with the head and shoulders pattern having completed in a successful triple bottom, today's &quot;return move&quot; test of the neckline in JD shares holds much less weight as potential resistance as the dominant pattern is bullish.Also of interest, unlike shares of BABA -- which saw investors taking profits following earnings -- JD stock found a bid. Not only that, shares remain above pre-earnings prices despite last week's trade war escalation and lower prices in the broader market for the five-day period.Finally, with last week's price action in JD stock resulting in upside confirmation for the decision-based doji candlestick, there's additional evidence JD's relative weakness on the price chart is turning the corner towards a period of outperformance.My recommendation if you want to go long JD stock is to use an improvised signal to buy shares and provide protection against unwanted downside risk. The suggestion is to wait for JD.com to rally back above the doji high of $30.47 before purchasing shares.The buy trigger remains in effect only if the low of the doji holds. Even though the triple bottom looks important, I'd be hesitant to be long JD stock, as there's a lot of downside risk between the doji if it fails to hold and December's key pattern low.Should shares produce a signal to purchase JD stock, I'd set an initial stop below the doji candle's closing price $28.17. The $2.30 exposure is the equivalent of 7.5% JD stock risk. In our view, along with taking initial profits at the 50% retracement level near $35, this looks like sufficient wiggle room off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-22,"The bottom is falling out for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Baidu stock fell by almost one-quarter on Friday and Monday. Excluding a very brief dip in 2015, BIDU stock now sits at its lowest level in almost six years.Source: Shutterstock The near-term catalyst has been BIDU's disappointing first-quarter report issued on Thursday afternoon. But there's more weighing on BIDU stock than just a single earnings report. As I wrote earlier this year, there have been significant concerns about the health of its business for a long time.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors Its Q1 results and, perhaps more importantly, its Q2 guidance, suggest those concerns are quite realistic. And so I wouldn't recommend that investors try and time the bottom of BIDU stock just yet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Baidu's EarningsOn the surface, Baidu's earnings look modestly disappointing,  but they don't seem bad enough to drive such a steep fall. Adjusted earnings per share of 41 cents did miss analysts' consensus estimate by $0.16. But its revenue growth in Chinese yuan rose 15%, in-line with the consensus outlook,  and its sales actually grew 21%, excluding the divestiture of a number of its businesses last year.The earnings miss sounds disappointing, but the overall numbers don't seem terribly out of line. The company's revenue is still growing. BIDU had warned that its profits would drop in the first half of the year, partly due to higher spending on its search business.But looking more closely, two factors drove Baidu's top-line growth. The first was its ownership of iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), the so-called Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of China. Baidu still owns roughly two-thirds of iQiyi, so IQ's results and its growth are reflected in Baidu's consolidated numbers.But Baidu's online marketing revenue, the key part of its wholly-owned business,  increased just 3%. And Baidu spent an enormous sum on marketing in the quarter. SG&A, which includes marketing expenses, rose a stunning 93% year-over-year. Some of that increase was due to BIDU's efforts to support iQiyi's growth. But the operating income of Baidu's core operations plunged a stunning 67% year-over-year.Outside of iQiyi, then, Baidu essentially bought, at an expensive price, what little revenue growth it could muster. And Q2 isn't going to be much better. Baidu guided for consolidated revenue to rise just 1% to 6% excluding divestitures, representing a significant slowdown. The Baidu Stock Price PlungeSo the reaction to the earnings report does make some sense. Baidu's stake in IQ accounts for roughly 20% of its market cap; IQ shares have fallen on BIDU's results. BIDU's legacy business seems to have a significant top-line growth problem. And its increased spending is causing its profits to not only decline, but to decline sharply. BIDU stock simply has a very different fundamental profile after its earnings than it did previously.Beyond the numbers, the results confirm the fears that have dogged Baidu stock for some time. Its desktop search business is being displaced by greater use of apps, which bypass browsers and Baidu altogether. (That is also a concern for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), to which Baidu is often compared, though Alphabet has done a better job of holding onto its business.) Baidu has added some self-inflicted wounds, including a scandal surrounding medical search results back in 2016 and complaints about its news results earlier this year.BIDU managed to come out the other side of the 2016 scandal. But its Q2 guidance, in particular, suggests a deceleration of growth to levels not seen since 2016-2017. That, in turn, implies that Baidu's brand in China has taken another hit from which it may not be as easy to recover.Outside of search, Baidu hasn't proven it can win. Its income from equity investments (which does not include iQiyi) declined 57% in Q1. Its efforts in artificial intelligence and the cloud don't appear to be moving the needle much. If Search starts to fade, it's not clear that BIDU will have an answer. Baidu Stock Doesn't Look Cheap EnoughBaidu stock looks awfully cheap on the surface. The company closed Q1 with over $18 billion in cash, excluding the funds held by iQiyi. Its stake in IQ is worth close to $10 billion. Combined, those assets support over half of the current market capitalization of BIDU stock.Based on those assets and analysts' 2019 consensus EPS estimate,  it appears that Baidu stock is trading at a single-digit multiple to the profits of its core business. But it's worth noting that those EPS estimates are going to come down, and potentially sharply, in the wake of the Q1 results. BIDU stock may look cheap, but there's a wealth of evidence at the moment which suggests that it should be cheap.Meanwhile, the trade war still hangs over all Chinese stocks. But Baidu stock has badly lagged even its peers recentl. Big Chinese names like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) all posted solid earnings reports last week, and their shares have risen so far this year. What happens to BIDU stock if and when investors' views on China deteriorate?The response by Baidu stock over the last two sessions is not an overreaction, or a panic, or a case of investors not paying attention. There have been real concerns about BIDU stock for some time now, and those concerns seem supported by both its Q1 results and its Q2 guidance. So it's not surprising that Baidu stock has fallen so hard. And it wouldn't be a surprise if BIDU keeps falling.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-24,"What's interesting about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is that it has been a much better company than an investment. It's hard to argue that Alibaba hasn't lived up to expectations since its IPO nearly five years ago. Yet it hasn't done all that much for the BABA stock price.Source: Shutterstock Since its first-day close just under $94, Alibaba stock has risen about 69%. That's good performance, certainly, suggesting roughly a 12% annual appreciation. But over that stretch, BABA has actually underperformed large-capitalization tech stocks, as measured by the NASDAQ 100. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has returned 472%. The 179% return in Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is more than double the increase in BABA shares.Yet it's hard to argue that Alibaba as a business has been a disappointment. It's clearly, as many hoped five years ago, the dominant e-commerce player in China. Revenue for fiscal year 2019 (ending March) was more than seven-times higher than it was in fiscal 2014. Sales have grown an average of 48% over that period, including a 51% increase in FY19. Margins have compressed somewhat, but adjusted net income still has risen 230%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Alibaba has done its job, but it doesn't feel like it's been rewarded enough. The question is when, or if that will change. Recent trading suggests it might take quite a bit of time. Alibaba Stock Slumps After EarningsThe reaction to Alibaba earnings last week seems to highlight the problem for BABA. By any measure, Q4 earnings were close to spectacular. Both profits and revenue crushed analyst expectations. Dana Blankenhorn wrote that the report &quot;blast[ed] away the bears&quot;. Luce Emerson said the quarter was &quot;stellar.&quot;Those analyses all seem dead on. Yet the BABA stock price increased just 1.5% after the release. In the five sessions since, it's dropped over 10%. Shares are down 20% just since May 3rd.The obvious culprit is fear of a trade war and what it might do to the Chinese economy. But that's not the only explanation. Alibaba's chief e-commerce rival, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), has seen its shares drop just 11% since the third of this month, with a strong earnings report of its own. Even Tencent shares are down less than 17%.One might think given its scale, its massive user base -- 654 million customers last year -- and its clear dominance in e-commerce, Alibaba stock might have some insulation from those broader fears. Yet it's underperforming other publicly traded Chinese companies. The Long-Term Problem for BABA StockBut, again, this isn't a one-time issue. Alibaba simply hasn't been that impressive an equity over time. Basically, investors have had one good year. That was 2017, when the BABA stock price skyrocketed 96%. Shares are now below where they traded before the beginning of 2018.One issue may be that some investors simply see too many risks with Alibaba stock. Indeed, I'm one of them, as I've written in the past. The Chinese economy still looks worrisome and remains Communist-controlled. A steadily weakening yuan certainly hasn't helped BABA or other China plays of late. Alibaba's accounting is opaque, to say the least. The VIE structure means U.S. investors don't actually own shares of Alibaba, but a Cayman Islands-listed entity.Those risks may be short-sighted as some bulls argue. But they also mean that every time the market gets nervous, BABA stock is going to sell off. The trading action of the last week isn't anything new. Alibaba shares, 2017 aside, simply haven't been able to maintain a consistent rally. How to Play BABAWhat's interesting about the long-running problem is that bulls very well could -- and likely do -- see it as a good thing. Continual pressure on the share price might cause short-term frustration. However, it also presents repeated buying opportunities.After all, there's a case that Alibaba stock is going to rise eventually as long as it keeps performing. And is it really that impossible to believe that BABA could at some point pass the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and become the world's most valuable company? That's the uber-bull case for BABA: dominant share in the world's largest market means it could become the world's biggest company at some point.But even if Alibaba can get there, it's going to take some time, and quite a bit of patience. The risks here are real, and it's clear at this point that BABA stock is going to react to external factors as much as, if not more than its own performance. Put another way, if BABA stock can't gain after this type of earnings report, it's difficult to see what catalyst there might be.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-29,"JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock benefitted from a great first quarter. For the first three months of the year, JD stock rose by almost 55%. Now, trade-war concerns and slowing revenues have brought down JD in recent weeks.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrAs of this writing, the price stands at just over $26 per share, about 20% below its all-time high. Although JD should prosper long-term, the lingering trade war means JD will more than likely continue to fall in the near-term.From a long-term perspective, I like JD stock. Former GE (NYSE:GE) CEO Jack Welch made it a point to invest in either the largest or second-largest company in an industry. If he led GE today, he might have bought the stock. JD is China's second-largest retailer, lagging only Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement  A Closer Look at JD StockAlso, despite not having a cloud division like Alibaba or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD typically draws the &quot;Amazon of China&quot; distinction. Unlike Alibaba, JD has followed Amazon's lead in building a logistics infrastructure.Even better, as James Brumley argues, its move into Indonesia could bring JD leadership in a key emerging market of around 264 million people. Most analysts tend to focus on China and India. However, JD has set its sights on a high-growth market with a population almost as large as the U.S. With a gross domestic product per capita of nearly $3,900 per person, it closely mirrors China's per capita GDP in the early 2000s. When the business media finally decides to pay attention to the Indonesia story, JD will have already solidified its position there.Consequently, I also think investors should focus less on the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. The 26.4 multiple may seem high for a retailer. However, as with Amazon, massive infrastructure spending weighs on profits. Conversely, JD looks very cheap when compared with revenues. JD trades at a price-to-sales (PS) ratio of only 0.55. This compares with a multiple of almost 3.8 for Amazon and a 7.5 PS ratio for Alibaba. JD Stock and Short-Term ObstaclesDespite its long-term appeal this company has too many factors weighing it down to buy now.The fact that JD stock is a Chinese equity makes it much harder to trade. Chinese laws forbid U.S. investors from buying their stocks. As a result, traders must buy a Cayman Islands-based holding company claiming to represent JD.com stock.Killing the goose that lays the golden egg will not serve China well. Hence, for the most part, I do not worry about owning stock in the holding company instead of the firm itself. Still, in the face of tenuous U.S.-China relations, investors need to increase the risk premium that comes with this arrangement.Also weighing on the stock is the rape allegation surrounding founder Richard Liu. Though authorities released Mr. Liu from criminal liability, the 21-year-old victim has filed a civil suit against him. JD tends to move significantly based on news surrounding the case.The trade war has lingered longer than most analysts, including myself, have anticipated. Since JD partners with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to sell in the U.S. and other places, a trade war can have both direct and indirect adverse effects. As my colleague Josh Enomoto correctly states, without the U.S. middle class, there is no Chinese middle class. Consequently, I would avoid JD until the trade war shows apparent signs of ending. Final Thoughts on JD StockCurrent economic conditions make JD stock a long-term winner facing likely near-term struggles. JD's logistics investment in both China and Southeast Asia gives the company a competitive moat that few will likely match. Moreover, its investment in Indonesia will serve the company well once investors begin to recognize it as one of Asia's rising economic powers.However, in the end, China's prosperity depends on America's middle class. As a result, the stock has fallen as the trade war continues to slow the company's revenue growth rate. As long as this dispute continues, I do not see JD gaining much traction.Still, do not assume these conditions will remain in place forever. Eventually, both the U.S. and China will come to an agreement. At that point, I see little that will stop JD stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-05-31,"If there's been one constant for JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock since its 2014 IPO, it's been volatility. The chart of the JD stock price looks like a roller coaster and admittedly not a terribly pleasant one at that.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrJD.com stock has returned about 41% from its $19 IPO price. But that's only a 7% or so annual return over the five years - and JD.com has gained 6%, total, from its first-day close just shy of $25.To be sure, some traders have done better or worse. The round-trip in the JD.com stock price from below $20 in 2016, to $50 18 months later, and back below $20 late last year created opportunities for longs and shorts alike. External factors, most notably of late, on-again, off-again trade war worries, have driven much of the volatility, particularly over the last eight months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth That volatility is likely to continue, not just for JD but other Chinese plays. But in the case of JD, patience seems likely to pay off. At the same time outside noise seems to be getting louder, JD.com's performance is getting stronger. Once that noise dies down, the stock seems likely to rise. Another Strong Quarter Boosts JD.com StockFirst quarter earnings from JD.com certainly seem to strengthen the long-term case. Both sales and earnings per share crushed analyst estimates. Revenue rose a solid 21% - even if that figure admittedly was the company's lowest growth rate since going public. Operating margins in the core business - now referred to as JD Retail - expanded a solid 60 bps year-over-year.The quarter isn't perfect. As The Motley Fool pointed out, even JD.com CEO Richard Liu admitted on the post-earnings call that profit in the quarter was &quot;a little bit high.&quot; Slowing sales growth is a function in part of JD.com's increasing size, but the increase in revenue also was notably lighter than that of larger ecommerce rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).Still, the quarter seems like good news. Most notably, it seems to confirm the bullish thesis for JD.com stock that came out of a similarly strong fourth quarter report. As I wrote after that release, JD.com seemed to have clarified and strengthened its story after Q4. Worries about operating margin compression were explained by increased detail about investments in other areas, and the broader strategy seemed an echo of that of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), focusing on revenue growth above margins.Given how successful that strategy has been for Amazon, both in terms of its growth and its stock price, the path chosen by JD.com seemed similarly attractive. A second straight blowout quarter, meanwhile, confirms that the strategy is on track. External Factors and JD.comThe report seemingly has done little for JD shares. JD.com actually is down 10% in just the last month and threatens a three-month low as I write this. It trades below levels seen ahead of the release.The problem, again, is external. JD.com spent the second half of 2018 pretty much in freefall owing mostly to fears about the Chinese economy and the impacts of the U.S.-China trade standoff. The possibility of a U.S. hike to 25% tariffs resurrected those concerns.It's not just JD.com that is selling off, either. BABA shares are down over 20% in less than four weeks. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is at a multi-year low, albeit with some help from disappointing earnings. iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ), 58.com (NYSE:WUBA), and other Chinese plays all have pulled back as well.Relative to other Chinese stocks, in fact, JD.com stock actually has performed reasonably well. But the recent declines again show that it's impossible to separate JD.com from broader sentiment towards China.With no apparent momentum toward a trade war resolution, and another U.S. presidential election now less than 18 months away, it's likely sentiment toward the Chinese economy is going to stay rather volatile for the foreseeable future. JD Stock on the Other SideLong-term, the case for JD stock still looks attractive. But some investors may choose to either sit out near-term volatility - or look to profit from it. Put premiums for JD.com aren't particularly high at the moment, but selling the June 2020 25 strike still returns nearly 17% - while locking in a purchase price of $21.50 per share.Traders can also look to shorter-term strikes to either gain premium or capture a below-market price for JD if external fears drive another leg down in the stock.That said, investors shouldn't let those external fears overshadow the fact that JD.com, as a company, looks to be in an excellent position. As large as China's ecommerce industry is, and will be, second place likely is good enough.Efforts in brick-and-mortar retail and other investments haven't paid off yet - but some will over time. The combination of a lower share price and margin expansion has made valuation more reasonable: JD now trades at roughly 25x 2020 consensus EPS. That's likely too low given the company's opportunities.That multiple can get lower, however, particularly if broad market fears grow. And it's likely the road for JD stock going forward will be bumpy. I still believe investors willing to ride out the volatility will be handsomely rewarded in the end. But trading in JD over the last few weeks shows it will take some patience - and possibly some nerve.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-05,"Until mid-May, the shares of Chinese ecommerce powerhouse, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), had been in the bull mode. They went from $21 to $30. But lately, things have gotten wobbly with JD stock.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrNote that the return is about -13% from the highs. Yet in comparison to other large Chinese operators, the drop has not been as pronounced. For example, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is down by 23% and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is off a grueling 33%.Yes, when it comes to Chinese tech stocks, there is usually a good amount of volatility. After all, there is always the pervasive political risk, which has been heightened lately.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Might there be an opportunity with the sell-off in JD.com stock? Is it time to think of a purchase? Well, for the most part, I think there could more downside from current levels, and to see why let's take a look at the following: JD Stock: Drama and DistractionJD.com has really been weighed down by drama and distraction. All this is mainly due to the founder and CEO, Richard Liu. Last August, he was arrested in Minnesota for &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot; against a female student. While the charges were dropped, it was still a concerning episode for investors.Since then, Liu has been the center of more controversy. For example, he called some of his workers &quot;slackers.&quot; This was in response to the growing discontent in China about long work hours called &quot;996,&quot; which stands for a six-day work week that has a daily schedule from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.Such things come against the background of JD.com's decelerating growth ramp. During the latest quarter, the revenues increased by 21%, which was the lowest since the company came public. To put things into perspective, the revenues were up by 33% in Q1 of 2018.Even more worrisome is the sluggishness of annual active customers growth, coming to only 3% in Q1. A year ago, it was 28%. This is kind of perplexing, actually, since JD.com has a partnership with Tencent (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY), which operates WeChat, the largest social network in China. Shouldn't this be a source of much more growth in the customer count?I think so. If anything, this does look like a sign of a lack of discipline and execution from management. JD Stock: ValuationThe valuation is not cheap. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is 27X.This is at a premium to BABA, which is trading at 22X. And yes, the company is growing much quicker and has a more diversified platform such as with its cloud business and entertainment ventures. JD Stock: Trade and the Chinese EconomyThe escalating tensions between China and the U.S. is perhaps the biggest risk factor for JD.com. Keep in mind that the company has recently initiated layoffs of 8% of the workforce. True, there was probably a need for restructuring. But the move does point to challenges with growth in the business. In fact, the company has also been getting more aggressive with promotions and discounts.As for the trade situation, it is far from clear what the endgame will be as both sides have been digging in. With the rise of uncertainty, there could easily mean slower growth in China as businesses pull back on investments. This means there could be increased headline risk for JD Stock.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-06-06,"It's amazing the difference a month's time can make. In early May, headlines shouted that insiders believed a trade deal between the U.S. and China was imminent. Today, leaders from the two nations have ratcheted up their angry rhetoric. This of course places incredible pressure on Chinese flagship company Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and the underlying BABA stock.Source: Shutterstock Naturally, investment sentiment perfectly illustrates the ebb and flow within the political realm. The first three trading sessions last month started with relatively strong upside movements. But once angry social-media posts proliferated from the White House, the Alibaba stock price tanked. Since May 1, shares have dropped nearly 21% while the 403-stock iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) is down 12.4%; BABA stock is the exchange-traded fund's second-biggest holding.Those looking for a respite in Alibaba stock shouldn't hold their breath. Throughout the first round of the U.S.-China trade war, Beijing adopted a comparatively measured approach. They were content in letting, to paraphrase Confucius, a fool open his mouth and remove all doubts (about his foolishness).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault But now, the second-biggest economy in the world has apparently lost its patience. Just recently, Beijing launched an attack on the Trump administration, calling out American &quot;intimidation and coercion.&quot; Such nasty vitriol does nothing for the longer-term prospects of the BABA stock price.Yet Alibaba seems to have a workaround. Last year, the Chinese tech giant introduced its strategy to court high-level international brands to its home import market. A synergistic component of this strategy is to sell cloud services to international firms seeking a foothold in China.This vision had the potential to take Alibaba stock to the next phase of its growth cycle. But with the trade war showing no signs of abating, investors should dismiss this narrative. Alibaba's Cloud Turned into a Paper TigerAs comparatively new entrants on the elite global stage, a subtle desperation underlines virtually all major Chinese companies. The firms are both eager and anxious to prove to the western investing establishment that they belong.As such, companies like Alibaba, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have a vested interest in putting their best foot forward. Regarding Alibaba, they're proud about their global market share in the cloud, taking around 5%.But relative to the competition, that's a small tally. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the decisive leader at 35% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) comes in second at 15% share. With China levering a population size four times that of the U.S., Alibaba is doing less with more.Adding to deeper questions about BABA stock is the company's list of cloud customers. Yes, they have some big-time names like Ford Motor (NYSE:F). But that's only because Ford is desperate to break into the Chinese market. Without China, the car maker is toast. Thus, management figures going with a Chinese cloud platform is the most-effective means to secure Chinese customers.But most companies aren't clinging to life support the way Ford is. Those firms have no need for Alibaba's services because they can get better support from Amazon or Microsoft. Plus, if a major organization doesn't want those two platforms, they have better options, such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM).Finally, the trade war complicates Alibaba stock because it negatively impacts the underlying company's cloud ambitions. Contrary to common opinion, leading in the cloud involves more than just building a massive data center. Software and infrastructural compatibility between provider and client is critical.Worsening relations between the U.S. and China also cuts business and technological ties. This makes compatibility a possibly insurmountable challenge, hurting the case for BABA stock. BABA Stock has Few Options AvailableLove him or hate him, President Trump tells it like it is. Okay, maybe he tells it like he thinks it is. But when it comes to the issues leading up to this trade war, Trump dropped some truth bombs.An alarming CNBC poll revealed that 20% of corporations have had their intellectual property (IP) stolen by the Chinese. That's a major concern because IP represents the majority of the value of S&P 500 index companies.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth So while Americans are going back and forth about Trump's policies, the rest of the world sees things differently. They don't want to suffer the same consequences that U.S. blue chips have. Therefore, I anticipate reluctance in trusting Chinese services, which in turn hurts Alibaba stock.China must get over this key credibility problem. The Trump administration is making it difficult to do so, constantly peppering it with embarrassing exposes. A big reason why the Chinese are reacting angrily is because the insults and accusations feature a ring of truth.This geopolitical headwind places Alibaba in an awkward situation. As I stated previously, the company is China's flagship. But with the flag under duress, I'd be cautious on BABA stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Juxtaposed against the current backdrop of tariff wars, however, the strategy may become a negative catalyst for JD stock.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrRunning out of room to continue growing online, China's second-biggest online retailer is doubling down on the development of storefronts as part of an effort to meld digital and physical retailing. The move is taking shape at a time when China's consumer market may be close to crumbling, pushed past a point of no return by the trade conflict which seems to be a political standoff neither side wishes to back down from.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Even if the tariff battle comes to an amicable close, its damage may prove to be too much for JD stock to simply shrug off.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Back to Brick and MortarWhereas JD's rival, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), has built itself from the ground up as an online-selling middleman, JD has based a business  on empowering China's brick-and-mortar stores. JD Logistics and its supply chain tech cater to a largely underserved market of small shops peppered across the country.JD- despite all of its internet-tech capabilities -- has always had something of a soft spot for actual shops and shoppers. In 2017, its CEO, Liu Qiangdong, vowed to open 1 million convenience stores all across China by 2022, and in 2018 it opened a cashierless store in Jakarta, ripping a page from the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook.It doesn't appear either initiative is going to go as initially planned, but not because JD couldn't forge ahead. Rather, its brick-and-mortar retail strategy appears to have adapted.JD is now aiming to cultivate a network of 15,000 small stores (up from 5,000 as of the end of 2018) as a means of connecting with its customers. These units, which are best described as franchises, will serve as de facto showrooms; sales of home appliances seem to be the focal point of the strategy.Beyond that, JD is looking to develop stores with much bigger footprints, on the order of half a million square feet, in every major city in China. Though appliances will surely be part of that division's mix as well, it would be difficult to fill that much space with just appliances. The sheer scope of the planned stores implies they'll look more like traditional superstores, particularly given that JD is also acquiring a major stake in established appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance. Right Idea, Wrong Time?Though China's e-commerce spending is still growing,  its expansion has measurably slowed, and should continue to slow as saturation turns into a headwind.To that end, the move to an omnichannel strategy is the right one for JD.com stock, particularly when it touches China's more rural areas and its older consumers. More than 240 million of China's shoppers over the age of 60 live in the more rural western part of the country, and while they're not completely unfamiliar with the web, they're not necessarily internet or e-commerce savvy. Many still prefer to shop in person.No part of China, no matter how remote, however, is immune to the impact of a trade war that's gone on far longer than many expected it would.But the impact of the conflict is debatable. Retail spending in China during the first quarter was up a healthy 8%, defying the odds and the worriers.The problems caused by the conflict have become clear and frequent, though. In April, China's retail sales growth fell to a 16-year low of 7.2%, as the ripple effect of the trade war began reaching all facets of the nation's economy.April's industrial output also slowed rather dramatically. Meanwhile, the conflict has affected JD stock, as JD stock price is down 5% in the last month and 32% over the last 12 months. The Bottom Line on JD StockWhile China's urban areas accounted for 85% of last quarter's e-commerce growth, rural online spending grew 9.2% versus a more modest 8.2% rise in online shopping by China's urban residents.So there's money to be made in the rural areas, if a company can just find a way to connect with those consumers, and assuming the country's economy holds up in the midst of  the trade tensions.JD.com has undoubtedly mapped out a plan to make sure it's able to connect with rural consumers, potentially boosting its profits and JD.com stock  in the process.JD is taking another step to advance that goal. Specifically, it's planning a cost-effective delivery network. China's Civil Aviation Administration has already given JD permission to test delivery drones in the remote northwest Shaanxi province. JD ultimately hopes to develop 10,000 drone &quot;airports&quot; meant to serve hard-to-reach places.If, however, JD bets big on consumers at a time when China's consumerism hits a wall, JD stock price could take a big hit, since brick-and-mortar retailing appears to be the biggest part of its growth plan.It's a potential pitfall that's just too big for the owners of JD stock to ignore.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11,"Back in September, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) announced a joint venture in Russia called AliExpress Russia JV. It now is a done deal. The question is how it might affect Alibaba stock.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrSo let's take a look at the details: The company, along with the Russia sovereign wealth fund (RDIF), each agreed to invest $100 million and MegaFon (Russia's second largest mobile operator) will sell its 9.97% equity stake in Mail.RU to Alibaba for a 24.3% in the JV.Then Mail.ru will transfer its Pandao ecommerce business and $182 million for a 15% position. By doing this, the JV will have sufficient cash resources but also access to key technology assets and distribution, with access to about 77 million subscribers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Here's what the CEO of Alibaba, Daniel Zhang, said about the deal:&quot;This partnership will enable the AliExpress Russia JV to accelerate the development of the digital consumer economy of Russia and CIS countries in ways that no one party could accomplish alone. Together, we are uniquely positioned to offer consumers in Russia and neighbouring countries an innovative shopping experience by combining social platforms with commerce, as well as enabling regional brands and SMEs to sell their products locally and globally. Alibaba's mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. This JV is an important part of Alibaba's international expansion and step toward our goal of supporting 10 million small businesses reach profitability and serving 2 billion consumers around the world.&quot;It's true that Russia can be a risky market. Let's face it, the government has a history of periodic interventions, which have resulted in losses for foreign partners. Just look at the challenges that companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and BP (NYSE:BP) have had to deal with.But then again, China is a tough market to navigate as well. And for the most part, Alibaba has thrived.Interestingly enough, the U.S.-China tensions may push China toward different alliances, such as with Russia. This would certainly make it more amenable for arrangements like AliExpress Russia JV.Something else to consider: It will get tough for BABA to keep up the growth in its ecommerce segment in the years ahead. While China still has lots of upside, this will likely come from smaller cities, which could be more difficult to monetize. In other words, BABA has little choice but to look at global expansion, even in riskier countries. Bottom Line on Alibaba StockIn the meantime, Alibaba's business is running on all cylinders. For the fiscal year ended March 31, revenues soared by 51% to $56.2 billion and net cash flows came to a hefty $22.5 billion.Although, this should not be much of a surprise as the company has a dominant platform. Note that the retail marketplaces have 654 million annual active consumers and there are 721 Mobile MAUs (Monthly Active Users).But of course, Alibaba stock is more than just about ecommerce. The cloud business, for example, continues to see much traction. During the latest quarter, the revenues for this segment jumped by 76% to $1.15 billion. In fact, BABA is the clear leader in the Chinese market. And as seen with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the cloud business can produce juicy margins.Alibaba stock is also trading at an attractive valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 24X, which is at a steep discount to the growth rate. It is also cheaper on a relative basis to other Chinese ecommerce operators, like JD.com (NYSE:JD), that is trading at 28X and is growing at a slower pace.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-06-11,"What a difference six months can make. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock is down 30% in the past couple of years. But therein lies an opportunity to ride the upswing momentum now going into the summer.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrYes, JD stock has been sliding for a while, but lately the tide has been changing. Year-to-date, it's up 30%, which is double the performance of the S&P 500. Clearly, the bulls are setting a tradeable bottom. In early March, and after a strong earnings report, I wrote about the bullish opportunity in JD. The trade worked well for a while, then the geopolitical rhetoric soured all equities in a big way.We went from almost having an imminent trade deal between China and the U.S. back to being at square one. Stocks like JD are sensitive to the political rhetoric because, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it sits in the line of fire.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut there is good news to surmise from the price action. First is that the JD stock bulls are not dead. They succeeded in setting higher highs. Sure they failed after hitting prior two accident scenes at $30 and $32 per share but that is part of normal price action.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Once a stock revisits a ledge from which it fell hard, it finds sellers. So it's natural it works through those orders before it continues higher. But it is important that the bulls hold support levels so they don't have to reestablish their footing.In this case, JD.com stock held the $25.50 zone. This was important because it served as the neckline for the late February breakout. It is normal for a stock to revisit the neckline from which it last broke out to test its strength. Bulls now know that they can rely on it as solid footing.It is also important to note that this happened without any China deal hopium and in spite of the bad news. This lowers the JD risk that if the Trump / Xi meeting fails in a few weeks. It is still vulnerable because this is not a cheap stock.To that point, JD sells at an price-to-earnings ratio of 80. This is almost three times more expensive than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). This is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) P/E territory, but without the substance that AMZN brings. So JD stock has a lot of potential froth to shed should Wall Street have another tizzy. How to Approach JD StockThis is not the same as saying the stock is too expensive nor is it a judgement of its potential. I am merely pointing out the downside risk if the outside factors cause another selling equity wave. It would whirlwind JD into another test of support. If it fails this time, it could target $22 per share. I am in no way calling for this scenario as my base case, but I am pointing out the possibility.These are nervous and fickle markets on Wall Street. The so-called experts have very little conviction and they have one foot out the proverbial door. We are near all-time highs, so they will sell their positions first without asking questions.If you own JD stock for a fast trade, I'd suggest setting up your stops below $25.25 per share. But if you're in it for the long term, then I'd ignore these short-term gyrations for as long as the macroeconomic conditions are this good. We are fully employed and we have central banks committed to fuel the fires. They say to not fight the Fed, so I expect stocks to climb this wall of worry with sporadic dips.  * 7 Top-Rated Vanguard ETFs to Buy in 2019 It is crucial to note that this is not December. Last year ended in a Christmas crash because sentiment was horrendous. This time the Fed has flipped from a foe to friend and an ally to stocks. They will rescue Wall Street.The long-term viability of a competitor like JD.com has its critics. They compare it to AMZN so they wrongly assume that it's going to fail. Amazon proved that the world wants to transact online. That's why they gutted the brick and mortar retail industry. This trend is still in its infancy and there is no turning back. So there will be room for many competitors of all sizes that will thrive for decades to come.JD.com has a legitimate shot at being one of them and for as long as they deliver growth, investors should give them a pass on profitability.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

(NASDAQ: JD) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) are both compelling China-based stocks, Alibaba stock has more potential to reward investors.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10  Alibaba's $20 Billion of Extra LiquidityOn May 28, Reuters reported that Alibaba would raise $20 billion through a Hong Kong listing of Alibaba stock. The additional liquidity gives the e-commerce giant some insurance against risks associated with the U.S.-China trade war. If BABA delists Alibaba stock from the U.S. market, it will still have plenty of cash on its balance sheet, and BABA stock will still be publicly traded, albeit in Hong Kong.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsListing  Alibaba stock on the Asian exchange also prevents Americans' animus towards China from holding down the valuation of all BABA stock. In New York, Alibaba stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6, even though analysts,  on average, expect its earnings per share to jump  36% this year.Alibaba does not need the $20 billion from listing Alibaba stock in Hong Kong. At the end of last quarter, (BABA's fiscal fourth quarter) the company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $28.8 billion. To increase shareholder value, the company bought back 10.9 million shares of Alibaba stock for $1.6 billion. Looking ahead, Alibaba expects its top line in FY 2020 to come in at $28.9 billion (RMB 500 billion). Expect the company to use some of its cash to buy back more shares of Alibaba stock this year. Solid Q4 Earnings GrowthIn Q4, Alibaba's total revenue jumped 51% and its EPS came in at $1.20, outpacing analysts' consensus estimate by 33 cents. The company will become more  profitable as its innovative initiatives strengthen its digital media, entertainment, and cloud-computing businesses.Instead of buying Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock to gain exposure to the growth of Amazon's cloud business, investors can buy Alibaba stock, which has a much lower price-earnings multiple than AMZN stock. BABA's cloud-computing revenue surged 76% last quarter, and Alibaba is the leading cloud service provider in China and faces no real competition there. Conversely, Amazon.com's AWS may eventually face growing competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) cloud business, Azure.To convince investors that Alibaba's cloud business will eventually meaningfully raise its bottom line, the unit must first report positive EBITDA margins. Although the unit's EBITDA was negative 2% in Q4, that's  an improvement over the negative 8% it posted during the same period last year. Still, more customers are signing on to Alibaba Cloud, and the unit's operational costs will fall as its revenue rises Meanwhile, Alibaba generated $1.6 billion in non-GAAP free cash flow despite its investments in Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba Stock Is UndervaluedAlibaba stock should trade closer to its 52-week high of $211. Instead,BABA stock price is around $161. Investors are still discounting Alibaba stock instead of rewarding it for the continued growth of Alibaba's customer base. In Q4, its customer base surged 77% year-over-year. Markets are clearly nervous about the U.S.-China trade war. But BABA's China retail business will likely continue to grow, despite the ongoing macro headwinds.On June 11, China's local governments introduced  new stimulative infrastructure spending initiatives to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Chinese economy. BABA's China-based businesses should be relatively  resilient to the trade war, so  the stimulus should cause the company's revenue growth to accelerate in the next few quarters. Valuation and the Bottom Line on Alibaba StockThere's  little reason to doubt that BABA's revenue growth will be at least 20%. Based on a 5-year DCF Growth Exit model, Alibaba stock has a fair value of over $200 per share.BABA stock price bounced back from $150 to almost $161 in June. As investors speculate on the U.S.- China trade talks slated to take place at the next G20 meeting at the end of this month, expect the rebound of BABA stock price to continue.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any of the companies mentioned in his column.

2019-06-17,"Investors should exercise caution investing in companies that are both losing money and are listed in China. Such is the case with iQIYI(NASDAQ: IQ). Escalating trade wars between the U.S. and China scared investors away from China-based companies and that move has been costing iQIYI stock.Source: Shutterstock Even after JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) and Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) reported solid quarterly sales growth, the stock failed to return to yearly highs. So, with iQIYI reporting first-quarter revenue growth of 43% but a loss of around $270 million, what is there to like about this company?iQIYI's subscriber base grew an impressive 58% to 96.8 million, up from 61.3 million last year. Revenue grew 43% but net losses doubled to around $270 million. The company effectively strengthened its platform with user growth and attracted new users, increasing overall user stickiness in the quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Both DAU on the mobile app and time spent grew in the double digits, demonstrating effective marketing campaigns and premium content resonating with users. The Legend of Haolan, The Golden Eyes and The Legend are examples of premium, high-quality original drama driving subscriber growth.iQIYI's secondquarter revenue guidance of 6.91 billion - 7.29 billion yuan (USD $998 million - $1.05 billion), up 12-18% Y/Y is disappointing investors with a short-term time horizon. Revenue growth lags with the subscriber additions. If the time spent per user increases, expect iQIYI reporting higher revenue later this year.Still, the company reported ad revenue remaining largely flat compared to last year. It is maintaining a cautious outlook, factoring the macroeconomic weakness in China that is driven by the ongoing trade disputes. Opportunity in iQIYI StockiQIYI's self-produced content, premium content, and ad solution should keep a positive business momentum despite the macro headwinds ahead. Viewership should grow, driven by advertising initiatives to attract new subscribers. IQIYI is building multiple business engines to diversify.Its gaming business performed well in the first quarter while its content unit will incorporate more Chinese cultural values. The richer its content library gets, the wider an audience iQIYI will attract.IQIYI is exploring the prospects of 5G with China Unicom. It launched an 8K VR visual experience center in March. Its &quot;Qisubo&quot; service integrates CDN technology with 5G Mobile Edge Computing and ensures high frame rates for videos having lots of interactivity. As Qisubo matures, its service may be used in hotels, high-speed trains, airports, universities, and anywhere high-quality video content is displayed. Headwinds for iQIYI StockWith all the strong growth prospects ahead, investors cannot ignore the growing expenses and quarterly loss. SG&A expenses rose 62% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher marketing spend and increased share-based compensation. R&D costs, which rose 54%, is expected for a technology firm that must invest to stay ahead.Falling content costs could offset the other expense increases. Policy changes and regulatory censorship may have contributed to its 20% sequential drop in content costs in Q1. Looking ahead, the company expects steady content costs for the second and third quarter.Subscriber growth outpaced competitors but could slow if its peers counter iQIYI's successful initiatives. Still, strong original content and variety shows like Idol Producer resonate well with viewers.Revenue from advertising could continue lagging as the trade war remains unresolved. On the flip side, a resolution between the U.S. and China would lead to a strong rally in IQ stock. Investors will anticipate a rebound in ad revenue as trade levels rebound and the economy in China strengthens. Valuation and Your Takeaway on iQIYI StockIQ stock is getting close to its IPO price of 2018. Analysts are cautious of the stock's upside, predicting a gain of just 9%. In a five-year DCF revenue exit model, iQIYI needs revenue growing 25% annually to justify a fair value of $20.50. But after the stock fell almost 30% in the last quarter, the selling momentum needs to subside before the stock has any chance of drawing buyers again.Ideally, the U.S. and China resolve their trade dispute differences. If they do not, the stock will underperform. And since fundamentals are strong for the long-term, investors willing to hold the stock for more than a year should consider iQIYI at these levels.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-18,"Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NYSE:JD) have been in bounceback mode in early 2019 for one very simple reason: the narrative surrounding JD stock has changed dramatically -- for the better -- over the past several months.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrSpecifically, over the past several years, the narrative surrounding JD stock has been one defined by rapidly decelerating revenue growth and profit-margin erosion, which led to concerns surrounding the company's long-term profit growth potential. As those concerns grew, JD stock dropped. From $50 in early 2018, to $20 by late 2018.But that slowing growth, compressing-margin narrative has changed course over the past several months. JD's revenue growth rates have started to stabilize in the 20% range. Profit margins have begun to expand meaningfully. Management expects both of those trends to persist for the foreseeable future. Thus, clarity and optimism have been injected into this company's long-term profit outlook. That dynamic has ultimately propelled JD stock 30% higher in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJD stock will stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future. This new narrative implies that JD has big long-term profit growth potential. That big long-term profit growth potential still isn't fully priced into shares. Hence, JD stock has runway to head even higher over the next several months.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today How much higher? The fundamentals say JD stock has runway to levels north of $30. Consequently, I'm staying bullish on this stock until it crosses above $30. The Narrative Has Changed for the BetterWhen it comes to JD, the big-picture narrative is pretty straightforward.You basically have the Chinese version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which operates a giant e-commerce business in China's rapidly expanding and urbanizing consumer economy. Much like Amazon, JD operates that e-commerce business at slim profit margins, but the long-term plan is to win market share and then leverage scale to meaningfully expand profit margins. Also, much like Amazon, JD has jumped into multiple tangential growth verticals -- like logistics -- and while those businesses operate at poor margins today, they too will eventually scale into much more profitable operations.Because the long-term plan follows the Amazon roadmap and does pave the path for huge profit growth at scale, JD stock soared in early 2018 to $50.But that long-term plan was called into question throughout 2018, as the company's growth rates decelerated and margins failed to expand with scale. Specifically, from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018, revenue growth dropped from ~40% to ~20%. Meanwhile, operating margins were sliced in half from 0.8% to 0.4%. As investors questioned the long-term profit trajectory, they sold the stock, and shares of JD fell all the way to $20.In early 2019, though, the narrative has changed course. It once again supports huge profit growth at scale. Revenue growth has stabilized over the past two quarters around 20%, and projects to stay at 20% next quarter too. Meanwhile, operating margins expanded 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018, and 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2019.Thus, the Amazon roadmap of sustained big revenue growth on top of margin expansion is once again the underlying trend at JD. This underlying trend ultimately supports JD stock shooting above $30 soon. JD Stock Has Good Upside PotentialThe numbers supporting JD stock look pretty good at the moment.You have a 20%-plus revenue growth company with growth that projects to stabilize around the 20% mark for the foreseeable future. At the same time, you have operating margins that are hugely depressed, hugging the flatline, making huge upward progress in early 2019, and which project to keep heading higher over the next several years. Thus, for the foreseeable future, JD projects as a big revenue-grower on top of big margin expansion, which should drive doubly big profit growth.That's why analysts see EPS essentially doubling this year, rising by 50% next year, and rising another 35% the following year. Net net, analysts think this is a 45% annualized profit-grower over the next several years. JD stock trades at less than 40 times forward earnings.A 40 forward multiple for 45% profit growth is an attractive combo. If you model that out, EPS should get to around $2.20 by fiscal 2023, from $0.34 in fiscal 2018. High quality retailers, like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), tend to trade around 20 times forward earnings. Based on that 20 multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2022 price target for JD stock is $44. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of roughly $33.Thus, this rally in JD stock has fundamentally supported runway to above $30 in 2019. Bottom Line on JD StockThe narrative surrounding JD stock has completely changed over the past two quarters. This new narrative -- defined by stable revenue growth and big margin expansion -- once again supports robust profit growth at scale.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold This robust profit growth is not fully priced into JD stock, yet, and the stock has fundamentally supported runway to levels above $30 in 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD, AMZN, and WMT.

2019-06-19,"In May, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) reported what appeared to be blowout earnings. The report topped expectations by a mile, but  it did nothing for Alibaba stock. BABA stock price barely advanced following the earnings release, and it is still down 9% over the last three months.Source: Shutterstock What's going on? Surely, some of the struggles of  Alibaba stock  are related to the trade war. The longer it drags on, the more the Chinese economy will continue to slump. But Alibaba faces some unique issues of its own, namely that people are increasingly questioning the company's accounting. BABA is now trying to sell more stock to the public, while its short interest has ballooned to 9% of its available shares.  That's a massive number for a company of its size.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half The shorts have been encouraged by the internet posts of a person who claims to be a financial professional  These  posts, made under the name Deep Throat IPO,  contain allegations about Alibaba's accounting, leading many investors to conclude that BABA can't be trusted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Alibaba Actually Earning Much Money?For last  quarter, Alibaba reported a huge jump in its net income. In fact, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, Alibaba crushed analysts' average expectation. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $1.28 against the consensus outlook of just 95 cents. Meanwhile, its GAAP EPS of $1.47 absolutely annihilated analyst estimates of just 51 cents per share.What explains the huge disparity? Most of Alibaba's reported profits for the quarter came from marking up the value of its investments rather than from its operating businesses. For the quarter, its reported net income soared 252% year-over-year  to $3.5 billion. However, its actual profits from its operating business went down 5% to just $1.3 billion, though it would have posted a modest gain if it hadn't had to pay a lawsuit settlement.Still, its worth asking what's going on. Alibaba reports phenomenal revenue growth rates, yet its core retail profits are essentially flat. And its much-touted cloud and digital media divisions continue to lose money. Take out the increased  profits from its investments - which doesn't mean much unless BABA can turn that paper into actual cash in the future - and BABA stock is absurdly expensive compared to its actual cash earnings. Is Alibaba Really Bigger Than Wal-Mart And Amazon?There's long been a great deal of dispute over whether Alibaba and other Chinese retailers inflate their GMVs (Gross Merchandise Volume). The SEC probed Alibaba's sales reporting a few years ago, and investors have  made allegations about other Chinese firms like PinDuoDuo (NASDAQ:PDD) inflating their revenue.In the case of Alibaba, the numbers get more and more questionable  as time goes on. Alibaba claims its GMV has soared more than tenfold from 2012  to today, with that figure jumping from $80 billion then to more than $800 billion now. For comparison sake, that's more than Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) handle annually combined! You might say that Alibaba's business could be that big because China is so huge. Remember, though, that Walmart is a leading retailer in 25 countries and Amazon has a huge overseas businesses as well. It strains credibility to believe that Alibaba is larger than Walmart and Amazon put together.There's also the matter of how much each company generates per employee. That  is a common check for fraud, and Alibaba comes out looking rather peculiar. Deep Throat IPO puts it well:The other ratio I find fascinating is GMV per employee.  Walmart's GMV per employee is $284,000.  Amazon's is $428,000.  Alibaba's is $8,366,000 per employee.  They are truly masters at doing more with less.Is it realistic for Alibaba's employees to be 20 times more efficient than Amazon's? If you own BABA stock, you better hope so. Is Ant Financial Worth Anything Close To Investors' Expectations?Supposedly, Alibaba's Ant Financial, a digital payments facilitator, is worth $150 billion, which would make up around a third of the  overall $400 billion market cap of Alibaba stock. In fact, Ant Financial  was valued at $150 billion when it raised money last year. However, there is reason to be skeptical about that valuation. Specifically, it scrapped plans for an IPO last year, and it was supposed to launch an IPO this year, but the offering appears to be delayed again.Meanwhile, Ant Financial, which is supposed to be such a dominant global payments player, doesn't appear to be doing so well. Last year, Alibaba, which has a profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial, did not receive any distributions from Ant because Ant didn't make any  profits. This past quarter, however, Alibaba earned $77 million from Ant Financial.  $77 million seems like a pittance, given Ant Financial's supposed $150 billion valuation.  Perfectly normal. What Happens If the Chinese Financial System Freezes Up?For all of Alibaba's purported profits, the company keeps needing more money. There's probably good reason for that, since most of its &quot;profits&quot; don;t come in the form of cash while it is investing money in a nearly endless list of start-ups both in China and overseas. As mentioned above, Ant Financial did a big fundraising push last year, and now Alibaba is trying to unload a cool $20 billion of its stock in a secondary offering in Hong Kong.All this brings up the trade war and the weakening yuan. The yuan is near seven per dollar,  its lowest level in years, and pressure appears to be growing for a major devaluation of the currency. What happens to Alibaba's ability to raise more money to keep its investing carousel spinning if China's capital markets freeze up? Also, the valuations of all these nascent businesses Alibaba has invested in will implode if the IPO window shuts down for these sorts of firms. The Verdict on BABA StockIt's been interesting watching Alibaba and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) over the past year or two. As the Chinese economy has slowed, many of China's retailers have seen their growth rates sharply drop. JD, for example, has gone from 50% annual growth to just 20% recently. Alibaba's growth rate, however, appears totally unaffected by the deepening Chinese malaise. It keeps pumping out 50% annual revenue growth, rain or shine. Does Alibaba have a special sauce that keeps it immune to economic weakness?So far, BABA stock has been a winner. But how long can it keep up? Alibaba already claims to be larger than Amazon and Walmart put together. If the numbers are real, surely BABA will run out of people to sell to fairly soon; there are, after all, limits to a company's growth once it dominates a market. And if the numbers aren't real…At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JD.com stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-06-19,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) reportedly is getting a Hong Kong listing. Multiple reports suggest the company is planning to sell $20 billion worth of Alibaba stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. A key question, with the BABA stock price down about 18% from early May highs, is &quot;Why now?&quot;.Source: Shutterstock As with so much when it comes to Alibaba stock, bulls and bears likely will answer the question very differently. Bulls see the company raising capital for its myriad initiatives -- and potentially raising the profile of BABA stock. Bears wonder why the company needs the cash and why it needs to do such a deal now.BABA has long been a battleground stock. The Hong Kong listing likely will only harden both sides.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Case for the Alibaba Stock OfferingThere are two broad benefits to the cross-listing. One, Alibaba's plan to list on the Hong Kong exchange could -- and maybe should -- drive the BABA stock price higher.Hong Kong-listed shares can be owned directly by Chinese investors. Those investors might see Alibaba more favorably than their foreign counterparts. And if Alibaba stock rises on the Hong Kong exchange, its New York listing might do the same, as arbitrageurs buy cheaper New York-listed shares.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today That said, those arbitrageurs also would sell the Hong Kong-listed shares, potentially mitigating some of the effects of increased demand. And the two shares would not be the same: BABA stock does not offer direct ownership of the company. Rather, 'shareholders' own a stake in a VIE (variable interest entity) in the Cayman Islands.That VIE has a contractual right to Alibaba profits -- but that's not the same thing as actually owning shares of Alibaba itself. As such, it would seem almost certain that Alibaba shares in New York will trade at a consistent, if modest, discount to the Hong Kong-listed shares to account for the VIE-related risk.Still, details aside, a second listing could increase demand for Alibaba stock, particularly among China's retail investors. Smaller investors control 35% of the Chinese market, against an 8% share in the U.S. And the pending Alibaba stock split likely allows those Chinese retail investors to afford smaller positions. There is a case that BABA stock should get a bump from the two listings.The second goal, apparently, is to raise capital. Alibaba's New York IPO was the largest in history, raising $25 billion. Alibaba reportedly will bring in another $20 billion this time around. Those funds can be used for more acquisitions; building out the cloud business; or further investing behind the business.That in turn would seem to signal a longer-term rise in Alibaba stock, assuming the funds are invested well. The Case Against the OfferingSo BABA bulls no doubt see the new listing as good news. Indeed, the BABA stock price has risen modestly of late, though a stronger broad market likely plays a role as well.But for Alibaba skeptics, the offering seems curious. That's particularly true for investors who question the company's accounting, The first question is why, exactly, Alibaba needs another $20 billion. The company closed fiscal 2019 (ending March 31) with $28.3 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Alibaba owns another $24 billion or so in investment securities (not including its investments in private companies). That $44 billion war chest sits against total debt of less than $9 billion.To be sure, Alibaba does have places to spend its cash. The company's operations beyond core commerce last year -- cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and its &quot;innovation initiatives&quot; -- all posted losses last year as Alibaba invested in future growth. In cloud, Alibaba is trying to replicate the success of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is spending heavily on its supply chain.But operating losses for those segments totaled a little over $5 billion. Even with those losses, free cash flow was somewhere in the range of $15 billion, even including payments for copyrights and other intangible assets.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 For those who doubt Alibaba, the offering (which reportedly will be of new shares) makes little sense. Alibaba, if its financials are accurate, has more than enough cash to fund even aggressive investments in its new initiatives. Unless there's a big acquisition planned, Alibaba is diluting its shareholders for money it doesn't seem to need. Is the BABA Stock Price Too Low?Alibaba stock is down 23% from July 2018 highs. Yet it will likely price those shares at a discount to the current U.S.-listed price (as is usually the case with these offerings). That in turn means Alibaba shareholders will see their ownership diluted at a price well below their view of the stock's intrinsic value. (Presumably, all Alibaba shareholders, outside of passive managers, believe the stock is undervalued at the moment.)It's possible the dilution will be worth it. Perhaps Alibaba has a big deal in mind. It needs to compete against JD.com and Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and, perhaps, the more cash the better. A wider reach for the stock -- and direct ownership, as opposed to the U.S.-based VIE structure -- can help as well.But the capital raise only adds to the doubts surrounding BABA stock as well. And while short interest here is likely somewhat overstated (there are no doubt arbitrage traders who are long Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA) and short BABA), short sellers likely will see the offering as confirming their thesis, not disproving it.In short, the beauty of the listing, like Alibaba stock, is in the eye of the beholder. Bulls see more shareholders, more cash, and a higher BABA stock price. Bears see another questionable move … and maybe even another red flag. Time will tell which side has it right.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-19,"For most of the past year, investor concerns surrounding JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have mainly been about CEO Richard Liu, who was arrested in early September on suspicion of rape. JD stock fell 6% on the first day of trading following the news, further extending a drop that had begun in early June 2018.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrLiu was in Minneapolis for a residency as part of a doctorate program in business administration for &quot;top-level executives&quot; working full-time in China.While journalists wrote breathlessly about the shares plunging after Liu's arrest, the real question -- for investors -- is why JD stock began falling about a year ago in the first place and where it may go from here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips JD.com is InfrastructureLike Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA), JD.com stock is a play on Chinese e-commerce infrastructure. But unlike Alibaba, which focuses on clouds and retailing, JD.Com focuses on distribution.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 JD.com is able to deliver orders profitably to remote villages, and is a leader in automated delivery in cities.  The company delivers about 150,000 orders daily from 500 distribution bases and it has robots delivering fresh goods by land and air. While U.S. companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) struggle to get orders delivered in 24 hours, JD.com is getting some packages to their end point in 30 minutes.JD.com has a market cap of $33 billion and expects quarterly revenue of $21.85 billion, with profits of 5 cents a share, when it next announces earnings August 9.  During the March quarter, when it was expected to earn 12 cents per share, it surprised investors with earnings of 74 cents. The delivery infrastructure has value in its own right, and there have been reports it might list the unit separately. China Growth ConcernsJD.com had revenue of $18.6 billion in 2014. That more than tripled, to nearly $70 billion, by 2018.My InvestorPlace colleague James Brumley wrote recently that investors are worried about JD tripling the number of its rural storefronts in China to 15,000.Serving 60-something moms and dads in rural villages is unique but selling refrigerators to their kids in Shanghai is harder. Despite having stores as big as 500,000 square feet, that's where I place my worries because then JD.com is competing directly with Alibaba. Unique NichesUnique niches are hard to come by, but JD.com keeps finding them. One of the more interesting is online sales of luxury goods, where it has a tie-up with Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), a global seller of luxury brands that went public last September.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Farfetch China acquired Toplife, JD's luxury portal,  in 2017.  JD.com bought a $397 million stake in Farfetch  and Liu sits on the Farfetch board. Farfetch opened a China portal on JD.com earlier this month, giving JD stock a much-needed boost.Which leads to the other bearish call on JD.com: the slowing growth of China itself. The trade wars have Morningstar cutting its growth estimates for the world's second-biggest economy in half, to 3.25%.  That's still higher than U.S. growth. Bottom Line on JD.com StockThe trade war has made Chinese stocks volatile, especially in the tech sector. But JD.com stock is now selling at a Walmart (NASDAQ:WMT) price, when its $70 billion in sales are matched with its $33 billion valuation. (Walmart is worth $311 billion on $515 billion in sales.)JD.com's growth means it hasn't yet made a profit for a full year, but if it hits the mark in August, and continues to make money through 2019, while growing that unique infrastructure, it's got to be worth money  to a speculative investor.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-20,"It's been almost a year since JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) CEO and founder Richard Liu was arrested on suspicion of rape. Since then, JD stock has lost about 10% of its value. Of course, it could have been much worse. Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLiu was not convicted , and even though the university student who made the allegations is suing JD.com's CEO for undisclosed damages, investors seem to have forgiven the e-commerce company. JD stock is up 35% year-to-date through June 18, recovering most of the losses from the fall and early winter. One thing that has cropped up in recent months that could affect JD.com though is the departure of several key executives. In May, Lan Ye, a key driver of the company's growth, stepped down. In June, chief technology officer Zhang Chen, who was responsible for the company's unmanned logistics operations among other projects, left the company. Also going is general counsel Lu Yong.   * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Not only are top-level executives leaving, but so, too, are mid-level managers, a sign that Liu's management style might be rubbing employees the wrong way. Should JD stock investors be worried about the exodus? You betcha, but for other reasons. Talent Takes FlightIt's easy to point to JD.com's chief executive as the reason for the culture problem at the company. However, a more significant concern might be that the real reason people are leaving is that JD.com is losing the e-commerce battle to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) and all the other smaller e-commerce companies that do battle in China. &quot;Talented workers are starting to quit because they are worried about the outlook for the company,&quot; the Nikkei Asian Review reported, quoting an anonymous employee. My InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn recently discussed the growth issues facing JD.com. &quot;Serving 60-something moms and dads in rural villages is unique but selling refrigerators to their kids in Shanghai is harder,&quot; he wrote on June 19. &quot;Despite having stores as big as 500,000 square feet, that's where I place my worries because then JD.com is competing directly with Alibaba.&quot;Dana believes that a profitable JD.com is a stock worth considering given it trades at the same price-to-sales ratio as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest retailer in the world. Profits are always good. In the first quarter ended March 31, JD.com generated $190.7 million in free cash flow, which is 1.1% of revenue in the quarter. By comparison, Alibaba generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter ended March 31, representing 11.5% of its revenue. JD.com might be profitable in 2019, but it's got a long way to go to meet Alibaba's cash flow generation.  There's No ProblemJust before CEO Liu's arrest in late August, I was still on the JD.com bandwagon. I didn't think it was in Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) league, but I believed it had a good business. &quot;I don't think JD shareholders need to worry about the company's business. Overall, it's very strong. Unless it delivers a dud of a quarterly report, the mid $30s appear to be an artificial floor,&quot; I wrote August 6. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if JD stock was trading over $50 by this time next summer.&quot;By Labor Day, Liu had been arrested, resulting JD stock down to the high teens by the end of the year. It has since recovered most of those losses. After the Liu revelations, guilty or not guilty, I recommended that investors stay away until the truth came out. Although that's still a matter for the civil courts, the CEO hasn't been charged with a crime. End of, as the Brits say.  * Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less Another InvestorPlace colleague, Luke Lango, who owns JD stock, recently suggested that JD.com's Amazon-like growth strategy was back on track. &quot;Revenue growth has stabilized over the past two quarters around 20%, and projects to stay at 20% next quarter too. Meanwhile, operating margins expanded 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018, and 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2019,&quot; Luke wrote June 17. &quot;Thus, the Amazon roadmap of sustained big revenue growth on top of margin expansion is once again the underlying trend at JD.&quot;If you read between the lines, the fact that employees are leaving JD.com has less to do with its business outlook and more to do with the fact people don't stay with companies nearly as long as they once did. It's time to turn the page.  Bottom Line on JD StockWhile I agree with most of my colleague's sentiments about JD.com, I have less conviction that JD stock is going to run much higher in 2019. Perhaps it gets to the mid-$30s with another good earnings report. Beyond that, I'm doubtful. As for employees leaving, I wouldn't give it a second thought. Good people leave companies all the time. JD.com's no different. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20,"As the potential of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) draws interest, the company remains mired in a trade war hitting most Chinese stocks as well as a few self-inflicted problems. While this may hamper JD stock for now, the company should grow long-term as JD extends its reach both into established markets and, in some cases, markets ignored by the investment community.Source:  Daniel Cukier via Flickr JD Stock and the Trade WarWithout question, the 800-pound gorilla driving JD.com remains the U.S.-China trade war.JD continues its alliance with Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Nonetheless, the trade war affects mostly its customers, who have less money to spend with more limited access to the U.S. This brought the stock price from $50 per share down to $20 last year. A recovery has taken it above $28 per share. Still, JD trades more than 40% below its all-time high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal Another factor involves the legal troubles of company founder and CEO Richard Liu. We now know he will not go to jail, but civil allegations related to the rape accusation remain an issue.Such personal matters should concern investors. The company has no clear successor or even a plan of succession. Given the scope of Liu's troubles, a succession plan would remove a source of uncertainty that weighed on JD stock last fall.His management decisions have also led to criticism. The so-called &quot;996&quot; schedule, 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, six days per week has attracted a lot of negative publicity. Mr. Liu also faces attacks for criticizing employees perceived as lazy or unwilling to sacrifice for the company.Still, barring a major strike, labor complaints rarely affect stocks. Also, I think management will find a way to fill the vacuum should something happen to Mr. Liu. After the trade war ends, traders will more than likely judge JD for what the company does right and how that benefits investors. Investment and JD StockWhat has benefitted investors is the investment in infrastructure. While many believe the logistics network itself will trade under a separate stock, JD's management has no plans to list this unit separately on the markets.However, logistics remains the factor that separates it from its larger rival, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Rather than acting as a middleman like Alibaba, JD built a logistics network comparable to that of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the United States.This gives JD an advantage as it facilitates omnichannel retailing. With a forecasted 94.3% earnings increase this year and 50% the next, these investments have begun to pay off. Moreover, traders can buy this kind of earnings growth at a relatively low price. Currently, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of about 27.2.Admittedly, such a multiple would appear expensive to most stocks. Also, should profits on JD stock take a sudden dive, the company might struggle to maintain this multiple. However, considering the earnings growth, 27.2 times forward earnings looks like a bargain.Further, as I mentioned in a previous article, investors should not discount its investment in Indonesia. At a population now estimated at over 269 million, it has more people than two more recognized emerging markets, Brazil and Russia. Hence, as it gains more attention as an emerging market, the rise of Indonesia should help JD stock to rise as well.Yes, the company needs the trade war to end, and the company should address its succession issues. However, given the deep investments and its reach across the world, I see little else that can stand in the way. Concluding thoughts on JD stockJD's deep infrastructure investments at home and its reach abroad should help JD.com stock overcome its challenges long term. Admittedly the trade war and Mr. Liu's legal troubles have influenced the stock's short-term performance. Some of his management decisions have also brought criticism.However, when one can buy 50%-plus profit growth for 27 times forward earnings, it should pay off at some point. This makes JD stock a winner--as soon as it can put the trade war behind it.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

However, it is actually several weeks worth of promotions, starting June 1 and running through to June 18. The company posted the results for this year's 6.18 sale on its blog and the impressive numbers have helped to boost JD stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 On Thursday, JD stock price hit $29.71, before settling down to close at $29.12 for a 1.61% gain on the day.

The company provides data-driven tools to retail clients, including profiling buyers, targeted advertising and an AI-powered chatbot. And the new approach is showing encouraging results.&quot;This initiative employs big data and consumer insights, providing insights to brands to adjust their manufacturing and marketing approaches with the goal of providing consumers with products they want before they even know they want them. Transaction volume of new products and C2M products during 6.18 increased 289% compared with the same period last year.

The companies have already largely &quot;exhausted&quot; online growth amid a Chinese e-commerce market that is growing saturated. For revenue to increase and JD stock to grow in value, the company needs to provide more value to merchant partners, increase customer loyalty, and convince those customers to buy more.

2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Carrefour SA has agreed to sell an 80% stake in its China unit for 4.8 billion yuan ($698 million) in cash to local retailer Suning.com Co. as it rethinks its exposure in the world’s No. 2 economy after years of decline.The yielding of control comes after a long search for a partner for the French company’s struggling Chinese operations. Once the premier foreign supermarket chain locally, it failed to adjust to the onslaught of e-commerce in recent years and sales slumped.The shares rose as much as 2.9% early Monday in Paris.Carrefour will retain a 20% stake in the China business, which generated net sales of 3.6 billion euros (28.5 billion yuan) in 2018. It will also get two seats out of seven on the China unit’s Supervisory Board, according to a statement Sunday. The valuation of Carrefour’s China unit at 0.2 times its 2018 sales -- compared to an industry average of 0.8 times -- is at a “significant discount to peers likely due to poor financial results,” said Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Lydia Ling in a note Monday.“The consolidation in store network, supply chain, logistics and membership could improve efficiency and profitability for both parties,” said the Citi note.A growing number of European and American retailers are either scaling back their presence or tying up with local partners in order to stay competitive in China, where e-commerce penetration is one of the highest globally. Walmart Inc., which has a network of around 400 supermarkets, relies on JD.com Inc. for its delivery service, while Germany’s Metro AG is said to be trying to offload a majority stake in its Chinese business.“The big problem for Carrefour and other western grocery chains is that they have major challenges in their home countries and can’t afford to grow in China,” said Pascal Martin, a Hong Kong-based partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. “In China, if you want to grow in the groceries space, you have to continue to invest capital in less developed cities.”End of an EraIt’s the end of an era for one of the first foreign brands to gain a loyal following among Chinese consumers. Carrefour entered the country in 1995, ahead of Walmart, and its massive hypermarkets where one could buy fresh pork along with a TV ushered in a new style of shopping for a country just opening up to the outside world.But it has struggled to maintain profitability as buyers moved online rapidly in recent years, a shift that’s favored home-grown giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Despite efforts to digitize its operations, and an initiative to rent out store space to local retailer Gome Retail Holdings, Carrefour’s China sales declined about 10 percent last year to 3.6 billion euros, according to the company’s annual report.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were 66 million euros or 516 million yuan last year. It operates 210 hypermarkets and 24 convenience stores in China currently.The transaction represents an enterprise value of 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) for Carrefour China. For Nanjing-based Suning, primarily an electronics retailer, the deal will help it cut procurement and logistics costs and boost profitability, the company said in a statement Sunday. Its Shenzhen-listed shares rose as much as 6.5% in early trading on Monday as investors rewarded the retailer for closing the deal at a low price.Alibaba holds a 20% stake in Suning and the two companies are closely allied. They’ve been investing in brick-and-mortar retailers with the goal of building an empire where offline and online shopping are seamlessly integrated. Earlier this year, Suning bought 37 department stores from Wanda Group, while Alibaba paid $2.9 billion in 2017 for a 36% stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., China’s biggest supermarket chain. The Carrefour deal is likely to strengthen Alibaba’s foothold in the fiercely competitive groceries market in China.The acquisition has been cleared by Carrefour’s board and is expected to close by year end, but still needs approval from the Chinese regulator, said the companies.Carrefour’s decision to retain a 20% holding shows how China remains a strategic market for global retailers. Keeping that stake will allow it to maintain a foothold in an innovative retail market, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.(Updates with shares in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Robert Williams.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Geraldine Amiel in Paris at gamiel@bloomberg.net;Daniela Wei in Hong Kong at jwei74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Bhuma ShrivastavaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Carrefour Sells Control of China Business at a Discount

2019-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has set up a new website to double the number of global brands on its flagship online mall, taking an important step toward fulfilling its global ambitions.The e-commerce giant began offering an English-language portal on Tmall for the first time on Wednesday to entice more merchants from around the world to sell to Chinese consumers. Alibaba is counting on the initiative to help double the number of foreign brands on Tmall Global to 40,000 in three years, said Yi Qian, deputy general manager of the service, which caters to buyers of foreign goods.Alibaba is seeking new growth engines to offset a cooling economy at home as the trade war rages on, while fending off increasingly aggressive competitors including JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. Billionaire co-founder Jack Ma had set a goal of generating more than half of the company’s revenue from outside of China by 2025.“The website will widen our reach to merchants, especially to those medium and small sized businesses around the world,” Yi said in an interview. “We will help them with our logistics and marketing services.”Alibaba grew to become China’s largest public company by popularizing e-commerce across the world’s No. 2 economy, on which it still depends for the vast majority of its business. It’s begun making inroads into Southeast Asia through the acquisition of Lazada, but now aims to broaden its reach even further.Tmall’s new portal allows English-speaking merchants to fill in details online about their products. Alibaba then vets them based on category and quality, and will contact merchants within 72 hours to gauge if their products are a fit, Yi said. Previously, such sellers could only join Tmall through personal introduction, or by signing up at trade fairs. Other foreign-language versions of the website are in the works, including Spanish, Japanese and Korean.Alibaba doesn’t disclose dealings over its Tmall platform, which helps merchants sell goods to 600 million-plus buyers, but it’s one of the single largest online retailers in China’s $1 trillion e-commerce arena. Jiang Fan, one of Jack Ma’s closest lieutenants, said in April the company wanted to double transaction volumes on its Tmall service in three years.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Aims to Double Global Brands With New English Site

2019-06-28,"The commentary on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been mixed, especially with the trade war continuing to wreak havoc on the market. Although Alibaba stock has been in the news a lot lately, the overall investment story hasn't changed much. The same growth story is still driving the bull case and the same risks are still supporting the bears.Source: Shutterstock Here's a look at both sides of the coin for BABA stock. Pro: Strong Growth Story for Alibaba StockA big reason that BABA stock is on anyone's radar is the fact that several observers consider it the Chinese Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  That's because Alibaba has become the go-to marketplace for nearly half of the Chinese population. Similarly, Amazon has become the first port of call for most Americans.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The Top 8 Tech Stocks of 2019 (So Far) Put Amazon and China together in one sentence, and you have every investor's dream: a fast-growing company with a hold on a massive population whose buying power is also on the rise.Although Alibaba began with e-commerce, the company has since morphed into a data-driven conglomerate offering a wide range of services. Now it's China's largest e-commerce platform and the nation's largest cloud business.Alibaba has used the past few years of impressive revenue growth to invest in the firm's future. Outside of its cloud segment, BABA has also built out a food-delivery platform as well as a digital-entertainment arm. On top of that the firm bought out a 33% stake in Ant Financial. Ant and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) controls about 90% of China's payments market. Pro: China's Digital LandscapeAnother reason Alibaba stock should be on your radar is that China's digital economy is only in the nascent stages. Experts forecast e-commerce sales in China to increase 15% or more annually over the next few years. And right now, Alibaba controls more than half of China's e-commerce market through Taobao, Tmall and Alibaba.com.That hold on China's online shoppers is crucial because it means that as e-commerce expands, so will Alibaba. Much like Americans trust Amazon, Chinese consumers likewise trust Alibaba. As more people switch to shopping online, BABA will be the first place they look.They've heard the name and they know to trust it. This sentiment also implies substantial positives for the BABA stock price. Pro: BABA Stock Is on SaleWhether or not a stock is cheap is all in the eye of the beholder. But there's no denying that at the current rate, Alibaba stock is cheap compared to a year ago.InvestorPlace's Luke Lango sees the BABA stock price making its way back to $200 per share in 2020. He's not alone either.According to The Wall Street Journal, every one of the 50 analysts covering Alibaba stock was bullish. The average price target came in at $219.38. Moreover, the lowest target price was $193.60, which represents a 13% upside from where shares trade today. Con: Slowing Economic GrowthPerhaps the biggest worry on traders' minds when it comes to Alibaba stock is the U.S.-China trade war. With an already slowing Chinese economy, economic tensions will worsen this situation. Beijing reported that its economy grew at its slowest pace in 28 years in 2018. Understandably, that has raised alarm among investors of Chinese stocks.Much of BABA's growth story is dependent on China's growing middle class and the fact that the nation's consumers have more purchasing power. However, not only is the Chinese economy showing signs of weakness, but retail sales also slowed. Worryingly, this suggest that consumers aren't as willing or able to spend as analysts previously believed. Con: Chinese TiesThe fact that Alibaba is a Chinese firm is both a rose and a thorn. On one hand, the fast growth in China is a huge factor in BABA's success. However, being tied to China also adds a layer of risk for investors. Not only have analysts raised concerns about the validity of Chinese economic data, the ongoing trade war with the U.S. has forced BABA to pledge its allegiance to its home country.Many have speculated that Alibaba's decision to list on the Hong Kong exchange has political motivations. The move has been dubbed a &quot;homecoming.&quot; Although the capital raised will certainly be useful, it's a statement that reinforces BABA's ties to Beijing. Plus, it acts as an insurance policy for Alibaba if Trump decides to restrict China's access to Wall Street. Con: CompetitionWhile Alibaba is controlling the majority of China's e-commerce market, many are still concerned about competitors like JD.com (NYSE:JD) that threaten to slow BABA's growth in some categories. Specifically, JD has made strides toward gaining consumer trust and expanding its offerings by partnering with Tencent and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Plus, BABA has to compete with strong international players like Amazon if it wants to grow outside of China. Many are worried that Alibaba's rapidly growing portfolio of businesses is diverting management's attention from its most important core business. Such a diversion could hurt the firm's competitive edge against rivals. The Bottom LineThings look bumpy for Alibaba stock over the next few months as long as the trade war continues. However, a resolution to the tension between Washington and Beijing could send shares of BABA soaring. The pros outweigh the cons here, making Alibaba a good choice for investors willing to ride out some uncertainty.As of this writing Laura Hoy was long AMZN.

Despite trade-related concerns, Alibaba is advancing in several different sectors as its founder, Jack Ma, who is now the company's executive chairman, prepares to retire in September.Source: Shutterstock Alibaba stock currently has both positive and negative catalysts. Although valuation could make buying at least a small position in BABA stock worthwhile, investors should keep their expectations of BABA in check.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer  Alibaba Is a Cheap Source of GrowthLike peers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Alibaba has moved headlong into the digital-ad business. It also competes with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) on smart speakers, though it may need to play catch-up in the latter area, as it has fallen behind BIDU in smart speakers. BABA also has a cloud business and has developed a chip for self-driving cars.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdditionally, Alibaba has focused on expanding outside of China. Recent reports revealed that the company plans to invest $100 million in a joint venture in Russia. Moreover, with the $10 billion IPO of BABA slated to occur in Hong Kong, the company will have enough cash to fund its ventures generously.Despite my criticism of BABA stock in the past, I currently see a lot to like about Alibaba stock. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the company's profit to rise 21.9% during the current fiscal year and 29.3% next fiscal year. Given that level of growth and Alibaba stock's forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of just 19.4, I believe buying BABA stock is worthwhile. The Nature of Alibaba Stock Stymies Its GrowthHowever, traders also have reasons to have moderate expectations for BABA stock. For one, unlike the shares that will soon be listed on the Hong Kong exchange, BABA stock is not actually shares of Alibaba. Instead,  BABA stock is actually shares of a Cayman Islands-based holding company that's entitled to a portion of Alibaba's profits.Since such holding companies' stock doesn't provide investors with direct ownership of companies, it tends to trade at a discount. But I do not expect BABA to violate its agreement with the holding company.However, I think this arrangement places some level of doubt in the minds of investors. I believe these doubts prevent Alibaba stock from attaining  the triple-digit PE ratios that Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have reached in the recent past. Nonetheless, Alibaba stock has risen about 150% since its IPO over five years ago. That amounts to a compound annual growth rate of about 20%, which is higher than the CAGR of the  S&P 500.Moreover, although BABA does little business with  the U.S.,Alibaba stock has traded in a range since the trade war began in early 2018. I don't expect BABA to return to its sub-$130 lows of last December.  I do not, however, think it will remain above $200 per share for a long period of time unless the trade war ends. As a result, investors must moderate their expectations of Alibaba stock. Leadership Change Will Affect Alibaba StockBABA's founder, former CEO, and current executive Chairman Jack Ma will soon leave the company and hand the reins completely to his hand-picked successor and current CEO, Daniel Zhang. Only time will tell how successful Zhang will be. However, due to the conglomerate status of Alibaba, Zhang's job will be difficult. But I do not expect BABA to do as badly under Zhang as GE (NYSE:GE) did under  Jeff Immelt, who succeeded the great CEO Jack Welch.Nonetheless, given BABA's challenges, I think Alibaba stock is reasonably priced at its current levels. For risk tolerant investors, I think buying BABA stock makes some sense. However,  BABA's unknowns, including the coming leadership transition, make BABA stock risky. Final Thoughts on Alibaba StockAlibaba stock will likely generate strong returns, but it has risks that aren't discussed enough. While the shares trade at bargain levels, the fact that buying BABA stock does not give investors shares of Alibaba could keep a lid on BABA stock price. Moreover, the company's leadership transition poses risks, and Alibaba's conglomerate status adds considerably to the uncertainty.But for those who want to speculate and can tolerate risk, Alibaba stock might be worthwhile. However, the ultimate success of BABA stock will likely depend on politics and personalities more than numbers.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

That’s “double or triple” the number of private deals it strikes in a typical year, he said.As China and the U.S. engage in a stop-go trade spat, slowing economic growth in Asia’s biggest economy is damping investor appetite for listed giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., as well as their unlisted peers. The country’s vaunted tech sector is undergoing a period of pain as companies including JD.com Inc. lay off staff and trim costs, while startup investment fizzles.Against that backdrop, Ji sees an opportunity.“The macroeconomic overhang is the worst we’ve seen in 10 years,” he said. “The market has become more rational, and that’s helpful for value investors like us.”Forecast valuations for unlisted Chinese tech firms that plan to go public within three years have dropped at least 20% to 30% versus a year to 18 months ago, Ji said. There have been isolated cases of sharper declines of as much as 50%, he added.All-Stars is targeting firms that can sustain robust growth throughout an economic cycle by helping customers cut costs, improve efficiencies and innovate, Ji, a former head of Asia internet and media research at Morgan Stanley, said.New-Economy ChampionsHong Kong-based All-Stars manages almost $2 billion in hedge and private equity funds that focus on “new-economy champions” in China. The majority is in private equity, including $600 million the group closed in January for a seven-year fund. Unlike early-stage venture capital investors, All-Stars’ private-equity investments focus on more mature companies that are close to public share sales.All-Stars’ new investments include artificial intelligence outfit SenseTime Group Ltd., online financing company Lufax, co-working firm Ucommune and WeDoctor. It added to its investments in Tujia.com, a Chinese rival to Airbnb Inc., and Full Truck Alliance Group, China’s largest truck-sharing platform, Ji said.Besides cheaper valuations, muted sentiment has made it easier to negotiate terms that are more favorable to investors, he said. Having deployed a majority of the money in the $600 million fund, All-Stars plans to tap investors for another private-equity fund in the second half, he said.To contact the reporter on this story: Bei Hu in Hong Kong at bhu5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Katrina Nicholas at knicholas2@bloomberg.net, Peter VercoeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",$2 Billion Firm Doubles Down on Chinese Tech Investments

More than half of Amazon's deliveries today are on behalf of other companies, and that has been increasing.While politicians have talked about infrastructure, and most corporate CEOs have danced around it, Amazon has been putting money into it, and making it available to competitors. That's why Amazon has its own fleet of delivery trucks, its own airplanes, and is launching its own drones, following the path of China's JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).  Stop the Investing?Efforts to break up Amazon are predicated in part on the work of Lina Khan, who as a law student in 2017, suggested in a Yale Law Journal article that Amazon should be made a common carrier, like AT&T (NYSE:T), for the purpose of controlling its market dominance.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Instead of looking for harm to consumers, Khan argues for &quot;economic structuralism,&quot; the idea that any market dominated by a few companies promotes anticompetitive conduct. Her article views lower prices as predatory and vertical integration as undermining competition. The problem with this approach is that it makes any company that scales subject to the government's micro-meddling. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) slowly lost its competitiveness under Justice Department guidance. So did Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). If we had waited for AT&T build the cloud, we'd still be waiting. Khan's conceptual framework would prohibit large companies from investing ahead of a market. It would make all scaled infrastructure investment subject to government control.How does that help us compete with China? Defending AmazonThe new attitude spawned by Khan's paper has made every Amazon action subject to political and media sneering.If Amazon is trying to bring the military into the 21st century, it's a &quot;cloud industrial complex,&quot; a direct threat to human liberty.Like its fellow cloud czars -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- Amazon is having to hire a host of lawyers, PR mavens, and political pros to defend its right to engage in business. Bottom Line on Amazon StockThe question for Amazon stock investors isn't whether critics are right but how much the results of that criticism will cost the company in terms of profit and stock market gains.History shows that antitrust scrutiny becomes internalized. Companies under the government's eye become increasingly adept at saying &quot;no&quot; to change and, eventually, put money into dividends and buybacks rather than infrastructure.Every Amazon investment is now subject to criticism. From the way it operates its warehouses to its efforts to build office space, from the TV shows it offers Amazon Prime members, to the recommendations of its search engine, Amazon now has a target on its back before the press, the public, and (most important) the government.

2019-07-08,"(Bloomberg) -- China went through a five-year surge in venture capital investment that fostered a new generation of startups from ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to TikTok-parent Bytedance Ltd. Now the boom may be over.Venture deals in China plummeted in the second quarter as investors pulled back amid unpredictable trade talks and growing concerns about startup valuations. The value of investments in the country tumbled 77% to $9.4 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, while the number of deals roughly halved to 692, according to the market research firm Preqin.The second quarter of 2018 marked the peak for China venture deals with a total of $41.3 billion invested. That included a $14 billion round for digital payments giant Ant Financial, $3 billion for e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo Inc. and $1.9 billion for truck-sharing service Manbang Group (known also as Full Truck Alliance Group). By comparison, the largest venture deal in the second quarter of 2019 was a $1 billion investment in JD Health, the health care affiliate of e-commerce provider JD.com Inc.China has never been through a widespread bust like the U.S. did after the dotcom boom, in part because the country’s venture market is so new. Years of steady growth in tech investments resulted in predictable -- and enormous -- profits. Whether the current downturn becomes a painful crash depends in large part on how VCs, entrepreneurs and regulators navigate terrain they’ve never seen before.“We’re seeing real stress in the system for the first time,” said Gary Rieschel, a founding partner at Qiming Venture Partners who has worked in China and the U.S. “We have never seen a downturn in the China market. For 20 years, it’s been pretty much up and to the right.”China’s venture boom began in 2014 when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public in the largest-ever initial public offering, making clear to investors the potential riches in the world’s most populous country. Venture deals tripled that year to more than $17 billion and proceeded to rise every year through 2018 when the total topped $105 billion, almost as much as in the U.S.Along the way, firms like Qiming, Sequoia China, Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Group Corp. fostered some of the most valuable startups in the world. Bytedance, the force behind short-video app TikTok and other addictive services, sports a valuation of $75 billion, the highest anywhere according to CB Insights. Didi, the ride-hailing service that ousted Uber Technologies Inc. from China, was last valued at $56 billion, the second highest.But the rise of China’s tech industry put it squarely in the crossfire of the trade war. The Trump administration has accused China of stealing intellectual property and unfairly subsidizing companies in strategic fields, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. In May, the U.S. blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co., preventing the telecom giant from buying American components, and is considering doing the same to a swath of startups.The trade war gives investors one more reason for caution. Valuations had already grown vertiginous. High-profile startups such as smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp. and delivery giant Meituan Dianping saw their stocks tumble after they went public, reinforcing the impression that private-market valuations had gotten out of hand.So-called sharing economy startups have also tested the patience of their investors. Companies like Didi, Meituan and bike-sharing provider Ofo blitzed the market with heavy subsidies to grab market share from rivals, making up for their losses with venture money. Now there’s skepticism that many such companies will ever turn a profit.“You’re really reaching the end of the shared economy -- this idea of let’s give away services for free and make up for it in volume,” Rieschel said. “Some companies -- Didi is the classic case -- are just not showing any ability to become profitable.”A Didi representative didn’t respond to a message and email seeking comment.Valuations haven’t declined yet in China though. The country’s startups have resisted so-called down rounds, when they raise money at lower valuations than an earlier round. “China entrepreneurs, more than any on the planet, will do unnatural things to avoid a down round,” Rieschel said.Meanwhile, venture firms are pivoting to alternative business models, like enterprise software. Such startups are not only less capital intensive, they are at a stage of development where they require less money.This also may simply be a time when venture investors opt for caution. Given the volatile negotiations between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it’s not clear what kind of opportunities China’s tech startups will face in the years ahead or how capital markets will treat the next big IPO filing.“It won’t cost you that much to sit on your hands for a few months,” Rieschel said.&#92;--With assistance from Lulu Yilun Chen.To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Elstrom in Tokyo at pelstrom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China's Venture Capital Boom Shows Signs of Turning Into a Bust

2019-07-09,"Over the past few months, the stock price of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), one of the most important Chinese companies to be listed on U.S. exchanges, has been extremely choppy as the rhetoric on U.S.-China trade issues has become the elephant in the room.Source: Shutterstock It's probably the understatement of the past 12 months to say that the trade war between the U.S. and China have brought significant uncertainty to the global stock markets. As a result, most Chinese stocks are currently much cheaper than they were a year ago.Now that the meeting between President Donald Trump and the Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit is over, investors will turn their attention to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision as well as the upcoming earnings releases by many tech heavyweights. Therefore, the recent volatility we have experienced, especially in the tech sector, is likely to stay with us for a while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday let us discuss BABA stock in light of the developments in China as well as South and South East Asia. The Chinese Economy Is Growing and EvolvingOver the past two decades, Alibaba has become a highly regarded global company, and BABA stock offers U.S. investors the chance to invest in the growing Chinese consumer and e-commerce markets.Although the Chinese economy may slow down in 2019 or even 2020, its GDP is still expanding at an average annual rate of 6% minimum. This growth is indeed faster than almost any other major economy in the world. With a population of almost 1.4 billion people, China's economic growth is still in its early stages and the Chinese middle class is likely to expand for a long time.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half About 20% of the country's retail purchases are made online. In 2018, the online retail sales of goods and services was over $1.3 billion, up by 23.9% year-on-year (YoY). Readers who are interested in various statistics on China may want to refer to the website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China.In other words, China's growing middle class will continue to drive increases in the country's consumer spending. And when average Chinese citizens have more money in their pockets, more of it can be spent on online shopping sites like Alibaba, which itself is a good proxy for levels of retail spending in China.Furthermore, many analysts believe that BABA stock's bottom line is not going to be too adversely affected by current trade wars, as its business model is tied to China directly, decreasing the long-term risks of bi-party trade wars.This fact may indeed be important for long-term Alibaba shareholders, as in general the trade war has had a negative impact on investor sentiment as well as on the prices of many tech stocks. After all, the U.S. is still China's biggest trading partner, as it buys almost one-fifth of its exports.As weeks go by, not many analysts believe that the U.S. and China are likely to conclude a comprehensive trade agreement soon. The negotiations may well drag out right up to the U.S. presidential elections.Yet, BABA stock may prove quite resilient to further news on the trade disputes, especially as one headline is usually reversed in a few days by usually an opposite headline. Alibaba's management has also downplayed the potential adverse effects of the trade war on BABA stock. Soon, markets may stop caring much about the news on the trade rhetoric. How Does Alibaba Stock Make Money?Alibaba is expected to release its next earnings statement on Aug. 22.When BABA stock released its most recent quarterly results on May 15, both sales and earnings exceeded estimates. Total revenue came at $56.1 billion, an increase of 51% YoY. On the bottom line, BABA stock grew adjusted net income by 12%. In fiscal 2020, management expects Alibaba's revenue to top $72 billion, a 33% YoY growth.In the most recent quarterly statement, analysts have paid attention to four main areas:  * Core commerce (BABA's largest segment, whose revenue grew 54% YoY);  * Cloud computing (revenue soared soared 76% YoY);  * Digital media and entertainment (revenue increased 8% YOY); and  * Innovation initiatives (revenue jumped 22% YOY).Despite the company's dominance in the Chinese e-commerce space, Alibaba is also rapidly expanding into many other lucrative industries aside from consumer products and retail. These segments include cloud computing infrastructure (i.e., Alibaba Cloud), digital payments (i.e., Ant Financial Services Group), online entertainment (i.e., Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures), and food delivery (i.e., Alibaba Local Services Company which is a merger between Ele.me and Koubei).Alibaba also owns over 31% of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), the Chinese microblogging company. Chinese internet celebrity (better known as &quot;wanghong&quot;) accounts at Weibo, and the website's rich multimedia functionalities help make WB a much-loved and somewhat indispensable social media company within China. Furthermore, WB's recent investments in live video streaming and fintech have already started contributing to the bottom line.Although many analysts have expressed growth concerns regarding China in the coming quarters, the country's economic fundamentals have vastly improved over the past decade. The internet population is still booming and money continues to pour into Chinese companies operating in this space -- factors that help support the long-term durability of BABA stock. BABA Stock Has Robust FundamentalsAlibaba has been branching out into other business ventures, and this expansion has been made possibly partly by its steady free cash flow (FCF), which measures a company's ability to produce cash. Investors care a lot about FCF, as it can be used in a discretionary manner. For example, BABA has used its FCF to invest in growth opportunities and strengthen its balance sheet further.Therefore on Aug. 22, Wall Street is likely to analyze the company's cash position closely. Many analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to continue growing by double-digit-percentage rates.In general, Alibaba's management does not provide any earnings guidance for future quarters. But there is general consensus that BABA's top line can increase at an average annual rate of 20%, through both organic growth and acquisitions. That would be an impressive growth rate for a company with a market cap of $452 billion.Another metric to pay attention to in August is Alibaba's operating margin, which stood at roughly 18% as of the end of the first quarter. Over the years, BABA's high operating margin has contributed to its profitability, which has been even higher than that of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).However, investors are concerned that Alibaba's profit margins are decreasing. In fact, they are at their lowest levels since the company went public in September 2014. The group's various investments in especially cloud, digital media and food delivery have been pressuring profits. Although these new ventures help BABA expand its ecosystem, they also weigh on the stock's profitability, as these other segments are not yet profitable. The current profit margin stands at 27.7%. Alibaba Stock Is a Leader in E-CommerceAt present, the company's share of the Chinese e-commerce space is over 55% and BABA's core business of online retail contributes to about 85% of revenues.In comparison, Alibaba's closest rival, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), has about 16% share of the Chinese e-commerce space. On the other hand, in 2018, Amazon's share of online retail marketplace was less than 1%; as a result Amazon is now closing down its Chinese online market.BABA operates through three main ecommerce sites -- Taobao, a Chinese online shopping website; Tmall, a Chinese-language website for business-to-consumer online retail; and Alibaba.com, the group's international trade site. The three sites have hundreds of millions of users globally and host millions of businesses.Alibaba's mobile Monthly Active Users (MAUs) on its e-commerce platforms is now 721 million. Alibaba's core business  of e-commerce is highly profitable, as it charges a commission on items sold. The group also sells advertising on its platforms.Alibaba uses Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) to measure total sales transacted through its platforms. For fiscal 2019, Alibaba's commerce business generated $853 billion in GMV, especially led by the Tmall retail marketplace. GMV on Tmall and Taobao have also increased by 31% and 19%, respectively.It is important to remind our readers that many U.S. companies already use Alibaba's platforms to reach  consumers in China, a market that's competitive yet attractive. And the group is aiming to increase its reach further and have more American business list their products on the company platforms. When Alibaba reports in August, BABA shareholders will be interested to analyze the corresponding MAU and GMV numbers.Earlier in 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that China, the world's second-biggest economy, is likely to be slowing down in the rest of the year. However, the e-commerce market in China is still forecast to almost double within the next four years to reach $1.8 trillion. Therefore, even if the Chinese economic growth pauses for a few quarters to come, the country's growth potential is intact.In other words, a potential cooling off in China shouldn't get in the way of a sensible, long-term investing strategy, which BABA stock may offer shareholders. BABA's Cloud Segment Is GrowingWith a population of nearly 1.4 billion people, China is the largest country in the world. A rising middle class leads to higher consumerism, and that bodes well for many industries in China. One of those industries set to benefit is cloud computing.Alibaba's concentrated push deeper into cloud computing is increasingly being compared to the success of Amazon's cloud business. Alibaba Cloud is now the market leader in Asia.On May 15, when BABA released its quarterly results, both sales and earnings exceeded estimates.  Investors cheered that BABA's cloud computing revenue soared 76% YoY.Alibaba has over 40% of the public cloud market in China. The market share of Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), its biggest competitor, is about 11%.As a result of increased diversification as well as the growth in the cloud space, Alibaba's total revenue is expected to grow by double-digit-percentage rates. Such a growth rate would indeed be impressive for a company with a market cap of $415 billion.Alibaba is now offering data analytics services to third-party businesses through A100, which integrates consumer shopping data into merchants' other services. The data is also becoming increasingly personalized through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). For example, Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have already started using this data analytics service offered by A100. Other merchants have started linking facial-recognition data to A100 so that they can offer personalized solutions to customers as soon as they enter the store. Ant Financial and Alibaba's Fintech EcosystemThe global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the financial technology (fintech) apps revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as their retail customers.Ant Financial Services Group, formerly know as Alipay, is Alibaba's mobile and online payment platform. Alibaba has a 33% stake in Ant Financial, which is an extremely popular mobile payment platform throughout China.The company processes payments between any two users. It further offers a wide range of financial services, such as insurance, credit, loans, credit scoring, and wealth management.China is witnessing the tremendous growth of fintech. At present, Ant Financial and Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival in this sphere, control about 90% of China's payments market.Ant Financial has now become a powerhouse which many analysts expect may itself become a publicly listed company. The group is valued at over $150 billion.To put it into perspective for our readers, the market caps of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are about $75 billion and $366 billion respectively. Alibaba Is Growing InternationallyFinally, forward-looking investors may want to pay attention to BABA's international growth numbers, too. Currently, more than 90% of the e-commerce giant's sales are made in China.  But BABA has investments in start-ups in South Asia and Southeast Asia, too.Southeast Asia is en route to becoming the world's fourth-largest economic region by GDP, and analysts expect its e-commerce sector to expand tremendously within the next decade. Higher incomes and rising internet penetration rates are likely to strengthen these regions' e-commerce markets.Among the start-ups in those regions in which BABA has stakes are Paytm, an Indian digital-payments provider, and Lazada, a Singapore-based e-commerce company that is growing in overseas markets.Aibaba's focus on India is an area that investors may want to pay attention to for the long run. Globally, India is the fastest growing e-commerce market where the annual growth rate is about 50%. Increased smartphone usage as well as advances in delivery infrastructure and logistics are contributing to the increase in revenue. In addition to Paytm, Alibaba has also invested in Big Basket and Zomato in India.BABA is also looking to partner with European companies. Many European companies are still discovering new ways to enter the Chinese market, and BABA may enable them to connect with Chinese customers faster. Ant Financial is also seeking to expand in Europe.The &quot;Amazon of the East&quot; has also set its eyes on moving west through partnerships with European companies, including Vodafone Group (NASDAQ:VOD) in Germany and El Corte Ingles in Spain.International growth will not only help increase the company's bottom line, but it will also enable BABA to diversify away from China, lowering the country-specific macro risk of Alibaba stock. BABA Stock's Upcoming Listing in Hong KongBy the end of year, Alibaba is possibly going to Hong Kong for a second listing. There the company is expected to raise $20 billion.BABA had delisted from Hong Kong in June 2012. Now there is speculation as to why the company wants to move closer to China in a second listing and raise cash. Both the bulls and the bears are debating Alibaba's motives.Is it because BABA management is worried about the trade wars? Can BABA's second listing encourage more Chinese companies to follow Alibaba to Hong Kong? Does Alibaba need the cash for reasons investors do not know yet? Should investors therefore be worried?The exact result of this listing is still hard to pin down. For example, Alibaba has recently announced a one-to-eight stock split. A lower price may lure more Hong Kong-based investors into buying Alibaba stock.However, we do not know how its U.S. shareholders may react. One thing we can probably count on, though, is increased volatility in BABA stock price. Short-Term Technical Analysis for BABA StockAs a result of the impressive run-up of Alibaba stock since early June, BABA's short-term technical indicators have become overextended. Therefore, in July BABA stock has been impacted by profit-taking as it heads into its earnings report season.In the next few weeks, I do not expect BABA stock to regain its recent high of $195.72, which was last seen on May 3. At this point, bulls are not yet in control. Therefore Alibaba shares will need a strong catalyst to make them attractive in the eyes of long-term investors. Instead, depending on headlines regarding the U.S.-China trade war or the interest rate decision by the Fed, I expect BABA stock to trade between $155 and $175.In other words, at the current price of about $167, I find the risk/reward ratio on the long side inadequate. I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness, but I'd be ready to start building a position around $155 later in the summer.It's almost impossible to time a top and a bottom in the markets. Those who bought at about $195 in early May might not be too happy, but investors who had the courage to step in at the end of 2018 or on the last day of May 2019 are in pretty good shape.If you are an investor with paper profits, maybe you should consider locking in some of those gains now. That said, if you are worried about profit-taking in the short term , then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, to protect your profits to date, you may consider placing a stop-loss at about 3%-5% below the current price point.In case of a potential profit taking, short-term moving averages and oscillators would move toward a more neutral reading from the overbought levels we are currently seeing. And long-term investors may prefer to open up positions then.In other words, if you are not yet a shareholder of BABA stock, you may want to wait on the sidelines until you have had a chance to analyze the earnings results.If you already own BABA shares, you may consider hedging your position with at-the-money (ATM) covered calls with Aug. 16 or Sept. 20 expiry.The volatility of Alibaba stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. BABA Stock's PEG RatioIn addition to looking at technical analysis charts, I keep an eye on  stocks' Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio.  A PEG ratio of one means the market's perceived value of the stock is equal to its anticipated future earnings growth. For example, if a stock had a P/E ratio of 25, and the company's projected earnings growth was 25%, then the PEG ratio would be one.With the PEG number, investors can compare and contrast the relative value of a stock against other stocks. I also compare the change in PEG with the change in a stock's price within a given time-frame to gauge investor sentiment regarding a stock's potential price increase.In 2019, Alibaba stock is up over 20%. Given BABA's current level of earnings growth, Alibaba's PEG of 1.33 is currently high from my perspective. In other words, I regard BABA's stock price of about $167 as somewhat over-stretched. However, please remember that the PEG ratio is just one tool in investors' arsenal. The Bottom Line on BABA StockAlibaba stock offers U.S. investors the chance to invest in the growing Chinese consumer and e-commerce markets. As the company's second decade ends, it is increasingly focusing on becoming a social hub. Alibaba's growth in e-commerce, cloud computing and other investments throughout China and globally make it a disruptor and a sound long-term investment.BABA stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment in China as well as in the neighboring regions with further growth prospects, profitability, leadership, stability and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.I also believe that most of the negative effects of the U.S.-China trade war have already been priced into Alibaba stock. If the two sides reach a deal that's seen in a positive light this year, BABA stock is likely to rally.The month of June has given Wall Street a glimpse of how powerful BABA's comeback could be: the stock rallied from an intraday low of $147.95 on May 31 to an intraday high of $177.95 on July 1.Therefore long-term investors should possibly view any decline in BABA stock as a good opportunity to get into Alibaba shares. However, traders with a short-term horizon should remember that there might be some profit-taking in the stock ahead of BABA's earnings in August.Investors who are interested in buying into Chinese companies, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Alibaba may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have BABA as a holding, including iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI), KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF(NYSEARCA:KWEB) or iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:IEMG).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09,"Beyond the size of the market, JD.com's (NASDAQ:JD) market share may be at risk. The company long has been a distant number two to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). That said, evidence sprouted that JD.com was taking share, as Luce Emerson wrote back in 2017. However, that no longer appears to be the case, fading one of the declining reasons to buy JD stock.Source: Shutterstock Still, Alibaba is expected to lose market share again. But that share isn't going to JD.com. Rather, smaller rivals like Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) have stepped in. Additionally, other companies taking advantage of Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) app WeChat took market share for themselves.As we've seen in the U.S., technology allows smaller operators to compete head-to-head with massively larger firms. That's likely going to be the case in China as well. Therefore, JD.com stock faces risks as the underlying competition defends its existing turf.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Rising Costs Hurts JD.com StockThe other concern is below the operating line. Part of the reason JD stock has rallied is because margins have expanded, notably in the first quarter. Years of investments have deflated profit, but that's starting to change. With JD heading to real profitability -- analysts expect over $1 in adjusted EPS in 2020 -- investor confidence has risen.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The question is whether that can hold.

Soon afterwards, CEO Richard Liu wrote an internal letter citing huge losses in the company's logistics unit as the rationale for cutting the pay of delivery couriers. Liu elsewhere complained about &quot;slackers&quot; in his business, a complaint that drew scrutiny in the Chinese media. It also sparked discussions on social media amid debates over work-life balance in Chinese tech.To be sure, layoffs aren't necessarily bad news. And they don't mean that JD.com or JD Logistics are headed for declining earnings. JD.com hasn't just reduced its staff and delivery courier pay; it cut 10% of its executive workforce in February. Management explained this as a move to speed decision-making. Some pruning after growth makes sense.But the pressure on the logistics business is worrisome. Logistics is the bread-and-butter of Alibaba, JD.com's key competitor. Margins overall for JD.com are quite low: there's no room for pressure if the company must reverse its pay decision or cut the hours of staff elsewhere. It's not difficult to get the sense that JD.com is pushing its employees as hard as it can. And with adjusted operating margins under 2%, it has little recourse if they push back. The Case for JD StockAgain, this is not to say that JD stock is headed for a flameout. This still is the number-two e-commerce play in a still-growing market at a valuation that looks reasonable.But back above $30, the case does get a bit thinner. Plus, execution becomes more important. Below $20 late last year, JD.com stock was simply too cheap, priced for all but a worst-case scenario.But with the JD stock price more than 50% higher, that's not the case.And there are challenges to watch here. The Chinese economy still may not be that healthy. JD Logistics needs to get better; as Liu himself pointed out, the business only has two years' worth of cash left. Smaller competitors are coming. JD.com has a large enough, and profitable enough, business to thrive in this new environment. Unfortunately, the room for error is not what it used to be.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Noah Holdings Ltd., one of China’s largest wealth managers, levied accusations of fraud against Camsing International Holding Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed company that said last week its chairman had been detained by police.The asset manager has filed a lawsuit and reported Camsing to regulators in relation to a 3.4 billion yuan ($490 million) asset management product that’s in danger of default, Wang Jingbo, Noah’s chief executive officer and co-founder, said in an internal memo on Monday that was obtained by Bloomberg News. The product’s duration will be extended by as much as one year to ensure repayment, Wang said in the memo, the contents of which were confirmed by a spokeswoman.Camsing, a conglomerate with businesses spanning entertainment and health care, saw its stock plunge 80% in Hong Kong on Monday after the company said Chairman Lo Ching was being held in criminal custody by the Shanghai police. Noah’s shares fell 20% in New York after it said some credit funds managed by one of its affiliates provided “supply chain financing involving third-party companies related to Camsing.”A representative who answered the phone at Camsing’s office in Hong Kong declined to comment. The stock fell another 27% on Tuesday.Chinese investors have seen a slew of recent frauds involving listed companies, including false financial reporting by drugmaker Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. and fake profits at laminating-film maker Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co. The incidents are adding to an already stressed credit market: Bonds from at least 56 Chinese companies totaling $40 billion face repayment pressure, according to company and ratings firm statements compiled by Bloomberg.The incident “could significantly hit investor confidence, especially given current high macro-economic uncertainty and low risk appetite among clients,” Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Daphne Poon wrote in a note published on Tuesday.The underlying assets of the product are backed by accounts payable from Beijing JD Century Trade Holdings Ltd. to Camsing, Wang said in the Noah memo. In a statement on Tuesday, JD.com, JD Century Trade’s parent, denied any involvement.“Camsing falsified JD.com’s business contracts, engaging in fraudulent behavior,” a spokeswoman said by email. “We are shocked that this occurred and have been cooperating with the police on this issue.”In a statement on Tuesday, Noah said it had also sued JD.com, the online marketplace operator that Noah said had a longstanding relationship with Camsing. In response, JD.com said the lawsuit was “unmerited” and “severely impacted” its reputation.Citi’s analysts said that downward pressure on the economy could have contributed to the alleged fraud at Camsing. The company has worked with Noah for three years and previously had a good track-record, they said, with more than 6 billion yuan of asset management products having matured and been paid back.Shanghai-based Noah, which directly managed about $25 billion in assets at the end of March, has obtained additional shares of Camsing and its affiliates as collateral, Wang said in the memo. A Chinese court has frozen Camsing’s stock and bank accounts, she said, without providing more details.(Adds additional comments ninth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Zheping Huang.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Evelyn Yu in Shanghai at yyu263@bloomberg.net;Jun Luo in Shanghai at jluo6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Charlie ZhuFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Chinese Wealth Manager Claims $490 Million Fraud Behind Missed Repayments
2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- China Creation Ventures, an investment outfit founded by former Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Zhou Wei, is seeking to raise about $250 million in funding, according to people familiar with the matter.CCV, which was founded in 2017, is planning to raise a second U.S.-dollar fund to focus on early-stage Chinese startups, the people said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private. Yu Yi, a spokeswoman for CCV, declined to comment in a text statement.Zhou counts e-commerce giant JD.com Inc., online podcast and radio service Ximalaya and internet finance platform Creditease among his investments. His venture capital firm, founded together with a team of former KPCB portfolio managers, is mustering more ammunition at a time Chinese startups have struggled to attract backing.Chinese capital-raising is slowing after a five-year surge in VC activity, in part because risk-averse institutions gravitate toward top-tier investment targets while an escalating trade war depresses the world’s No. 2 economy. The value of investments in the country tumbled 77% to $9.4 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to market research firm Preqin.CCV has deployed about-two thirds of its first U.S. dollar fund, which pooled about $200 million. About 90% of those deals were series A investments -- typically the first significant round of venture capital funding -- where it held a board seat, according to a company statement. The firm also operates a 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million) local-currency fund, giving it a total of roughly $400 million of assets under management. With a focus on China and Southeast Asia, CCV has four portfolio companies that are seeking a public offering before the end of 2020, the company said.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Former Kleiner Partner Is Said to Seek $250 Million in Funding
2019-07-09,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the so-called Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China, always generates investor scrutiny. That's especially true at this juncture. After a meteoric rise in 2017 when Alibaba stock finally justified its premium, we're now at an impasse.Source: Shutterstock On one hand, the BABA stock price at nearly $169 represents a 23% swing from the beginning of this year. This is an impressive tally, considering that the 380-stock exchange-traded fund iShares MSCI China ETF (NYSEARCA:MCHI) is up less than 12% during the same period. Also, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) has gained almost 19% in 2019.But on the other hand, Alibaba stock is almost dead-even with 2018's opening price. In other words, shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant haven't moved for over a year-and-a-half. Obviously, that's not the type of performance you want to see if you're a China bull.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor comparison sake, Amazon shares are up almost 27% YTD. Extended that period to the January 2018 opener and AMZN shows a 59% increase.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Will BABA stock match or even exceed this track record? Or will stakeholders regret holding on too tightly? Here are three pros and three cons to consider: Pro: Trade War Truce Potentially Benefits Alibaba StockUnless you've been living under a rock, you know that the U.S.-China trade war has weighed heavily on global markets. What appeared as a rapprochement between the top-two economies of the world last year deteriorated into a war of words.However, the recent G20 summit in Japan provided an opportunity for both sides to lay the groundwork for a deal. It was a highly anticipated and tense moment for President Donald Trump and his counterpart President Xi Jinping. Though the two administrations didn't disclose many substantive details, we at least have one critical agreement: both nations will delay escalating tariffs.Unsurprisingly, the BABA stock price responded positively to the developments. Since the beginning of June, shares gained more than 16%. This contrasts sharply with the month of May, when tensions flared and Alibaba shares hemorrhaged 21%.The implication is clear: strong U.S.-China relations equal a healthy Alibaba stock. Pro: Regulations? What Regulations?Invariably, whenever a discussion about Chinese stocks stirs, you'll eventually come across their government's notorious control mechanisms. Let's face it: China has an infamous record for censorship and for cracking down on elements their administration finds disagreeable. Under that environment, you might worry about the longer-term trajectory of the BABA stock price.However, for Alibaba and other Chinese consumer-tech firms, like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), China offers a more agreeable marketplace. That's because so far, neither the Chinese government nor the general public have shown qualms about their push for products and services featuring artificial intelligence. For instance, facial recognition programs raise concerns about online privacy.These issues stymie American tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). In comparison, Chinese companies have free reign to explore their innovations. Logically, this dynamic has favorable implications for Alibaba stock. Pro: BABA Stock Receives Flagship SupportOne of the things you should understand about Chinese stocks is that this segment is very political. Whereas American companies are largely driven by the profit motive, Chinese blue chips represent both profiteering and patriotism.What do I mean by this? China has very ambitious goals, such as their &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; initiative. If you keep up on geopolitical news, you'll realize that they're not satisfied with merely being big. They want to be the biggest and the baddest, essentially replacing the U.S. from its tech leadership role.This is the reason why the trade war is so heated. We're not just fighting for the here and now. Instead, we're looking decades down the road. As such, you can expect BABA stock to receive maximum support from the Chinese government. Con: Truce Is a &quot;Show Me&quot; NarrativeAlibaba stock may have popped following the G20 summit. Since then, however, shares have not impressed, moving sideways as if seeking more substantive news. I'm not surprised one bit.Quickly, the much-covered trade war truce transitioned into a &quot;show me&quot; narrative, and I can't blame the markets for it. Too many times, we've seen head-fakes in this arena. Late-last year, the global investment community anticipated an eventual trade deal. Instead, we got fiery social media posts from the executive office.Therefore, absent an actual deal, a cloud will hang over the BABA stock price. Because at any point, this unsteady relationship could rapidly soar. And if it does, we've already witnessed how much things can deteriorate. Con: U.S. Has a Credibility CrisisUnderstandably, many equity bulls have held out hope that the U.S. will eventually sign a lasting trade deal with China. Because we live in a globalized economy, we can't afford to think, let alone operate in isolation. And despite rhetoric to the contrary, the uncomfortable truth is that the U.S. and China need each other for growth.That said, the bear case against a trade deal is also very strong. The biggest problem affecting investments like Alibaba stock is that the U.S. has a credibility crisis. Currently, we have a worsening relationship with an increasingly belligerent Russia. We have potential flash-points in North Korea and Iran, despite the Trump administration exercising diplomatic caution. On top of that, our allies generally regard us as unstable.Under that context, President Trump can't afford to show weakness with China. Moreover, the U.S. must keep the Chinese government accountable for their unethical business practices and intellectual property theft. Otherwise, it signals to everyone else that it's open season on the U.S.But obviously, don't expect China to play nice on this issue. Con: Chinese Consumer Market Probably Worse Than You ThinkOne of the biggest headwinds facing Chinese stocks is that you don't really know what you're getting. China has always played fast and loose with their economic figures. Subsequently, more than a few analysts have raised questions about Alibaba's accounting practices.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Even BABA stock isn't what you think it is. As InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy and many others have brought up, BABA is actually a share in a Cayman Islands-based holding company. Generally speaking, though, stakeholders have ignored these warning signs because the China narrative is so remarkable.That could change in the coming years, and maybe a lot sooner than some experts anticipate. Early this year, The New York Times reported that Chinese consumer sentiment slipped noticeably. I really doubt that things changed in half a year: due to China owning the more dependent economy, this prolonged trade war hurts them more than it hurts us. Bottom Line on BABA StockI can appreciate why so many bulls love BABA stock. Essentially, China owns the world's largest market for anything of importance. To win in business means you must win in China. Naturally, Alibaba benefits from home-field advantage.However, the trade war represents a paradigm shift in how the U.S. and others approach this Asian juggernaut. In many ways, President Trump exposed the dirty underpinnings of Alibaba stock. And that's why I think investors should cool off on shares until at least the geopolitical headwind is gone.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Ride-hailing giant Go-Jek has secured an investment from Siam Commercial Bank Pcl, the Thai lender that counts King Maha Vajiralongkorn as its biggest shareholder, according to people familiar with the matter.It’s unclear how much Thailand’s biggest bank is investing in Go-Jek, the people said, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Their partnership will help Indonesia’s most valuable technology startup bolster its financial services, while Siam Commercial is counting on online growth to help increase revenue, they added.Southeast Asia’s banks are increasingly teaming up with technology firms that are getting onto their turf, offering financial services from digital payments to consumer loans. Thailand’s Kasikornbank Pcl has invested $50 million in Go-Jek’s rival, Grab, and the pair intend to establish a co-branded mobile wallet.Established over a century ago by royal charter, Siam Commercial Bank is Thailand’s oldest homegrown lender. It’s the latest to join Go-Jek’s ongoing series-F round, a term denoting late-stage financing.The startup has already raised over $1 billion as of the round’s first close, Bloomberg reported in February. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. invested alongside Provident Capital. This week, Go-Jek announced additional investment from Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. as part of the series F financing.Go-Jek, which debuted its app for hailing motorbike taxis in Jakarta in 2015, is expanding beyond Indonesia to cater to consumers across Southeast Asia, aiming to popularize an all-purpose consumer app similar to Tencent’s WeChat in China. It is valued at $10 billion according to CB Insights, and hosts more than 20 on-demand services on its platform from food delivery to cab-hailing.Representatives of the bank and Go-Jek declined to comment.To contact the reporters on this story: Yoolim Lee in Singapore at yoolim@bloomberg.net;Anuchit Nguyen in Bangkok at anguyen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Divya Balji at dbalji1@bloomberg.net, ;Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Go-Jek Snags Investment From Thailand's Largest Lender
2019-07-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Before being detained by police in Shanghai, Lo Ching was lauded as the new-age Hua Mulan, the legendary female Chinese warrior. Now the downfall of Lo, chairman of a Hong Kong-listed conglomerate, has become a parable of the dangers of investing in China. Noah Holdings Ltd., one of China’s largest wealth managers catering to high-net-worth individuals, is among the first to find out. The U.S.-listed asset manager has filed a lawsuit against Camsing International Holding Ltd. related to a 3.4 billion yuan ($490 million) credit product in danger of default, according to a filing this week.  The word default, itself, isn’t so scary. After all, evaluating the risk that an obligation won’t be paid is what credit investors do every day. Nor is Camsing’s credit product all that unusual: The underlying assets are account receivables the company expects from China’s top-tier retailers, JD.com Inc. and Suning.com Co.Formal financing channels – such as bank loans, corporate bonds or exchange-traded asset-backed securities – aren’t readily available to smaller private enterprises in China. So while the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. can regularly issue account receivables-backed securities, small businesses often use their working capital as collateral for loans from asset managers. In the case of Camsing, Lo pledged her 62% stake in the company to Noah. The worrying part about all this is whether any money can be clawed back. JD.com and Suning said they don’t owe Noah the 3.4 billion yuan: “Camsing falsified JD.com’s business contracts,” a JD.com spokeswoman told Bloomberg News. Camsing held 5.7 billion yuan in account receivables, 74.4% from Suning and 23.2% from JD.com at the end of 2018, Caixin reported, citing Camsing financial documents the financial news site said it had seen.As for those shares Lo pledged, they’re hardly worth anything now. Camsing’s stock crashed 80.4% on Monday after news of Lo’s detainment broke. That 62% stake is worth just HK$340 million ($43.5 million) now.Noah can file as many lawsuits as it wants; the truth is its path to recovery doesn’t look good. Data on these types of shadow-credit products are slim, but reviewing defaults of exchange-traded corporate bonds, China Inc. has a lousy track record. Among the 128 issuers that have defaulted on their bond obligations since 2014, only 28 have paid back investors in full. Of the total 216 billion yuan in missed bond payments, only 31 billion yuan, or 14.5%, has been repaid, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Private enterprises are the worst offenders. Of the 17 state-owned enterprises that have defaulted, 41% have paid investors back,  according to HSBC. By comparison, just 19% of the 111 private business that defaulted repaid creditors.As I argued last week, when it comes to private businesses, no one will come to rescue lenders and minority shareholders if things go sour. While cash-strapped local governments rarely pump their fiscal dollars into failing state enterprises these days, none of them wants to see a local champion fail. Somehow municipalities will wring money from bailout funds, strategic investors or even local banks to save struggling businesses. I’d love to laud the animal spirits of China’s private enterprises, but recent waves of corporate-governance scandals – from missing cash to potentially falsified business documents – are scaring investors. If you’re into stocks, by all means go with your heart. If you’re a credit investor, use your head instead.To contact the author of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2019-07-11,"Since reaching nearly $200 in early May, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock has come under pressure. But over the past few weeks, Alibaba stock has seen notable improvement.Source: Shutterstock The reason: There was a relaxation of tensions in the trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump agreed to hold off on any new tariffs and he loosened restrictions on selling technology to Chinese powerhouse, Huawei.So there was good reason for a rally. In fact, for the year so far, the BABA stock price has risen about 24%. This is actually in-line with the kinds of returns for the past few years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut of course, the main question now is: What's in store for Alibaba stock going forward? Well, besides the improvement with the trade situation, there are other major catalysts that should help with BABA stock. So let's take a look at three: China Ecommerce PowerhouseAs seen with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the U.S., the dominance of the ecommerce market is a mega advantage. It allows for the collection of massive amounts of data and provides a platform for launching new services.  * 7 of The Best Schwab ETFs for Low Fees And yes, when it comes to BABA, the company is essentially the Amazon of China … but with a much more profitable model. The company operates a high-margin digital marketplace that connects buyers and sellers.Keep in mind that the scale is enormous, dwarfing the U.S. market. BABA has 721 million mobile monthly active users (MAUs), up 104 million on a year-over-year basis.To get a sense of how large the opportunity, here's what BABA Executive Vice Chairman, Joseph Tsai, said during the fourth-quarter earnings call: &quot;The middle class in China has reached critical mass of over 300 million, almost as large as the entire U.S. population. The middle class will double in the next 10 years, especially from the lesser developed Chinese cities. While total Chinese domestic consumption is $5.5 trillion today, consumption from these third-, fourth-, and fifth-tier cities, with a combined population of 500 million people, will triple from $2.3 trillion to nearly $7 trillion in the next 10 years.&quot;The company has also been aggressive in building on-demand services, such as for food delivery. Part of the strategy has been to partner with companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Such efforts will certainly be a big help in providing more convenience and stronger connections with customers. Cloud And AIAgain, BABA has borrowed from the Amazon playbook by making an aggressive move into the cloud industry. This may actually turn out to be the biggest growth driver. In fact, BABA's cloud business is already the largest not only in China, but the whole Asia Pacific region.During the latest quarter, revenues in the segment spiked by 76% to $1.15 billion. To keep up the growth, BABA has been rapidly innovating the cloud platform by adding new services for blockchain, cybersecurity, database systems and AI.Note that BABA has also been leveraging these technologies across its own properties. For example, Tmall Genie is an AI-powered smart speaker. Then there is the Amap app, which is China's largest mobile provider of mapping, navigation and traffic information. Financials And ValuationThe valuation on BABA stock is fairly reasonable. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is 19X. By comparison, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) trades at 29X - and is growing at a much slower pace. For example, BABA reported revenues that jumped a sizzling 51% to $13.9 billion during the latest quarter.And with the resources, BABA has been making smart investments. Perhaps the most significant is Alipay, which has become one of the largest payment networks in China along with Tencent's (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) WeChat.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Tiger Global Management has examined at least a dozen deals with Indian startups in recent months, according to multiple people with knowledge of the talks, illustrating global investors’ fierce interest in the country’s technology ecosystem.The ultra-secretive New York-based hedge fund has closed investments in at least half of these startups -- nearly all of them in fintech or enterprise software segments. Hedge funds, venture capital firms, and the likes of South Africa-headquartered internet group Naspers Ltd. are also chasing India’s rapidly growing consumer internet and enterprise software firms.The rising interest in India occurs as investment in China’s recently booming startup sector faces a steep drop-off. It’s a radical progression from just a few years ago when global investors worried about the prospects for India. Fewer smartphones and expensive wireless-data plans restricted internet access to a tiny user pool in a country of 1.3 billion people, pushing investors to chase the handful of entrepreneurs building consumer internet startups. Now cheap Chinese smartphones and inexpensive data rates offered by the aggressive telecom giant Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and its rivals are luring millions of users online every month.There’s buoyancy also because India’s recent decisive election assured political stability, said venture capitalist Vani Kola, managing director at Kalaari Capital Advisors Pvt, prompting international funds to get back in the investment game. “Investors like Tiger Global are enthused that the market is stable and has reached a certain maturity,” she said. “There’s confidence in the depth of the market.”This year is already being dubbed Tiger Global India redux by some. The influential investor is renowned for its early bets on high-profile Indian consumer internet startups like Ola, and its triumphant exit last year from most-valuable Indian startup Flipkart, which netted a $3 billion return. In the first half of 2019, Tiger has already funded 13 Indian companies, according to researcher Tracxn Technologies Pvt, compared with 8 investments in 2018 and 6 the year before.The spigot remains open, according to the people, who didn’t want to be named as the deal signings are ongoing. On Thursday, supply chain software developer Moglix became the latest investment when the startup announced it had closed a $60 million financing round led by Tiger.Tiger’s new focus on enterprise software services coincides with management changes. Lee Fixel, the 39-year-old co-head of private equity for the technology-focused fund, recently departed the firm and Scott Shleifer, a partner, took over the portfolio. Schleifer, 41, best known for turning a $200 million investment in Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com Inc. into a $5 billion return, went on a whirlwind trip to India recently to meet entrepreneurs.The newest bets by the deep-pocketed hedge fund are mostly in the sub-$50 million range. They include logistics-management startup Locus, agritech provider Ninjacart, expense-management software provider Fyle, and Zenoti. All are spearheaded by Schleifer, the people said.India’s historical strength in IT services is also spawning thousands of software-as-a-service and business-to-business companies, a natural evolution given the expertise of the labor pool.“Investors are excited to see India’s transition from an IT services powerhouse to a rising B2B solutions hub,” said Sudheer Koneru, founder and chief executive officer of Zenoti, where Schleifer led a round of funding last month. Services can be virtually served on the cloud to customers anywhere in the world, making it viable to build SaaS startups in low-cost India.“Not just Tiger -- other global investors too are waking up to the exciting surge of B2B startups coming out of India,” said Koneru.Koneru’s Zenoti provides business and customer management and software services to beauty and wellness businesses, including spas, salons and gyms. Its 340 workers in the southern city of Hyderabad engineer the product, generate leads, and offer tech support to customers. After initially serving Indian businesses, nearly two thirds of Zenoti’s customers are in the U.S., and it’s doubling revenues year-on-year.Investments in Indian startups from other global names have also gathered pace in recent months. SoftBank Group Corp. and its Vision Fund, for instance, have invested in logistics provider Delhivery, and in Ola earlier this year, converting both into unicorns. India’s leading fintech startups are also in fund-raising mode.“Investors are finally seeing numbers, and the market is looking very very viable,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of researcher Tracxn.(Updates with latest deal announced in the sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, ;Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Tiger Global Fuels India Startup Boom With Dealmaking Spree

2019-07-15,"The battle for market share in China's ecommerce arena is over. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) won. There's no reason for JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) shareholders decide to dump their JD stock, though. Alibaba isn't as well-positioned to dominate the next chapter of eastern Asia's maturing online-shopping industry; JD.com is the name to own on that front.Source: Shutterstock The next chapter is distinctly different from the previous one. Alibaba was largely in the right place at the right time, stealing a few pages from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook at a time when China's outlying areas were first accessing broadband, and smartphones were becoming the norm. JD arrived a little too late to that party.With the country's ecommerce market now relatively well saturated, the next chapter is one that will sell omnichannel and brick-and-mortar retailing support as a service in and of itself. That's something JD has been doing for a while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  Logistics and JD StockIt was laying the groundwork for the marketable service long before logistics became a revenue-bearing product.As far back as 2014, JD had already established more than 80 warehouses, more than 1,600 delivery stations and more than 200 pickup sites in almost 500 Chinese cities. Same-day delivery was readily possible in most locales, and where it wasn't easy, the nascent ecommerce outfit partnered with local convenience stores.It was a network that would serve as the framework for something much bigger, however.In early 2017, with deliveries and online-selling mostly mastered, JD partnered with Zebra to address the inevitable future of retail. The creation of the IoT + E-commerce Logistics Lab set the stage for higher-level things like data gathering and machine vision that would further obscure any seams between the steps taken between a consumer's purchase and final delivery.The logistics-as-a-service unit had become so well gelled, in fact, that in early 2017 JD.com spun it off as a stand-alone entity, though it didn't stop development there. By last year, JD opened up its logistics network to third-party consumers and businesses, handling goods that weren't directly sold to buyers out of JD's inventory.Although it's a separate entity, there's no disguising that JD Logistics largely exists to support JD.Com. The ecommerce site still owns more than 80% of JD Logistics, which just raised more than $200 million to invest in other logistics companies and related technologies.JD is offering solutions to China's consumer-oriented companies -- and small players in particular -- that Alibaba isn't at a time when e-commerce spending (and offline spending) growth is slowing down. The Alibaba Threat and JD StockThat's not to suggest Alibaba isn't developing marketable solutions of its own as the market's e-commerce industry marches toward its peak.Case in point: In late 2017, Alibaba began work that would allow China's six million small stores to plug into the power of cloud computing.The platform, called Retail Integrated, was designed to help mom-and-pop shops streamline inventory purchasing and improve sales. The service was free, as long as users let Alibaba use those stores as shipping dropoff and delivery points, and store owners were willing to share valuable customer data.By 2018, the e-commerce behemoth was using much of that technology to make its own grocery store chain, Hema, a state-of-the-art experience. The use of QR codes on a product's label not only serves as a means of providing more information, but it's also how consumers can select and pay for goods while they shop using nothing but their smartphones.The technology even allows Hema stores to map out the typical path shoppers take through the aisles, identifying less-visited and more visited areas.Alibaba's retail tech has its fans and users to be sure, but adoption has been modest. The solution is for a problem most of China's small shops aren't convinced they have. What they really need is logistics solutions and foot traffic coming into their stores to begin with.That's what JD.Com and JD Logistics are offering. Looking Ahead for JD StockInvestors should absolutely keep things in perspective.JD stock may have an edge right now with a much better-developed and more thoughtful logistics solutions, but Alibaba is still Alibaba. It can buy what it's not yet developed. To that end, in March it invested nearly $700 million in China's delivery and logistics outfit STO Express. It's not done anything to alter STO's operation, but there's a reason it wants a seat at the table.JD isn't merely coasting on its past developments though. JD Logistics continues to work in a way that maintains its lead on the logistics front. That, at least indirectly, supports JD.com's ecommerce ambitions.It's also a huge, even if overlooked, undertow that could let JD stock outperform most other names on China's e-commerce landscape for the long haul.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-15,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed down last Thursday slipping 0.83% on the day. But for a short time that morning, Amazon stock continued its July rally and passed the $2035 mark.Source: Shutterstock That milestone put it in the rarified company of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a trillion dollar company -- a position Amazon has not been in since last September.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Here's why AMZN stock has been on the rise this month, and why there could be clouds on the horizon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Anticipation Over Prime Day is Boosting Amazon StockPrime Day is on July 15 and 16 this year. So that's two days, but like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and its yearly 6.18 anniversary sale (which actually runs for several weeks) AMZN isn't known for being a stickler on nomenclature.However, one thing is certain and investors know it: Prime Day is huge for Amazon. It's the company's largest shopping event, surpassing Cyber Monday and Black Friday.The company suffered a black eye last year when its website repeatedly glitched for several hours, but despite technical issues, the sale was a huge success. AMZN reported selling more than 100 million products worldwide during the Prime Day event. Sales were up 89% over the previous year in the first 12 hours -- despite issues with its website during that time. Amazon doesn't release dollar figures, but it was estimated that last year's Prime Day brought in $4.19 billion in worldwide sales. That's a huge number, and up 60% over the $2.41 billion from the previous year's event. To put it all in perspective, the first Prime Day (in 2015) brought in an estimated $900 million in sales.With those kind of numbers, you can see why Amazon stock had been on a run in July, gaining nearly 5% since the start of the month, before slipping on Thursday. Also Helping AMZN? The Trade War's Limited ImpactAMZN stock -- like many other tech stocks -- had also been impacted by concerns over the trade war between the U.S. and China. The threat of increased tariffs on Chinese good sold in the U.S., and the potential for retaliatory measures was bad news for Amazon. A trade war could impact the economy globally, and cut consumer spending. In addition, tariffs make products more expensive which means consumers may buy less. Both scenarios are tough on retailers, and despite its size AMZN is not immune.Fear that the situation was escalating hit AMZN stock hard in May, but as rhetoric cooled and consumers kept buying, Amazon stock recovered. Its latest rally took it to a new high for 2019 and Amazon's market cap briefly hit the $1 trillion mark. Storm Clouds on the Horizon for Amazon StockThis week is critical for Amazon, with Prime Day falling on the 15th and 16th. However, there's another big event involving AMZN that may be a little less pleasant for the company and its investors. On July 16, Amazon and other FAANG tech companies will be appearing before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. In AMZN's case, the company's grip on e-commerce will be under particular scrutiny.Should investors worry that the government's interest in the company could result in measures that torpedo Amazon stock? Analysts at Wedbush believe the investigations won't result in actual intervention any time soon, and the long-term impact on Amazon and AMZN stock may be less than feared.&quot;These hearings and potential DOJ probes can represent an overhang and risk to the FAANG group, but we would encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals in the near-term as any probe would take years to complete as we witnessed firsthand with Microsoft, which proved to be more noise than a structural jolt to its business model.&quot; In other words, stay calm and enjoy what is expected to be another record-setting Prime Day.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"Though Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) was founded and grounded on an industrial revolution that drew hordes of people from rural China to its major cities, most owners of Alibaba stock know the company's future growth lies outside of those urban areas. Outlying second-tier cities and even minor villages are finally catching up with their more metropolitan peers, particularly in terms of communication.Source: Shutterstock What's the great irony -- and potential problem -- in that paradigm shift? A shrinking rural population. The China National Bureau of Statistics reported earlier this year that the country's rural areas saw 13 million people leave for more opportunity in 2018. Many of those leaving were among the most promising income-earners that could find more rewarding employment elsewhere, taking their discretionary income with them when they left.Now, with China's economic growth falling to a 27-year low as of June, the already-imbalanced trickle-down upside of the nation's new economic engine is further jeopardized. A shrinking population, particularly among working aged people, only exacerbates the concern.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a paradigm that calls into question just how much growth Alibaba can truly expect to find in China's more remote areas. It's a paradigm that also quietly weighs on the BABA stock price, even if most owners of Alibaba stock don't fully realize it the full scope of the brewing storm.There's a narrow pathway starting to appear through the distant fog, however. China's Big Cities Attract Rural WorkersIt's not a challenge its U.S. rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) ever had to contend with, though for the record, Alibaba rivals like JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) and Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN) are largely in the same boat.That is, China is a huge country, and for as much work that's been done to improve incomes outside of its biggest cities, its rural population continues to shrink after being eclipsed by metropolitan populations back in 2011. Those urbanites take their discretionary incomes with them, dragging down rural economic activity faster than redistribution efforts can boost them. The undertow takes some of the strategic shine off of Alibaba's plans.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy China's lopsided economic revolution, however, may be on the verge of another tidal shift that once again works in favor of Alibaba stock. Urbanites are now moving back to more rural areas, taking jobs and discretionary incomes with them. China's Digital Economy 2.0On balance, China's biggest cities are still gaining workers at rural areas' expense. The trend is abating though. Last year, seven million people shed their yuppie status to return to rural areas. Almost two-thirds of that group did so to work on China's farms.Things have changed dramatically, even if unevenly, on China's pastoral landscapes. Though still rustic in some spots by most anyone's standard, the government's support via subsidies, the establishment of wireless telecom and internet service and the improvement of basic utilities are all improving the case for foregoing city life.The so-called reverse migration also has an element that will feel familiar to U.S. investors and inhabitants as well, however. The new rural population is doing business in a way their parents wouldn't have, and largely still can't.Case in point? Farmer Xu Pengfei and his business partner, an online-video celebrity of sorts who goes by the name Handsome, are promoting their produce grown in northern China's Yujin village. The videos are filmed with an iPhone, selling fruits and vegetables to consumers nowhere near their farm. Government reports suggests that half of all the people leaving China's cities are engaged in some sort of e-commerce, which transcends the physical limitations of distance.It's making a difference too, as these migrants are finding their incomes ultimately improve when they become rural entrepreneurs.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond &quot;[Returning migrants] have become a major driving force in closing the gap between Chinese cities and villages, and between the coast and inland,&quot; explains Cui Chuanyi, with Beijing's Development Research Centre of the State Council. Cui concludes &quot;Much of China's future growth lies in these less-developed regions,&quot; jibing with a message Alibaba stock owners have been hearing for a while now.Those wealthier entrepreneurs also make for stronger consumers, but most noteworthy is the fact that Handsome's and Pengfei's preferred platform for selling produce online is Taobao, owned by Alibaba. Looking Ahead for Alibaba StockIt's not a reason in and of itself to step into BABA stock. It's a secular shift that could take years to play out. Much could change in the meantime, and not all would-be entrepreneurs have found moving out of the city is a recipe for fortune. Indeed, urban populations are still growing, and rural populations continue to shrink.On the other hand, even with a number of potential pitfalls still looming ahead for the e-commerce giant's rural focus -- like market saturation and logistical hurdles -- there's certainly argument to steer clear of Alibaba stock. As Barron's confirmed on Sunday about the company's rural ambitions, &quot;Alibaba is growing fast there.&quot;As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"Last  year was tough for the shares of Chinese e-commerce juggernaut JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD). JD stock tumbled from its $50 highs in early 2018 to its $20 lows in late 2018, as everything that could've gone wrong for JD did go wrong.Source: Shutterstock The growth of China's economy slumped to multi-year lows in 2018. The trade war between the U.S. and China  heated up, putting further downward pressure on China's economy. Chinese consumers lost confidence. That weighed on JD's revenue growth rates, which , like China's economy, slumped to multi-year lows. The company's margins came under pressure as JD continued to invest in next-generation opportunities.  * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace JD's profit was flat in 2018, and JD stock lost more than half of its value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the company's performance has been very different in 2019. China's  consumer and services sectors  have picked up steam. The U.S.-China trade war has cooled. Chinese consumers are regaining their confidence. JD's revenue growth rates are stabilizing. Its margins have started expanding again.As a result of these trends,  JD's profit growth has accelerated in 2019, and JD stock has risen an impressive 47%.This renewed strength of  JD stock price will persist for two major reasons. First, China's consumer economy in general and its  digital consumer economy in particular are showing signs of improving, at the same time that JD's margins are rebounding. Second, JD.com stock remains undervalued relative to its long-term growth potential.This coupling of a favorable valuation and improving operational trends should keep JD stock price on a wnining path for the foreseeable future. The Trends Are Now in Favor of JD StockIn 2018, the trends were moving against JD.com stock.Specifically, China's retail sales growth slowed from 10.2% in 2017, to 9% in 2018, while the proportion of physical consumer products bought online fell from 28% in 2017 to 25.4% in 2018. This online retail slowdown caused JD's revenue growth to drop. The company's revenue growth rate went from over 40% in 2017 to under 30% in 2018. At the same time, JD was investing  a large amount of money in next-generation growth opportunities, and its operating margins sank 50% in 2018.In 2019, however, the trends have shifted, and they are now working in favor of JD stock.China's retail sales climbed 8.4% year-over-year in the first half of 2019. While that's slower than 2018's 9% growth rate, things are improving for JD stock in 2019. In the first half of 2019, retail sales growth (8.4%) was greater than first-quarter retail sales growth (8.3%), retail sales growth in June surged to its highest level since March 2018, and online retail sales growth in the first half of 2019 (21.6%) was higher than Q1's online retail sales growth (21%).Broadly, then, China's consumer economy is showing signs of rebounding.Additionally, JD's revenue growth rates are stabilizing in the 20% range, and JD's margins are bouncing back as the impact of its growth investments fades (its operating margins have risen by 0.7 -plus percentage points in each of the past two quarters).All in all, the things which whacked JD stock in 2018 (a slowing consumer economy, falling growth rates, and compressing margins) have reversed course in 2019. JD Stock Remains Undervalued in the Big PictureIn the big picture, JD stock remains undervalued relative to JD's long-term growth potential.According to eMarketer, China's online retail market will continue to grow at a robust  annual rate of 15%-plus for the next several years. That makes sense. It's growing at a 20%-plus rate today, and China has a lot of people, the majority of whom are rapidly urbanizing and digitizing. This non-cyclical demographic trend should spur strong growth throughout China's online retail market for the foreseeable future.JD is one of the two biggest players in that market. The platform is already so big - and so embedded into China's consumer economy - that it's tough to see it being unseated anytime soon. As a result, as China's online retail market grows at a 15%-plus pace over the next several years, JD's revenues should increase at a similar rate.Alongside that healthy revenue growth, JD's margins should expand as it grows. Companies with large retail operations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  have operating margins of around 4-5%. JD should be able to reach that point over time. Thus, by 2025, it's reasonable to predict that JD's operating margins will rise towards 4%.As a result, it's clear that JD's earnings per share can rise towards $3 by 2025. Based on a  20-times forward multiple, which is average for the consumer discretionary sector, the 2024 price target for JD stock would be $60. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $37.JD stock presently trades at just a hair under $31. The Bottom Line on JD Stock2018 was an awful year for JD stock. But 2019 is turning out to be a great one. Already up 47% year-to-date, JD stock price looks ready to run even higher into the end of the year.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD, AMZN, and WMT.

2019-07-22,"(Bloomberg) -- aCommerce, a Bangkok-based startup that helps brands such as Samsung, L’Oreal and Unilever sell their products online across Southeast Asia, has raised more than $10 million from existing investors including KKR & Co.KKR’s Emerald Media, investment house Blue Sky, DKSH Holding AG and an arm of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas also took part in the company’s latest funding round, intended to drive the startup’s expansion and help it reach profitability by early 2020. That in turn paves the way for an initial public offering in two to three years, Chief Executive Officer Paul Srivorakul said. The six-year-old firm plans to raise another $5 million by the end of this year as part of an extended Series B or early-stage funding round, he added.“We have the ambitions for an IPO so it’s really important that we grow a healthy, valuable business,” Srivorakul said in an interview.aCommerce is trying to set itself apart from other online retail startups that focus on growth over the bottom line. Rather than go head-to-head against Chinese giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and JD.com Inc., which have made inroads into the region in recent years, the Thai outfit concentrates on supporting brands keen on expanding their own online sales.aCommerce makes money by providing services from distribution and marketing to warehousing and delivery.

2019-07-22,"Second-quarter earnings season is upon us. The broad outlook from Wall Street is not a rosy one. For the second quarter in a row, analysts are expecting the S&P 500 to report a year-over-year earnings decline. For comparison purposes, in the year ago quarter, S&P 500 earnings rose 25% year-over-year.Although Q2 earnings are expected to be bad, it is important to note that Wall Street analysts have a history of underestimating EPS. For example, last quarter, analysts thought the S&P 500 EPS was going to drop 4% year-over-year. But Q1 earnings only dropped 0.3% year-over-year. This is nothing new. Over the past five years, reported S&P 500 earnings have exceed estimated S&P 500 earnings by 4.8%, on average, while the projected EPS growth rate heading into a quarter has historically been 3.7 percentage points below the actual EPS growth rate in that quarter.If we extrapolate that trend out, then Q2 earnings will actually rise by about a percent. Importantly, that represents sequential acceleration form last quarter's down 0.3% growth rate. Such sequential acceleration implies that corporate earnings may have bottomed, and that going forward, earnings will start growing at a healthy pace again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom this perspective, Q2 earnings could provide a big catalyst for the market. If earnings do come in ahead of expectations and actually grow year-over-year, then the stock market will rally as investors take that as evidence that the mini-earnings draw-down of early 2019 is over.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio With this in mind, let's take a look at seven stocks to buy with the potential to lead an earnings rally this summer. Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: July 24The Thesis: One stock that looks due for a blockbuster summer earnings report and big subsequent rally is digital ad giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook has spent most of 2019 putting its 2018 user privacy headaches behind it. The Q2 earnings report should cement that those headwinds are in the rear-view mirror.Global online ad spend trends in 2019 have been favorable. Facebook Stories usage has been on the up and up, while Instagram has seen an influx of new advertising opportunities, as has Messenger. Thus, Facebook's user and revenue numbers should be good this quarter. The margin numbers should be good, too, as the lap gets easier. Further, Facebook management will be able to update investors on its new commerce initiatives, and bullish sentiment there could spark a rally.All in all, it increasingly looks like the big 2019 rally in FB stock is set to take another leg higher this summer, making the social media giant a stock to buy. Crocs (CROX)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: August 6 (estimate)The Thesis: Ugly is the new cool, and because of that, &quot;ugly&quot; footwear brand Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) has staged a huge operational turnaround over the past several years. But that turnaround hit a snag in the first quarter of 2019 as Crox ran into some demand and margin headwinds. Investors implied from this that the best of the CROX turnaround story had already materialized, and CROX stock subsequently dropped off a cliff.But the best of this rebound narrative hasn't materialized. Instead, most data points suggest that the Crocs brand is only gaining momentum. Piper Jaffray's survey of young consumers found that Crocs has one of the fastest growing mind-shares in the entire footwear category, while both domestic and global search interest trends indicate that consumer interest surrounding Crocs is surging higher. Further, the company's recent collaboration with Vera Bradley was a huge hit.  * 10 High-Flying, Overvalued Stocks in Danger of Crashing Overall, then, it looks likely that Crocs will report very strong second quarter numbers this summer. Those strong numbers will affirm that the best of this rebound narrative isn't over just yet, and will consequently spark a nice recovery rally in CROX stock. JD.Com (JD)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: August 15 (estimate)The Thesis: Calendar 2018 was a really bad year for Chinese e-commerce juggernaut JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD). China's consumer economy cooled off, JD's revenue growth rates dropped, and the company's margins were slashed in half. In response to those adverse trends, JD stock lost more than half of its value in 2018.But all three of those trends have reversed course in 2019. China's consumer economy has picked up steam recently, especially over the past two months, during which retail sales growth has accelerated meaningfully and notched a 12-month-high in June. At the same time, JD's revenue growth rates have stabilized in the ~20% range, while operating margins have expanded by 70 basis points or more in each of the past two quarters.Because all three of these trends have reversed course, it is likely that JD puts up impressive summer 2019 numbers. Those impressive numbers should sustain the big 45% year-to-date rally in JD stock. Foot Locker (FL)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: August 24 (estimate)The Thesis: Owing largely to fears regarding trade war escalation and its impact on the company's demand and margins, footwear retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) has dropped over 20% in 2019. But the U.S. and China have declared a trade war truce, meaning conditions on the trade front won't get worse anytime soon.At the same time, Foot Locker reported strong numbers last quarter that comprised positive comparable sales growth and gross margin expansion. Nike (NYSE:NKE), who is Foot Locker's largest brand partner, just reported very strong 10% constant-currency revenue growth in its most recent quarter. Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), who doesn't sell through Foot Locker but nonetheless is an important player in the athletic apparel market, also reported strong revenue growth last quarter.  * 8 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than Amazon Broadly, then, athletic apparel adoption tailwinds remain alive and well, while trade war headwinds have been put on pause for the foreseeable future. That combination means that Foot Locker likely had good a Q2, and that management will issue a favorable guide. In response, beaten up FL stock should rally. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: July 24The Thesis: Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were hammered in early 2019 amid a global auto and EV demand slowdown which negatively impacted Tesla's first quarter delivery numbers. The consensus thesis became that the best of the Tesla growth narrative was over. In response, TSLA stock crashed.But that consensus thesis was disproved by a strong Q2 delivery report, in which Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles. TSLA stock rallied after the Q2 delivery report. But it's still well below where it was following the bad Q1 delivery report, and that's mostly because investors want to see how margins played out in Q2. Given the rampant increase in scale, it's likely that margins similarly moved higher in Q2. Thus, the Q2 earnings report should also reaffirm that Tesla's bad Q1 was an anomaly that won't repeat.If so, TSLA stock has runway to retake the $300 level this summer. It also helps that 30% of the float is short -- a historically large number, even for Tesla -- so in the event that second quarter numbers are good, TSLA stock is positioned for a huge short squeeze rally. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Reporting Date: August 7 (estimate)The Thesis: Following a record year in 2018, box office results have been sluggish through the first half of 2019. Year-to-date through June, box office sales were down over 9% relative to 2018. As the box office has been sluggish, so have shares of America's largest movie theater operator, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Year-to-date, AMC stock is down 20%.But not all hope is lost for AMC stock. Thanks to the huge success of the most recent Spider-Man movie, July box office revenues are up slightly year-over-year. This renewed box office growth will likely persist into the end of the year, given the upcoming releases of Lion King, Frozen 2, and a new Star Wars movie. At the same time, AMC's subscription movie-going program, Stubs A-List, is gaining tremendous traction.  * 5 Reasons to Buy the Dip In Netflix Stock All in all, I think AMC's next earnings report will be quite good. The trailing three month numbers might not be the best. Bu, the guide will likely be good, and management will likely talk up the success of Stubs A-List on the call. That will be enough good news to get shorts - who represent a whopping 30% of the float - to cover, and spark a big rally in AMC stock. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Shutterstock Reporting Date: August 22 (estimate)The Thesis: The story at Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is similar to the story at peer JD.Com. Calendar 2018 was a rough year, defined by slowing consumer strength, falling revenue growth rates, and compressing margins. But calendar 2019 has been very different. The Chinese consumer is starting to bounce back. Revenue growth rates at Alibaba are stabilizing. Margin expansion is coming back into the picture.As these new and favorable trends persist throughout 2019, Alibaba should report solid numbers. Those solid numbers will converge on a relatively cheap (only 26-times forward earnings, versus a five year average forward multiple of 29) and beaten-up (11% off 2019 highs) BABA stock. This convergence should result a healthy rally in Alibaba stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, CROX, JD, FL, NKE, LULU, TSLA, AMC, and BABA.

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is opening its oldest online platform to U.S. merchants, promising to help American businesses at a time U.S.-Chinese tensions are darkening the outlook for global trade.The Chinese e-commerce giant on Tuesday opened up Alibaba.com to U.S. sellers for the first time, allowing them to peddle to buyers around the world who seek merchandise to stock shelves or materials to make products. Alibaba says it now wants American producers to hawk their wares as well, eventually helping them tap a vast Chinese market. Fruit and vegetable wholesaler Robinson Fresh and Office Depot Inc. will be among the first U.S. names to join Alibaba.com.Two years after billionaire founder Jack Ma promised Donald Trump he would help create a million American jobs, Alibaba is opening up its wholesale platform to U.S. sellers who want to tap a multi-trillion dollar global procurement market. The initiative could generate new income and also goodwill for Alibaba in the U.S., particularly as Washington and Beijing spar over trade. The threat of rising tariffs is now encouraging businesses to source their merchandise and components locally, said John Caplan, president of Alibaba’s North American business-to-business effort.Rollout PlanU.S. business owners “increasingly want to find domestic producers because of trade concerns and this platform will allow them to do that,” he told Bloomberg News. He anticipates strong demand for American agricultural produce and consumer products. “Anything you put on or in your body.”Alibaba will send staff to promote the service to businesses and local chambers of commerce, and plans a September promotional event to drum up awareness, Caplan added.“The success of this program will depend on whether Alibaba can recruit a strong number of successful sellers,” said Jillian Ryan, principal analyst at researcher eMarketer. “It will ultimately determine whether Alibaba will be able go toe-to-toe with Amazon in the B2B commodity market.”The Chinese internet powerhouse is opening up Alibaba.com just as a decelerating home economy depresses the top line. The online retailer is expected to soon post its slowest quarterly revenue growth in three years.Oldest UnitUnlike its better-known consumer bazaars Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba.com was originally envisioned as a way to match foreign firms with Chinese wholesalers of everything from watches and shoes to raw textiles. Operating under the motto “global trade starts here,” Alibaba.com now connects about 150,000 mostly Chinese sellers. It had some 650,000 registered U.S.-based companies as of 2017. Those American businesses previously could only buy, not sell, via Alibaba.com.It’s the Chinese giant’s oldest business but now accounts for just a sliver of revenue, mostly through membership fees, marketing and shipping assistance.Alibaba still gets the vast majority of its revenue at home, but has taken steps to court international markets in recent years. It acquired Lazada to spearhead a foray into Southeast Asia. It’s also tweaking its main businesses: in June, it set up an English-language portal on Tmall for the first time to entice more merchants from around the world to sell to Chinese consumers.But like rival JD.com Inc., Alibaba is trying to grab a bigger slice of so-called cross-border e-commerce, particularly as affluent consumers in the world’s No. 2 economy buy more goods from abroad. That market is expected to reach 3.6 trillion yuan ($523 billion) by 2020, according to AliResearch, a unit of Alibaba.(Adds analyst comment)To contact the reporters on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.net;Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Is Opening Up to U.S. Merchants for the First Time

2019-07-23,"Long-time readers should know that I'm very skeptical of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). It's unlikely that I'll ever invest in Alibaba stock. There would have to be a massive simplification of their accounting, much more clarity on their revenue recognition practices, and the adoption of an independent board of executives before I could ever get comfortable with the Alibaba story.  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock But for today, let's take a look at the bright side. If you do believe in Alibaba's story, where's the ceiling? How high could BABA stock go once the trade war winds down and investors start buying Chinese equities again?I make the case that BABA stock could hit $200 again fairly soon. Here's why.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alibaba's Faster Revenue GrowthOne big point in Alibaba's favor recently is that they have maintained their growth rate despite the big slowdown in the Chinese economy. Most Chinese firms have shown a sharp drop-off in their business performance in recent months. Additionally, key retail sales figures in China, such as auto demand, have plummeted.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Importantly, Alibaba's closest rival, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has seen its revenue growth rate dive from 50% annually into the twenties recently. Meanwhile, Alibaba has managed to keep its revenue growth rate up at 50% per year. That's only a slight slowdown from where it was during better times. That's particularly impressive given that Alibaba is growing off a huge revenue base already.Now, the more skeptical among us might counter that it is difficult to believe Alibaba is growing revenues at 50%/year in China's dour economic climate. It gives more fuel for the swirling rumors around Alibaba's revenue recognition practices. But again, if you believe Alibaba is credible, then its performance during this economic downturn has been outstanding.If the numbers are real, it speaks to Alibaba's great diversification. With so many other businesses besides its core retail, perhaps that has allowed it shelter from the economic storm while rivals like JD have slumped. Alibaba Stock and Market AccessAnother strong point for Alibaba is that it has absolutely incredible access to the average Chinese consumer. Alibaba claims that 654 million Chinese people visited its various retail websites last year. That figure grew by 18 million last year. That's not a huge increase, but when you already reach more than half of the adults in a country, even modest growth is impressive. Furthermore, its monthly average users on mobile devices increased as well and topped 700 million.Interestingly, Alibaba may be able to turn a negative into a positive due to the trade war. The longer normal supply chains remain broken down due to trade war friction, the stronger Alibaba's position grows. That's because it has by far the most customers and best distribution in China.This makes it more desirable for America and other exporters to route their business through Alibaba given the uncertain political situation. By contrast, this would hurt smaller rivals like JD that have been building import businesses with specific overseas manufacturers that may lose interest given the trade war barrier. Trade War and Alibaba StockChina's official GDP growth figure came in at 6.2% last quarter. That's its worst readout since 1992 when the Chinese government began publishing regular GDP data. And many outside analysts suspect that the government is overstating even that slowing GDP growth number.China and the U.S. reached a truce on some tariffs earlier this summer, but a large number of tariffs remain in place. Trump has promised to put even more into effect if China and the U.S. don't reach a deal soon. Many analysts, myself included, expected the U.S. and China to reach a deal by now.But we must accept the possibility that this will drag out until next year's American election. Trump certainly seems unwilling to back down on the issue for the time being. And China may be playing to run out the clock, hoping Trump's opponent wins next November.If the trade war drags on, it would be a negative for the Alibaba stock price. But it'd be worse for most of Alibaba's U.S.-listed Chinese internet rivals. This makes BABA stock a relatively safe holding for investors fearing an extended trade slowdown. Alibaba Stock VerdictIf you believe Alibaba's accounting is credible and that the Chinese economy will pick back up soon, then you may find BABA stock interesting at this price. It certainly stands out from most of the rest of the tech world. Alibaba stock is down over the past 12 months while the NASDAQ has made new all-time highs. I wouldn't be surprised if BABA stock caught back up with its overseas tech rivals.BABA stock is also nicely positioned for the trade war worries. It's one of the less affected Chinese companies from the situation. If the trade war continues through the presidential election, it would hurt BABA stock less than most other Chinese firms.Regardless, when the two countries finally do reach a deal, BABA stock is going to soar regardless. While I have grave doubts about Alibaba's long-term merits, an attractive short-term trade could be setting up here.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JD stock.

2019-07-23,"In the pantheon of e-commerce stocks, it often feels like there are the two &quot;A's&quot;: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). While Amazon and Alibaba dominate the online shopping landscape due to their dominant perches in the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, there are plenty of other players in the e-commerce space.Source: Shutterstock Some of those companies include credible, large-cap names such as China's JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). In many ways, JD.com is the classic e-commerce company as American investors have come to know the concept. It is just a Chinese version.JD sells all sorts of things: electronics, personal care items, pet products, clothing, accessories, sports gear, fitness equipment, cars and a host of other goods that Americans usually find on Amazon, eBay and others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLike Amazon and Alibaba, JD.com operates across multiple business lines, but JD is not quite as sprawling as the other two companies. Its core competencies are JD Retail and a unit known as New Business. Fun Fundamental Facts About JDIn the lexicon of Chinese growth stocks, there are plenty of pretenders. Fortunately, JD.com stock is not one of those offenders. JD has market value of nearly $45 billion. Said another way, the Chinese company is about $11 billion larger than eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund In Amazon-esque fashion, JD operates several fulfillment centers across China and has more than 550 warehouses. Logistics is a significant piece of the e-commerce puzzle, one operators in the space know they cannot live without. Amazon knows this and has a sprawling logistics enterprise of its own, though it still has relationships with traditional cargo companies.JD appears to be taking cues from AMZN on the logistics front.Last month, JD said its &quot;logistics division has raised a 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million) fund to invest in companies and technologies specializing in logistics,&quot; according to Reuters.Up more than 40% year-to-date, JD.com stock acts like, and is, a growth stock. Trading at nearly 53x forward earnings, it is clear JD.com stock's multiples confirm the name's growth stock status.&quot;We expect that management will reinvest the cash flow from the first quarter in the second and fourth quarters' promotion seasons, which could lead to a full-year margin expansion lower than the first quarter,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;Strong second-quarter revenue guidance implies year-over-year growth of 19%-23%, driven by strong sales in April, a lower comparison in June 2018 due to a long holiday weekend and the World Cup, and more resources from the strong first quarter to reinvest in the second quarter.&quot;Morningstar has a fair value estimate of $36 on JD.com stock, slightly above the Wall Street consensus target of $34. The shares closed at $30.66 on July 22, indicating either modest upside from here or that a host of upward price target revisions are coming. Bottom Line: Paying For GrowthBased on forward price-to-earnings ratios, JD stock is about twice as expensive as Alibaba, but investors may do well to not make this an apple-to-apples comparison. While the two are the two largest online retailers in China, JD.com is looking to enter the traditional brick-and-mortar space. While Chinese consumers are also increasingly shopping online, JD views this as a necessity. In fact, JD is opening 5,000 franchised stores around China.While JD is richly valued, it is worth noting that broadly speaking, Chinese consumer discretionary stocks are not. The MSCI China Consumer Discretionary 10/50 Index has a 2019 estimated price-to-earnings ratio of just over 20x while the U.S.-focused Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index has P/E of almost 21.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-24,"JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) stock appears finally headed for a comeback. The equity plunged in 2018 as geopolitical concerns and the legal troubles of the CEO caused the stock to lose more than 60% of its value.Source: Shutterstock JD.Com is not close to the $50-plus per share highs of January 2018. However, JD stock trades close to its highest levels since its 2018 plunge. This is also the same level from where JD pulled back in April, calling into question whether it will continue to recover or remain range-bound. JD.com Will Move Higher, EventuallyLong-term, I see JD stock as a winner. While it continues to lag Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in sales, it has managed to stay ahead of Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) in the retail sector. Also, as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has in other countries, it continues to build an extensive logistics infrastructure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Most who follow JD stock are aware of its logistics advantage. However, investors should remember that short-term profits would likely come in higher if not for these infrastructure investments. For this reason, the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 29.8 probably makes it much cheaper than it appears.JD stock also looks cheap considering both the past and the predicted profit growth levels. Earnings rose by an average of 81.86% over the previous five years. Wall Street predicts similar increases, with 97.1% growth forecast for this year. Analysts also believe that this rate of increase will slow to 49.3% in fiscal 2020. However, the buy case remains intact with a forward PE under 30. Where will JD go next?That said, the short-term picture appears less clear. JD stock has risen by more than 62% since the lows of last November. It seems traders have figured out that the U.S.-China trade war has only a minimal direct effect on JD.com.However, JD.com stock has again reached an inflection point. Currently, the JD stock price stands at around $31 per share. This is approximately the price level the equity reached in early April before pulling back.If it falls from that level again, many traders will see JD stock as one stuck in a trading pattern. InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto already calls the price action a &quot;head-fake.&quot; I have to concede that geopolitics remains an ongoing worry with China. Still, the price action indicates Wall Street seems less worried about these tensions. Moreover, even if JD falls from these levels, it may only amount to a correction. JD bounced back from a late-May low of $25.52 per share. If sentiment turns, it could easily head back to that level.As for the bull case, if it can break through $31 per share, I think it could return to its 52-week high of about $37 per share. Interestingly, our own Luke Lango pegged the fair value of JD stock at $37 per share using discounted cash flows. I also think it will occur at some point. Still, until I see evidence that $31 per share is not a price ceiling, I would hold off. Concluding thoughts on JD stockBefore buying JD stock, traders need to know if the equity has placed itself on the path to recovery or has become stuck in a range. Looking at the long-term case for JD, I see little not to like. JD seems poised to maintain its position in the Chinese retail market, and its logistics infrastructure could ultimately give the company an edge over Alibaba, which primarily acts as a middleman.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 However, geopolitics and last year's arrest of the CEO sent JD stock plunging. The stock has recovered from lows, but it remains unclear whether JD will continue its recovery or trade in a range. JD.Com trades at a reasonable valuation, and its growth can easily push it higher. Still, investors should only buy when they know $31 per share is not the ceiling.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-24,The Minneapolis Police Department has released public data relating to its investigation into a rape allegation against Chinese billionaire and JD.com founder Richard Liu,Police release more details on rape allegations against founder of China’s JD.com
2019-07-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Minneapolis police have released more details on their investigation into the alleged rape of a student by Chinese internet billionaire Richard Liu, drawing attention to conflicting accounts from the parties involved.The files shed new light on a case that transfixed China. Liu, founder of giant online retailer JD.com Inc., was arrested in August last year and accused of raping a 21-year-old female Chinese undergraduate. U.S. prosecutors subsequently decided not to press charges against the billionaire, who was participating in a University of Minnesota executive program at the time.Interview transcripts show the alleged victim at one point told police she wanted money. They concluded after an investigation it was unclear if a crime had actually taken place. According to the files, a police sergeant asked the student if she wanted authorities to investigate the billionaire. “No, I want it to go away,” she was cited as saying in one transcript, adding that she wanted an apology “and money.”In April, the student, Liu Jingyao, filed a civil suit against the chief executive and JD itself, seeking monetary damages. She claimed he forcibly assaulted her in her apartment after plying her with alcohol at a dinner. After police arrived at the apartment to investigate, the JD founder allegedly tried to intimidate her in an exchange recorded on officers’ body cameras, according to the lawsuit.The rape accusations hung over JD.com’s stock in 2018, because Liu’s outsize control of voting rights closely linked the firm’s fate to his own. In China, he’s seen as a visionary founder and the driving force behind one of the country’s most successful internet companies.The billionaire was attending a doctor of business administration program in Minnesota last year when the alleged rape took place, after a dinner attended by the student and more than a dozen Chinese male executives. According to police documents, the billionaire said their sex was consensual. He said she invited him to her apartment and suggested they take a shower together, according to the documents.“The evidence released today again reaffirms our strong belief from the very beginning that Mr. Liu is innocent,” Jill Brisbois, Richard Liu’s attorney, said in a statement that JD provided.To contact the reporters on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.net;Michelle Fay Cortez in Minneapolis at mcortez@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Police Release Files on Rape Allegations Against China Billionaire

2019-07-25,"If the U.S.-China trade tug-of-war has you feeling a bit motion sick, you're not alone: plenty of investors are weary of trade-tension-driven market volatility and reluctant to take a position in a vulnerable asset like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock. Still, with Wall Street generally leaning bullish on BABA stock and expectations running high for next month's earnings report, could Alibaba shares be the perfect trading vehicle for what seems like an inevitable trade-war resolution?Source: Shutterstock  Room for Appreciation in BABA StockThe BABA stock price might seem a bit lofty, but if we take a step back and observe that it's been above $200 per share before, it's not hard to envision the shares reclaiming that level and beyond. If anything is capable of giving Alibaba stock that big push above resistance, it's the aforementioned earnings announcement, which I believe has moon-shot potential for BABA.  * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar Evidently, I'm not alone in this sentiment, as FactSet reports, the average EPS forecast for BABA is $1.50 for the quarter -- about 28% higher than the year-ago quarter. And irrespective of the actual earnings results, TipRanks calculates the average analyst price target for BABA stock as $219.73, signifying 23% upside from the current share price. (Not that I'm one to blindly follow analyst predictions, but even if Alibaba stock is halfway as successful as predicted, that would still represent a decent gain.)InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Opening the FloodgatesBesides a positive earnings surprise, what could really push BABA stock shares over the top is Alibaba's olive branch amid trade tensions: opening their business-to-business platform to U.S. companies. By permitting American merchants to engage in global B2B transactions on Alibaba's e-commerce platform for the first time, the company is not only promoting free trade, but it's also posing serious competition to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the multinational online business-to-business space.As explained in an official statement from the company, U.S. businesses will be able to sell their products wholesale on Alibaba.com:&quot;Now, the nearly 30 million small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. -- especially manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors -- can better access the $23.9 trillion global B2B e-commerce market, an opportunity that is six times larger than the global B2C e-commerce market.&quot; An Ambitious VisionI'm not saying that Jeff Bezos should be shaking in his boots, but investors should be aware that Alibaba's recent foray into the China-U.S. B2B e-commerce space is a shot fired directly at Amazon as well as top Chinese rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). In fact, inviting U.S. merchants to set up business-to-business shops could, according to Alibaba, double the number of international brands on the platform within the next three years. Right now, that number is around 20,000.So yes, Alibaba will pose a serious threat to Amazon and JD.com through this year and beyond. Indeed, one-third of Alibaba.com's B2B buyers are already based in the U.S., and many products are significantly cheaper on Alibaba's platforms when ordered in bulk, making the company's outreach to American merchants almost irresistible in some instances. The Bottom Line on Alibaba StockIs Alibaba's move into the U.S.-China online business-to-business market the manifestation of a vision of international peace and harmony? Let's not kid ourselves. It's 100% financially motivated, plain and simple… and I'm 100% okay with that.I'm more than happy to let greed and competitiveness drive Alibaba -0-and just as importantly, BABA stock -- to new heights as the trade war wends its way through another long, action-packed summer.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"When Chinese streaming company iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) had its initial public offering last year, it almost immediately rewarded early speculators. From its $18 starting point, IQ stock jumped well above $40 in a matter of months. But in short order, shares hemorrhaged badly, at one point dipping sharply below their IPO price.Source: Shutterstock As if to tease those early believers, iQiyi stock offered a repeat performance this year. From subterranean levels in January, IQ briefly mounted a challenge toward the $30 mark. Similar to what happened last year, sentiment quickly soared when investors realized that the fundamentals didn't quite justify the bullishness.We're essentially back at square one. IQ stock currently trades hands at just over $19 a pop, less than 6% above the IPO price. Disappointment doesn't quite do this situation justice, considering that Chinese firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have performed relatively well this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the other hand, iQiyi stock is incredibly deflated from its all-time highs. More importantly, the underlying company has earned the unofficial title of China's Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). IQ has 100 million subscribers. And as our own Jamie Johnson noted, 98% of them are paying customers.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Plus, iQiyi has no shortage in terms of ambition. A few months back, CNBC reported that the company is rolling out an original movie business. With Chinese ex-patriots all over the world, this strategy represents a major boon for IQ stock.Does this mean you should bet on iQiyi stock? Not really, and here are three reasons why: IQ Stock: Growth Stock Ain't GrowingWhen people compare iQiyi with Netflix, they're almost always doing so because of their shared streaming platform. But if we're making that comparison, it's fair to have similar expectations for iQiyi stock from a technical perspective.In other words, NFLX is a growth stock. If we're being consistent, that descriptor should apply to IQ stock as well.And for the most part, no one is going to argue against this point. After all, China is still a developing nation. On a GDP per-capita basis, its citizens are poor because the Asian juggernaut has quadruple the U.S. population. Thus, as much growth as China has witnessed, more upside potential exists.But when it comes to IQ stock, that potential appears tapped out. In the second quarter of 2018, the Chinese streamer generated $969 million in revenue. In the most recent Q1 2019 earnings report, management disclosed top-line sales of $1.04 billion.  Click to EnlargeSo in three quarters, sales grew a little over 7%: that sounds like a boring dividend-bearing blue chip mired in a mature, saturated market. Certainly, it's not worthy of being compared to one of the most exciting and transformative companies in the modern era.Therefore, unless you have some compelling reason to believe that Q2 will bring home the goods, I'd avoid iQiyi stock. Negative Earnings Raise Eyebrows for IQ StockI'm not one to harp on negative earnings. As many InvestorPlace readers may know, I'm particularly fond of the legal marijuana industry. Therefore, I'll never get on my red-ink high horse unless I have to.But with IQ stock, I must do exactly that. Let's start with the obvious headwind. As I explained above, many folks associate iQiyi with Netflix, a veritable growth stock. Even after all this time, Netflix consistently reports strong, double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis.IQ stock? We're going to see single-digit growth in Q2 2019 unless something big happens.But the worrisome part here is that investors can forgive Netflix for running key financial metrics into the red. Of course, it's not favorable, but the growth justifies the aggression. With iQiyi stock, we have plenty of aggression, but not so much in terms of results.And let's go back to Johnson's point about the 98% paying customers statistic. If that's true, I shouldn't see an acceleration of negative &quot;growth&quot; in operating income. But profitability across the board is bleeding badly.Barring some accounting conspiracy, this only means one thing: iQiyi isn't charging their customers an economically viable rate. Furthermore, I don't think they can, which leads to my next point: Chinese Customers Don't Want to Pay (Much)Most of the world, particularly Americans, have gotten fat off low-priced Chinese junk products. As consumers, we demand more for less, and that just drives manufacturing further into developing countries, &quot;MAGA&quot; be damned.Is it any surprise, then, that the emergent Chinese consumer has adopted some of our consumptive habits?Moreover, from a historical perspective, the Chinese don't value media content as much as we do. For decades, China was ground zero for content piracy. Guess what? Nothing has changed.Under this context, I just don't see Chinese consumers forking over their hard-earned yuan for something that they can get for free. That poses major challenges for IQ stock.Plus, the ongoing bitter U.S.-China trade war, along with internal distrust of the Chinese government, has incentivized belt-tightening. Combined with the specific challenges of entertainment media in China, I'd avoid iQiyi stock for the time being.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-29,"[Editor's note: This article was corrected on July 30, 2019.]I'd be interested to know how many InvestorPlace contributors would buy JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) stock and how many would buy its archrival, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Both JD stock and BABA stock are up big in 2019; I'm sure some people would say &quot;buy both&quot; and a few might say &quot;buy neither,&quot; given the run they've been on.Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPerhaps one of our editors will put up a poll. In the meantime, I'll provide my two cents on JD stock and Alibaba stock  and reveal which of the two I prefer.   * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek  What I Like About JD StockIt's been a while since I last wrote about JD stock. I got off the bandwagon of JD stock when its CEO and founder, Richard Liu, was accused of raping a 21-year-old student in August 2018. While the Minnesota police never pressed charges against Liu, the allegations left a bad taste in my mouth. However, there was a time when I thought JD stock price could climb more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In a January 2018 article about JD stock, I compared nine years of financial data from JD and AMZN at approximately the same point in their corporate histories. I concluded that JD.com's growth rate was as much as six times higher than Amazon's. I'll admit it wasn't an entirely scientific, apples-to-apples comparison, but the evidence was enough for me to end on the following note:&quot;Combine the difference in growth rates with the analyst estimate that JD.com will earn $0.33 per share in fiscal 2018 and $0.75 in fiscal 2019, and you've got a clear winner,&quot; I wrote in an article published on January 29, 2018. &quot;Unless you're unwilling to take the risk of owning Chinese stocks, history tells me you should go with JD.com. However, if you can own both, you should,&quot; I added.JD stock price is down considerably from where it traded (above $50) in January 2018. Amazon is up 41% during the same period. I'm glad I said investors should buy both if they can afford it. Interestingly, I mentioned analysts' average  fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings estimates of 33 cents and 75 cents, respectively, for JD. The company delivered  EPS of 34 cents in 2018. Analysts, on average, now expect 2019 EPS of 51 cents and EPS of 68 cents in 2020. I also said that if JD continued to turn its inventory every 38 days or faster, JD stock remained a buy. In 2018, JD turned its inventory every 37.3 days, an indication that it continues to run an efficient e-commerce business. And none of this takes into account all the progress of JD.com's logistics business, something InvestorPlace's James Brumley recently discussed.Brumley is impressed by how much thought went into the development of the company's logistics solutions, which have spurred the launch of other businesses, making the unit a profit center for the company. Over the long-term, as JD builds its international business, the logistics head start will boost JD stock.      What I Like About BABA StockIn Alibaba's latest reported fiscal year, it generated free cash flow of $15.6 billion on $377 billion of revenue. In JD.com's most recent reported fiscal year, it generated free cash flow of -$1.1 billion on revenue of $67.2 billion. The InvestorPlace contributors who like JD stock would remind me that JD.com's free cash flow is negative because of the increased capital expenditures it made in 2018 to keep its business growing. Fair enough. A quick look at JD's fiscal Q1 shows that it generated $190.7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, a significant turnaround from -$1.3 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. While that's a considerable improvement, it's nowhere near the free cash flow generating power of Alibaba. JD converted 1.1% of its $18.0 billion in quarterly revenue to free cash flow. That compares to 27.8% for Alibaba. End of story.And don't get me started on Alibaba's cloud business. JD has focused on logistics, but the cloud delivers much higher profits. As Alibaba continues to grow its cloud business, investors will almost forget that it's an e-commerce company. Alibaba might have a lot of moving parts, but they're moving in the right direction. The Verdict on JD.com Stock and Alibaba StockAside from the allegations against JD's CEO, I do like what JD.com is doing to grow its business. In many respects, it's built a logistics behemoth that will be able to handle significantly higher merchandise volumes than it's currently handling -- and that's great news for the owners of JD stock.I also like all the things Alibaba's doing to conquer the world while generating tremendous amounts of free cash flow. Those trends are certainly positive for Alibaba stock. If the allegations against JD's CEO had never been made, I'd have a tough time picking between JD stock and BABA stock, but I but would ultimately side with Alibaba stock. However, I can't put aside the accusations, regardless of the fact that charges were never filed. The allegations are causing me to stay away from JD stock. Over the long-term, both BABA stock and JD.com stock will do well, but I'd go with Alibaba if I had to buy one or the other.

2019-08-01,"JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock has seen a boost in the past two months month. Shares in the Chinese retail giant popped from the $25+ in early June to the $30+ range as of this writing. With tense U.S.-Chinese trade relations cooling, investor confidence in JD stock has improved certainly.Source: Shutterstock Shares continue to trade a high valuation, driven by JD's potential to challenge Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and become king of Chinese e-commerce. But is there additional upside to the JD stock price here? Or should investors take caution, given that JD currently trades at a high valuation? Let's take a deeper look, and see what is the verdict with JD.com stock. Recent PerformanceFor the first quarter of 2019, sales grew 21% year over year. However, the company's growth has slowed from prior years. The company saw a 50% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2012 and 2018. But with scale comes improved profitability. Gross margins grew from 10.8% in 2014 to 14.1% in 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, gross margins reached an all-time high of 14.8%. This is an 29% improvement over the prior year's quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income What does this mean for the JD stock price? With the company scaled up, JD can ease off the gas pedal in terms of infrastructure investments. Coupled with pricing power and a diversification into related services, the company could see higher operating margins. This will justify the current valuation, and potentially lead to additional upside.But what about Alibaba? What makes JD.com stock a better opportunity in terms of playing the Chinese middle class growth story? While Alibaba is king of the hill with regards to the Chinese retail market, JD.com could overthrow them as the &quot;Amazon of China&quot;. JD.com Could Become The &quot;Amazon of China&quot;Alibaba is the undisputed king of Chinese e-retail. BABA's Tmall platform has a 61.5% e-Commerce market share. This leaves JD a distant second, with only 24.2% market share. But the differing business models of both companies could be key to JD's future growth. Alibaba is primarily a marketplace. JD.com is more akin to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), operating as both a retailer and as a third-party platform. As InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy recently wrote, JD.com continues to build out an extensive logistics infrastructure in China. This build-out is similar to what Amazon has successfully achieved in the United States.But can JD.com overtake Alibaba to become the &quot;Amazon of China&quot;?With a little help from some deep pocketed friends, they could give it a go. JD has been partners with Chinese conglomerate Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) since 2014. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have made strategic investments as well. These partnerships provide opportunity for the company to leverage its market power both China and across the globe. But is the company getting ahead of itself? With heavy competition and geopolitical headwinds, there are many factors that could impact the JD stock price. With shares currently trading at a premium valuation, upside could be limited. Risks to JD Stock PriceJD faces competition not only from Alibaba, but from low-cost retailers such as Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD). While JD.com focuses on branded products, Pinduoduo could one day make a run for the company's higher-end market. The U.S.-China trade war is a minor risk. Trade talks have resumed, but is tough to predict their future outcome. As JD.com CEO Richard Liu discussed last month, the trade war threatens the import of American-made goods into China. The trade wars remain a minor risk, likely already priced into shares.Valuation is another risk to the JD stock price. Shares in the company trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 47.2. The company's Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio for the trailing twelve months is a stunning 74.3. While competitor Alibaba trades at a higher forward P/E (323), BABA trades at a lower EV/EBITDA ratio (31.9).Is this EV/EBITDA premium to Alibaba justified? Entering the stock at such a high EBITDA multiple could be a risk. While the company could improve operating earnings once growth expenses cool down, much of the potential upside is already reflected in the stock price. Bottom Line: Keep JD Stock on Your RadarFor investors looking to play the Chinese middle-class growth story, JD.com stock may be a strong investment idea. With their infrastructure build-out, along with the Alphabet and Walmart strategic partnerships, the company has a shot in overtaking Alibaba as the &quot;Amazon of China&quot;. While the trade war risk is still on the table, this geopolitical factor's negative impact is likely priced into shares.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 JD.com stock is overvalued. Investors have given the company a premium valuation in anticipation of earnings growth. With this mind, exercise caution before entering a position. With the next earnings report anticipated to be released in mid-August, it may clearer down the road whether JD stock's current valuation is justified.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Thiel is a self-described contrarian. This philosophy worked well when he helped establish an online bank at a time few people trusted anything on the internet and more recently, with his bet on the ultimate long-shot presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Understanding where his latest gambit, a very public rebuke of the world’s second-largest economy, fits into this strategy is as complex as his belief system.In a pair of recent public appearances, Thiel diverged from virtually everyone in the global business community by stoking anti-China sentiment and goading the Trump administration to intensify the trade war. Thiel can take this position because, either by accident or by design, the Chinese economy is largely irrelevant to his business interests.Thiel’s network of venture capital and personal funds manages more than $7 billion and has bet on hundreds of startups. Of those, there are only three known investments in Chinese companies, according to a study by market research firm PitchBook commissioned by Bloomberg. The most recent was in a small Beijing-based biotech startup early this year. None of the companies appear to be thriving.Depending on how you look at it, Thiel’s new Chinese offensive is a bitter response to missing the investment opportunity of the decade or a brilliant long game that’s finally coming to a climax. His protectionist rhetoric, in which he accused Google of “seemingly treasonous” collaborations with the Chinese government, initially won plaudits from President Trump and could return benefits to his companies. A spokesman for Thiel declined to comment.Three of Thiel’s most promising investments—Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., data mining company Palantir Technologies Inc. and border security provider Anduril Industries Inc.—rely heavily on U.S. contracts. Those deals have grown in size, and the companies now supply critical capabilities to the nation’s defense and military complex.Although federal contract approvals are supposed to be an objective process, emotional appeals and a sense of patriotism can have an effect, said Mike Hermus, a former technology chief for Homeland Security. “The people who make decisions are still human,” he said. “People can only compartmentalize so much.”Thiel didn’t always look on China with scorn. He once viewed it as an economic wonder and characterized its rise as “the most important political trend of the new millennium.” In a 2008 essay for Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, Thiel wrote: “There is no good scenario for the world in which China fails.” By 2014, his curiosity took on a dismissive tone. In his book Zero to One, he wrote that Chinese technologists simply copied ideas from the West.“There is no good scenario for the world in which China fails.”A persistent view Thiel has held is that China doesn’t make it easy for foreigners to buy a stake in the country’s prosperity. “I suspect we are underestimating China, but it may be very hard to invest,” he told economist Tyler Cowen in 2015. In the meantime, several of his peers found ways in. Yuri Milner’s DST Global and Sequoia Capital have been backing Chinese startups for a decade or more, with bets on the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. that proved to be incredibly lucrative.Thiel’s picks, meanwhile, haven’t become household names on the mainland. He invested $180,000 a decade ago in a Shanghai market intelligence startup called Business Connect China, said a spokeswoman for his venture firm Founders Fund. (She disputed that Business Connect China is a Chinese company because it’s incorporated in the Cayman Islands.) According to PitchBook research, Thiel bought an undisclosed amount of stock in Beijing’s Genome Precision in 2016. And this year’s investment was in Immunochina, which has raised less than $30 million from a half-dozen backers including Thiel to develop cancer treatments.As recently as last year, Thiel was still contemplating how to break into China. He evaluated various options, including partnering with local venture firms, people familiar with the conversations said at the time. Those talks never progressed, some of those people now say. It’s essentially too late, said Helen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners. Today’s market is highly competitive and leaves little room for an outsider, she said: “China is one of the two largest tech ecosystems in the world.”The new contrarian strategy, it seems, is to turn a weak business record in China into an asset. By targeting Google with his unsubstantiated claim last month, Thiel suggested associations with Beijing should be a disqualifier for a U.S. contractor. Trump at first entertained the idea, promising in a tweet that the White House would look into Thiel’s claims of treason and calling him “a great and brilliant guy.” The sideshow appeared to temporarily take the heat off Facebook Inc., where Thiel is a board member. But Google denied the claims, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that they found no security concerns.Some in Thiel’s orbit said the venture capitalist’s concerns are authentic. “He’s a very patriotic guy,” said John Meyer, who received a grant from Thiel’s fellowship program to start a company in lieu of attending college. “If Google is building an AI office in Beijing and hiring a ton of AI engineers there, that means its working with the Chinese government in some way. He’s worried about that.”Thiel’s stance could also win him fans in Washington. The three major U.S. contractors in which he holds stakes have at times echoed Thiel’s message of American loyalty. They have a lot of money riding on federal spending.Just this year, SpaceX has won more than $350 million from the Air Force, Defense Department and NASA. Palantir, which counts Thiel as a founder and chairman, secured a contract worth more than $800 million from the Army in March and another in July from the Defense Department for $144 million.In the second agreement, which hasn’t been previously reported, Palantir will supply software to intelligence agencies and the Coast Guard over four years. This deal was particularly significant because it wasn’t open to competing bids and established Palantir as a “brand name” federal provider of defense technology, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The designation can set a precedent, said Meagan Metzger, who runs Washington-based Dcode accelerator, which consults with tech companies on federal contracting. “When you do a brand name contract of that size, you have to get a bunch of approvals up the chain,” she said. “That’s a huge award.”The newest addition to Thiel’s portfolio of government suppliers is digital surveillance company Anduril. Palmer Luckey, founder of the Facebook-owned virtual-reality headset Oculus, runs the business, which, like Palantir, takes its name from the lore of Thiel’s beloved childhood book series, the Lord of the Rings. Anduril is staffed by more than a dozen Palantir veterans and funded largely by Thiel’s Founders Fund.Anduril has gained significant traction inside the U.S. government in the two years since it started operating. The startup quietly took over the military’s Project Maven this year, according to a news report in the Intercept, after Google faced employee protests and abandoned the effort. Anduril also secured a $13.5 million contract with the U.S. Marine Corps to provide autonomous surveillance towers on the border and at military bases, according to documents surfaced in July by worker advocacy group Mijente.Thiel’s love of country is being embraced throughout his empire. One of the newest additions to the Founders Fund investing team, Delian Asparouhov, posted a photo July 17 to Twitter showing the office décor set to commemorate a visit from Luckey to discuss Anduril. An American flag was draped across a white board in the conference room, as he held a red, white and blue napkin emblazoned with the words, “USA all day.”To contact the author of this story: Lizette Chapman in San Francisco at lchapman19@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Peter Thiel Missed Out on China.

2019-08-02,"Does it make sense to buy shares of a company whose stock plummeted more than 60% last year? How about a stock that surged 6% in July, only to lose it all and more before the end of the month? These are questions that the owners of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock are facing today.Source: Shutterstock I'm not expecting JD.com stock to reclaim the dizzying heights of January 2018, when the shares were trading in the $50 range. I'm just making the case that the JD stock price should make a nice comeback in the near future; I won't predict an exact time frame  for the rebound, but JD stock price will rise, in my humble opinion.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now  Dark Days for JD.com StockLong-standing owners of JD stock don't like to discuss the past, and there's a good reason for that: in August of last year, JD.com CEO and founder Richard Liu was accused of committing a terrible crime against a 21-year-old (I won't go into details, but feel free to look up the unfortunate information if you're so inclined). Charges were never pressed against Liu, but the scandal left the owners of  JD.com stock shaken and skittish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat was a main driver of JD stock's fall from grace, but the company has worked hard to rebuild its standing, and while it's not likely to become an $1,800 stock like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a cheapskate investor like me is much happier to buy up JD shares at $30 than at $50. I intend to hold JD stock until it at least breaks through its stubborn resistance level in the mid-30's. Earnings Could Drive the JD Stock Price HigherThe next  JD.com quarterly earnings announcement is scheduled for August 15, and this event could be precisely the catalyst that bullish investors have been waiting for. It seems that the bar has been set rather low for JD stock, as analysts, on average, expect the company to report EPS  of only 5 cents.Looking through the historical data, I suppose that this pessimism is understandable; after all, JD's actual EPS for the same quarter a year earlier was a heartbreaking -23 cents. That's the type of setup that I like to see come earnings time, though: an easy hurdle to clear with bearish sentiment already factored in and plenty of room for better-than-expected results. China's Recovery Could Be JD.com's SaviorNumerous sectors have remained under pressure as the U.S.-China trade war drags on month after month, and JD stock price is reflective of investors' concerns about these international tensions. In spite of these headwinds, retail sales in China  increased 8.4% year-over-year during the first half of 2019.Not only that, but the pace of the country's retail sales growth may actually be accelerating, rising 9.8% year-over-year in June, after an already encouraging 8.6% year-over-year increase in May. The macro environment won't be sufficient by itself to lift JD.com stock to $50 or even $40, but the retail sales acceleration is indicative of a favorable backdrop in which the company can flourish even amid a protracted trade war. And of course, if the tariff war is resolved in the near future,  JD stock price is likely to be boosted, and JD stock may even return to  its previous high-water mark. The Bottom Line on JD StockWith China's economy surviving and perhaps even thriving despite political and economic tensions, a position in JD stock is a bet on the eventual easing of those tensions, as well as on China's resilience during the toughest of times. Detente or no detente, I'm looking forward to a time when investors can forgive and forget JD.com's no-good, awful, terrible year and focus on its new horizons in the international, interconnected e-commerce market.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-06,"International relations are never easy. However, the U.S.-China trade war has hit all the ugly branches of the geopolitical forest. And when I look at recent news, I can't help but feel incredibly pessimistic for companies like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). If you're heavily vested in JD stock, you might want to consider easing off your position if you haven't already.Source: Shutterstock In late June, I warned readers that the head-fake in JD.com stock might not last too long. At the time, shares were up over 49% year-to-date. But throughout July, the JD stock price mostly traded sideways. By the end of last month, the Chinese internet firm started to lose its grip.On paper, the company is still enjoying a very positive year. Compared to January's opening volley, the JD stock price is up nearly 29%. But that ignores the context that since July 24, shares have plummeted nearly 19%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWorse yet, I think the pain in JD.com stock is only starting to get real. Here are three reasons why: The Trade War Will Only Get Uglier for JD StockHistorically, the U.S. has always had an uneasy relationship with Asian powers and people. Go dust off some of your textbooks, and you'll learn about &quot;Yellow Peril.&quot; Essentially, this is a xenophobic philosophy that East Asian cultures and ambitions represent an existential threat to the West.Yellow Peril didn't just hurt people's feelings. It had real consequences through justifying incredibly racist policies, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the forced internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Today, I argue that we have a modern version of Yellow Peril in that our Asia policy is unusually combative. For instance, our relationship with China has quickly submerged to one of the worst in memory. Moreover, the Trump administration has previously slapped tariffs on Japan, a vital U.S. ally in the Pacific region.Although I'm bringing up a controversial element of our history, it's important for investors of JD.com stock to know this. Undeniably, we have an anachronistic President who has no qualms about being politically incorrect. Thus, you have a foreign administration seeking respect, and a domestic one unwilling to give it.Add to this volatile mix our own history with East Asian relations, and you have a troubled outlook for the JD stock price. U.S. Amped Up the StakesInvariably, many Trump supporters will claim that the administration is only taking China to task for legitimate grievances. I agree. From the evidence that I've seen, the Chinese government has orchestrated multiple acts of corporate espionage. Certainly, they don't play nice.However, I still believe that historical U.S. animosity toward East Asia remains a relevant factor. That's because the Trump administration has had opportunities to bring normalcy to U.S.-China relations. But unfortunately for American commercial interests in the here and now, we haven't sealed a deal.Instead, we're doing the opposite: we're ramping up our heated rhetoric and actions. Recently, our government designated China as a currency manipulator. Moreover, an editorial from The Wall Street Journal declared that the trade war has transitioned to a currency war.And if that weren't enough, CNN reported that Trump is losing control of this situation. Naturally, the mainstream media is focusing on the visible evidence of the conflict; namely, that international investment indices are crumbling. Obviously, this circumstance has done no favors to the JD stock price, nor to compatriots like Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) or Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).But let's also consider the political consequences. Through these actions, Trump has forged a &quot;tough guy&quot; image. Backing off will make him look weak to his supporters, and volatile to fence-sitters.Plus, the Chinese are not going to take too kindly to this escalation. Therefore, JD.com stock is a name to avoid.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale  We Own the Most Important MarketWhen we talk about certain growth companies, we always mention their potential for international expansion, especially in China. But for names like JD stock, their growth strategy focuses on the U.S. market.Logically, this is a huge problem if you have a portfolio significantly levered to JD.com stock. With tensions skyrocketing over the last few days, the nearer-term forecast is very poor. Plus, the current administration almost seems to delight in turning up the heat. As I explained, I don't think this is a coincidence.But let's say we do get that trade deal. Eventually, Chinese flagship companies will face the same regulatory scrutiny that American technology giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have incurred. If watchdog agencies have a dim view of our own organizations, they'll really work over Chinese firms.In other words, whether we have a trade war or not, Chinese corporate ambitions will hit a brick wall. That's why I'm going to sit out JD stock until the coast is truly clear.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-09,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock is having a rough start this month. Shares have fallen from $174.33 on Aug. 1 to $162.22 at the close of Aug. 8. With the U.S.-China trade war accelerating, investors are skittish about the company's prospects.But will the trade war materially impact the business of Alibaba Group? With BABA becoming increasingly tied to China's domestic economy, they could be insulated from this macro risk. With shares taking a dip, the stock could be a buying opportunity.However, growing competitors are an emerging threat. Long-term, this could reduce the company's market power. So what's the play with Alibaba stock? Read on to see whether investors should take a position, or wait for a better entry point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Will Competition Impact Alibaba Stock?As discussed in my July article, the company's future is the Chinese middle class. Similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the U.S., the company dominates e-commerce in China, holding a leading market share in its home market. Alibaba's move into cloud services and entertainment is very similar to Amazon's diversification in the United States.However, Alibaba's diversification efforts currently lose money. Amazon's AWS unit generates most of AMZN's operating income. But BABA's cloud computing unit had an operating loss of RMB 164 million in the quarter ending March 31. Alibaba's entertainment unit lost RMB 2.82 billion in the same quarter. The massive profitability of the retail unit (RMB 27.5 billion in quarterly operating earnings) allows Alibaba to take gambles with diversification.But BABA is not the only e-commerce player in town. Rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is catching up fast. As I wrote on Aug. 1, JD.com could unseat Alibaba as the &quot;The Amazon of China.&quot; JD's e-commerce platform is a distant second to Alibaba, but JD.com has plenty of capital to scale. With partners such as Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), JD.com is a serious threat.But the growing Chinese retail market leaves plenty of runway. Chinese e-commerce grew 23.9% in 2018. The Chinese online retail market is expected to hit $1.8 trillion in sales by 2022. This will make China's retail market double the size of the U.S. market. Alibaba Group continues to show impressive sales growth. The move from an export-driven to a consumer-driven economy provides tremendous upside. But BABA stock could already be pricing in this potential. Let's take a look at Alibaba stock's valuation relative to peers. Do investors get a discount, or is the stock fairly valued? BABA Stock Valued in Line With PeersAlibaba stock currently trades with a forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.56. The company's trailing twelve month (TTM) Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) is 25.5. Compare this to Amazon's current valuation (54.3 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 28.2). This makes Alibaba cheap on a P/E basis, but fairly valued on an EV/EBITDA basis.Competitor JD.com trades at 26.1 times forward earnings, and has a TTM EV/EBITDA ratio of 64.2. Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) has both a negative forward P/E, as well as a negative EV/EBITDA ratio. JD.com is a more-apt peer to Alibaba, given Pinduoduo's focus on the lower end of Chinese e-commerce.While JD.com has a wider runway given its size relative to BABA, Alibaba stock is the better value. As Alibaba Group continues to lose money in cloud computing and entertainment, this diversification provides additional pathways to upside. In addition, while JD.com has the potential to usurp Alibaba as the &quot;Amazon of China,&quot; investors must pay a hefty premium for that opportunity. Wait Until Earnings to Make a Move on Alibaba StockAlibaba Group releases earnings next week. With this in mind, it may be best to wait things out. It is tough to predict the outcome of the U.S.-China trade war. But Alibaba's domestic growth continues to be a major catalyst. With the upcoming earnings report, investors can better assess the long-term potential of Alibaba stock.With shares trading at a fair valuation, BABA stock is no bargain. High expectations continue to be priced into shares. But if the current headwinds continue, you may be able to enter a position at a better entry point.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-09,"Shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have been obliterated over these past few trading sessions. Shares fell over 19% in just eight trading days, before landing at support earlier this month. This comes as trade-war tensions increase.Source: Shutterstock The Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trade is crumbling in similar fashion, although shares could have a lot further to fall. The stocks are starting to stabilize, as investors parse through the financial and look for bright spots.The simple truth is, equities are at the whim of the U.S.-China trade war. When the headlines are positive and investors are optimistic about its progress, stocks ride higher. In particular, Chinese equities are back in favor. When tensions are on the rise though, equities -- especially JD, BABA and others Chinese names -- are under severe pressure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Let's look at the charts of JD stock price. Trading JD Stock PriceJD stock price is sitting on a very important level right now: $26.  Click to EnlargeAfter putting in a double-bottom near $19.25 in November and December, JD stock began a steady uptrend in 2019. While $26 was initially resistance, it eventually gave way. $31 ultimately became range resistance, while pullbacks were met by range support at $26 -- which remember, was prior resistance in January. This type of price action is constructive.Since May, $26 has buoyed JD.com stock three separate times. It helps that the 200-day moving average is also near this area. When JD pulled back in May and June, the 200-day was in decline, but on its current test of the $26 area, the 200-day is trending higher.However, $26 is more than just range support and the 200-day moving average. The 61.8% retracement for the one-year range rests at $25.93. So investors can clearly see why this area is so important.  Click to EnlargeIf the trade news deteriorates notably from where we are today, this level may gave way. If it does, perhaps a decline into the $23 area is in the cards, as the long-term weekly chart below suggests.Also notice on the weekly chart that the 200-week moving average is acting as resistance near $32, while the 50-week is acting as support. Yet another layer of support near the $26 mark. Valuing JD.com StockThe problem with JD? It's not Alibaba. The latter has multiple growth levers it can pull, is quite profitable and has diversified its revenue stream. Other mega-cap tech companies -- like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- have done the same things. Tapping into advertising, cloud computing and other segments to drive growth.I'm not saying JD stock is a one-trick pony, but it lacks in size and momentum compared to BABA.That said, it doesn't make JD a bad company. Analysts expect sales to grow ~17% this year and next year. That goes alongside nearly 100% earnings growth in 2019 and ~50% growth in 2020.The problem though? Valuation and the bottom line. As revenue continues to grow, the bottom line has really struggled. After losing more than half a billion dollars (-3.8B CNY) in 2016, JD was basically back to breakeven operation in fiscal 2017. Dropping back to a loss of more than $350 million in fiscal 2018 has derailed momentum, though.While analysts are calling for non-GAAP earnings to almost double this year to 69 cents per share, that still leaves JD stock trading at almost 38 times earnings. Not exactly a bargain when one can buy BABA with ~50% better revenue growth and a price-to-earnings ratio that's almost 40% lower.So better growth and a cheaper stock? Got it. Still, that doesn't mean JD stock is worthless or shouldn't be owned. Those who want exposure to the Chinese e-commerce market may find it attractive. Just make sure it holds ~$26.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AMZN and GOOGL.

2019-08-13,"Whenever JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) is examined it's compared to bigger rival Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA), and for the most part, that's not an unreasonable comparison. Both are e-commerce players. Both are in China, primarily taking aim at China's consumers.But JD stock is materially different from BABA stock.Source: Shutterstock There's a paradigm shift underway, however, that's drawing a more distinct line between the two. Alibaba is continuing to fly solo, so to speak, while JD.com is partnering up.It's not a surprising move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith control of more than 60% of China's ecommerce market versus JD's 24%, the smaller competitor would likely never dethrone the bigger player as the market leader. Indeed, without the same scale, Alibaba's Tmall enjoys, it's likely that Alibaba would eventually capture market share from JD.com. Finding well-armed partners with the same interest in keeping Alibaba in check is the only viable long-term play.Its chosen partners, however, are a reason for Alibaba to sweat at least a little.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now  Ganging up on AmazonNeither enjoys the kind of dominance of the western hemisphere's eommerce market Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) enjoys. But, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) are no slouches either. The former is the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, while the latter operates the world's most fruitful ad-supported search engine.They're both also teammates of JD in its battle against Alibaba, which has quietly been escalating while investors have focused on the bigger trade war picture. Namely, in July, Google overhauled its e-commerce platform in preparation for more Chinese sellers. JD, which already sells some goods to U.S. shoppers via Google's platform, will find and vet these providers.Owners of GOOGL or JD stock need not hold their breath waiting for remarkably better bottom lines. They won't see them soon, if at all. Google still contends with Amazon in most places outside of Asia and hasn't yet made much of a dent in its dominance.Still, it's a development that sets the stage for growth in a market where Google has seen little, and where Chinese merchants have struggled even when utilizing Amazon.com.As Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, explained it, &quot;It's probably a much better approach to have a Chinese company to deal with Chinese sellers, Obviously JD has much more experience in this. They have existing local relationships. They have an existing local experience.&quot; Walmart and JD StockAs for Walmart, its relationship with JD has been solidified even longer.Walmart's first store in China was established in 1996, and has since grown to a count of more than 400 units. It's a figure that pales in comparison to the more than 4,700 U.S. stores the retailer operates though, serving as evidence that big-box brands that thrive in the United States don't necessarily thrive elsewhere.That's not necessarily the case when that organization partners with a local player, however, like Walmart partnered with JD.com in 2016 by opening an online store of its own at JD.com. The partnership was expanded in 2017 when the two players integrated much of their co-efforts in China to streamline the operation. Walmart and JD established a means of looking at one another's inventory, for instance, to determine where a particular order should be packed and shipped from.That partnership is letting Walmart capture a piece of a market where Amazon struggled to make capital investments pay off. In April, Amazon shuttered its China marketplace. Think Bigger Picture for JD StockBoth relationships remain obscured, partly by design, and arguably partly because none of the three players truly knows what the foreseeable future holds. They're all keeping their options open as they learn from the initial efforts of both partnerships.There's little doubt as to the underlying motivations though. Amazon.com owns the North American ecommerce market, along with a sizable piece of the market on this half of the planet. Alibaba owns a similar share of the other half. Nobody's going to beat either giant on their own, but in league with frenemies, at least Amazon and Alibaba can be contained.They're admittedly slow-burn projects, but they're both projects that play right into the hand JD.com is holding.JD is above all else a logistics expert, which Walmart needs particularly in China. And, a U.S. market that's been otherwise difficult to penetrate with and without the help of Amazon could be opened up a great deal more now that Google has handed JD the keys. Thomas Niel succinctly said it well earlier this month, writing: &quot;These partnerships provide opportunity for the company to leverage its market power both China and across the globe.&quot;It's not a reason to buy JD stock, but, it's absolutely something serious JD.com shareholders need to put on their radars.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Turmoil in Hong Kong Will Weigh on BABA StockUnfortunately for investors, the only thing even more massive than the revenue and earnings growth is the uncertainty this company faces. The factors that could supersede earnings news mostly lie beyond the company's control.First, the company has begun the process to list Alibaba stock on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. However, this comes at a time when Hong Kong is dealing with massive protests following efforts by the Chinese government to assert more direct authority in the special administrative region. This has led to extreme worries in Hong Kong and has even prompted rumors that the protests will lead to an invasion. We have no way of knowing if that will occur. However, such fears and the intensity of the demonstrations casts obvious doubts over it's initial public offering in Hong Kong. Secondly, any power grab by the Beijing government could serve as a reminder that Alibaba stock is not actually stock in Alibaba Group. Traders have long discounted BABA compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for this reason. However, the political strife surrounding Hong Kong could easily prompt further discounting of the Cayman Islands-based holding company which represents BABA stock. Trade and Jack Ma's Departure Add to UncertaintyA third factor is that Chinese retailers depend on the U.S. even when they do not. This is because the Chinese economy, and many of Alibaba's customers, depend heavily on the American consumer. The trade war has hurt Chinese stocks for more than a year-and-a-half. This includes equities such as BABA stock which conduct a negligible amount of business in the U.S.Fourth, founder Jack Ma will leave his position as chairman of Alibaba in September, completing the full handover of the company to Daniel Zhang. Admittedly, traders will have to wait for years to learn the outcome of this transition. Still, such changes become a concern with conglomerates such as Alibaba. Many remember the decline of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) after Jack Welch left and do not want to see history repeat itself.However, until proven otherwise, I would look at this handover as comparable to Steve Jobs handing the reins to Tim Cook at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Bottom Line on BABA StockFor now, the first-quarter earnings report is a less significant concern for Alibaba stock. Alibaba Group has beaten earnings for the last three quarters. Yes, the company missed estimates during the same quarter last year. Still, I expect BABA stock will exceed expectations in much the same way JD stock beat estimates earlier in the week.However, Alibaba stock faces more daunting challenges, most of which lie outside of the company's control. The company is listing shares in Hong Kong at a time when this former colony of the United Kingdom has become crippled by protests. This could also prompt investors to look at the holding company that represents Alibaba in a different light.Additionally, the political turmoil casts doubts on any business conducted in Hong Kong. Further, many of Alibaba's customers make their living -- in some respect -- with trade from the U.S. Both the trade war and the aforementioned turmoil in Hong Kong bring uncertainty to growth forecasts.Investors could see a bump in Alibaba stock following earnings. Still, with all of the turmoil, I would wait for the dust to settle before considering purchasing BABA stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-13,"When Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) last reported its earnings in May, there was little to quibble about. Revenues shot-up by 51% and net income came to an impressive $3.85 billion.Yet this performance was not enough to gin up interest in Alibaba stock. During the past three months, the shares have gone from $178 to $157.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, BABA stock is no outlier. Other notable Chinese stocks have also come under pressure, such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Weibo Corporation (NASDAQ:WB) and Baidu, Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). Yes, the U.S.-China trade war has certainly taken a toll.As for Alibaba stock, the next earnings report - which will be announced Thursday before the market opens - will be an important one. Keep in mind that the company has already indicated that growth will likely decelerate.  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now So, what does the Street expect for the current quarter? Well, analysts forecast revenues to jump by 28.4% to $16.09 billion and earnings to come to $1.49 per share. And yes, given BABA's own conservative guidance, the numbers are probably beatable. But this may not matter much. For now, the markets are mostly concerned about the trade situation, which is vague. The Quarterly Events for Alibaba StockFor BABA stock, the latest quarter has certainly been active. Let's take a look at some of the highlights:  * The company filed confidential papers for a listing on the Hong Kong market. The proposed offering, which will be led by China International Capital Corp and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), will likely raise billions (keep in mind that the U.S. IPO came to $25 billion). Although, due to the continued instability in Hong Kong, the listing is far from a guarantee.  * Alibaba's B2C platform for brands and retailers, Tmall, announced a partnership with the New York Fashion Week (NYFW): The Shows. There will also be similar arrangements with the Paris Fashion Week and Milan Fashion Week.  * Luxury brand Michael Kors - which is a part of Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) - has opened a digital store on Tmall. The deal will also include exclusive access to special products.  * Alibaba Group announced a strategic partnership with the municipal government of Yiwu, in the Zhejiang province of China. The deal will involve the launch of the eWTP hub, which will facilitate trade in the world's largest wholesale market.  * For the &quot;6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival,&quot; Taobao and Tmall had record-breaking performances, as demand from less-developed cities surged. More than 200,000 brands took part in the event. Bottom Line on BABA StockFor the long-term, I think Alibaba stock looks attractive. The company is similar to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), with dominant positions in key markets like e-commerce and cloud computing. What's more, the market in China is much larger. For example, BABA has a whopping 721 million mobile monthly active users (MAUs), up 104 million on a year-over-year basis.As for the cloud business, the prior quarter saw a 76% surge on the top line to $1.15 billion. The company has been leveraging its massive platform to capture new customers and has also been aggressive with adding new services like blockchain, cybersecurity, database systems and artificial intelligence.Something else: the valuation on Alibaba stock is fairly reasonable. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is 18.5-times. By comparison, JD.com is at 26x.However, in the near-term, there still may not be much bullishness with BABA stock. The uncertainties regarding trade seem to be paramount concerns right now. And this could mean that shares will be choppy for some time.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-08-13,"It has been a turbulent past few years for investors in Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD), with most of that volatility in JD stock driven by fluctuations in the company's revenue growth rates and operating margins.Source: Shutterstock Back in 2016, JD was a $20 stock. Then, from the back-half of 2016 and through to early 2018, JD's operating margins materially improved against the backdrop of sustained big revenue growth. Profits were consequently soaring, and investors were taking an increasingly constructive outlook on JD's long-term profit potential. In response, JD stock soared to $50 by early 2018.But then things changed. JD's revenue growth rates started to meaningfully slow. Operating margins started to retreat. Profit growth fell flat. Investors became increasingly pessimistic on JD's long-term profit growth potential. JD stock dropped back to $20 levels by late 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsComing into this year, things started to improve again. JD's revenue growth rates stabilized. Margins began to creep higher. Investors got bullish again. JD stock soared to $30.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates In other words, history says that as go JD's revenue growth and margin trends, so goes JD stock. Distracted by Trade War NoiseRecently, JD stock has taken a step back on trade war concerns. Such concerns are just noise. In the bigger picture, the fundamentals imply that JD's revenue and margin trends will remain favorable over the next few quarters. As they do, JD stock will bounce back from this recent sell off in the near term, and surge higher in the medium term.As such, this dip in JD stock is worth buying. Near to medium term upside looks compelling at the current moment. Revenue Trends Remain FavorableThe first big reason to buy the dip in JD stock is because the company's revenue trends are improving, and should be favorable for the foreseeable future.To understand this, let's take a step back and look at the Chinese economy as a whole. The trade war is escalating. That's not good for China's economy. Specifically, it weighs on China's trade -- exports and imports will both presumably take a hit for the foreseeable future. Trade is a big part of China's economy. Thus, as trade takes a hit, so does China's GDP. That's why you are seeing these decade-low GDP prints out of Beijing.But, amid all this trade noise, it's important to separate out the consumer. The trade war isn't all that relevant to the consumer, in either China or the U.S. Sure, it means higher prices in some places. But, only marginally higher prices. Such price hikes won't derail either countries' consumer economies. Instead, those consumer economies are driven by still favorable labor conditions. Indeed, as 30 year-old Shanghai clerk Roman Wu said in a recent UBS survey, &quot;consumers like me will spend more, for as long as we keep our jobs and our income continues to rise.&quot; China's Consumers Keep SpendingThat's exactly what is happening in China. China's unemployment rate has dropped to a decade-low 3.6% in 2019, while wages have risen to a decade-high, up more than 6% year-over-year in the first half of 2019 in major Chinese cities. That's why Chinese retail sales growth trends have improved meaningfully over the past few months after a temporary slowdown in early 2019, and why June 2019 retail sales growth was the highest its been since since March 2018. It's also why, according to that same UBS survey, most Chinese consumers actually expected to keep spending big both now and for the foreseeable future.In other words, China's consumer economy remains largely isolated to the trade war, and favorable labor conditions project to keep China's consumer economy on a healthy upward path for the foreseeable future. This will create a rising tide that will lift all boats -- JD included -- and which should help stabilize JD's revenue growth rates in the ~20% range for the foreseeable future. Margins Will Keep Powering HigherThe second big reason to buy the dip in JD stock is because the company's margin trends have meaningfully improved over the past few quarters, and project to keep improving for the foreseeable future.JD is a big growth company in a big growth market. As a big growth company in a big growth market, the company is investing a bunch of money back into the business to expand market share and improve long term efficiency. This includes investing in things like expanding geographic operations and optimizing warehouse logistics with robotics. Near term, these investments have a hugely negative impact on margins, because they have sizable upfront costs. Long term, these investment have a hugely positive impact on margins, since they expand scale and improve efficiency.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What It increasingly appears that JD is in the phase of the investment cycle where these investments are going from having a &quot;hugely negative impact&quot; on margins to having a &quot;hugely positive impact&quot; on margins. Specifically, for most of 2018, margins were under pressure. In the last quarter of 2018, though, JD Mall reported 50 basis points of margin expansion. JD followed that up with 20 bps of expansion in the first quarter of 2019, and 60 bps of expansion in the second quarter of 2019.That's a favorable multi-quarter margin expansion trend. Further, management commentary on the Q2 conference call broadly implied that JD is the early innings of a realizing the long-term margin benefits of its 2017-2018 operational investments.Net net, then, JD's margin trends are finally starting to improve, and it appears that they will continue to improve in a big way for the foreseeable future. Bottom Line on JD StockIn the big picture, only two things drive JD stock: revenue growth and margins. When both are trending in the right direction, JD stock powers higher. When both are trending in the wrong direction, JD shares falls off a cliff.For the foreseeable future, both revenue growth and margins project to trend in the right direction. Thus, for the foreseeable future, JD.com stock should remain on an uptrend, meaning that trade war related dips in the stock are nothing more than buying opportunities.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD.

2019-08-14,"Credit has to be given where it's due -- at least the Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) bulls are trying. Though down in step with most other stocks since late July, Alibaba stock turned the ship around in early August before a major technical floor was broken. For the second time in less than three months, that recovery effort is unfurling on above-average volume.It remains to be seen if it will take hold. A solid second quarter report from rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) certainly helped fan the bullish flames of the current rebound effort. But, it wasn't enough to push BABA stock above a convergence of technical resistance before a newly-inverted yield curve stoked recession fears … again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul Thursday's post-close earnings report from Alibaba Group may well force traders to commit to a decision, for better or worse, on Alibaba stock. BABA Stock Getting SqueezedIt's a misnomer that all of China's top stocks are in a nosedive. Certainly Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Iqiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) have been fighting losing battles. Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN), Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Alibaba stock remain in distinct uptrends though, even with sizeable setbacks seen in the middle of 2018.That could all change dramatically after Thursday's closing bell rings, however. That's when Alibaba is slated to reveal last quarter's results into an environment where there's little room left to roam.The chart tells the tale. The rising support line in place since early 2016 is still intact, prompting last week's rebound effort. But, a relatively young falling resistance line is also in place. That's what broke the rally effort in July, and ultimately in May as well.  Click to EnlargeThose two lines are clearly on an intercept course, now less than thirty points apart. That's not a lot of room for BABA stock to do what it usually does.It's highly likely that whatever Alibaba reports on Thursday will ultimately snap the psychological underpinnings of either the support or resistance that has taken shape over the past few months. Alibaba Group Facing a HeadwindThe company's first-quarter fiscal results are going to be unveiled in a less than hospitable environment.Although the White House backed off on plans to introduce new tariffs on Chinese imports into the United States this week, older tariffs remain in place. While the U.S. economy is growing at a measurable pace, China's is starting to show serious cracks. The country's industrial output grew at a 17-year low in July. Though it hinted at a recovery in June, retail spending growth fell to 7.6% last month … the second-lowest growth pace in years. The nation's unemployment rate grew from 5.1% in June to 5.3% in July.It remains to be seen to what extent that turbulence will affect Alibaba's results. The quarter in question ended in June, so the first two months of the three-month stretch were reasonably healthy.Conversely, investors are increasingly pricing stocks based on where it seems they are going rather than where they have been. If China's e-commerce giant paints anything less than a rosy forward-picture, nervous investors may assume the worst and respond bearishly to bullish news. Looking Ahead for Alibaba StockAs of the latest look, analysts are calling for earnings of $1.46 per share of BABA stock on revenue of $15.82 billion. That's considerably more than the year-ago figures of $1.16 and $11.66 billion. The bar is set uncomfortably high.On the other hand, Alibaba only failed to top one quarterly estimate for the past three years. Again, a beat may still not be good enough against the present backdrop consisting largely of worry.Whatever's in store, just know that the chart is just as likely to lead the rhetoric as much as it's apt to be shaped by it. But, that's potentially problematic in itself.If a modest breakdown drags Alibaba stock below the aforementioned floor, that selloff will be heavily highlighted by the financial media, which will exacerbate the selling by virtue of inciting more fear. The market-wide tide will also play a role in the stock's direction from here, and clearly investors are increasingly nervous.Perhaps there's a case to be made for being on the sidelines by the time Thursday's closing bell rings, even if it means leaving money on the table. There's likely to be plenty of trade-worthy action outside of the converging wedge shape.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-15,"Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) stock posted its quarterly earnings before market open this morning, but its strong first-quarter results beat are not likely to matter. The day before, Aug. 14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points. Fear in the markets is rising and threatens to scare off investors from China-based stocks.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com Despite the market volatility in the short term, what is there to like from Alibaba's first-quarter results?Before diving into its fiscal first-quarter numbers, look first at what Alibaba reported in the previous quarter. In its last quarter, BABA stock posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28 (GAAP EPS of $1.47), with both figures beating expectations by a wide margin. Revenue grew a solid 51%, rising to $13.93 billion. After the results, BABA stock fell from around $195 to as low as $150 a month later. The U.S.-China trade war started intensifying at the time, pressuring investors to dump China-based stocks like Alibaba.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWithout that trade war, Alibaba stock should have traded well into the $210 range and higher. Instead, at a recent closing price of $162, its price-to-earnings ratio is just 4.3 times while its PEG ratio was 1.23.For its Q1, analysts had a consensus EPS estimate of $1.49 on revenue of $15.86, up roughly 30% from last year. And with all 18 analysts calling Alibaba stock a &quot;buy&quot; with an average price target of $218.94 (per TipRanks), investors must hold the stock and sit tight. Alibaba Stock's First-Quarter ResultsAlibaba reported earnings of $3.55 billion on revenue of $16.74 billion, up 204% from last year. Chinese stocks are suffering from the trade war yet Alibaba managed to cushion the negative impact of lower exports. Strong domestic demand lifted the active consumer base by 20 million. Active annual consumers at its China-based retail marketplaces reached 674 million. Core commerce revenue grew a solid 25% year-over-year, digital media advertising grew 6%, while cloud computing grew 66%, to $1.13 billion.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall Drilling into the segments, the company's core commerce generated $14.14 billion, cloud computing generated $93 million and innovation initiatives generated$18 million. The cloud computing is the only segment that did not beat consensus. Still, an increase in average revenue per customer led the revenue growth for the cloud unit. In the June quarter, Alibaba launched over 300 new products and features related to the core cloud offerings. As it continues investing heavily in talent and technology infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud will continue growing. Strong Performance at Alibaba's Retail UnitThe fast-growing consumer community at Taobao lifted the growth in core commerce. Active annual customers grew, helped by referral programs through the Alipay app and a record-breaking 6.18 Mid-Year shopping Festival. Taobao expanded its market reach by attracting customers in less developed areas.Tmall, formerly the Taobao Mall, leads the consumer engagement and distribution platform for Chinese brands. During the quarter, the gross merchandise volume of physical goods, excluding unpaid orders, grew 34% year-over-year. Higher user numbers and average spending drove the growth in sales. Unavoidable Macro HeadwindAlibaba could have reported results as impressive as that of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) but will not enjoy as big a jump in the stock price in the coming days. JD.com's market cap is 10 times smaller than that of Alibaba stock. Plus, the stock price is in the $160 range, which makes shares less liquid for small-time investors. When Alibaba splits its shares at 8:1, expect bigger rallies in future earnings reports. Writer William White explained the BABA stock split here.For its second quarter, JD.com reported revenue growing 23%, while earnings of $0.33 beat consensus by 25 cents. Service revenue grew 42% year-over-year while its operating cash flow almost doubled, to $4.53 billion. Its stock enjoyed a bounce of more than 10%. Whether an investor holds JD.com or Alibaba, the long-term prospects are strong for these firms. Alibaba is more comparable to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both firms have a hugely successful online retail channel on the desktop and mobile, and Alibaba's cloud services is certain to bring in high profit margins in future quarters. At a forward P/E of 53 times, Amazon trades at a big premium compared to Alibaba. Alibaba's forward P/E is 19 times Bottom Line on BABA StockAlibaba will enjoy just a small bounce post earnings despite the company's outlook looking stronger than ever. Investors who remain unconcerned over the ongoing trade war should accumulate Alibaba stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc. has dropped off the list of China’s five most valuable internet companies, underscoring the challenges facing the search giant from a weakening economy to intensifying competition.NetEase Inc., China’s second-largest gaming house, has overtaken Baidu in market value after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings last week. Shares of NetEase have gained 11% this year, while Baidu’s plunged 40%. The latter company, once touted as a member of China’s internet triumvirate alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., has bled $66 billion of capitalization since its peak in May 2018 -- the equivalent of one Morgan Stanley.Baidu has struggled to fend off competition from the likes of Tencent and ByteDance Inc., both of which are luring smartphone-savvy consumers and advertisers to their popular mini-video and social media apps.The company enjoyed a near-monopoly in Chinese internet search after Google departed the market in 2010 over government censorship. This week, ByteDance launched its own standalone search engine, posing a serious threat to the almost two-decades-old Baidu. The company was previously pushed out of the Top 3 in market value by e-commerce operator JD.com Inc. and food delivery service Meituan.Baidu, together with rivals Alibaba and Tencent, has long formed part of a trio of leading internet companies known by the acronym BAT. Now even that title seems under threat, with some dubbing ByteDance the new “B” in the group. Baidu in May posted its first quarterly loss since its 2005 stock market debut, after the Chinese economy slowed and rivals chipped away at its advertising sales.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Baidu’s $66 Billion Dive Knocks It Out of China’s Top 5 Internet Companies

2019-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong demonstrators will need to look beyond mainland China for supplies of protest gear that’s defined the look of the movement.Queries on Chinese e-commerce portals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Taobao for umbrellas, masks and helmets would return the searches as “item not found” for buyers based in Hong Kong, while those on the mainland had positive results. Hong Kong logistics companies said a list of “sensitive items” which include black T-shirts, banners, laser pens and facial masks will be detained at customs.Protests in Hong Kong have dragged on since early June, with the government warning of the damage to the economy and the city’s reputation. Police have used tear gas and rubber bullets on demonstrators who linger after peaceful rallies ended, and the confrontations have turned increasingly violent in recent weeks.In such fights, protesters wear gas masks and helmets, and police have said some target strong laser beams at them. After entering search queries, e-commerce site JD.com showed helmets and laser pens are “out of storage for Hong Kong and Macau.” A representative of Hong Kong’s customs says it didn’t receive any directive to control the import of protest-related items, and it doesn’t know if there are any restrictions from mainland customs. Outside of business hours, a call to China’s customs went unanswered, while representatives for JD and Alibaba, which owns Taobao, didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.According to a notice on the website of Hong Kong logistics company Dailybuyco.com, customs has strengthened controls over imports and exports. The current list of “sensitive items” also includes towels, umbrellas, glow sticks, flashlights and helmets. The list, as defined by the customs, is constantly changing, the website said, without specifying if it was Hong Kong or China authorities.Another delivery company Taopai.hk posted a similar notice earlier this month, saying that customs and the Hong Kong government are posting restrictions over imported goods, including yellow umbrellas, yellow helmets, iron pipes and knives. No “goods for riot” can be transported in freight, the post said.To contact the reporter on this story: Jinshan Hong in Hong Kong at jhong214@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Fion LiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",China E-Commerce Sites Block Sales of Protest Gear to Hong Kong

2019-08-19,"Chinese internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is set to report second-quarter numbers after today's bell and I'm not too optimistic on BIDU stock ahead of the print.Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com From a high-level perspective, it does appear that China's economy is rebounding. Economic data coming out of China has meaningfully improved over the past several months. Meanwhile, Chinese tech heavyweights Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) all recently reported strong quarterly numbers.But two of those three companies -- JD and Tencent -- said on their earnings calls that the ad market in China remains incredibly challenging. Tencent's ad business actually slowed this quarter. Baidu gets most of its revenue from its ad business. As such, with the broad read from recent reports being that China's ad business remains under tremendous pressure, the chance of Baidu reporting favorable numbers is not great.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's why I'm avoiding BIDU stock this earnings season. This stock is in a big secular decline because its numbers have consistently disappointed investors. Those numbers will likely continue to disappoint for the foreseeable future. Thus, while Baidu stock is pretty cheap, it's still too risky to try and catch this falling knife.The big implication here? Stay until away until there's reason to come back. Baidu's Numbers Likely Won't Be GoodThe big reason to avoid BIDU stock ahead of the Q2 print is because it looks like the numbers won't be that good. * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Baidu has a lot of moving parts. But, at its core, this is the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) of China. As such, Baidu is an advertising business. Specifically, this is a search advertising business. But, the whole digital ad market in China -- and specifically the search ad market -- is dramatically slowing, mostly because it's oversaturated and because the entire economy is slowing.In these slowing markets, Baidu is also losing share. This share erosion has two drivers. One, alternative ad formats are more compelling (like in-feed and social). Two, Baidu is staring at elevated competition in the search game.Net net, Baidu is losing share in a slowing market. This has caused core revenue growth rates to slow from 50%-plus a few years ago, to under 20% last quarter. At the same time, Baidu is aggressively investing in alternative growth arenas to re-stimulate growth. This big spend is killing margins. Slowing growth plus falling margins equals tumbling profits. That's exactly what's happening. BIDU stock's earnings per share is expected to be cut in half this year.It does not appear that the Q2 print will have anything in it that will change the course of this downbeat narrative. JD said in its recent conference call that the China ad market remains under great pressure. Tencent had a similar tone in its conference call, citing a challenging digital ad macro environment as the reason why their digital ad business slowed from 25% growth in Q1 to 16% growth in Q2.If JD and Tencent -- two companies whose ad businesses have been relatively strong -- struggled this past quarter on the ad front, then it's pretty likely that Baidu -- a company whose ad business has been in free-fall -- struggled too. Continued bad numbers from Baidu won't be enough to shake BIDU stock out of its multi-quarter downtrend. Baidu Stock Is Cheap -- But the Worst May Not Be OverZooming out, Baidu stock is unequivocally very cheap in the big picture.Revenue growth trends are falling flat this year. But they will probably improve over the next several years as Baidu adapts its ad business to be more relevant in China's double-digit growth ad market. Thus, Baidu should be able to start stabilizing market share over the next several years, which should lead to renewed and consistent double-digit revenue growth. Revenue growth consistency will allow the company to pull back on big growth-related investments, so margins should improve too.Realistically, Baidu could grow revenues at a roughly 10% rate from 2019 into 2025, while adjusted operating margins could bounce back to 20% (where they were in 2018). Those assumptions make $15 in EPS seem doable for Baidu by 2025. Based on a market average 16-forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target for BIDU stock of $240. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $150.That's more than 50% higher than where Baidu stock trades today. Thus, BIDU stock is undervalued.But, it will remain undervalued until investors have reason to believe that Baidu will stabilize its share in China's slowing digital ad market. That won't happen this quarter. As such, for the foreseeable future, BIDU stock will likely remain undervalued. Bottom Line on BIDU StockAt some point, Baidu stock will stage a huge, rip-your-face-off rally. But not today. That rally won't happen until Baidu proves that it can stabilize share in the slowing China digital ad market, and thereby, stabilize margins and profits. Baidu won't prove that this quarter. Until it does, it's best to stay away from this falling knife.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, JD and GOOG.

2019-08-20,"Despite the negatives, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) managed to blow away critics last week with a fantastic earnings report.Source: Shutterstock Everyone knows the current economic situation in China is rather unfortunate. The trade war with the United States keeps getting worse and worse. The Yuan recently broke below 7 and appears to be on the cusp of a significant devaluation. And the protests and uncertainty in Hong Kong keep intensifying. All in all, investors have a lot of jitters around Chinese stocks.That only makes it more amazing that the earnings release sparkled from top to bottom, with the company beating on revenues, earnings, and a lot of details that we'll get into. JD stock took off, rising 15% in the days following the earnings report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWill the good times keep up? There's obviously still the macroeconomic concerns that aren't going anywhere anytime soon. And at least one plus from this earnings report isn't likely to last forever. Still, the central bearish thesis on JD stock has now been invalidated. The company can continue to grow rapidly while also delivering rising profit margins. A Fantastic QuarterJD stock rocketed up last week, and with good reason. The company's latest earnings report was simply amazing. It beat on revenues by nearly a billion dollars for the quarter, posting $21.9 billion against expectations of just $21 billion. That resulted in a far faster than expected year-over-year revenue growth rate of 23%.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Incredibly, with revenues shooting up, JD also managed much higher profit margins. Non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share utterly blew away analyst expectations of just eight cents per share. Now, to be fair, some of this was due to a tax benefit that may not continue in the coming quarters. But a good chunk of it is simply from JD earning higher margins; this was their best operating margin in more than two years, in fact.The market had gotten the idea that JD was essentially paying for growth. When it wanted to post faster growth, it would up marketing spend or discount big-ticket items like electronics, thus whacking its profit margin.This quarter demonstrated that the bears appear to be wrong. The company's efforts to build scale and exploit its large competitive advantage in logistics is starting to pay off with durable operating results. JD Profit ExpectationsI own JD stock and have been involved for quite a while. As a result, I've seen both the company's up and down quarters. Unfortunately, a lot of investors don't seem to be that familiar with the CEO's growth strategy and thus extrapolate too much out of one or two quarter's of results.In the past, whenever JD announces a big quarterly profit, people assume that EPS is going to shoot up. Similarly, when margins go down, everyone starts panicking.Both reactions are not well-founded. That's because JD founder and CEO Richard Liu has repeatedly said that the company will reinvest profits back into the business. When profits go up, the company subsequently invests more in growth. Similarly, when profits slide, JD scales things back a bit.Why adopt this sort of strategy? JD has clearly said from the outset that it wants to mimic Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A key part of that company's success was earning enough cash flow from operations so as to keep expanding without having to dilute the stock heavily or take on much debt.However, Amazon never cared much about accounting earnings in its formative years. The bears repeatedly said AMZN stock was wildly overvalued because they looked for accounting profits. But the real thing to watch was cash flow and the ability to keep growing.JD is running the same model. Whatever profits the company can make now are better put to use in expanding the business further. JD has a ton of competition both in China and in the other markets it is attempting to expand into. We're in the early innings of JD's growth story, so why should management get hung up on high reported profits now? JD Stock VerdictWhen you own JD stock, everyone wants to compare it to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). And sure, Alibaba is still a much larger business than JD, but that's more than reflected in the market caps.Alibaba has a $460 billion market cap right now, and JD has a $46 billion market cap. Despite having only a tenth of Alibaba's market value, JD actually does more in annual revenues than Alibaba. Additionally, JD has 321 million active customer accounts - that's half of Alibaba's figure and equal to the entire population of the United States.Revenue is growing at more than 21% a year, margins spiked up and JD is guiding margins to be above 2017 levels through the end of the year (when the stock was up at $50). Meanwhile, JD's new business lines are paying off, revenues there grew 70% year over year.All this good stuff is happening, we must recall, during a major economic downturn in China. Get a trade deal with the U.S., and things turn even more interesting.Long-term, if JD continues to execute, it's easy to see a path to JD being worth $100 billion or more in the market, leading JD stock to a valuation of at least $65/share. If you want to invest in Chinese e-commerce, make sure to own JD stock before the trade war ends.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JD stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-08-20,"Alibaba Group's (NASDAQ:BABA) second-quarter results fulfilled most bullish expectations of the owners of Alibaba stock.Earnings of $1.83 per share easily beat estimates of $1.50. Sales of $16.74 billion were up 42% versus the same period a year earlier.  The company's cloud revenue jumped  66%. year-over-year Source: Shutterstock For weeks. I've called Alibaba stock invincible, and a core holding. I called BABA stock one of the best names to own now, and said buying Alibaba Group before BABA's earnings was investors' best chance to maximize profit. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat the results from Alibaba Group and its rival, JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) prove, is that the Chinese consumer wasn't hunkering down last spring, anticipating trouble ahead. Instead, they were buying goods with both hands.But what about the future?  * Major Headlines Mean Opportunities for Smart Investors  The Storm Clouds GatherOn the surface, Alibaba Group exudes confidence about its future.It is buying Kaola, the largest online merchant that sells imported goods to Chinese consumers, from Netease (NASDAQ:NTES) for $2 billion.  Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai is buying the Brooklyn Nets and their arena for $2.35 billion. But China faces an existential tipping point, one that Alibaba symbolizes. Alibaba Group is built on human capital, on people like Tsai thinking creatively and deeply about things like supply chains and software. But the best minds don't just think about business and sports.The Nets' previous owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, also thought money would immunize him from what was happening back in his home country, Russia. It didn't. And it won't for Tsai,who is  reportedly worth $9.3 billion, either. The Hong Kong QuandaryIn Q2, the owners of Alibaba stock approved an 8:1 stock split in preparation for a new listing of BABA stock  in Hong Kong next month.The Hong Kong exchange, like American exchanges, doesn't require corporate democracy. Dual-share structures like Alibaba's, in which the managers control a company without owning a majority stake, are not allowed on the Shanghai Exchanges. So if China decides to kill Hong Kong's autonomy, it will also be cracking down on Alibaba's corporate structure.People can't be told to think creatively about money and not be expected to think about their future. After losing most of the 20th century to anarchy, Chinese people have a strong preference for order over liberty. But all the Chinese people I know do love liberty.Alibaba has an extensive presence in Hong Kong. It owns the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading newspaper. It wants to reach Chinese investors through Hong Kong's exchange. But it may have to embrace free thought to accomplish that goal. The Bottom Line on Alibaba StockFor Alibaba stock, success covers a multitude of sins.But today,  economic growth requires human capital. To do their best mental work, people must be free. Money has made Alibaba Group executives Jack Ma and Joe Tsai as free as any American billionaire.But what about the people who work at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou? How much liberty will they demand, and what risk to order will their demands create?As  long as that's an open question, the gains of BABA stock will be limited.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-20,"Shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) soared on Tuesday. JD stock gained nearly 13% after its second-quarter earnings came in well ahead of analysts' average expectations.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com And there's a simple reason why JD.com stock can keep climbing. Specifically, even after those gains, JD.com is up only 2% over the past month. That's because JD stock dropped 17% in five sessions a couple of weeks ago on fears of an escalating trade war, and Tuesday's gains only recaptured most of those losses.In other words, the good news from JD's earnings doesn't seem priced in. And that, in turn, suggests that JD could keep moving higher, as long as the company gets a little bit of outside help.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips JD.com Crushes EstimatesCompared with analysts' average expectations, JD.com had a truly impressive quarter. Its earnings per share of 33 cents, excluding certain items, was 25 cents above the average estimate. That was the company's biggest earnings beat since its 2014 IPO. JD's year-over-year revenue growth of almost 23% was more than five percentage points better than the Street's average expectation.On an absolute basis, too, the results looked strong. The 22.9% increase in its sales was a notable acceleration from the 13% growth that JD.com reported in Q1. And its net income, excluding certain items, increased more than 600% year-over-year.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall And it's how JD grew its sales and profits, not just by how much they increased, that helps the bull case on JD stock. When JD.com sold off last year, worries about a potential trade war and its impact on the Chinese economy were key drivers of the decline . But investors also fretted about the company's higher spending, which pushed profits to nearly zero in Q2 of 2018.In Q2 of this year, however, JD managed to drive strong growth while posting a modest increase in gross margin and, more importantly, controlling its operating expenses. Its fulfillment expenses only rose at half the rate of its revenue. Furthermore, its marketing spending increased less than 7%, and its general and administrative spending increased only 5%. JD.com's spending on technology jumped 34% year-over-year, but that line item amounted to less than 2.5% of its revenue.That focus on cost control is much-needed, and not just for JD.com. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) stock rallied after its Q2 results showed that its cost leverage had driven solid profit growth. Investors have wanted Chinese stocks to start showing some margin improvement, and NTES and JD.com both delivered.JD.com's Q2 results showed that the company is moving in the right direction. And so it's a little surprising that JD stock has not responded more favorably to the results. Why JD Stock Should Keep Moving HigherIt seems that JD.com stock can -- and maybe should -- move even higher. Again, the stock trades below where it did on July 30, before JD.com posted a blowout quarter  and the U.S. decided to postpone additional tariffs. At this point, the outlook of JD stock seems to be stronger than it was two weeks ago, and yet JD stock is cheaper than it was then.And JD.com is getting close to cheap or at least, it's not quite that expensive. Heading into Q2, analysts' average 2019 EPS estimate for the full year was 68 cents. JD.com now has generated 66 cents in non-GAAP EPS in just the first two quarters of the year.JD can generate EPS of over $1 in 2019, which would put its price-earnings multiple below 30. In 2o20, that multiple could drop to the low- to mid-twenties.That multiple isn't necessarily that cheap in the context of Chinese stocks right now. Rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trades at less than 20 times the average fiscal 2021 EPS estimate. Internet plays Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) are even cheaper.But JD.com's thin margins, still only 2%+ in Q2, still have much more room to increase. And thus there's more room for the company's profit to grow, making a higher multiple justified.JD does pose some risks. JD.com hasn't always been the most consistent performer. Sentiment toward Chinese stocks on the whole still looks shaky -- and that goes double for Chinese tech, as I wrote last month. As a result, in the near-term, JD stock might be choppy.Still, for Chinese bulls, JD stock looks awfully attractive. And there appears to be room and reason for its post-earnings gains to continue.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21,"I'm a long-term bull on China stocks. Even as a long-term bull, however, I recognize that beaten up China stocks won't rebound until China's economy stops slowing.Fortunately, over the past few weeks, several signs and trends have emerged which imply that China's economy is starting to curb its slowdown. Those signs and trends are as follows:  * OECD Leading Indicator Trending Higher: The OECD's Composite Leading Indicator (or CLI) for China, which has been compressing since late 2018, has improved every month from February through June 2019.  * OECD Consumer Confidence Trend Has Bounced Back: Similar to the OECD's CLI, the OECD's Consumer Confidence Index (or CCI) for China compressed throughout 2018, but has rebounded in 2019.  * Retail Sales Trends Improved in 2019: The retail sales growth trend in China has improved from 8.1% to 8.2% in the last two months of 2018, to 8.3% through the first seven months of 2019, including an average gain of 8.7% over the past three months.  * Manufacturing Activity Shows Signs of Bottoming: China's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) reading compressed rapidly throughout 2018, but has shown signs of stabilizing between 49 and 50 in 2019.  * Trade Data Stabilizing: Amid a trade war with its biggest trading partner, China's trade data -- both imports and exports -- has been sluggish over the past several months. But, June trade data was much better than expected on both the imports and exports side.All these signs and trends may just be a series of head-fakes. But, I don't think so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Instead, the volume of data here strongly suggests that China's economy is finally starting to stabilize, and that means it's time to start buying the dip in high-quality China stocks, most of which still have compelling long-term upside. China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Alibaba (BABA)Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com Long-Term Bull Thesis: The long-term bull thesis on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is very simple. China has more than 1.4 billion people. Less than 60% of those people are connected to the internet, versus a 90% internet penetration rate in North America. Over the next decade-plus, as China's consumer economy urbanizes and digitizes, China's internet penetration rate will rise towards 90%, implying hundreds of millions of new shoppers in China's e-retail ecosystem.Most of those shoppers will do the bulk of their e-retail shopping on Alibaba. Thus, over the next decade-plus, Alibaba's revenues and profits will stay on a big growth trajectory. That big profit growth will push BABA stock higher in the long run.Near-Term Bull Thesis: The near-term bull thesis on BABA stock has everything to do with margins. Specifically, Alibaba has never had a problem with revenue growth. Thanks to secular e-commerce tailwinds, Alibaba has been a 20%-plus revenue growth company for a long time.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential Alibaba's margins have been under tremendous pressure over the past few years, thanks to big growth investments and competitive pressures. Over the past few quarters margin trends have improved significantly. If these margin improvements persist, BABA stock could continue to move materially higher in the near-term. JD.Com (JD)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Long-Term Bull Thesis: The long-term bull thesis on JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) mirrors the long term bull thesis on Alibaba. A ton of consumers in China, a significant portion of whom still aren't connected to the internet, imply huge growth potential over the next several years for China's e-commerce marketplace and its biggest players -- Alibaba and JD.On top of that, JD is also looking to expand internationally, and that international expansion provides a huge growth opportunity for the company in the long run. JD projects as a big growth company for a lot longer, and all that growth should propel JD stock higher in the long run.Near-Term Bull Thesis: Also much like Alibaba, the near-term bull thesis on JD stock has everything to do with margins. JD employs a very similar model to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Consequently, the company has historically run at anemic margins. But, margins in 2019 have improved meaningfully as the company has reaped the rewards of 2018 efficiency-related investments.These investments should continue to yield margin-expanding rewards for the next several quarters. As margins continue to track higher, so should JD stock. Vipshop (VIPS)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Long-Term Bull Thesis: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the long term bull thesis on online discount retailer Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) centers around the idea that China's e-commerce market is in the first few innings of a massive growth narrative which will ultimately power sustained growth at Vipshop.Specific to Vipshop, you have a company which dominates the online discount niche. Looking over at the U.S. retail landscape, the discount niche is a very valuable one (see Dollar General (NYSE:DG), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), or Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE)). As such, U.S. comps imply that Vipshop has a bright future as the go-to online discount retailer in China.Near-Term Bull Thesis: As is the case with every other China e-commerce stock, the near-term bull thesis on VIPS stock has to do with the fact that -- for the first time in several years -- Vipshop's margins are meaningfully improving. This big improvement was on full display last quarter, when gross and operating margins both increased nearly 300 basis points year-over-year.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now The implication is that this margin improvement will persist, driven by continued cost-cutting and logistics improvements. As margins continue to trend higher over the next few quarters, so will VIPS stock. Ctrip.com (CTRP)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Long-Term Bull Thesis: The long-term bull thesis on online travel service provider Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP) revolves around one critical statistic: passenger flight volume per capita. In 2015, America's passenger flight volume per capita was 2.5. In most developed economies, it was either near or above 1. China's passenger flight volume per capita in 2015 was around 0.3.This discrepancy implies huge room for China air travel volume growth over the next several years. China is projected to be the fastest-growing air travel market over the next several years. It's also projected to become the biggest air travel market by 2024. As China's air travel market rapidly expands over the next several years, China's go-to air travel booking site, Ctrip.com, will benefit from big traffic, revenue, and profit growth. All that growth will ultimately power CTRP stock higher in the long run.Near-Term Bull Thesis: The near-term bull thesis on CTRP stock ties back into this idea that China's economy is stabilizing. Specifically, air travel is a very economically sensitive industry. That is, when times are good and consumers have extra cash to spend, they often spend it on travel. The converse is true, too.Consequently, as China's economy stabilizes and starts to improve over the next several quarters, China's air travel trends should start to similarly improve. As they do, Ctrip's numbers will meaningfully improve, which should spark a nice recovery rally in CTRP stock. Bilbili (BILI)Long-Term Bull Thesis: From where I sit, the long-term bull thesis on Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) looks a lot like the long-term bull thesis on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). That's not to say these two platforms are the same. They aren't. Pinterest is a visual discovery platform. Bilibili is an anime gaming and comic-focused video platform.These two companies do have similar characteristics: huge user bases, unique value props, and nascent but growing ad businesses. The implication for Bilibili and Pinterest is that -- as these companies build out their revenue models over the next several years -- their huge user bases will translate into huge revenues and profits, and ultimately huge market caps.This dynamic is already playing out at Pinterest. It will play out at Bilibili in a similar fashion over the next several years.Near-Term Bull Thesis: Near-term, BILI stock looks good because it increasingly appears that China's economic stabilization is having a positive impact on China's digital ad market. Specifically, Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) are two Chinese digital ad companies which have struggled over the past few quarters. But, last quarter, each company reported better-than-expected numbers. The implication? China's digital ad market is finally improving.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul That's great news for Bilibili. Unlike Weibo and Baidu, Bilibili has maintained a big growth rate over the past few quarters as the ad market has slowed. Now that the market is ramping back up, Bilibili's numbers next quarter should be extra good. If so, that will spark a healthy rebound rally in beaten up BILI stock. Weibo (WB)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Long-Term Bull Thesis: The long-term bull thesis on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo revolves around the idea that this company is, for all intents and purposes, the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China. There are just three big differences.One; Weibo has way more daily active users (211 million, versus 139 million at Twitter). Two; Weibo is more profitable (38% year-to-date EBITDA margins, versus 35% at Twitter). Three; Weibo makes way less revenue per user (Q2 ARPU of about $2, versus around $6 at Twitter).The first two differences are positives for Weibo. The third is a negative. Presumably, Weibo's unit revenue trends will improve as their ad targeting capabilities improve and as China's ad market matures. As this discrepancy narrows, so will the market cap difference between Weibo ($10 billion) and Twitter ($30 billion) -- implying huge growth potential for WB stock in the long run.Near-Term Bull Thesis: The near-term bull thesis on WB stock has to do with two things. First, revenue trends are turning around. Over the past several quarters, revenue growth has been trending down every quarter. Next quarter, though, management is guiding for revenue growth to improve sequentially.Second, margin trends are improving. Over the past several quarters, margins have been under pressure. Last quarter, that pressure eased in a big way.So long as revenue and margin trends improve from here, then beaten-up WB stock should bounce back in the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, JD, AMZN, TJX, FIVE, CTRP, and BILI.

2019-08-22,"The trade war between the United States and China has been problematic for both nations, but despite the potential for economic strife both Beijing and President Donald Trump's administration appear to be digging their heels in. The conflict between the U.S. and China has hurt investors, especially those with exposure to China.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com However, if you're a Warren Buffett disciple then you're probably looking out for undervalued Chinese firms that have been hit by the trade tension. And JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) may be just that. What is JD.com?If you're an investor then it's unlikely that you haven't heard of JD stock. However what makes JD stand apart from its peers like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is the firm's business model. Unlike BABA, JD got its start as a first-party seller. The firm stocks its goods in self-owned warehouses and has made a name for itself by offering a quality customer experience. Initially, the firm concentrated on selling big-ticket items to wealthy customers, but has since expanded into a wide variety of goods. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBeyond its massive physical footprint, JD also carries a lot of value in its logistics business. With both of those aspects on firm footing, the company recently started adding third-party sales. Now merchants can stock their goods in JD controlled warehouses and use JD's logistics arm to ship. Plus, JD is also wading into the digital advertising space which has helped expand margins significantly.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The reason it's so important to understand JD's development is because it underscores the fact that the firm is moving out of the grunt work and into the reward. Building out an extensive warehouse and logistics network is difficult and expensive, but now that those assets are in place, JD can start to capitalize on them.Digital advertising and third-party sales are far more profitable than first-party selling and that's where JD is heading. It's encouraging as an investor to see a company that's laying the groundwork and is only just beginning to reap the rewards of high-margin business.  Growth Is on the HorizonJD.com's most recent earnings report spotlighted the company's growth potential. The firm delivered better-than-expected results in just about every way possible which helped boost the stock by 15% in the days that followed. Revenue growth was 23% and margins were significantly higher -- even when you account for one-time tax benefits. A year ago, I cautioned that JD stock was in for a rough ride whether the trade war dies down or not. Back then, I worried that the firm was having to spend big in order to deliver growth. I pointed out that spending in order to facilitate growth isn't necessarily a bad strategy, but that investors might want to wait until the firm begins to grow organically before jumping in with both feet.That moment appears to have arrived.  Golden Opportunity for JD StockWhat makes JD unique is the fact that the firm essentially shouted from the rooftops that its strategy is starting to pay off when it released its quarterly results last week. Investors responded and pushed the stock up 15% but the profit-taking has already begun. After nearing $32 per share at the beginning of this week, JD stock looks likely to make its way back below $30 before the week is over. JD stock lost 2% on Wednesday as investors squirreled away their profits and worries about the trade war weighed on Chinese stocks.Of course, there are still concerns about an economic slowdown in China -- but it's worth noting that the sluggishness in the Chinese economy doesn't seem to be pressuring consumer spending much, which is good news for JD stock. The bottom line here is that JD stock's e-commerce platform is growing in a country where online shopping is on the rise and the middle class is growing. The firm has already put in the hard work of building out its warehouse footprint and logistics network -- making now an ideal time to jump on board. The only dark cloud hanging over JD.com right now is the U.S.-China trade war, which could cause some bumpiness in the near term.However if you're a long-term investor looking to buy while the market is fearful of Chinese stocks, JD stock should definitely be on your short list.As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-22,"It’s no secret that the Chinese eCommerce segment has developed into a burgeoning market. According to a recent Barclays report from analyst Gregory Zhao, the country’s large population and increasing disposable incomes suggest that its current penetration rate of 24% only stands to rise. Amid this backdrop, a new era of eCommerce is being ushered in. Zhao deems the resulting market structure a “three-kingdom phase”. “Competition has become less about user traffic, with the focus now turning to the evolution of ecosystems, with value added services like payment, logistics, media content, marketing solutions, and offline retail integration. Based on this, Alibaba is still our preferred name in the space,” he stated. In the report, the 1.5-star analyst provides his take on Alibaba (BABA) and 2 other Chinese eCommerce Stocks.Let’s take a closer look at what the analyst had to say about each. JD.com Inc. (JD)JD has managed to pull off quite the turnaround. The company has demonstrated significant margin improvement in its last few quarters thanks to an investment in expanding its geographic operations and optimizing warehouse logistics with robotics. While this investment had a negative impact on margins in the short-term, JD is now on the right track with margins expanding by 60 bps in Q2 vs 20 bps in the previous quarter. Revenue growth has also stabilized, with it gaining 23% from the prior-year quarter. Not to mention JD is starting to embrace the team-buy model and prioritize its direct access to users on WeChat to acquire long-tail users, in order to combat the slower user growth it saw in the second half of 2018. Zhao notes that this should benefit ads and commission revenue growth on its marketplace. That being said, the eCommerce company still has a long way to go. “While new initiatives such as logistics and tech services provide another avenue for growth, we think the above positives have been fairly reflected in the consensus and stock price during the re-rating post 2Q earnings. In addition, while JD focuses on the retail market, it may miss some significant opportunities such as in Cloud and payment,” Zhao explained. As a result, the analyst initiated coverage with a Hold and set a $36 price target on August 19. His price target suggests shares could gain 15% over the next twelve months, with the stock already up 4% in the last five days. The rest of the Street takes a slightly more optimistic stance on JD. It has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $37 average price target, implying 21% upside potential.  Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD) This Chinese eCommerce stock has made substantial headway in its efforts to gain market share with its unique team-buy social-eCommerce marketplace model. Its platform allows users to share product information on social media networks like WeChat and QQ as well as form shopping teams to get a lower prices on their purchases.“We prefer PDD to JD, in addition to PDD's better use of social network resources, we view a larger monetization potential during its move toward high-end markets,” Zhao noted.This strategy appears to be paying off for PDD. According to its August 21 Q2 earnings release, monthly active users rose by 88% from the year-ago quarter to reach 366 million. Management attributed this growth to company’s user-first strategy as well as its shopping festival campaign. The company also highlighted the fact that customers have been impressed with PDD’s move up to large-ticket items, its effort to improve the brand image and stock keeping unit expansion into branded products.However, it should be noted that PDD reported operating loss more than doubled to RMB1.5 billion ($212.4 million) compared to RMB6.6 million ($934,500) in the prior-year quarter.     Even with this loss, the Barclays analyst believes PDD’s strategy will drive sustainable long-term growth. “While the Street is concerned about PDD's profitability in intensive marketing, we regard this investment as necessary at the current stage. In the long run, we expect upside in its ARPU and take rate during its expansion into the high-end market, along with an improving margin profile,” Zhao explained. Based on all of the above factors, he initiated coverage with a Buy and set a $32 price target on August 19. The analyst believes share prices could surge 6% over the next twelve months. This is on top of the 28% growth the company has seen over the last five days.All in all, the consensus among analysts is that PDD is a ‘Moderate Buy’. Its $27 price target suggests 11% downside. Alibaba Group (BABA)  It’s easy to see why the last stock on our list is widely considered to be the China equivalent of eBay (EBAY) and Amazon (AMZN). With 55% market share, Alibaba has cemented itself as the top player in the space.BABA’s “new retail” strategy centers around combining the best of both online and offline commerce to provide a shopping experience for the customer. The company creates this experience through three main eCommerce sites: Alibaba.com, its international trade site, Taobao, a Chinese online shopping website and Tmall, a Chinese-language website for business-to-consumer online retail. So far, investors like what they see. On August 15, BABA reported revenue of RMB114.9 billion ($16.7 billion) or a 42% year-over-year gain. Adding to the good news, user acquisition programs which deepened its penetration into less developed areas drove a 20 million increase in annual active users. By no means is the company stopping there. BABA’s cloud products alone generated RMB7.8 billion ($1.1 billion) in quarterly revenue, up 66% year-over-year thanks to the launch of over 300 new products and features in Q2. The company is also expanding its product offerings to include digital payments, online entertainment and food delivery.Based on all of these positive developments, Zhao points to BABA as most poised to outperform. “Alibaba is still our preferred name in the space, given its top market position, attractive valuation and monetization perspective,” he explained. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and $225 price target. With shares already climbing 8% in the last five days, the analyst sees even more upside as his price target suggests 28% upside. Wall Street mirrors Zhao’s sentiment, with the consensus among analysts being that BABA is a ‘Strong Buy’. Its $224 average price target suggests 28% upside potential.",Barclays Analyst Weighs in on 3 Chinese eCommerce Stocks

2019-08-23,"Wall Street is getting hit hard on Friday after China announced overnight a new batch of trade tariffs on U.S. imports.President Donald Trump wasted no time responding, hinting on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that he is preparing to take action to stop the U.S. dollar's rise to record highs. He added additional criticism at the Federal Reserve as well, who he believes is contributing to the problem with a reluctance to cut interest rates further.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip As a reminder, China responded to Trump's last salvo of import tariffs with an aggressive weakening of their currency -- which then caused the U.S. Treasury to label the country a currency manipulator. Stocks fell hard and fast this morning in response to all this. Here are four that are among the worst affected:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), China's version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down nearly 4% as I write this to cut back below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. This after stalling out near the prior high set in late July. Shares have been in a long sideways pattern since the trade war kicked off in late 2017 and look likely to revisit the late 2018 lows near $130 -- which would be worth a loss of more than 20% from here.The company will next report results on Nov. 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $10.64 per share. When the company last reported on Aug. 15, earnings of $12.55 beat estimates by $2.09 on a 42% rise in revenues. Luckin Coffee (LK)Luckin (NASDAQ:LK), which is China's take on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) with a heavy emphasis on preordering and lower prices, looks set to return to its post-IPO lows as the trade war creates a drag on Chinese consumers. The company has no clear path to profitability despite impressive revenue growth as it aggressively expands its store base. Higher prices are likely needed, which undercuts the reason people are visiting in the first place.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The company will next report results on Nov. 14 before the bell. Analysts are looking for a loss of 48 cents per share on revenues of $206.9 million. When the company last reported on Aug. 14, a loss of 48 cents per share missed estimates by three cents. JD.com (JD)Chinese online retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has stalled out near triple-top resistance around the $32-a-share level. Watch for another test of the 200-day average leading to a violation that could well give way to a retest of the late 2018 lows near $20. Such a move would be worth a loss of roughly a third from here.The company will next report results on Nov. 19 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.18 per share on revenues of $128.1 billion. When the company last reported on Aug.13 earnings of $2.30 beat estimates by $1.76 on a 22.9% rise in revenues. Petrochina (PTR)Shares of China's large energy conglomerate, Petrochina (NYSE:PTR), are in deepening trouble, falling to fresh lows today to cap a 40%+ decline off of the highs set in 2018. This violates the early 2016 lows and returns prices to levels not seen since 2009 as the last bear market was bottoming.Hayman Capital investor Kyle Bass railed against the company on Twitter this week, wondering why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows the company to be U.S.-listed when it owns the Pacific Bravo tanker, which is carrying Iranian oil against sanctions.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

So we think it's a good opportunity for us to reach down to those quality manufacturers, so we can provide those products at a really good value to our consumers.&quot;CEO Richard Liu expanded on these comments. According to Liu, JD.com is interested in increasing its investment to the growth of small Chinese cities. And with a growing logistics network, JD.com has the resources to make this happen.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills Tian Hou, founder and CEO of T.H. Capital echoed these statements pointing out that logistics are JD's strength (their logistics network broke even from an operating income perspective) and if they can, in fact, reach out to these lower-tier cities it could create a moat for their business. The Chinese E-Commerce Market Is Very CompetitiveHowever, price concerns may make it difficult for JD.com to sell their products in these lower-tier cities. They also are facing competition with other Chinese e-commerce companies. Although frequently compared to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.com's business model is much closer to rival company Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD). PDD is making some headway in these lower-tier cities, but JD.com is quick to mention that Pinduoduo targets a much lower segment of the market than JD.com. JD Stock Is on the Rise After a Huge Earnings BeatThe Chinese online retailer posted a second-quarter earnings report that blew away expectations. The company posted a non-GAAP EPS of 33 cents. The consensus estimate was for an EPS of 8 cents. The news was equally good for GAAP EPS that came in 13 cents above the consensus estimate. The company also beat revenue expectations, citing a 22.9% YoY increase to $21.9 billion.Equally, if not more importantly, JD.com reported a sharply increased margin. This corresponded with company management raising their adjusted net income guidance to between 8 billion yuan and 9.6 billion yuan for the full year. JD had reported full year losses to this number for the past three years.Shares rose 13% the day after the earnings report, adding about $5 billion to JD.com's market cap.A closer look at the numbers shows that JD.com is finally benefiting from the investments it has made in technology. In addition to their logistics network (noted above), this infrastructure includes a push into artificial intelligence, drone delivery service, and the company's plans to open one million convenience stores &quot;the supermarket of the future&quot; over the next few years. Investors Have Seen This Before With JD StockJD.com has a history of being able to post a great earnings report when it needs to. But frequently, a positive report is followed up by one or more quarters in which the company misses. Is this time different? Two good signs are an improved margin and evidence that the company is reaping the benefits from investments in their operational efficiency.Analysts have a consensus buy rating on JD.com stock. However a consensus price estimate of $33.02 is less than a 6% increase from current levels. Does this mean analysts are hedging their bets? Perhaps. However, with no clear sign of an end to the trade war, JD stock seems like a safe bet. As long as they have enough differentiation to separate themselves from discount e-commerce sites, JD.com may continue to be a winner in the trade war.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares in Meituan Dianping surged the most in five months, hitting the highest price since its initial public offering after the Chinese internet giant posted its first quarterly profit last week.The stock jumped 8.9% to close at HK$76.20 on Monday in Hong Kong, becoming the second biggest gainer on the MSCI China Index. Meituan went public at HK$69 a share in September 2018 and has spent most of the intervening months below that level.Meituan recorded a net income of 877.4 million yuan ($124 million) compared with the 1.57 billion yuan loss analysts projected on average, after it grabbed market share from rivals like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in food delivery. The company however got help from one-time investment gains, such as in wealth management products. Revenue rose 51% to 22.7 billion yuan, compared with the 21.9 billion yuan mean estimate.Hard-charging billionaire founder Wang Xing is waging a take-no-prisoners battle of subsidies with Alibaba for China’s $1.3 trillion online services industry, which includes food delivery. Meituan’s expenses have soared, though it’s trying to control costs by putting the brakes on investment in loss-making areas such as bike sharing and ride hailing.Meituan Earns Its Way Into Amazon’s Virtuous Circle: Tim CulpanAdvances made against Alibaba however have helped the company become China’s third largest publicly traded tech company. It’s overtaken search engine Baidu Inc. and e-commerce platform JD.com Inc. in capitalization after gaining 59% this year. Backed by WeChat-operator Tencent Holdings Ltd., Meituan could have gained another 2 percentage points of food-delivery market share versus its rivals, reaching 36% in the second quarter, according to Bernstein.“Food delivery business achieved positive adjusted operating profit due to favorable seasonality and improved economies of scale,” Jefferies analysts Thomas Chong and Ken Chong wrote.For now, Meituan is focusing on its bread-and-butter business of dining, expanding up the value chain to help restaurants manage their back-end systems. Longer-term, Wang envisions a super-app modeled on WeChat, extending a raft of everyday services to an increasingly wealthy populace.Read more: The Greatest Delivery Empire on Earth Has Alibaba’s AttentionHere are a few highlights from its quarterly results:Food delivery revenue rose 44%In-store, hotel booking and travel business revenue rose 43%Gross transaction volumes climbed 29% to 159.2 billion yuanAnnual active merchants grew 16% to 5.9 million in the year ended June 30Company will continue to prioritize revenue over profit, and accelerate investment in marketing channels, allocate more resources to membership programs to increase active users.(Updates with share moves from the second paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Meituan Surges to Highest Since IPO After Surprise Profit

2019-08-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China has been a graveyard for many foreign retailers, which frequently arrived with grand hopes only to pull back after years of debilitating struggle. Carrefour SA sold 80% of its operations in June after more than two decades in the country, Tesco Plc folded its business into a joint venture in 2013, and Metro AG is seeking a buyer for its Chinese unit. Costco Wholesale Corp. has more reason than most to believe it can buck the trend.It’s an inauspicious time to enter the world’s second-largest economy. Growth has slowed, and the trade war has made the environment less hospitable for overseas companies. China’s plan to set up a corporate social credit system will raise compliance costs and could put some firms out of business, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Wednesday. At the same time, online shopping is increasingly taking market share from bricks-and-mortar retailers. None of that stopped Costco’s first Chinese outlet, in Shanghai, from being mobbed on its opening Tuesday.It’s probably not a flash in the pan, opening-day discounts notwithstanding. China’s consumer markets are fickle and retail is viciously competitive, with razor-thin margins. Still, Costco looks to have picked its niche carefully. The Shanghai outlet is in a suburban district, aiming to cater to car-driving shoppers willing to load up with bulk items such as 30-pack boxes of cookies or 200-fluid-ounce (6-liter) bottles of detergent. Selling in quantity helps enable the discounts that underpin Costco’s appeal.Such a model wouldn’t work in the more built-up central areas of Shanghai, where most people live in cramped apartments and take public transport. That needn’t matter to Costco, though, as long as the U.S. retailer can find enough suitable suburban markets. Costco’s outlet in Shanghai’s Minhang district has parking space for 1,200 cars, more than any other of its locations.Membership is a key element of Costco’s pitch to consumers. Being part of a fee-paying club adds an aura of exclusivity that may play well with Chinese shoppers, particularly when the Shanghai store offers high-end products such as Maine lobsters, bluefin tuna and Birkin bags. Costco was charging an introductory membership fee of 199 yuan ($28) at Tuesday’s opening, which will rise to 299 yuan.Costco has already shown that it can export its warehouse model, building successful operations in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Revenue from international operations more than tripled in the past 10 years.Sam’s Club, a warehouse membership chain owned by Walmart Inc. that’s been in China for more than 20 years, gives cause for optimism on Costco’s entry. Sam’s Club has pushed upmarket by adding services such private dental clinics (for a higher membership fee) and aims to increase outlets in the country to 40 in 2020, from 23 at the start of this year, company executives told the China Daily in January. Chinese consumers have become increasingly willing to pay for better services in the past one to two years, Chen Zhiyu, senior vice president of Sam's Club China, was cited as saying.Costco positions itself as a higher-end shopping destination than Sam’s Club, and has built a reputation for quality fresh food. That may be the company’s best bulwark against the encroachment of internet operators. Venture capital money has been pouring into online grocers, as my colleague Shuli Ren observed last month. Even so, most shoppers in China still like to touch or at least see their vegetables with their own eyes. Sam's Club drove a 4.7% surge in Walmart’s China sales in its most recent quarter, thanks largely to fresh-food sales.Costco has had a five-year online partnership with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in China to market its flagship private label Kirkland. That’s helped to build the company’s name in China ahead of its entry to physical retail. A strategy that integrates the two may be critical to flourish in China’s demanding retail landscape. “In many parts of China, same-day delivery really means same-hour delivery,” as Walmart observed in its 2019 annual report. The Sam’s Club owner has a partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc.Shares of Costco rose 5% on Tuesday, the most since March. That may overstate the potential from a Chinese expansion that’s likely to be modest and incremental, at least at first. But if Costco can thrive in China’s current conditions, it should be there to stay. To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2019-08-28,"Wall Street analysts don't always get it right. After all, behind the Wall Street allure, they are just people -- like you and me -- doing their best to predict future stock prices, which is, for what it's worth, one of the harder things to predict in the world.Still, investors would be wise to listen to Wall Street analysts. Don't treat their recommendations like a crystal ball. Instead, take them with a grain of salt. But, still take them, because these are smart people with a lot of resources who are doing their best to get it right.Investors should listen in particular when Wall Street analysts are either super bullish -- or super bearish -- on a stock, because this indicates that a group of trained and equipped individuals are screaming &quot;Buy&quot; or &quot;Sell&quot;. In this article, we will focus on the former.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSpecifically, we are going to take a look at seven stocks that Wall Street analysts think can rally 50% or more over the next 12 months. Specifically, we'll look at stocks that have a consensus sell-side, forward 12-month price target that is 50% or more above the current stock price.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Will all these stocks rally 50% or more over the next 12 months? No. But some could, which would make them some of the best stocks to invest in now. And that alone makes the group worth looking at. Wall Street's Best Stocks With 50%-Plus Upside: AMC Entertainment (AMC)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Price Target (according YCharts): ~$16.50Current Price: ~$11Implied Upside: Roughly 50%One beaten up stock which Wall Street is particularly optimistic about is AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).AMC stock has been beaten and bruised in 2019, as shares have tumbled more than 40% over the past 52 weeks to what are essentially all-time lows. The culprit? A sluggish first half 2019 box office, which reinvigorated fears that the movie theater business is a dying one, and that AMC is a dying company.But, the box office has picked up steam in July and August -- thanks mostly to the latest Spider-Man movie -- and most industry insiders and analysts project this newfound strength to persist into the back-half of 2019, led by a new Frozen movie and a new Star Wars movie. That's why analysts haven't thrown in the towel just, and have a $16.50 consensus price target on the stock -- roughly 50% above where the stock trades today.The thesis? As the box office rebounds in the back-half of 2019, investors will realize that movie theater apocalypse fears were overstated. They will rush back into AMC stock, pushed by the fact that the stock is trading at a huge discount to its average valuation. This rush will cause AMC stock to fly higher.I 100% agree. As such, I think Wall Street has it right here. Buy AMC stock before the second half rebound. Uber (UBER)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Price Target: ~$52Current Price: ~$33Implied Upside: Nearly 60%Another beaten up stock that Wall Street is still highly optimistic on is Uber (NYSE:UBER).The ride-share giant has had an awful time as a public company. The IPO was a dud, with UBER stock closing below its $45 IPO price in its first day of trading. Not a good start. The stock has since spent very little time above that IPO price, and following a bad earnings report in early August, has dropped all the way to $33.That's a long way from $45. But, analysts are still broadly optimistic, with a $50-plus consensus price target on the stock, representing nearly 60% upside from today's level.The thesis? Near-term weakness is noise. In the big picture, the ride-sharing market projects to be huge, and Uber projects as the leader in that market given its liquidity network advantage -- more drivers equals more riders, which equals more drivers. That market will rationalize as its matures -- as most markets do -- and Uber's promotional activity will ease up, creating runway for gross margins to move higher. Big revenue growth will concurrently drive positive operating leverage. Operating margins, therefore, have visibility to be sizable one day. As do revenues. That combination implies big profits at scale, which aren't priced in today.  * The 10 Biggest Winners From Second-Quarter Earnings Again, I 100% agree with that thesis. Uber is a long-term growth company going through some growing pains right now. The big picture fundamentals remain healthy, and in the long run, this company (and the stock) will do very well. Jumia (JMIA)Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com Price Target: ~$25.50Current Price: ~$12Implied Upside: Over 100%Yet another beaten and bruised stock that Wall Street hasn't give up hope on is Jumia (NASDAQ:JMIA).Jumia is a rapidly growing African e-commerce platform. From that alone, the bull thesis is very simple. Africa is the last great frontier of the global technology revolution, with an internet penetration rate below 40% (the rest of the world is above 60%). But, over the next decade, the global technology revolution will sweep through this last frontier, sparked by more widespread and affordable internet access, cheaper smartphones and private and public investment into the space. This revolution will dramatically grow and expand Africa's digital economy, of which e-commerce is one of the biggest components.Jumia is at the epicenter of Africa's e-commerce market, with over $1 billion in GMV and nearly 5 million active buyers across multiple countries. As such, the bull thesis is that as Africa's e-commerce market surges over the next several years, so will Jumia -- with the end result being that Jumia turns into the Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) or JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) of Africa. Those are $40 billion-plus companies. Jumia has a market cap of under $1 billion. Thus, the long-term upside potential is compelling.But, there are a bunch of red flags here. Specifically, short-seller Citron has claimed that the company's numbers are fake -- they book fake orders, book cancelled orders (which account for a large volume of total orders), rarely ever deliver an actual package and dramatically overstate GMV, among other things. The evidence is hard to refute here. That's why investors have listened with both ears, and why JMIA stock has tumbled from $50 to $10 over the past few months.Analysts think it will rebound. I think it could. But, I also think that before it rebounds, management has to more appropriately address the fraud allegations. Until they do, I'm unconvinced that JMIA stock can stage a big rebound. Stitch Fix (SFIX)Source: Sharaf Maksumov / Shutterstock.com Price Target: ~$36Current Price: ~$19Implied Upside: About 90%Investors seem to have thrown in the towel on online personal styling service Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX). Wall Street hasn't.The bull thesis is pretty simple. Stitch Fix saves money and enhances consumer convenience. On the consumer convenience front, Stitch Fix makes it so consumers don't have to worry about what to wear, or how to find the clothes they want to wear. Stitch Fix does all the styling for you, and sends the clothes to your front door. On the saving money front, Stitch Fix does all of that for just $20 per month, and that fee is mostly for the personal styling. The clothes are essentially &quot;free&quot; -- you don't have to buy any of the clothes Stitch Fix sends you. Instead, you buy what you like, and send back the rest.Seems like a solid value prop. Consumers should fall in love with that service, and as they do, Stitch Fix will disrupt the entire retail landscape, which will result in huge revenue and profit growth, the likes of which will power SFIX stock higher.That's what analysts think. They have a $36 price target on SFIX stock -- 90% above today's price tag.But, the bear thesis here shouldn't go unnoticed. It can be summed up in a few words: people don't care that much about what they wear. Most consumers won't find an extra $20 a month to shuffle out to personal styling, and those who do amount to a small group, of which Stitch Fix is already dominating. Thus, where does the growth come from?  * The 10 Biggest Winners From Second-Quarter Earnings I don't buy this bear thesis, yet, at least. Stitch Fix has 3.1 million active clients. There are about 340 million people in the U.S. Thus, Stitch Fix is at less than 1% penetration. That's too low. In my personal circle, I can think of more than one in a hundred people who would pay for Stitch Fix. Consequently, I don't think this growth narrative is over -- on the contrary, it may just be getting started. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Price Target: ~$45Current Price: ~$25Implied Upside: About 80%Pot stocks have been killed over the past few months by a slew of bad news across the industry. Cannabis industry leader Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has been no exception to this trend. Instead, it has been hit the worst. But, analysts remain largely optimistic about the company's long-term growth prospects.Once upon a time, CGC was a $50 stock with a bunch of promise. Canopy dominated the Canadian cannabis market without challenge. The CEO was promising $1 billion in revenue soon. They had announced their intention to explode onto the U.S. cannabis scene with the acquisition of Acreage (once cannabis became federally legal).That was several months ago. Today, the story is much different. Canopy has reported disappointing quarters back-to-back, which in sum paint a picture of a cannabis giant losing its lead. The CEO who promised $1 billion in revenue was canned and that $1 billion target looks more elusive than ever now. All has gone quiet on the U.S. front. CGC stock has consequently been cut in half, dropping from $50 to $25.Analysts are advising investors to mostly look at the big picture here. Canopy is in the first inning of a long-term growth narrative. A lot of what happens today will amount to nothing more than noise in a decade. As such, investors should pay attention to the core long-term growth fundamentals. Those remain broadly healthy. Cannabis still projects to be a huge market, Canopy still has the biggest balance sheet in the industry, they are still the sales leader, they still have the biggest production capacity, and they are still backed by a global alcoholic beverage giant.Net net, analysts think that Canopy still projects as the leader in what will amount to a massive global cannabis market in a decade. I agree. That's why I think recent weakness in CGC stock is a long-term opportunity. Groupon (GRPN)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Price Target: ~$3.75Current Price: ~$2.25Implied Upside: Over 65%The only penny stock that found its way on this list is discount platform Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).Groupon wasn't always a penny stock. Earlier this decade, GRPN stock was trading hands above $20. But, it has since plunged into penny stock territory because the online discounts market has proven more niche than investors originally thought. That is, in a world where companies often run their own discounts on their own websites, a third-party discount code aggregator isn't all that important.That's why Groupon's active user base has shrunk -- not grown -- over the past several quarters. Revenues have dropped. So have profits. As has GRPN stock.Analysts think a rebound is coming, with a consensus sell-side price target that stands over 65% above the current GRPN stock price. That's because Groupon is pushing forward on a local-focused and mobile-driven growth strategy that has potential to reinvigorate growth and stabilize margins.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale This strategy may work. But, because Groupon has been a losing stock for so long, investors won't believe it until they see it. Right now, investors can't see it (last quarter's numbers were bad). As such, for the foreseeable future, I don't see GRPN stock rebounding in a big way. Skechers (SKX)Source: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com Price Target: ~$43Current Price: ~$28Implied Upside: Over 50%Last, but not least, on this list of stocks which Wall Street thinks can rally 50% or more is athletic footwear brand Skechers (NYSE:SKX).SKX stock soared to $40 in late July after the company reported very strong second-quarter numbers that included robust revenue growth, strong margin expansion, big profit growth and a healthy third-quarter guide. But the stock has since given up all of those gains -- and then some -- because of escalating trade tensions, of which Skechers finds itself at the epicenter due to its global growth narrative.Analysts think this trade war selloff is over done, with a $43 price target on the stock -- 50% above today's price tag. I agree with these bullish analysts.Skechers is a great company that dominates the mid-price niche in the global athletic apparel market. This great company is firing on all cylinders right now, because the company is doubling down on its vastly under-penetrated international opportunity. Revenues are running higher. Margins are expanding. Profit growth is as big as it has been in a long time.And yet, SKX stock trades at a depressed 13-times forward earnings. That's too cheap for this double-digit revenue grower with upside margin drivers. As such, once trade tensions ease -- and they are already starting to -- SKX stock should soar in a big way.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMC, UBER, BABA, JD, SFIX, CGC and SKX.

2019-08-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc. has once again lost its spot among China’s five most valuable internet companies, this time elbowed out by much younger rival Pinduoduo Inc.The four-year-old e-commerce startup PDD is now worth more than Baidu after its shares surged 8.7% in New York on Thursday. That puts it among China’s Top 5 internet companies in market value, trailing the likes of rival JD.com Inc. and food delivery service Meituan. Baidu has been pushed to sixth place.It’s not the first time that Baidu dropped from the Top 5. NetEase Inc., China’s second-largest gaming house, briefly overtook the local internet search leader in market value earlier this month. Baidu’s shares later recovered after it posted stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company has shed about $63 billion of capitalization since its peak in May 2018, or roughly equivalent to one Caterpillar Inc.Once touted as a member of China’s internet triumvirate alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu is grappling with a slowdown in China’s economy and is facing intensifying competition for advertising from app factory ByteDance Inc. That popular social media giant recently launched its own Google-like general search engine, posing a direct challenge to Baidu’s core business.PDD has experienced meteoric growth since its inception. The shopping app, known for cheap deals and gamified purchasing experiences, is luring new users from China’s rising middle class while investing in its own logistics network -- areas currently dominated by rivals Alibaba and JD.com.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Baidu Bumped From China’s Internet Top 5 List Again
2019-08-30,"Optimism has returned to JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD). After trade war fears sent JD stock reeling earlier in the summer, a robust quarterly report sent the equity charging back.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com However, it has failed to move above certain levels, and the stock still rises and falls based on the market's feelings about the trade war. Though JD should bring investor returns long term, investors should not buy at current levels.In my previous article on JD, I urged investors to buy, but only after it sustained itself above the $31 per share price ceiling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI was close.The stock peaked at $32.33 per share before concerns over an economic slowdown sent the stock below $26 per share. However, earnings and revenue beats for Q2 quickly turned the equity around. Today, it trades at about $30 per share. JD S Is Set to Move HigherWithout a doubt, JD.com has shown improvement, and not just on the revenue and earnings side. The non-GAAP operating margin rose from 0.1% in Q2 2018 to 2.1% in the latest quarter.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Free cash flow improved to about 18.27 billion RMB ($2.56 billion) up from 13.15 billion RMB ($1.84 billion) in the same quarter last year. Like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) before them, JD.com invests heavily in logistics infrastructure. Hence, cash flows may reflect the performance of JD better than earnings.I think this investment will give them a leg up over their larger rival, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). However, this strategy led to years of losses for Amazon before it finally started turning massive profits. Still, despite these outlays, the company reports profits that continue to bolster JD stock.Many of my colleagues have turned bullish on JD.com. Vince Martin finds &quot;room and reason&quot; for post-earnings gains to continue. Ian Bezek urges readers to &quot;make sure to own&quot; JD before the end of the trade war.If that refers to the long term view on JD stock, count me as one of the bulls. JD.com trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 25.9. While not a low multiple, it seems reasonable for a stock expected to see 148.6% earnings growth in fiscal 2019 and 34.5% the next year. Its logistics, international expansions, and convenience stores will drive much of the increase. Do Not Buy JD YetHowever, in the short run, I go back to what our own Dana Blankenhorn said about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a company that derives almost 24% of its revenue from China. He stated that one should buy NVDA when Trump tweets negative things about China and sell when his rhetoric turns nice. I cannot help but think we could say the same thing about JD.com.For now, Trump has turned friendly. Still, this rhetoric could turn on a dime and send JD.com back below $26 per share, where it traded before the Q2 earnings announcement. Hence, the current price leaves with my thesis from late July, save for the fact that I have to adjust my ceiling more to a &quot;low $30s per share&quot; range.Unfortunately, all of the optimism has not yet taken JD stock beyond that level. Until investors can see that psychological barrier broken, or they can buy JD.com at a discount, I would recommend waiting. When to Buy JD StockJD.com remains a long-term winner, but investors should wait. A blowout earnings report stoked optimism, and I think this report speaks to JD's resilience amid a trade war. Many have turned bullish on the stock for this reason. I also remain a long-term bull.However, JD stock could take a while to reap these benefits. Intense trade war rhetoric has sent JD.com down in recent months. Since we do not have a trade agreement in place, this could happen again. Moreover, it has not been able to move beyond the low-$30s per share range since the summer of 2018.Investors should look for buy points with this equity. I think if JD can put the aforementioned price ceiling behind it, investors should profit.If JD.com falls from these levels, the buy thesis changes. I would look for a retest below the $26 per share price range. Twice this summer, it has quickly bounced back from that level. If the rhetoric turns negative again, I think investors can get this price.Whatever happens, I think JD.com will thrive regardless of the trade war. Investors should simply make sure to buy the stock at levels where they can prosper as well.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-30,"Despite the recent turmoil, the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is still up 22% this year, but is up just 2% over the past 12 months. For Nio (NYSE:NIO), it's been a far worse run. Nio stock is down more than 50% both this year and over the trailing 12 months.Source: THINK A / Shutterstock.com Lower-than-expected growth, high cash burn and worries over the Chinese auto market have all been negative catalysts for Nio. For a while, Nio was being called the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China. Thus, it doesn't help that Tesla has been struggling too, down 33% in 2019.The all-electric car maker Nio was supposed to enjoy robust demand in the world's largest electric car market. That hasn't really been the case. And with Tesla making rapid progress on a new production facility in Shanghai, there are fresh concerns regarding Nio's staying power.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe charts also present another worry, this of the make-or-break kind. Trading Nio StockIn June, the Nio stock price finally put a bottom, carving out a nice base near $2.50. While down some 80% from its highs a few months ago, the carnage finally ended. After some better-than-expected figures from the company, NIO quickly climbed to $4 in July.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Since then, Nio stock has been making a series of lower highs, forming a downtrend line of resistance (blue line). Shares have also failed to hold the 50-day or 20-day moving averages as support.In short, the name has been weak after its initial big jump, where shares ran some 60% in just a few days. Those are the types of moves you can see with sub-$5 stocks, though.  Click to EnlargeIt's not all doom and gloom, however. The Nio stock price has continually found support near this $2.75 area. Even amid all the trade war drama between the U.S. and China -- which was really weighing on Chinese equities like Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and others -- this support level has held up.That's the good news. The bad news is that Nio stock is trapped in a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish trade setup. With resistance squeezing NIO against support, bulls will really need to step up to the plate. If they don't and support gives way, then $2.50 base support will be called upon once more. Below it and NIO is officially in no man's land.If bulls can push Nio stock over resistance, their next task is to get it north of the 50-day moving average. Above both and investors may look to squeeze shares as high as $4, up about 27% from the 50-day moving average. Valuing NIOJust because NIO is off its lows doesn't mean it's doing all that well. Shares are still down 75% from its highs made last year and 71% from this year's highs.The Chinese auto market used to be a pillar of strength, enjoying decades of growth. That's not the case anymore. Monthly auto sales declined for the 13th straight month in July, adding to the recent turmoil in the space. Last month, sales fell 4.3%, which is typically bad news to most observers. However, some view it as a possible turning point in the market.That will need to be the case if Nio wants to have a chance at making a comeback. That's especially true given its recent news. Amid the softness of the Chinese auto market, Nio delivered just 837 vehicles in July. Ten days later, the company announced that it will slash its workforce, cutting about 1,200 employees as it looks to get down to around 7,500 workers.Lastly, company co-founder Jack Cheng announced that he's leaving NIO a few weeks ago. It hasn't been a good stretch and having your co-founder walk less than a year after going public isn't a good look.While Tesla has had its struggles, it has a heck of a promoter in Elon Musk. It's allowed Tesla to raise money countless times and with an elevated share price, it's not hard to do. At sub-$5 though, it's a tough task for Nio.So, what's the bottom line? Those that feel the need to play this speculative holding, wait for the chart to tip its hand.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-09-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the trade war's objective is to even the playing field for American firms, President Donald Trump isn't going about it the right way. China’s easy access to U.S. dollars over the past decade has fueled asset bubbles, driven an overseas debt binge and laid the groundwork for its low-cost, export-driven economy. Only cutting off the supply of cheap money will reverse this.So while Trump is pressuring Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates – questioning the central bank chief's patriotism and calling him &quot;a bigger enemy than Xi Jinping&quot; – the way to wring equitable behavior out of China is for the Fed to hold the line.Fundamentally, money will go where it can find yield. And however much capital the world has to spare, China has shown an appetite to absorb it. During the most expansive years of quantitative easing in the U.S., foreign money seeking yield went into China labeled as &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;investment.&quot;From 2009 to 2014, China may have taken in as much as $2 trillion in hot money spewing from the Federal Reserve's low interest-rate policy. My company looked at just one measure – the over-invoicing of exports via Hong Kong – in just one year, 2013, and found $390 billion of such flows into China.Since Beijing's capital controls, at the time, aimed to shut out foreigners eager to bet on a steadily strengthening yuan, speculators looked for bypasses: For example, some trading companies in China would inflate the value of their exports, enabling more money to enter the country as “export receipts.” Exaggerated foreign direct investment was also a popular channel for incoming speculative money, as was debt.China’s economic story begins and ends with liquidity; with so many dead assets that have to be refinanced every year, the country requires an ever-growing supply of capital. Much more than cheap labor, this cheap capital is what has created bargain-basement export goods. It also fosters anti-competitive behavior. Domestic companies can operate at a much lower cost than their U.S. counterparts, and they are rewarded in capital markets, despite growing evidence of intellectual-property theft.Consider what a decade of near-zero interest-rate policy has done for China:IPOs: Chinese companies listed in the U.S. now have a value of about $890 billion. Not even the high-profile delistings and fraud charges against China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. and Sino-Forest Corp. could drain the hype for the IPOs of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. Bonds: Investors hungry for yield have lapped up bonds issued by China's riskiest companies. That's enabled firms such as junk-rated China Evergrande Group, one of the country's most indebted developers, to continue tapping U.S. markets. Chinese firms have raised more than 90% of the high-yield Asian dollar debt issued this year. Mainland developers have about $110 billion in offshore junk-rated debt outstanding.  Dumping: A steady flow of dollars into China fueled an investment splurge that supported the manufacturing of ultra-cheap exports, from DVD players and TV sets to solar panels. China's history of leniency toward borrowers – its first onshore default was in 2014 – meant firms were able to sell their goods at cut-rate prices without worrying about how they'd pay back their loans.All this means that the best way to curb Chinese excess is to limit the availability of the dollar. Trump’s demand that Powell cut rates by one percentage point is counterproductive to what appears, anyway, to be the goal of the trade war. There are other, more targeted measures that the U.S. can pursue in tandem. These include:  Halting new Chinese IPOs in the U.S. American regulators have already ramped up scrutiny over such listings, which have tumbled to $2.8 billion so far this year compared with $29.1 billion in 2014. The U.S. needs to close the door to all share sales until China agrees to enable investigation and prosecution of fraud by listed companies. Requiring that American auditors and stock regulators have access to the audit papers of Chinese companies that are part of U.S.-listed entities, under penalty of delisting. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a Washington-based non-profit that scrutinizes audits, also should be permitted to review its members in China, a goal the Securities and Exchange Commission highlighted in recent commentary. Taxing incoming Chinese (and other foreign) investment. U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Josh Hawley in late July submitted a bill that would allow the Fed to impose a flexible tax on capital inflows. This measure would make it less attractive to park money in U.S. assets, thereby shrinking the capital account imbalance, and by extension, the trade deficit.Depending on whether Trump gets his rate cut, China’s slowdown will be fast or slow. By enabling new stimulus, cheap dollars would give the Chinese more rope to hang themselves with. Holding the line will mean Chinese austerity and unemployment. In that case, there would be no way out of economic recession other than an ambitious program of economic reform.To contact the author of this story: Anne Stevenson-Yang at anne@jcapitalresearch.comTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anne Stevenson-Yang is co-founder and research director of J Capital Research Ltd., a provider of investment advisory services.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",How Trump Can Win the Trade War

2019-09-03,"2019 has not been good to Nio (NYSE:NIO). Sales have been underwhelming. The company continues to burn cash. And the NIO stock price has plunged, dropping 55% so far this year and declining 70%+ from early March highs. In today's trading alone, it's down 5.8% as of this writing.Source: THINK A / Shutterstock.com The pressure has continued of late after a brief rally in July. But, to be blunt, it really should be worse. Bad news is mounting. Nio's very viability seems at risk in the near term. And there's an important question at the moment that hasn't been answered.NIO might seem cheap. The stock, as noted, has pulled back sharply. It trades below $3. As bulls are wont to argue, Nio is the &quot;Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China&quot; -- yet is valued at less than one-tenth its U.S. counterpart in terms of market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September But NIO isn't cheap. The market still values the company around $3 billion including net debt. There's little reason for even that valuation, particularly amid increasingly concerning news. This is a significantly challenged company in a hugely competitive market with macro worries layered on top. It can, and likely will, get worse for Nio. A Bad Month for Nio, and the NIO Stock PriceSince August 2, the NIO stock price has fallen 17.4%. It's declined 32.5% from intraday highs on July 10. Again, it really should be worse.Indeed, the news surrounding the company over the past month or so has been dreadful. From a macro standpoint, there's been no progress on the trade war front. And the yuan was devalued in early August, making Nio's eventual profits (if they arrive) less valuable to U.S. investors. Chinese macro concerns remain, leading to volatility in even more established plays like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).From a company-specific perspective, the news in August was even worse. July deliveries of just 837 vehicles disappointed. The 'retirement' of Nio's co-founder followed two other key executive exits the month before. A week later, the company announced it was laying off 1,200 employees -- nearly 14% of its workforce.None of those news items suggest a growth company, which Nio has to be. The NIO stock price, after all, is still ~2x revenue (again, including net debt). That might sound cheap -- but for a sharply unprofitable automotive company that doesn't even manufacture its own vehicles, it's not.Rather, this sounds like a company that needs to save cash, has serious strategic questions, and isn't selling nearly enough cars to come close to covering its expenses.That in turn undercuts the argument that a trade war resolution somehow fixes Nio's problems. There are 486 electric vehicle manufacturers in China, as Bloomberg noted earlier this year. That's a competitive issue not a temporary geopolitical problem. Where Are Earnings?After all that bad news, there's one odd piece of 'no news' at the moment: Nio's second quarter earnings. Nio reports on a calendar basis. But more than two months after its quarter ended, the company still hasn't even announced an earnings release date.To be sure, that doesn't necessarily mean anything nefarious. Bitauto (NYSE:BITA), also founded by Nio co-founder Bin Li, isn't reporting until Thursday. But it does seem to suggest that at the least Nio doesn't have much good news to report. It may also be that the company is working toward something else -- perhaps a financing -- before the release.Again, this is a company whose current burn rate suggests it may have less than a year's worth of cash remaining. That rate should moderate after the layoffs, to be sure. But any uncertainty for this kind of company seems like bad news. And it's possible, with more trade war drama over the Labor Day weekend, that the lack of an earnings release will lead to more questions - and more selling. Sell NIOWherever an investor looks right now, the news seems to be negative for NIO stock. The simplistic bull case here -- that Nio can benefit from EV growth in China, particularly on the high end -- in theory can still play out.But industry leaders don't lay off 13% of their employees. Co-founders don't 'retire' to go work for a supplier. Earnings reports are released on time.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now This is not the story that some bulls seem to think that it is.

2019-09-03,"JD.com (NYSE:JD) reported its second-quarter earnings August 13. They were better than expected sending JD stock up by more than 8% on the news. Unfortunately, it's gone sideways ever since. Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com JD traded at $50 as recently as January 2018. It fell all the way to $19 that year on allegations CEO and founder Richard Liu raped a 21-year-old student in Minnesota. Although charges were never laid, JD stock's never fully recovered from the fallout. And the trade war between the U.S. and China didn't help its cause. As for the business, the latest quarterly results suggest it is starting to turn the corner. However, despite the positive earnings surprise and being up 47% year to date through August 29, JD stock's gotten stuck at $30.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, investors are left wondering if JD.com is a $30 or a $50 stock. Here are my arguments for both stock prices. JD.com is a $50 StockInvestorPlace contributor Laura Hoy recently wrote that JD's work to build its logistics work is starting to pay off for the company as it gets higher-margin, third-party e-commerce revenues. Furthermore, as the company's gotten involved in the digital advertising space, margins have jumped higher. One only needs to look at the growth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing from its foray into digital advertising to know that it's a lucrative endeavor. eMarketer estimates that Amazon's U.S. ad business will grow 53% in 2019 to $11.3 billion. So, what's JD.com's ad business look like at the moment?JD doesn't separate its ad revenue. It's included with the fees the company generates from third-party sellers using its marketplaces. In the first six months of 2019, marketplace and advertising revenues were $2.8 billion, 25% higher than a year earlier. During its Q2 2019 conference call, CFO Sidney Huang did say that the company's 42% increase in net service revenues during the quarter were &quot;driven by strong momentum from third-party logistics and advertising revenues.&quot;Although its net services revenue only accounted for 11.2% of its overall revenue, the margins are much higher than those for its own ecommerce sales. More importantly, a number of analysts were asking questions about its advertising business during the Q&A after the conference call. You can be sure that they will continue to pester the company for greater detail. Investors should continue to pay attention to this aspect of its business. Like Amazon, it will be bigger than most realize. One of the reasons I prefer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) over JD is because of the free cash flow it generates.Well, in the first six months of the year, JD had $2.8 billion in free cash flow on $39.5 billion in revenue for an FCF margin of 7.1%. In Alibaba's first quarter ended June 30, it had free cash flow of $3.8 billion on revenue of $16.7 billion for an FCF margin of 22.8%. Clearly, JD can't hold a candle to Alibaba, but if it continues to grow the services side of its business, I could see the gap tightening. JD's headed in the right direction. JD.com is a $30 StockJD is making headway in its business. There's no question. However, the volatility of its free cash flow makes its stock awfully difficult to commit to. In the second quarter, JD had a 40% increase in its free cash flow to $2.7 billion. That's an impressive figure. What you might not notice about the jump in free cash flow is that a big chunk of it came from the sale of some of its logistics and real estate properties. Otherwise, its free cash flow wouldn't have been nearly as high. Until JD generates consistent free cash flow, its stock isn't nearly as attractive as BABA's. That's especially true if the trade war drags on well into 2020. Other than its inconsistent free cash flow generation, there's very little to say that's negative about JD.com.  The Bottom Line on JD StockInvestorPlace's Will Healy recently stated that JD has tested $26 twice this summer. On both occasions, it's bounced higher. He believes you should wait for a third-time lucky. I believe he's right. Is JD a $30 or $50 stock?It's a $50 stock disguised as a $30 stock. Once a trade agreement is reached, $50 will be easy pickings.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-04,"The old saying goes: When America sneezes, the world catches a cold. As the world's largest importer - and holder of its largest trade deficit by a country mile - the United States is the planet's indispensable economy. And emerging-markets stocks, with their dependence on foreign capital and high concentration in cyclical and commodity sectors, are particularly vulnerable to weakness in the U.S.There's nothing quite like a good trade war to give investors the jitters. But it's not just the ongoing spat between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping that has investors unnerved. U.S. economic growth appears to be topping out for this cycle, and issues in the American market have a way of spilling across borders.When western investors go into de-risking mode, they tend to throw out the baby with the bathwater, dumping high-quality emerging-markets stocks in a flight to cash. But in doing so, they often create fantastic buying opportunities.Jeremy Grantham and his colleagues at Boston-based asset manager GMO are not known for being wide-eyed Pollyannas. They're sober value investors best known for calling the last two major bear markets in 2000 and 2008. Perhaps not surprisingly, Grantham & Co. see U.S. stocks performing poorly over the next seven years, losing 3.7% per year. But interestingly, GMO expects emerging-markets stocks to return 5.2% per year over the next seven years. Even more interestingly, they see EM value stocks returning 9.8% per year.Today, we're going to look at 10 strong emerging-markets stocks that might give you a bit of heartburn, but ultimately should weather the trade war and reward new money. Most depend heavily on domestic EM consumers rather than on exports or trade flows, and all should be considered potential buys on any weakness in the coming months.

2019-09-04,"Analysts are debating whether the volatility and general market weakness in the markets will continue in September. Today, I would like to discuss the prospects of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), China's largest eCommerce company by revenue. Year-to-date, JD stock is up over 45%.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com In other words, despite the trade war, Chinese consumers are spending money. Currently, the JD.com share price is hovering at around $30. I believe this level will continue to act as resistance in the coming weeks. Let us take a look at how the rest of the year may shape up for JD stock. How JD.com Stock Makes MoneyJD.com, a member of the Fortune Global 500, offers investors the possibility to invest in the growing Chinese consumer economy. Online shopping represents about 35% of China's total $5.5 trillion retail market, and JD.com has a 25% share of the online retail market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe group also has hundreds of warehouses and thousands of delivery stations as well as fresh food stores across China. JD takes on inventories and handles logistics as a direct retailer. This approach requires more capital and higher costs. However, it also enables JD.com to have more control over the customer experience than its rivals, including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD).In August 2018, JD.com and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) jointly invested $500 million into Dada-JD Daojia, an online-to-offline grocery business which is part-owned by JD.com. In other words, the group is aiming to differentiate itself from the competition by investing heavily in its logistics business.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Moreover, JD also makes money from third-party sales of other merchants that use JD's massive warehouse and logistics operations.On Aug. 13, JD.com reported Q2 earnings and showed healthy growth. Its non-GAAP quarterly earnings came in at 0.36 Chinese yuan, or 5 cents per U.S.-listed share. JD.com stock's net revenues increased by 23% to hit 150.28 billion Chinese yuan, or $21.28 billion.Management highlighted the fact the eCommerce platform saw rising demand for big-ticket items, such as electronics and home appliances.In the last quarter, JD.com's number of annual active customers, i.e., those who made a purchase over the past year, grew 2% to reach 321 million. Investors also noted that Prada, the leading Italian fashion house, agreed to open first-party flagship stores on JD.com.Although management did not provide any bottom-line guidance for Q3, JD.com expects revenue to increase by 20%-24% annually in the third quarter. JD.com Faces Competition in ChinaJD.com faces increasing competition from other Chinese companies. Its main rival is Alibaba, whose Tmall and Taobao platforms are China's largest online business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer marketplace, respectively.When BABA stock announces its quarterly results, there is always a corresponding big move in the price of JD.com stock, too. As of the end of Q1, Alibaba has over 727 million monthly active users (MAUs) and is in the lead in China.Pinduoduo is also increasing its marketshare in the country. It a young eCommerce platform that focuses on group buying. PDD stock has recently reported strong Q2 results and the stock has seen new highs as a result. At the end of Q1, its MAU numbers were almost 300 million. Many analysts now believe that Pinduoduo, the underdog, is on the road to catch up to both JD.com and Alibaba.JD stock is a growth name that trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. In the past few months, China's industrial and manufacturing sectors have contracted. Yet analysts are hoping that consumer spending will continue to hold up well. Therefore the uncertainty regarding the Chinese economy may continue to affect investor sentiment in the short-run.On a final note, I am a bit concerned about JD.com stock's quick ratio of 0.91. This ratio demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs.In other words, the group may be in a somewhat difficult position to weather any serious headwinds due to an economic slump in the short-term. As a comparison, Alibaba stock's current ratio stands at 1.38. Long-Term Catalysts for JD.com StockIn June 2018, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announced that it would invest $550 million in JD.com. Both companies stated that the combined synergies would enable them to collaborate on various eCommerce and technology-related areas.Under the agreements, Google received &quot;27,106,948 newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares&quot; at a price that equated to &quot;$40.58 per American depository share.&quot; This cooperation between the two companies is likely to benefit both of them in the years to come. Yet so far, JD stock price hasn't shown any benefit.Although the Chinese economy may slow further in 2019 or 2020, China's GDP is still expanding at an average annual rate of at least 6%. Recessions hurt consumers in general, but they don't outright kill consumption. China's growing middle class will continue to drive increases in the country's consumer spending and the expansion of China's eCommerce market. When Chinese citizens have more disposable income, they can spend more money on online shopping sites like JD.com.China's economic fundamentals have vastly improved over the past decade. The internet population is still booming. And money continues to pour into Chinese companies operating in this space. These factors are likely to help support the long-term durability of JD stock.On Aug. 12, JD share price closed at $27.16. On Aug. 19, the stock hit a recent high price of $32.28. In other words, Wall Street was clearly pleased with the recent earnings results. Investors now seem more confident that in quarters to come, JD.com will continue to grow its revenues and the bottom line. So Should Investors Buy JD Stock in September?JD stock and many of the other Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges enable investors to benefit from growing Chinese consumer spending. However, the next several weeks may bring more volatility in JD shares. And I do not expect to witness a major favorable sentiment shift toward Chinese stocks.In the next few weeks, trading in JD stock is likely to be choppy with both widely up and down days. JD.com shares are likely to trade between $25 and $30.Short-term investors should be ready for daily price swings in these Chinese stocks such as JD. Long-term investors may see any further price declines as opportunities to go long.I think JD.com is still one of the best stocks China has to offer, and it could easily find a place in investors' portfolios if they're in it for the long haul. Within a few years, I expect JD stock to easily reach the lower $40's level, or the price Google paid for the shares in 2018.As of this writing, the author did not own shares in any of the companies mentioned.

2019-09-09,"Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is either a case of the glass being half empty or half full. Although worries obviously abound for Chinese equities, the technicals of Alibaba stock can be viewed as solid.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com On Thursday, the U.S. markets all surged . The three major investment indices were all in the black. Further, several companies in industries ranging from technology to oil rose meaningfully.But American stocks weren't the only ones benefiting from the bullishness. Perhaps surprisingly, BABA stock climbed strongly, gaining nearly 3% on the day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBased on that move, Alibaba stock may seem like a solid buy. Plus, Alibaba's Group's peers, such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), have also enjoyed strong momentum.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy But although BABA stock is up big since hitting a bottom in early August, its Friday closing price of $17.69 should raise eyebrows.For one thing, $180 represented resistance three times between the beginning of July and the end of August. That BABA stock couldn't get past this level again is quite telling.Additionally, the U.S.-China trade war is still worrisome. While the markets are enjoying their rally, a Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) post from President Trump could derail everything. Thus, I'm not too wild about jumping aboard BABA stock. Is Another Turning  Point Coming for Alibaba Stock?I'd like to make another point about the technical position of Alibaba stock. From the latter half of 2017 through July of the following year, the $180 level represented strong support. Since August of 2018, though, $180 has been strong resistance for BABA stock.Technically, then, BABA stock has reached a turning point.Two years ago, market analysts talked expectantly about the growth opportunities of Alibaba Group. BABA, after all,  was a dominant e-commerce and technology player standing atop the world's biggest consumer market.Now the outlook has changed dramatically. Pessimists decry what could be an unnecessarily prolonged trade war that ends up severely hurting the top two global economies. Furthermore, if the U.S.  suffers a recession, the ripple effect would again negatively impact both sides.But if the president's tweets push the markets higher,  Alibaba stock could regain $180 and then climb meaningfully higher.But how likely is this scenario? In my view, it's  not likely at all. Here's why: The Trade War Will  Hurt BABA Stock in the Nearer TermTo understand the trade war requires having some knowledge of the battling sides. On the American side, the Trump administration has a vested interest in protecting intellectual property. From China's perspective, it's primarily interested in fully transitioning from a developing nation to a developed one.Meanwhile, over the last five years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has obtained comprehensive power. According to Fox News, Xi &quot;is simultaneously general secretary of the Communist Party, president of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission.&quot;That was fine and well during peace time. But in the present context, Xi has a full plate. Not only is he warring with the Trump administration, but he must also control spiraling protests in Hong Kong. In all likelihood, he lacks experience with handling multiple, high-level crises.Thus, I think it's reasonable to assume that the Trump administration smells blood. And although the U.S. is hurting, we're probably damaging the Chinese economy more. For example, Chinese consumer confidence has steadily declined since February of this year. By contrast, U.S. consumer confidence has generally grown since earlier this year.  I don't think the state of China's economy will help Alibaba stock.But that doesn't mean China will concede the trade war. In order to maintain power, Xi must regain credibility. That won't happen if he caves into America's demands. Given this situation, the economic conflict will likely extend into next year. Obviously, that's not positive for BABA stock. How to Approach Alibaba GroupAlthough Alibaba stock has enjoyed a resurgence recently,  I don't think the rebound has inspired much confidence in BABA. As I noted, the trade war is a problem, and neither side is likely to give much ground. Until a resolution is found, both the American and Chinese economies will suffer. However, Chinese consumer sentiment has taken a hit, which bodes poorly for Alibaba Group.Additionally, a number of factors suggest that the U.S. may suffer a recession. If a recession does occur, BABA stock would probably drop. Although the Chinese economy is robust, it's also dependent on exports. Thus, if the U.S. economy weakens, it might take China down with it.Ultimately, I think the risks facing BABA stock outweigh its potential rewards. While the recent moves by Alibaba stock may have encouraged the bulls, the rebound hasn't removed longer-standing concerns.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-09,"When it comes to investing, my focus is generally on the fundamentals. But sometimes the charts are just too obvious to ignore.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com This is the case with JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock. A glance at the chart shows that there is stubborn resistance between $30 and $31. This has been the case since early March.Now there should be a breakout -- whether on the upside or downside -- right? I think so. And my guess is that it will be on the upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's encouraging that the company has been able to overcome some of its challenges, particularly with CEO Richard Liu. Keep in mind that he had been the source of much drama. During a trip to Minnesota, he was accused of rape. Although prosecutors did not press sexual assault charges on Liu, he was later accused in an April 2019 civil lawsuit. He had also called some of his employees &quot;slackers.&quot; This was in response to the emerging discontent in China with long work hours (known as &quot;996,&quot; which refers to a six day work week that has a daily schedule of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.).But the good news is that Liu has been able to keep a low profile lately. And let's hope this continues. The Pros and ConsI know there is a lingering issue: the U.S.-China trade war. This is certainly creating lots of uncertainty and weighing on growth.Yet the irony is that the situation may ultimately benefit JD.com. After all, the company is mostly focused on China's domestic economy. So as the government continues to juice up the stimulus, this should help with consumer demand.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Another key is that -- even with the falloff in trade -- the Chinese economy is still growing at a rapid clip of about 6% annually. Oh, and there are some other driving forces like these:  * The middle class is forecasted to hit 600 million by 2022.  * About 90% of the growth in gross domestic product is coming from domestic consumption.  * By 2021, the e-commerce market is expected to go from $470 billion to $840 billion. The JD.Com StrategyNow JD.com faces intense competition. Its rivals are not just large players like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD). There are also an increasing number of fast-growing startups.Despite all this, JD.com has some important advantages. For example, the company has built a sophisticated supply chain and logistics infrastructure that allows for quick shipping. It's straight from the playbook of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Note that JD.com has major fulfillment centers in seven cities and about 600 warehouses. It also has geographic coverage in nearly all counties and districts in China.Next, JD.com has been smart to pursue an aggressive partnership strategy, which has helped leverage growth. It has a deal with Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) that boosted digital distribution, as well as a strategic investment from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). JD.com has also entered a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that has provided much more brick-and-mortar coverage. The Bottom Line on JD StockNo doubt, JD.com has been very busy. And the latest quarterly report shows that its investments are starting to pay off. Revenues jumped by 23% to $21.9 billion, with strength in the categories of home appliances, electric devices and general merchandise. As for annual active customer accounts, there was an increase of 3.5% to 321.3 million. There was also an improvement in margins as the company continues to benefit from disciplined cost management and scale.These results, though, are probably not a one-off. Given the company's strengths, it does look like the growth momentum should continue. And yes, this should go a long way in helping JD.com stock break out of its range.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

Think Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BKR-B), the late Steve Jobs at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Jeff Bezos at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Source: Shutterstock The best comparison offered by a Chinese company is Jack Ma of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA). All Ma has done is build Alibaba into the largest e-commerce company in the world's largest internet market, while overseeing a double in Alibaba stock price since its initial public offering (IPO) roughly four years ago.Described by some as flamboyant, Ma departs the $460 billion behemoth he founded on Tuesday. He will be succeeded by softer spoken accountant Daniel Zhang. On the surface, the Ma-to-Zhange transition looks a little bit like the move to Tim Cook at Apple after Jobs passed away. Alibaba stock investors can only hope Zhang can deliver appreciation that is even in the ballpark of what Cook has delivered for Apple investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Ma, China's richest man, has pledged to stay on in some capacity, likely mentoring management. They found hand-picked Zhang, so that could be an important factor for Alibaba stock owners.Zhang &quot;has the logic and critical thinking skills of a super computer, a commitment to his vision, the courage to wholeheartedly dare to take on innovative business models and industries of the future,&quot; said Ma when he made the announcement last year. BABA Making DealsLike Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba is an e-commerce juggernaut in China, but that status does not mean it's a true monopoly. As is the case with Amazon on domestic, Alibaba must contend with e-commerce competitors in China, including JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). To take the Amazon comparison even further, Alibaba's playbook is similar to its American rival in that the Chinese company has become a player in other businesses beyond online retail.In the case of Alibaba stock, catalysts include growth in the cloud computing and mobile payments arenas, among many others. To the point of spreading its week, Alibaba has recently been on a shopping spree of its own.In recent days, the company agreed to buy e-commerce business Kaola from Chinese gaming company NetEase for $2 billion. That deal is aimed at getting Alibaba in front of more luxury shoppers.&quot;Kaola, launched by NetEase in 2015, aggressively targets shoppers in China by offering products from top brands such as Gucci, Shisheido and Burberry, primarily sourcing goods directly from suppliers to resell to consumers,&quot; according to Reuters.The deal also features an investment in Netease Cloud Music, which could be a catalyst down the road for Alibaba stock because it would better enable the company to compete in an arena dominated by rival Tencent.&quot;While TME's market position looks very strong, with more capital raised by Netease Cloud Music and possible future deeper collaboration with Alibaba's Xiami and its overall digital entertainment and SuperVIP membership program, we believe the joining force between Netease and Ali will likely strengthen Netease Cloud Music's competitive positioning against TME,&quot; said Citibank analyst Alicia Yap. Bottom Line on Alibaba Stock: Don't Forget the CashAnother catalyst for Alibaba stock is cash. At the end of the second quarter, the company had cash on hand of $33.72 billion, a year-over-year increase of almost 15%. That's a large enough stockpile to enable the company to do more acquisitions and probably some of size because with Alibaba stock commanding a market value of $460 billion, bolt-on deals are nice, but purchases of scale likely make the most sense.Additionally, Alibaba is likely to continue growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) around 30%, implying the 20.34x forward earnings multiple Alibaba stock is attractive if not inexpensive. Plus, China's expanding e-commerce market, one that is helpful for competitors to Alibaba, benefits the entrenched giant, too.&quot;The growth in recent quarters from all platforms in the industry gives us the comfort that the growing (e-commerce) sector is probably the last to be impacted even in a prolonged period of macro turbulence,&quot; said Bernstein analyst Davi Dai.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"Shares of Chinese premium electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO (NASDAQ:NIO) have been on a roller coaster ride ever since the company went public about a year ago. Over the course of the past year, the NIO stock price nearly doubled from a $6.26 IPO price to $12 within its first few days on Wall Street. That gain was clawed back to $6 over the next few months. Then, the ride took off again in early 2019, going to $14. Then, investors kicked shares lower over the past six months to where they are now, just above $3.Source: THINK A / Shutterstock.com Amid all this volatility, I've consistently sounded a cautious and bearish tone on NIO stock. My thesis has been pretty simple.There are a lot of EV brands in China. Not all of them will make it long term. In fact, very few of them will actually survive. Right now, probabilities and fundamentals suggest that NIO won't be one of the survivors. As such, while NIO stock could go boom long term, the more likely outcome is for the stock to go bust.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI maintain that cautious thesis today.To be sure, there are signs that China's auto market and economy are re-accelerating. That's good news for NIO stock. But, until this company can impress investors with numbers that it will remain a relevant player in China's booming EV market for the foreseeable future, I don't think NIO stock will stage a meaningful move higher.As such, there's no rush to buy into NIO stock today. In this situation, patience is your friend. Monitor the China EV market and NIO's trends in that market from the sidelines. If signs appear that NIO is improving its competitive positioning, buy into NIO stock. Until then, stay away. The Good News For NIOThe good news for NIO stock is that China's economy and auto market appear to be bouncing back after a multi-quarter slowdown.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy On the broad economic front, most data coming out of China implies that the worst of the country's multi-quarter economic slowdown -- which started in early 2018 -- is now in the rear-view mirror. Retail sales trends, in a downtrend since early 2018, have gradually improved over the last few months. PMI readings, similarly in a downtrend since early 2018, have stabilized over the last few months. Industrial profit growth rates have shown consistent improvement throughout 2019. The OECD's composite leading indicator for China has actually improved for five straight months. Many of China's biggest companies -- like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) -- have actually reported better-than-expected numbers over the past few months.Meanwhile, on the auto front, we are seeing similar signs of a turnaround. Specifically, China's auto market has declined for 13 straight months, with many of those months posting sizable declines. But, in July, the market dropped only 4.3%, one of the smaller declines in recent memory. There has also been a push from the government to further support EV adoption in urban areas through the removal of certain auto purchase restrictions which have constricted demand.Overall, then, the economic data coming out of China broadly implies that this country's economy is finally starting to turn the corner, and that China's auto market is following suit. That's all great news for NIO stock. The Bad News For NIOThe bad news for NIO stock is that re-accelerated economic and auto market expansion in China might not create a tide which lifts all boats.The big, overarching problem with NIO is that it is one of 486 EV companies in China. You read that right. There are 486 EV companies in China. That's far too many. In America, there are no more than 20 to 30 electric vehicle companies. In the long run, as China's EV market matures, rationalizes, and consolidates, it will down-size to something very similar to the U.S. EV landscape -- or, about 25 EV companies.In other words, 95% of China's EV companies today, probably won't be around by 2030. Those aren't good odds for NIO.Current trends are similarly unfavorable. NIO's delivery volume peaked in the fourth quarter of 2018 at nearly 8,000 deliveries. Ever since, delivery volume has dropped … significantly. In the first quarter of 2019, NIO delivered less than 4,000 cars. In the second quarter, it delivered around 3,500 cars. This quarter, the company is on track to deliver about 2,500 vehicles.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market In other words, from late 2018 to today, NIO's quarterly deliver volume rate has shrunk nearly 70% and that's with NIO launching a new vehicle in mid-2019.Those are ugly trends. Broadly, they imply that NIO may not have what it takes to last long term in China's auto market. So long as the trends support that thesis, NIO stock will remain depressed. Bottom Line on NIO StockLong term, NIO stock could go boom if the company does turn into the go-to premium EV brand in China's booming electrics market. But the data right now simply does not support this thesis. Instead, it supports the thesis that NIO will be among the 95% of China EV companies that ultimately goes bust instead of boom.As such, the best move right now with NIO stock is to wait-and-see. Wait for more numbers to come out of NIO and China. See if NIO's trends are improving, or not. If they are improving, buy into the rebound bid. If they aren't, continue to stay away until they do.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA and JD.

2019-09-12,"It would seem like the news has been pretty good of late for Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) stock … with one obvious exception. The last two earnings reports have looked impressive. The overhang of a major stockholder is ending. And yet Alibaba stock has stayed stuck, trading sideways since February.Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com To be sure, the U.S.-China trade war presents an apparent stumbling block in front of BABA stock. But rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has outperformed Alibaba shares of late, while facing the same trade-driven macro headwinds at home.JD isn't the only Chinese stock with better returns. Yes, Alibaba Group shares have returned 27% so far this year. That's better than the 16% average of China's 21 U.S.-listed large-cap (&gt;$10 billion) stocks. But that return puts BABA stock just seventh in the group, well behind leaders New Oriental Education & Technology Group (NYSE:EDU) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), the latter of which has almost doubled in the last two-plus months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, relative underperformance, a cheap valuation, and Alibaba's market-leading status would seem to clear a path for BABA stock to finally break through $200 and beyond. After all, it's hard (though not impossible) to see external conditions being much worse, yet Alibaba has grown earnings and Alibaba stock has managed to rise.That path is open. But the concern has to be that if BABA shares stay stuck, it could signal they're going to be stuck for a very long time. What's Gone Right (and Wrong) for Alibaba StockAlibaba Group has had some headwinds in 2019. The trade war has pressured consumer and business confidence in China, as several companies have noted in recent months. Protests in Hong Kong have only added to the geopolitical risk, and likely led to Alibaba's decision to delay its listing on the Hong Kong exchange.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy Major shareholder Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA) is liquidating its Alibaba stock. According to Alibaba's second quarter release, that company (formerly Yahoo!) sold almost 10% of Alibaba shares outstanding between May 20 and August 9.There are pressures on the business and pressures on the stock. And yet Alibaba has posted strong back-to-back earnings reports. Revenue increased 51% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter (ending March) and another 42% in Q1. Adjusted EPS handily beat Street estimates in both quarters.Meanwhile, BABA stock hasn't exactly soared -- but it's held up. The stock bounced from levels around $150 in late May, amid the Altaba selling, and has neared $180 three times in the past few weeks.Given those external pressures, the case for BABA stock here is that in a tough environment, investors still were happy to buy and/or own shares. So what happens when that environment gets better? After all, Altaba's liquidation is likely over at this point. The trade dispute should be resolved at some point, even if that point isn't necessarily anytime soon. Put another way, it seemingly only can get better for Alibaba Group, and for Alibaba stock, from here. Long-Running Concerns About BABA StockThe catch is that for some investors, it's not going to get better for BABA stock. To bears, Alibaba has significant structural problems. Its VIE structure -- shareholders actually own a piece of a variable interest entity in the Cayman Islands, not Alibaba itself -- makes BABA a no-go for some investors.Accounting issues have long dogged the company. They were raised again in the decision to go forward with the Hong Kong listing. As I noted at the time, it was strange for Alibaba to sell stock at seemingly cheap prices to raise capital when it had plenty of cash already. Indeed, the company is paying $2 billion to acquire Kaola from NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), a deal it is financing from cash on hand.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off There have been worries about self-dealing, highlighted by Alibaba's move of Alipay to former CEO Jack Ma. And many investors ignore Chinese stocks altogether, worried about a &quot;hard landing&quot; or, worse, an implosion of the economy still run by a nominally Communist single party. Can Alibaba Group Stock Finally Rally?Those skeptics admittedly could be wrong. &quot;Hard landing&quot; predictions, for instance, have been made for at least this entire decade. The VIE structure could change once Chinese regulations do. And, to at least some extent, a 20x forward P/E multiple incorporates those risks.But at least for now, those skeptics and that skepticism seem to matter. They're at least one reason why a proverbial lid has stayed on BABA stock. (Shares at this point haven't moved for two years now.) They're why, to some investors, Alibaba stock seems like a generational opportunity: an e-commerce leader in a country with over a billion citizens trading at a discount to many U.S.-based large caps with minimal growth. Other investors simply see the stock as a trap at almost any price.If the news around Alibaba stock gets better, particularly with the Altaba overhang gone, BABA stock has to rally. Otherwise, BABA starts to look like a stock that looks cheap - and will always look cheap, given the structural risks assigned by the market. As bearish as I've been on BABA, I can see that path to $200+. If Alibaba stock doesn't take that path, however, it might be time to worry.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-09-12,"In breaking news on Wednesday, President Trump announced that he would delay scheduled tariffs against China by two weeks. As he put it, the delay represents a goodwill gesture to China, and comes at the request of China's Vice Premier, Liu He. And on the surface, this development seemingly bodes well for JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and by extension JD.com stock.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com After jumping to a strong start earlier this year, JD stock encountered upside resistance around the $31 level. In the beginning of April, shares tried to break past this level, but failed, sparking a downward slide. Later in May, JD.com stock tried to break beyond $31, but the markets again stymied the effort.During the past summer, the e-commerce and technology firm enjoyed some strong sessions. In fact, JD.com stock moved beyond the aforementioned resistance level a few times. Unfortunately, the efforts ultimately went for naught.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the one-year chart for JD stock, we can clearly see a consolidation pattern. As InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli noted recently, this pattern is setting shares up for either a breakout or a breakdown. My colleague argues for the former, noting some strong fundamental catalysts. These include a robust and growing Chinese middle class, greater allocation of Chinese GDP to domestic consumption, and an upwardly moving e-commerce market.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Significantly, Taulli also mentioned that the trade war could be beneficial for JD stock. That's because the dispute has driven China to focus on its domestic economy, bolstering JD in the process.With this latest gesture from an otherwise strident Trump, it seems the case for JD.com stock breaking out is won. So, should you act on this diplomatic news? JD.com Stock Remains UnconvincingObviously, President Trump extending a small but meaningful olive branch is important. In the nearer term, no one should be surprised to see names like Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) jump higher.When it comes to China-related developments, the news seemingly kept getting darker for JD stock. With the U.S. and Chinese administration set to discuss their differences, this is the positive narrative that the bulls needed.But the story doesn't end there. Even from early in his administration, President Trump earned a reputation for flip-flopping. Granted, every politician contradicts themselves; otherwise, they wouldn't be politicians. That said, Trump can turn on a dime.Infamously, Trump stated in 2017 that North Korea will be met with &quot;fire and fury&quot; if the hermit nation threatened the U.S. In June of this year, Trump characterized his relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as a &quot;great friendship.&quot;Therefore, JD.com stock has a credibility problem, but it has nothing to do with the underlying company. Instead, we really don't know what's going to happen next. Of course, uncertainty is something that Wall Street dislikes.I'm not sure what the probabilities are regarding a trade deal in the nearer term. But based on Trump's unpredictable nature, I wouldn't bet too high on a resolution. Remember, Trump must look strong to his voting base because he's losing support elsewhere.Therefore, if a deal doesn't materialize, JD stock risks significant volatility. While many China bulls tout the country's massive middle class, we got to put those numbers into context. With a population size of over 1.4 billion people, on a GDP-per-capita basis, the Chinese are still poor. Plus, initiatives to push into China's lower-ranked cities may not pan out due in part to the country's sizable percentage of agricultural workers. What Happens If We Get a Deal?Suppose though that we do get a deal. Does that optimistic scenario spell game on for JD.com stock?Here again, I remain hesitant. I hate to bring up a politically controversial subject, but questions exist regarding China's economic data. For instance, in June of this year, the Chinese city of Guanghan allegedly falsified its economic data.This scandal brings up an uncomfortable topic: when we say that China's middle class is growing robustly, what data is that based on?Additionally, I'm inclined to believe the negative reports as opposed to the fluff stats. Because if China's middle class is booming, why are their auto sales plummeting? Other metrics are falling too. A trade deal probably won't fix these core problems.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now Therefore, the smart move is likely to wait out JD stock. Sure, the technical pattern is interesting. But with a volatile President and an even more volatile economic situation, gambling here seems more risky than rewarding.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-18,"It's tempting to believe that JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is an attractive stock held down only by trade war worries. After all, JD stock, even with a strong 2019, sits about one-third below 2018 highs. And it looks reasonably cheap from a fundamental standpoint, with a 26 times forward multiple despite analyst expectations for 250% growth in earnings per share between 2018 and 2020.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com To be sure, I do believe JD stock is somewhat undervalued. I wrote last month after the company's blowout earnings report that the stock should keep rising. JD.com shares have moved higher, though resistance at $32 continues to hold.And JD stock clearly has taken some hits from trade war sentiment. Most notably, the stock fell 19% in eight sessions starting in late July, during which time the U.S. announced new tariffs on China. The distance from 2018 highs, too, might seem trade-related.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the story isn't quite that simple. That doesn't mean JD.com stock is a sell. Again, I see upside from current levels. But it does mean that a trade war resolution, if and when it comes, might not be the catalyst some bulls hope. The Currency Effect on Chinese StocksThere no doubt is some trade war impact priced into Chinese equities at the moment. For instance, the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) still is down 23% from January 2018 highs.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars But one notable contributor to that decline has been currency. The Chinese yuan has fallen over 10% against the dollar over that span. That means profits -- and expected profits -- are less valuable in American dollars. And given that Chinese companies, including JD.com, generate nearly all of their revenues domestically, currency alone likely has driven roughly half the decline in Chinese stocks over the past 20 months. JD Stock UnderperformsMeanwhile, JD stock -- perhaps surprisingly -- actually has underperformed that ETF over the same period. JD shares have dropped almost 40%. And there have been some company-specific factors driving the decline. 2018 results were disappointing. JD missed Street estimates for revenue in both the second and third quarters. For the year, non-GAAP net income declined 31% in local currency.To be sure, JD was investing in its business, which created some pressure on margins. And the huge second quarter -- in which margins rebounded -- suggests those investments are paying off.Still, this year, revenue growth has slowed, to under 17% year-over-year in the first half. That's notably slower than larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) grew its revenue 169% in the second quarter, albeit off a much smaller base.Again, none of this is to suggest that JD stock is a short or a sell here. At 26x forward earnings, valuation is reasonable in the context of current growth. But there are risks here. A number of key employees have left of late. Margins are exceedingly thin. Any incremental pricing pressure can lead to a repeat of 2018's earnings decline.And some of these issues have been a factor in the underperformance of JD.com stock. This isn't just a trade war problem. Is JD.com the Right Play?Would a trade war resolution help JD stock? Absolutely. But there's certainly a risk that it could be what is known as a &quot;sell the news&quot; event. It's not as if investors have simply dumped the sector: MCHI has gained almost 12% this year and JD.com stock has risen 43%. Some kind of resolution -- at some point -- already is priced in.There's another question as well: Is JD stock necessarily the biggest beneficiary of a trade war resolution? I still think there's an intriguing long-term case for iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) despite disappointing earnings. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) could be interesting as well.Forced to choose, I'd still pick JD. But that choice would be made understanding the risks. Margins are thin, competition is intense and China has economic issues that go beyond tariffs. Those factors will hold with or without a trade war -- and they suggest that JD isn't simply going to soar once a trade accord is reached.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- India became the latest country to ban electronic cigarettes only days after Juul Labs Inc.’s products vanished from online Chinese marketplaces, a sign Asian nations may be no refuge for the industry from an escalating crackdown in the U.S.India’s government announced an executive order Wednesday banning the sale and production of all e-cigarettes, echoing growing concerns worldwide over health risks associated with the smokeless nicotine devices popular with teenagers.“Why are we debating if it’s more harmful or less? It is harmful. It is addictive,” said Preeti Sudan, India’s health secretary. “The entire next generation will be going down the drain if we don’t control it now.”Originally touted as a safer alternative to wean people off cigarettes, e-cigarettes have come under widespread attack in the U.S., especially for their appeal among youth. India’s decision follows similar prohibitions in about 27 other countries including Australia, Singapore and Brazil and comes on the heels of halted online sales of Juul’s products in China, the world’s largest tobacco market.‘Strong’ ActionDespite increasing global curbs on vaping, some nations view e-cigarettes as viable alternatives to smoking, a leading cause of preventable death. And though cigarette companies are getting into the electronic nicotine-delivery business -- including most notably a nearly $13 billion investment in Juul by Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. -- a vaping health scare could cause sales of the tobacco giants’ most important products to jump.Shares of cigarette makers in India gained on news of the ban.U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to “do something very, very strong” after the recent outbreak of a mysterious lung disease linked to vaping that has killed six people in the U.S. and afflicted hundreds of others. Lawmakers in the U.S. are also investigating the marketing of Juul, America’s top-selling e-cigarette brand.U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, told Juul Chief Executive Officer Kevin Burns in a letter dated Tuesday that the company had failed to produce all the documents requested by a House Oversight Committee and that further delay could result in the company receiving a subpoena.Juul only started selling its nicotine vaporizers online in China last week. Its official online stores disappeared on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Tmall and JD.com Inc. by Tuesday, prompting speculation that official action may be on the way.Juul wasn’t given a reason for why its products were pulled, according to a person familiar with the matter, but said in a statement it wants to make them available again.No Reasons GivenThe latest developments in India and China come as a blow to vaping companies that were setting their sights on Asia, where 65% of the world’s cigarettes are sold, as increased pressure in the U.S. forces them to look for growth elsewhere. India alone has 266.8 million tobacco users, according to a WHO factsheet.It isn’t clear if China plans to ban or enforce stricter scrutiny of e-cigarettes or vaping devices. The country’s National Health Commission -- a body responsible for health and sanitation -- announced it was devising legislation for such products in July, arguing the “hazards of e-cigarettes should be highly valued.”The Chinese health commission also said labels describing nicotine concentration on many such products are vague, and can lead to excessive consumption by users.Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has campaigned and given money in support of a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and tobacco.Some nations, however, view vaping as a lesser evil than smoking.Public health officials in the U.K., the biggest market in Europe for the products, endorse vaping as a way to wean people off smoking -- the prevailing view across Europe, where authorities are more sanguine about the effects of vaping.E-cigarettes allow users to satisfy their cravings by inhaling vaporized nicotine rather than tobacco smoke. Their popularity has soared in recent years driven by candy-like flavorings, sleek devices and savvy marketing.The U.S. Surgeon General called it an “epidemic,” after Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters that 5 million American kids said they’ve vaped this year. The Food and Drug Administration has been investigating the safety of e-cigarettes after reports of seizures.(Updates with U.S. lawmaker’s letter to Juul Labs in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Carolynn Look and Shruti Srivastava.To contact the reporters on this story: Ari Altstedter in Mumbai at aaltstedter@bloomberg.net;Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Bhuma Shrivastava, Timothy AnnettFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Tide Turns Against Vaping as India Bans Sales, China Sites Pull Juul"
2019-09-20,"In the stock market, risk and reward are correlated. That is, across all financial markets, the maxim is that as risk goes up, so does reward. Because of this, you won't find many low-risk stocks with multi-bagger potential. Instead, all the stocks with multi-bagger potential are often also accompanied with big risks.Thus, if you're looking for a multi-bagger stock that could rise 200% or more, it's safe to say that you are looking at stocks with big risk profiles.The key in picking winners in this group is to identify the stocks that are more likely to go boom than bust. That is, find the stocks where the upside is compelling enough -- and the probability of the stock realizing that upside is high enough -- to more than compensate for the risks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf Don't have the time to do all that analysis across hundreds of small cap stocks? No worries. I've done some of that leg work for you. Without further ado, then, let's take a look at 5 small cap stocks that could soar 200% or more over the next five years. Plug Power (PLUG)Source: Shutterstock Current Price: $2.80Potential 2024 Price: $12Five Year Upside Potential: ~330%First up, we have hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Most infamous for its 99.9% decline from 2000 to 2019, PLUG stock actually now has all the ingredients of a potential multi-bagger over the next few years.Here's the logic. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has lagged electric battery technology in terms of alternative fuel adoption for several years. But hydrogen tech is starting to catch on. This is especially true in the commercial market, where large enterprises are starting to value the longer life and shorter re-charging times hydrogen fuel cells offer versus their electric battery counterparts. This is largely why Plug Power had reported 20%-plus revenue growth since 2016.Management expects this big growth to continue, driven by expansion of HFC adoption in core commercial markets. Specifically, management is pointing towards $1 billion in revenue by 2024, with $200 million in EBITDA. Is that possible? Yes, but unlikely. Nonetheless, if Plug Power does hit those aggressive targets, the numbers shake out for the company to net about $0.50 in EPS by 2024 and likely somewhere around $0.60 in EPS by 2025.Apply a growth stock average 20-times forward multiple to that $0.60 EPS base in 2025. That implies a 2024 price target of $12, which means that in an &quot;everything goes right&quot; scenario, PLUG stock could rally more than 300% from here over the next few years. Aphria (APHA)Source: Shutterstock Current Price: $6Potential 2024 Price: $24Five Year Upside Potential: ~300%Next up, we have small-cap Canadian cannabis producer Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). Aphria is most famous on Wall Street as being the first Canadian cannabis company to strike a profit. But the company -- and stock -- could be so much more than that in the long run.Consider this. Most company and analyst estimates peg the global cannabis market as growing to $200 billion in annual revenues within the next 10 to 15 years. Let's call it 15 years. Thus, Aphria is at the epicenter of a market that will be $200 billion large in 15 years.Sure, Aphria isn't a big player in that market. But they have a unique and established value prop as the low cost, discount player in the market. That value prop has enduring demand. So long as Aphria maintains that value prop and dominates the discount cannabis niche, this company will forever command a respectable share in the cannabis market.Extrapolate it out. Maybe Aphria nets just 2% share in 15 years. In a $200 billion market, that equates to about $4 billion in revenue. The company already has sky high gross margins. They should pan out around 55% at scale, while big revenue growth will drive the opex rate down to a much more normal 30% in the long run. Therefore, with Aphria, we are talking about a company that within 15 years, could net 25% operating margins on $4 billion in revenue.  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Net net, that combination makes $3.50 in EPS seem doable in 15 years. Based on a market average 16-times forward multiple, that implies a 14-year-forward price target for APHA stock of $56. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 5-year-forward price target of $24 -- about 300% above today's price tag. Jumia (JMIA)Source: Shutterstock Current Price: $10Potential 2024 Price: $30Five Year Upside Potential: ~200%The third stock on this list of potential multi-baggers is African e-commerce company Jumia (NYSE:JMIA).The bull thesis on JMIA stock is that Jumia turns into the JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) of Africa. That is, with an internet penetration rate that is only 40% but rapidly rising, Africa appears positioned for a digital economic renaissance in the 2020s that will look very similar to China's digital economic renaissance of the 2010s, which birthed many multi-billion dollar companies, like Chinese e-commerce juggernaut JD.Here are the numbers. China will close the decade at 60% internet penetration, after starting the decade around 40% internet penetration. Let's say Africa follows a similar 40% to 60% internet penetration ramp in the 2020s. At the same time, Africa projects to have the fastest growing population in the 2020s, and that population skews young. The implication? Of the 1.7 billion people that are projected to be in Africa by 2030, around 1 billion will be on the internet, and those 1 billion will largely skew young and therefore be highly engaged in the digital channel.Let's say Jumia controls just 10% of that market, for 100 million active buyers Let's also say that those buyers spend a very pedestrian $400 per year on Jumia, versus the thousands per year consumers spend on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That would give Jumia a $40 billion gross merchandise value by 2030, which with a historically average 15% take rate, equates to $6 billion in revenue.Further assuming Amazon-like 5% operating margins, that should flow into $300 million in operating profits, which should easily flow into $200 million-plus in net profits. Based on a growth stock average 20-times forward earnings multiple, that implies a $4 billion valuation by 2029. On 80 million shares, you are talking a $50 price target by 2029. Using a 10% discount rate, that equates to a $30 price target by 2024.  New Age Beverages (NBEV)Source: Toshio Chan / Shutterstock.com Current Price: $3Potential 2024 Price: $15Five Year Upside Potential: ~400%The fourth stock on this list of potential small-cap multi-baggers is healthy beverage company New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV).New Age Beverages is trying to be the world's leading healthy beverage company. It hasn't worked out so far. Just look at NBEV stock over the past year. The chart isn't pretty. But thanks to a series of acquisitions, New Age Beverages has finally equipped itself with a respectable portfolio of healthy beverages that appear to be on the up and up, including Marley, Coco-Libre, Bucha Live Kombucha, Evian water and Illy coffee. New Age Beverages has consequently reported very healthy mid to high single digit organic sales growth so far in 2019.I don't see secular health awareness trends going anywhere anytime soon. These trends should create a rising tide which will lift most boats in the healthy beverage market, including New Age's healthy drinks. Further adding firepower to the top-line will be New Age's push into CBD-infused beverages in the very big U.S. cannabis market.Big picture -- the stars have aligned for New Age Beverages to report steady low double digit revenue growth over the next few years. Alongside that healthy revenue growth, margins will move higher because of positive operating leverage and gross margin expansion from a push into higher margin products. Assuming double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, EPS here should reach around $0.75 by 2025.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars Throwing a consumer discretionary sector average 20-times forward multiple on that $0.75 EPS target, we arrive at a 2024 price target for NBEV stock of $15. That is five-fold the current price tag on the stock. NIO (NIO)Source: xiaorui / Shutterstock.com Current Price: $3Potential 2024 Price: $14Five Year Upside Potential: ~370%Last, but not least, on this list of potential breakout small-cap stocks is Chinese luxury electric vehicle maker NIO (NASDAQ:NIO).Often called the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China, NIO hasn't quite lived up to that reputation. Say what you will about Tesla, but from day one, the company's delivery volumes have been on the up and up, and the company has consistently grown reach, deliveries and revenues over a multi-year period.The same has not been true over at NIO. NIO started delivering luxury electric vehicles about a year ago. They company started off red hot, delivering 3,600 vehicles in 3Q18 and nearly 8,000 cars in 4Q18. But the growth narrative has come undone in 2019 amid a massive slowdown in China's auto market, and NIO's quarterly delivery volumes are at 3,500 today… and rapidly dropping.In the big picture, there are simply way too many EV companies in China, and as the market cools, it is consolidating around a few players. The implication is that most Chinese EV companies will go bust, and a few will go boom. Probabilities say NIO goes bust, hence the $3 price tag for NIO stock. But given that this company has crafted a niche for itself in the luxury market, there is a possibility NIO goes boom.Let's say it does go boom. I think China's auto market hits 30 million cars by 2030 and that 25% of those will be EVs -- so about 7.5 million EVs. NIO can maybe control 5% of the market, implying around 375,000 annual deliveries. Assuming a $50,000 ASP and auto average 10% operating margins, I think that production volume easily flows into about $1.40 in EPS by 2030.Assuming a market average 16-times forward earnings multiple, $1.40 in 2030 projected EPS should produce a 2029 price target of over $22. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2024 price target for NIO stock of roughly $14 -- almost 400% above today's price tag.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long APHA, JD, AMZN and TSLA.

2019-09-23,"Despite Friday's stock slide, all-time highs remain a stone's throw away. So until we see more substantial deterioration like support breaks and reversal patterns, it's unwise to bet against the bull. Today's gallery will offer up three stocks to buy right now.The recurring theme tying these beauties together is simply a low-risk entry created by a compelling chart pattern. They come from different sectors which offer a diversified list of choices. One is a video game maker, one is an oil company, and one is a Chinese internet stock.By moving outside of a single sector, we've increased the chances of finding a stock that performs well regardless of where the money flows this week or which area leads.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf Enough with the preamble, on to the picks. Here are three of the best stocks buy this week. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Source: ThinkorSwim Last month Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) shares finally departed their nine-month trading range. The breakout both completed and confirmed a bottoming pattern and signaled the beginning of a new bull market. Thus far, the price action has been very constructive. Pullbacks have been extremely shallow, showing persistent buying pressure beneath the surface.The past week of sideways action has allowed ATVI to digest recent gains and build a base to launch from during its next ascent. With the 20-day moving average fast approaching, the start of its next rally is imminent.Implied volatility is extremely low at 34% or the 10th percentile of its one-year range. That suggests long premium plays are the way to go. A bull call diagonal spread looks particularly good here.Buy the Jan $52.50 call and sell the Oct $57.50 call for a net debit of $4.80. Hess Corp (HES)Source: ThinkorSwim Last week's oil spike lit a fire under energy stocks, sparking a breakout in many names. And the profit-taking seen since then has returned them to attractive entry points. Hess Corp (NYSE:HES) is one of the best looking ones in the sector.Monday's surge vaulted HES stock above a six-month resistance zone amid heavy accumulation. The ensuing retracement has returned it to old resistance creating a potential low-risk entry. The 20-day moving average is also rising beneath and likely to provide some support.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 If HES can trade above Friday's high of $66.63, then consider deploying bullish trades. The low implied volatility makes bull call spreads an interesting bet. Buy the Nov $65/$70 bull call spread for around $2.15. 3 Stocks to Buy Right Now: JD.com (JD)Source: ThinkorSwim JD.com (NYSE:JD) shares are flirting with an upside breakout of their seven-month trading range. And that has traders around the Street perking up. Resistance at the $32 zone is thus far holding firm, but if the bull market rolls on I suspect the ceiling will be smashed in short order.This year's rebound in JD stock has allowed the 200-day moving average to bottom out and turn higher finally. The 50-day and 20-day moving averages are also pointing north. When $32 breaks is anyone's guess, but I suggest being prepared with a trade, so you don't miss out.Today's theme of low implied volatility continues with JD suggesting buying options is smart. Buy the Dec $30/$35 bull call spread for around $2 to $2.30 if the stock pops above $32.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish positions in ATVI.

The travel app is targeting many users across the Indonesian archipelago who have little or no access to traditional banking or reliable internet.Founded by three engineers in 2012, Traveloka -- said to be valued at around $2 billion in 2017 -- has expanded across Southeast Asia by making it easier for consumers to book flights and hotels within the region. It’s raised at least $500 million from investors including Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia. Henry Hendrawan, president of Traveloka operations, said the card was one facet of building a fintech business to complement its travel, accommodation and lifestyle services.“In anything we do in financial services, we will always look to go with strong partners,” Hendrawan said in an interview, adding that he expects to unveil more products and partners in the near future. “This is a perfect example.”With a population of more than 620 million and growing middle class, Southeast Asia is expected to see its online travel market almost triple from about $30 billion in 2018 to $78 billion in 2025, according to Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.

2019-09-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Trump administration officials are discussing ways to limit U.S. investors’ portfolio flows into China in a move that would have repercussions for billions of dollars in investment pegged to major indexes, according to people familiar with the internal deliberations.The discussions are occurring as Washington and Beijing negotiate a potential truce in their trade war that’s rattled the world’s two biggest economies and investors for more than a year. They also come as China is removing limits on foreign investment in its financial markets. A U.S. crackdown on capital flows would therefore expose a new pressure point in the economic dispute and cause disruption well beyond the hundreds of billions in tariffs the two sides have levied against each other.Among the options the Trump administration is considering: delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges and limiting Americans’ exposure to the Chinese market through government pension funds. Exact mechanisms for how to do so have not yet been worked out and any plan is subject to approval by President Donald Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, according to one person close to the deliberations. Trump officials are also examining how the U.S. could put limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, three of the people said, although it’s not clear how that would be done. More Chinese companies in recent years have been added to major indexes that a broad array of investors have access to.‘This Is Huge’ as China Threat Dents Markets: Wall Street ReactsFor instance, hundreds of Chinese businesses have been added into the MSCI Inc.’s indexes since last year — raising questions from Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio and others on Capitol Hill who are advocating for stronger investment restraints and greater scrutiny for Chinese companies in stock indexes and U.S. pension funds. Bloomberg Barclays began adding Chinese bonds to its flagship Global Aggregate Bond Index in April.The S&P 500 Index sold off initially after the news and ended about 0.5% lower, while U.S.-listed shares of China-based companies tumbled. Alibaba Group Holding sank 5.2%, JD.com Inc. lost 6%, and Baidu Inc. fell 3.7%.The White House has been discussing its plans with Rubio. It is now considering whether to back legislation he put forward over the summer that provoked much debate over the issue of how to protect U.S. investors with funds allocated into what are often opaque Chinese companies.The White House has not had any discussions with the Chinese government over the issue, said one person close to the administration. It also wants to keep any action isolated from the broader trade negotiations now underway, the person said.But high on the list of U.S. concerns is the unusual influence the Chinese government has over private sector companies and restrictions Beijing places on the release of some financial information of even listed Chinese firms.Trade War Hasn’t Stopped Wall Street’s $9 Billion China RushThe fresh momentum behind the effort is partly due to a push from lawmakers to demand reciprocity with Beijing and a pending deadline for the government’s main retirement savings fund — administered by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board — to channel billions of dollars into Chinese companies next year, according to several people involved in the discussions.The National Economic Council has been chairing meetings on the issue and the Treasury Department and National Security Council are involved as well, people familiar with the discussions said. While action is not imminent, according to the people, Trump’s advisers are talking through the various options and their expected impact.At a dinner hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington last week, a group of China and finance experts debated the value and risks of a financial decoupling from Beijing, including how it could be done and what the impact on U.S. investors would be.Among the speakers was White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who declined to discuss any specifics, according to people who attended the dinner.Supportive MoodThe evening also featured deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, a China hawk who was just appointed the No. 2 at Trump’s NSC, as well as members of Congress.The push to unilaterally limit Chinese access to American capital is spearheaded by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s most hawkish aides, and officials at the NSC, but people involved in the process say even more dovish advisers have rallied behind some of their suggestions.An NSC spokesman and Navarro declined to comment, and Pottinger didn’t respond to a request for comment. Spokesmen for the White House and the Treasury also declined to comment. What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...“The U.S. has a comparative advantage in provision of financial services. A longstanding U.S. priority has been to open China’s market to its firms and investors. In the last few years, they have gained traction, with China removing barriers to foreign financial institutions and lifting caps on foreign investors. A policy which placed barriers in the path of U.S. portfolio flows to China would sacrifice those gains.”—Tom Orlik, chief economistClick here for the full insightThe arguments for action inside the Trump team vary from simply enforcing U.S. transparency laws and creating a level of reciprocity, to raising national-security concerns with some of the Chinese companies that American pension funds are exposed to, according to people familiar with the conversations.Some of those companies are firms that the U.S. government has identified as bad actors or has imposed sanctions against. The argument continues that Americans would unlikely want to invest in those companies if they had the choice.The market capitalization of the 156 Chinese companies, including at least 11 state-owned firms, listed on the three-largest U.S. exchanges — the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and NYSE American — stood at a collective $1.2 trillion as of late February, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.China earlier this month removed a $300 billion cap on overseas purchases of Chinese stocks and bonds meaning global funds no longer need to apply to purchase quotas to buy the assets. The move is designed to lure more foreign capital into Chinese markets.Next Big PhaseRoger Robinson, president and CEO of RWR Advisory Group who has been working on the issue since the ’90s, said this type of pressure can make a difference. “Treating the unequal financial dimensions and undisclosed material risks associated with China’s presence in the U.S. capital markets will likely represent the next big phase in the bilateral economic relationship,” he said.One of the most extreme arguments for cutting China off from American capital — advanced by Navarro and outside advisers like Steve Bannon — is that U.S. investments in Chinese companies or on China’s exchanges mean that Americans are unwittingly giving financial support to the Chinese Communist Party and a rising strategic and economic rival.QuicktakeHow China’s Trying to Woo Foreigners to Buy BondsTrump would also have the support of hardline advocates, like Bannon, his former chief strategist, and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass. Both are leading the Committee on the Present Danger: China. It’s a group that advocates for total economic decoupling as a way to secure America’s national security.In a recent “threat briefing” — which is how the group titles its meetings — Bannon said American financing have helped spur China’s economic ambitions and technological advances.“The Frankenstein monster that we have to destroy is created by the West. It’s created by our capital,” Bannon said at the Sept. 12 briefing.Rule of Law While some administration officials see these steps as giving the U.S. more leverage in the trade negotiations, others are working hard to ensure the two are kept separate. At the same time, the administration is hesitant to move forward on this out of fear that the already fragile economic relationship between Beijing and Washington could collapse.In particular, officials at the Treasury Department and the National Economic Council are wary of how any action could spook investors and are trying to signal to relevant stakeholders that the rule of law can be trusted. Those officials would want to frame any move as taking action against known bad actors that have persistently been out of compliance with U.S. laws.The NEC is still working on an analysis of the potential impact of any moves targeting financial flows. Just when that might be completed is unclear. Nathan Sheets, former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said action to delist Chinese companies or direct American dollars away from certain firms would be “a big deal” for markets and the bilateral relationship. “Both of those would be very disruptive. On the order of a kind of Huawei announcement,” he added, referring to the Trump administration’s blacklisting of China’s biggest telecommunications-equipment manufacturer.Capital Hill HawksRubio, who sponsored the so-called EQUITABLE Act, is the biggest champion of such efforts on the Hill and his public comments largely mirror what the White House is discussing. The senator applauded the White House’s work on the issue.“This administration deserves credit for their efforts to deal with the threat that the Chinese government and Communist Party poses to U.S. national and economic security, including how Beijing takes advantage of its access to U.S. capital markets for predatory purposes,” Rubio said in a statement.(Updates with markets in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Saleha Mohsin and Mark Tannenbaum.To contact the authors of this story: Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.netShawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Margaret Collins &quot;Peggy&quot; at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Brendan MurraySarah McGregorZoe SchneeweissFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",White House Weighs Limits on U.S. Portfolio Flows Into China

2019-09-27,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks sank the lowest since early September after a report that the Trump administration is considering opening a new front in its trade war with China, fueling angst that the skirmish will derail already fragile global growth.Stocks most sensitive to trade and equities linked to China paced the selling in American benchmark indexes, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq measures sliding more than 1.3%. The S&P 500 eased of its lows when it hit its 50-day moving average. Officials are discussing sweeping limits to capital-market investments among the nations, forcing Wall Street to assess the impact on potentially billions of dollars of assets. Among the most notable Chinese companies traded on American exchanges, Alibaba Group Holding sank more than 6% and JD.com Inc. lost 7%.The latest salvo from the Trump administration in its spat with China over trade rattled financial markets already on edge over rising political drama in Washington and signs that the American economy is cooling. Trade tensions had shown signs of easing in recent weeks ahead of a Chinese delegation’s visit next month for high-level talks.“This back and forth escalation like ‘oh, we’re going to play nice and come to the table and the next day we’re going to limit money flows to this other country’ is just silly and it’s really playing with fire,” Jennifer Ellison, principal at San Francisco-based BOS, said by phone. “This is all part of what makes the economy tick and we could take some steps backwards if we really get this wrong.”A U.S. crackdown on capital flows would expose a new pressure point in the economic dispute and cause disruption well beyond the hundreds of billions in tariffs the two sides have levied against each other. The Invesco China Technology ETF dropped 1.6%, with losses accelerating midday. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF fell 1.4% while the broader iShares MSCI China ETF was off 1.9%. The KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund lost 2.6%.The news overshadowed data showing the U.S. economy cooled a bit in August. Tech shares were already under pressure after Micron Technologies lead losses after it cut its profit forecast, citing the U.S.-China trade war.Elsewhere, Bitcoin slipped for a sixth session close to the $8,000 mark, in its longest losing streak in almost a year. Earlier in Asia, Japanese equities tumbled as a swath of companies traded without the right to the next dividend payment.Here are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index fell 0.8% as of 3:25 p.m. New York time.The Nasdaq 100 lost 1.4%.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.5%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.9%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index declined 0.8%.CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed.The euro rose 0.2% to $1.0938.The British pound declined 0.2% to $1.2307.The Japanese yen weakened 0.1% to 107.96 per dollar.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries fell less than one basis point to 1.68%.Germany’s 10-year yield gained one basis point to -0.57%.Britain’s 10-year yield dipped one basis point to 0.513%.CommoditiesGold declined 0.7% to $1,504.40 an ounce.West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.2% to $55.69 a barrel.&#92;--With assistance from Constantine Courcoulas.To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Ponczek in New York at sponczek2@bloomberg.net;Vildana Hajric in New York at vhajric1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Randall JensenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Stocks Hit 3-Week Low as Trade Tension Rise : Markets Wrap

2019-10-04,"What will today's political games bring tomorrow or the day after? It's far from clear, to say the least. But for Chinese stocks Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), the price charts are offering promising entries for investors willing to ignore headline threats in favor of risk-adjusted opportunities. Let me explain.They're pawns in a politically heated game where the rules of engagement are blurry at best. I'm referring to U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. As most investors are aware, the international trade war has negatively impacted the Asian giant's economy over the past couple of years and proven a foe for bullish investors in many of the country's largest companies.Diversified tech giant Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and large-cap energy producer China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) certainly haven't been immune. Since hitting highs in 2018, those titans of industry are off 20% and 37% respectively. And then there's a difficult 25% drop for the very popular iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:FXI) market barometer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow this political back-and-forth between the U.S. and China has added another layer of uncertainty to Chinese stocks. Over the past couple weeks, the President Donald Trump administration has hinted it's considering a forced delisting of publicly traded stocks domiciled in China.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? To be clear, there is no clarity on how this politically driven move might play out -- or how it might even be accomplished. And many argue whether it's really in the U.S.' best interests to consider going down this road. Bottom line, though, away from the &quot;will he or won't he&quot; headlines driving volatile day-to-day price action in Chinese stocks, shares of BIDU, EDU and JD stock have caught our eye on the price charts. They are names which are in friendly positions for bulls and bears in the weeks and months ahead. Chinese Stocks: Baidu (BIDU)Known to many as China's answer to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) due to its search business and broad reach in other technologies (like autonomous vehicles), BIDU stock is the first of our Chinese stocks to buy. Shares of Baidu have had a tough go due to company-specific issues over the last couple years. But many of those difficulties look to be in the rearview mirror after the company released its last earnings report.What's more, the pressure and price action add up to a below-the-market price multiple opportunity in a name still poised for growth.The price chart in BIDU stock also looks supportive for a turnaround in shares. The monthly view has Baidu stock setting up as an undercut variation of the classic double-bottom pattern. Combined with a &quot;modest&quot; failure of the closely watched 62% Fibonacci support, the possibility of a powerful intermediate low is raised in our technical assessment. The BIDU Stock TradeFor this Chinese stock, I'd suggest waiting for monthly chart confirmation of a pattern low. Waiting until a move above $116 looks like a solid buying strategy. That entry narrowly clears the high of the September pivot bottoming candlestick. This purchase also allows BIDU stock to reclaim the 62% level and should help drive additional buying pressure from bears positioned out of a smaller flag pattern.Along with our next two trade candidates, I'd also recommend a bull call spread in BIDU. It's a safer way to gain exposure in shares given today's volatile trading environment for Chinese stocks. New Oriental Education (EDU)New Oriental Education is another company to consider buying. EDU stock is well-known to growth investors and for good reason. Not only does this prep and online educational services outfit sport double-digit growth, after a significant 50%-plus correction in 2018 shares have been a rare bird within the universe of Chinese stocks as EDU continues to challenge fresh all-time-highs.Currently EDU is forming a tight triangle that's entering its third month of consolidation. With the pattern developing on either side of EDU's former highs, there's solid evidence this platform will lead to a breakout and another large rally into 2020. The EDU Stock TradeFor this Chinese stock, look to buy a slightly out-of-the-money intermediate-term bull call spread. But wait to see if EDU shares can stage a breakout above pattern resistance in the coming days or weeks. JD (JD)JD.com has been likened to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by many investors due to its online retail presence and growing logistics and services businesses. Technically speaking, JD stock is one which could be setting up for either bears or bulls.The monthly chart of this Chinese stock shows two head-and-shoulder patterns. The smaller formation played out well for bears as shares broke neckline support in 2018 and proceeded to tumble by roughly 40% before forming a triple bottom below $20. But the worst may be yet to come. A larger head-and-shoulders formation has developed over the entirety of JD stock's time as a publicly listed company. Ultimately, a breakdown beneath triple-bottom support would confirm a failure of the large pattern's neckline.Alternatively, with JD stock's right shoulder having formed a pivot high against the smaller neckline and 38% retracement level, a failure or upside breakout could be a huge buy signal for shares. A broken pattern can be powerful motivators for new money to come in. Then a bullish phase could begin. The JD Stock TradeWith shares stationed much closer to a pattern failure than confirmation, if JD can clear the August high of $32.28, a buy entry could be close at hand. Still, bears do have the benefit of the developing bearish head-and-shoulders formation. Either way, respecting the price chart to enter and exit and make any long or short positions a more ironclad proposition using JD stock's options market is advised.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-10-10,"Prior to the most recent dust up in U.S.-China relations, the case for Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) was an interesting one. After Alibaba stock peaked in the early summer 2018, shares have consistently met upside resistance. However, an apparent thaw in trade war tensions suggests a potential breakthrough. After all, a Chinese delegation was willing to meet in Washington for high-level talks.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Now, all hope appears dashed and I'm not using any hyperbole. On Tuesday, Bloomberg News broke a startling development that the White House was &quot;discussing blocking government pension funds from investing in China.&quot; Logically, such a measure would have serious implications for BABA stock, along with high-profile names like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).And if that weren't enough, the South China Morning Post reported that the two sides have not made any progress on key trade issues. Because of this stalling in negotiations, the Chinese delegation will leave on Thursday, a day earlier than scheduled. Unsurprisingly, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 300 points following the announcement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou don't need to read between the lines. This is all around bad news for Alibaba stock.  * 10 Best Cloud Growth Stocks Right Now Of course, the contrarians will argue that BABA stock represents great value. For one thing, Alibaba Group admittedly has great fundamentals. Profitability margins beat out most competitors in the broader retail segment. Revenue growth is very impressive. Just a few years ago, BABA racked up only $15.6 billion in annual sales. Currently, it's on pace to exceed $60 billion.Of course, Alibaba Group offers myriad innovations that bolster the longer-term narrative. But none of these things will matter for Alibaba stock in the interim with President Trump in the driver's seat. Alibaba Stock Has an Executive ProblemI'm not too sure which way most InvestorPlace readers sway when it comes to politics. But based on prior interactions, I'd guess conservative.If that's true, most of you can rejoice: I believe the evidence strongly points to President Trump winning a second term next year. But that's also bad news if you have substantial exposure to BABA stock.Now, you might be thinking, &quot;how could Trump possibly win when he is polling so poorly?&quot; I would counter, though, that we should note that polls aren't always accurate, as the 2016 election proved.But more importantly, I don't see the Democrats and the broader left-leaning politicians forwarding any substantive policies. Every time I turn on the news, I'm inundated with cries about Trump's alleged racism. And leading Democratic candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden have bluntly called Trump racist and divisive.What's the problem with all this? Well, people simply get tired of politicians pulling the race card to further their agendas. I agree with The Wall Street Journal op-ed writer Jason L. Riley, who bemoaned the extreme obsession with racial politics.And with the racism charge dulled, the Democrats have no solutions for real, everyday Americans. This above all else probably explains why most Americans believe Trump will win reelection, even with getting impeached.Again, that's bad news for Alibaba stock. No other president in recent memory has imposed such a tough, no-nonsense approach to China. With Alibaba Group in particular being the Asian juggernaut's flagship corporation, I don't see a positive outcome for BABA stock in the nearer term.Let's also remind ourselves that saving face is a highly revered component of Chinese culture. Right now, the Chinese are losing a lot of it thanks to Donald J. Trump.  * 7 Funds to Buy If the Market Turns Sour  Trump Is Doing What Must Be DoneObviously, the trade war is not a popular topic no matter who's side you're on. Small businesses that depend on warm U.S.-China relations have been disproportionately hurt. If tensions continue, all American consumers will start bearing the cost of this conflict.But what makes this situation especially awkward for stakeholders of Alibaba stock is the trade war's moral reality. If the U.S. shows any weakness here, it sends the wrong message to our adversaries: they can steal our intellectual property and stymie American interests with little penalty.President Trump cannot send that message. Especially with an election year coming up, he can't afford to disappoint his core voting base. That bodes poorly for Alibaba stock for the next 12 months. And it will get even worse if we download Trump 2.0.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-15,"On Sept. 19, 2014, Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) went public. In what still is the biggest U.S. IPO of all time, Alibaba stock priced at $68. It closed on its first day at $93.89, a healthy 38% pop.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com On Jan. 6, 2017, Alibaba stock again closed at $93.89. It had spent some 26 months trading mostly sideways, in fact dipping below its IPO price during the early 2016 broad market correction.But this time, $94 was a buying opportunity. Within three weeks, BABA stock was above $100, and never would dip into the double-digits again. The rally continued at an aggressive pace: BABA cleared $200 in less than 18 months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals Since then, however, the range-bound trading that marked BABA stock's first two-plus years on the public markets has returned. Monday's close of $171.16 puts the stock back to where it traded in August 2017 -- a little over 26 months ago.Investors who have long waited for Alibaba stock to finally rally again might hope that history will repeat. The problem at the moment is that, timing aside, it's not at all clear why or how that can happen. Is the Trade War to Blame for the Pressure on BABA Stock?Fundamentally, Alibaba stock looks cheap. It trades at an even 20x FY21 (ending March) consensus EPS. That low multiple comes despite the Street projecting 26% earnings growth next year, on top of a 23% increase this year.The 20x multiple doesn't even include potential optionality, most notably through the company's 33% stake in Ant Financial. That payment company has provided minimal help to Alibaba earnings so far -- but raised money at a $150 billion valuation last year. Assuming that valuation holds, Ant would account for over 10% of the current market capitalization of Alibaba Group.A common answer as to why BABA stock trades so cheaply is the trade war. Investors may well be worried that the impact to the Chinese economy from U.S. tariffs will slow that growth. Move FY21 earnings from a current consensus of $8.65 to something closer to, say, $7.50, and now Alibaba stock trades at 23x forward EPS. That's a premium to U.S. megacap tech plays like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) despite roughly similar growth in this scenario.But I'm skeptical the trade war necessarily is the key driver here -- or that a resolution of the dispute will lead to a sustained rally in Alibaba stock. After all, BABA's one big rally on the public markets began not long after the U.S. presidential election.Surely investors heard Donald Trump during the campaign. His plans likely seemed a potential negative for Chinese companies like Alibaba; indeed, BABA stock (unlike most U.S. equities) declined the day after Trump's surprise win. And rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has rallied nicely this year amid trade war worries, even if it declined much further during the late 2018 sell-off.A surprise trade deal no doubt would give Alibaba stock a nice pop. But as with the market as a whole, it seems too simplistic to argue that investors will simply send the stock up 10% or 20% once the trade dispute is resolved. It seems reasonably likely that investors expect a resolution at some point, and thus aren't pricing long-term effects into Alibaba stock. Can Earnings Drive Alibaba Stock Higher?Alibaba shareholders might well look to earnings, due in about a month, as a catalyst for the stock. After all, Alibaba historically has performed well relative to expectations. That includes solid beats with both fiscal Q4 and Q1 earnings.But those beats have done little for BABA stock. Shares actually sold off following the fourth quarter report. A post-Q1 rally faded quickly.In fact, it seems like earnings, if anything, could be a negative for BABA shares. Investors expect hugely impressive numbers -- and even when Alibaba delivers, don't always reward the company for doing so. Good numbers probably aren't enough to bring skeptics in, while bad news can shake the confidence of impatient shareholders.If bad news is punished, and good news met with a shrug, then Alibaba Group could be in a tough spot ahead of next month's release. Trust in Alibaba GroupThe broader problem I've long noted with BABA stock is that many investors just don't trust the company. The transfer of Alipay (now known as Ant Financial) from Yahoo! (now Altaba (OTCMKTS:AABA)) and Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) raised real worries about shareholder rights. The Cayman Islands VIE setup spooks other investors.The way the company is currently constituted, and managed, means that Alibaba stock is going to get a persistent discount to U.S. names. Much of the argument around the stock centers on just what that discount should be. Is there a risk that one day, Alibaba simply removes the profit rights of Alibaba stockholders? Is Alibaba's accounting trustworthy?This problem can be ameliorated over time. With Jack Ma moving on, new CEO Daniel Zhang can put his own imprint on the company. Perhaps a trade war deal will open Chinese markets -- and allow for actual ownership in the company, not in a VIE entitled to some of its profits. (This was one of the hoped-for effects of the company's now-postponed Hong Kong listing.)But in the meantime, Alibaba stock still is a no-go for many investors -- and a stock with significant questions, as Ian Bezek pointed out this summer. That's not going to change any time soon.So what moves BABA stock higher? It's hard to answer that question, but maybe that itself is the answer. It's possible a rally will simply come once the stock gets too cheap, even for more risk-averse investors. After all, the rally that began in late 2016 didn't have a spark beyond higher optimism on U.S. stock markets after 26 months of sideways trading. The best near-term hope for BABA stock might be that history repeats on both fronts.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-15,"Theoretically, it was the news that Wall Street was anxiously seeking. After a protracted trade war between the U.S. and China that left neither side as the clear victor, investors were ready to move forward with a productive relationship. Of course, one of the biggest beneficiaries would be China-based investments, such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and JD stock.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Following a series of tense negotiations between American and Chinese delegates last week in Washington, President Donald Trump made an announcement: critically, the two sides have agreed to a temporary truce, which he has termed a &quot;phase one deal.&quot; According to a CNBC report:As part of that deal, China will address intellectual property concerns raised by the U.S. and buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products. In exchange, the U.S. agreed to hold off on a tariff hike set for this week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAgain, on surface level, the news bolsters the argument for JD stock. Additionally, the apparent warming of relations opens the possibility of comebacks for major Chinese companies, such as Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). At least as far as stakeholders of JD.com are concerned, shares moved higher on last Friday's session, as well as on Monday.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now But is this announcement enough to get those on the sidelines to believe in JD.com? Despite the positive implications of this truce, the markets were unimpressed, turning in a muted performance.Ultimately, I believe this was due to a lack of credibility. As we see with the wild gyrations with JD stock since spring of this year, trade negotiations have been all talk and little meaningful action. Based on the headlines, I wouldn't chase JD.com here. JD.com Is Stuck in a Cloud of UncertaintyOver the years, Chinese stocks have generated considerable interest stateside. However, the one critical factor in China's massive growth is the U.S. As the world's largest exporter, China requires a robust relationship with American corporations and consumers.Of course, with a more lasting trade deal, the optics for JD.com stock improve significantly. But what's telling is that only one side - the Trump administration - expresses definitive optimism. According to China Daily, the country's official state-owned English-language newspaper:While the negotiations do appear to have produced a fundamental understanding on the key issues and the broader benefits of friendly relations, the Champagne should probably be kept on ice, at least until the two presidents put pen to paper.That doesn't sound like a trade deal is imminent. In my view, the Chinese government is leery about President Trump's seemingly erratic behavior. At least in this regard, I don't blame them. I'm also not surprised that JD stock really hasn't moved since the end of March.Now, it's true that China has attempted to diversify its economy. In recent years, the government has introduced monetary, structural and fiscal reform to help transition an export-driven economy into a consumption-drive one. On paper, this should give China the edge in this current geopolitical conflict.But in order for this strategy to work effectively, the Chinese consumer must be strong. And that's exactly what it's not, according to Victor Shih, Ph.D., associate professor of political economy at the University of California, San Diego. In an email correspondence, Shih described that the average Chinese households &quot;are trapped between much higher food prices and uncertainties about future income.&quot;Such a negative dynamic will put off discretionary spending. Naturally, this is a net negative for JD stock. Avoid JD Stock Until a Deal Is DoneMoving forward, we have two basic ways to play JD.com stock: gamble on the signing of a permanent trade deal or stay on the sidelines until you know for sure.If you're not a professional trader, you're better off waiting. For one thing, Trump is an unpredictable world leader. His recent actions in Syria angered Christian evangelicals, who largely represent ardent support for his administration.That shows you that Trump is a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; type of leader. And gambling on that is always a tough business.Second, I don't like the variables that the upcoming election poses for the trade war. As I've argued before, the president cannot look weak to his conservative base. Wavering on China, an issue which has dogged both the Obama and Bush administrations, carries significant risk.Therefore, I see more chances of things going badly for JD stock than the other way around. The smart move is to wait for this noise to fade, if it fades at all.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesian President Joko Widodo has offered the 35-year-old co-founder of the country’s biggest startup, Gojek, a position in his new cabinet, affirming the importance of the internet sector in propelling Southeast Asia’s largest economy.Nadiem Makarim on Monday told reporters he has accepted a cabinet post after resigning with immediate effect as chief executive officer of the ride-hailing giant he started nine years ago. That leaves the $10 billion startup, one of Southeast Asia’s largest, without its most visible leader at a time it’s pursuing funding to compete with arch-rival Grab Holdings Inc. Gojek said President Andre Soelistyo and co-founder Kevin Aluwi will take the helm as co-CEOs. The company will outline its next steps in the coming days, Gojek said in an emailed statement.Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, will specify the role to be taken up by Makarim in a later announcement. Makarim’s appointment -- in line with the Indonesian president’s stated desire to include professionals and millennials in his second-term team -- shouldn’t disrupt operations at Gojek given its deep bench of experienced managers.“This means President Jokowi’s new cabinet will be filled with young people with ability to execute,” said Willson Cuaca, managing partner of East Ventures, one of the most active Indonesian-focused venture capital firms. “It shows that Indonesia appreciates what they’ve done for the country. For Gojek, it’s reached a point that even if Nadiem resigns, it’s business as usual.”The Gojek co-founder hails from a prominent Indonesian family. His grandfather was part of the delegation that won the country’s independence from the Netherlands in a 1949 conference at The Hague.“Since the beginning, my mission in Gojek has been to display Indonesia on the world’s stage,” Makarim told reporters when he announced his resignation in Jakarta on Monday. “So, this is a continuation of that mission, but this is certainly for the state and within a bigger scale.”Read more: Jokowi Eyes $7 Trillion Indonesia Economy With New CabinetGojek is the largest player in an Indonesian internet industry that’s booming as smartphone adoption there explodes. The world’s fourth most populous country with 264 million people has produced other unicorns including Tokopedia and Bukalapak, which are driving e-commerce and the digital economy more generally.Makarim started Gojek in 2010 as a call center arranging couriers in Jakarta. At that early stage, everything was done manually -- employees called motorbike drivers one by one until someone accepted an order -- and Makarim had to work at other startups in order to sustain Gojek.It was only in 2014 that the Gojek chief decided to introduce a mobile app, with backing from private equity investor Northstar Group. When that debuted in January 2015, the service was so popular that Gojek couldn’t cope with demand, Makarim said in an interview in 2016.Gojek today has more than 2 million drivers and 400,000 merchants, while its apps have been downloaded more than 155 million times in Southeast Asia. The company counts Google, JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. among its investors and is seen as an icon for aspiring Indonesian entrepreneurs.Makarim was selected as one of 50 people who defined global business in 2018 by Bloomberg Businessweek.Southeast Asia’s Internet Economy to Top $100 Billion This YearTo contact the reporters on this story: Yoolim Lee in Singapore at yoolim@bloomberg.net;Viriya Singgih in Jakarta at vsinggih@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, ;Thomas Kutty Abraham at tabraham4@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Gojek’s 35-Year-Old Chief Is Joining Indonesia’s New Cabinet
2019-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- ESR Cayman Ltd., a logistics real estate developer, is seeking to raise as much as HK$11.4 billion ($1.45 billion) in what could be Hong Kong’s second-biggest initial public offering this year.The company and some shareholders including Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs Investments Holdings (Asia) Ltd. are offering 653.7 million shares at HK$16.20 to HK$17.40 apiece, according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg. ESR in June postponed its IPO attempt of raising as much as $1.24 billion, citing unfavorable market conditions.ESR’s offering attracted Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System as a cornerstone investor, with the Canadian pension fund agreeing to subscribe for a total of about $585 million of stock, based on mid-point pricing, the terms show.The comeback of ESR would further propel Hong Kong’s IPO market momentum even as anti-government protests continue to rock the city. The developer’s share sale would trail Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd.’s $5.8 billion IPO last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The city’s first-time share sales have slumped by 43% to $18.4 billion so far this year from the same period last year, the data shows.The rapid growth of e-commerce in Asia Pacific, fueled by local players such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., has boosted demand for logistics warehouse systems. ESR is raising capital as it continues to expand in the region. It bought a majority stake in Singapore’s Sabana Investment Partners Pte. after pledging to invest more than $1 billion in a logistics park in Yokohama, Japan.APG Asset Management, General Electric Pension Trust and JD.com Inc.’s Jingdong Logistics Group Co. are also among the seven holders selling shares in the IPO.ESR aims to price the offering on Oct. 25 before beginning trading on Nov. 1, the terms show.

2019-10-23,"iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) stock keeps slipping. The stock touched an eight-month low earlier this month, and even with a recent rally sits 43% below February highs.Source: Faizal Ramli / Shutterstock.com There are some fundamental reasons for the decline. Trade war worries have pressured the Chinese economy. As a result, iQiyi's advertising sales dropped 16% year-over-year in the second quarter after a flattish performance in Q1. That weakness was just part of a Q2 report that looked concerning for IQ stock.That said, other Chinese companies are seeing similar pressures. And their shares have held up better. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), for instance, trades just 13% below its 52-week high. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which like IQ is more of a growth play, is 7% off its highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold Through 2020 The divergence in IQ stock suggests that at least part of the problem could lie with U.S. investors, rather than Chinese economic conditions. What that means for the stock might depend on whether those U.S. investors are right. iQiyi Stock UnderperformsAs noted, IQ stock has underperformed larger Chinese consumer plays. But the divergence holds looking elsewhere in the group. In fact, among 42 Chinese stocks with a market capitalization above $2 billion, only three are farther from their highs than IQ stock.Admittedly, two of those three are Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), which, like iQiyi, have seen pressure on ad sales. That said, IQ hardly has the same exposure to advertising. Roughly 30% of its second quarter revenue came from advertising. For Baidu, the figure was over 80% excluding iQiyi, which is included in its financial statements. (Baidu still owns a majority stake in iQiyi.)Meanwhile, IQ stock hasn't had a steep post-earnings fall, as both BIDU and SINA have. And yet it has performed almost as poorly. Obviously, trade war and macro worries have played a part. But essentially every other Chinese stock faces similar exposure, as even the largest companies still have minimal international exposure.The relative decline does make IQ stock intriguing for Chinese bulls -- as I've argued twice before. But the fall might not suggest the stock actually is cheap if the decline is coming, at least in part, from a rational response by U.S. investors. Is NFLX Stock Hitting IQ Stock?IQ stock seems to be underperforming Chinese peers despite decent earnings performance. (Both quarters have looked solid, though the company did miss second-quarter earnings per share estimates by a penny.) That might signal an opportunity. Bigger declines during the trade war should in turn lead to bigger gains if and when that dispute is resolved.I have made a similar case for IQ stock before, most recently in June. More so than other Chinese plays -- even leaders like BABA and JD -- IQ seemed to have the most potential for a rally when sentiment toward Chinese stocks improved. That thesis played out at the beginning of this year: iQiyi stock nearly doubled on its way to February highs.But there has been a notable change since February. U.S. investors are much, much less willing to pay up for unprofitable growth stocks. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), for instance, to which iQiyi is often and not always accurately compared, has seen its shares drop over 25%. The pressure on recent IPOs like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) has been well-documented as well.The weakness in NFLX stock, in particular, may be causing IQ stock to slide. Much of the fundamental case for IQ since its IPO has been based on the valuation gap on a price-to-revenue basis between the two streaming companies. Some investors may see a cheaper NFLX as implying a cheaper IQ.But the broader pressure on stocks similar to IQ might be more to blame. Investors even are focusing on profitability in cannabis stocks. Cash-burning, loss-making stocks are not in vogue on U.S. markets right now. iQiyi stock is one of those stocks at the moment. To Buy or to Sell?If that indeed is the case, that makes the case for IQ perhaps more complex. Many investors believe a trade war resolution will boost stocks (though I'm personally skeptical on that front), and it might seem like consumer-focused IQ stock would be an obvious beneficiary.But if the problem includes pressure on unprofitable growth names, the trade war catalyst isn't as strong. And given the obvious near-term risks to waiting for some movement on that front, it's tough to recommend IQ stock at the moment.Of course, for risk-loving investors, the decline makes the stock even more attractive. IQ stock right now is valued at a little over $100 per subscriber. Netflix subscribers, when NFLX traded near $400, were worth as much as $1,000 each on the public markets.That kind of gap suggests iQiyi stock could have enormous upside if investors return to growth stocks and sentiment toward the Chinese economy improves. For investors willing to bet on both those developments, there may be no better opportunity in this market.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-30,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s technology ambitions are at the epicenter of the nation’s trade dispute with the U.S. Not that you’d know it from the bond market.Credit investors who bought Chinese tech debt at the start of the year are sitting on a 13% return, more than any other sector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Industry titans from JD.com, Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. are in favor with $213 billion wealth manager Pictet Wealth Management. With the trade war hanging over the global economy and tech in particular, this may seem counterintuitive. But President Donald Trump’s efforts to rein in Huawei Technologies Co. and force supply chain changes have little impact on large parts of the industry that are focused on domestic demand. Plus, the revenues of tech manufacturers that don’t export to the U.S. aren’t directly hit by Trump’s tariffs.“There are no Asian countries that are completely immune to the U.S.-China trade conflict, but we do see some resilient Chinese corporates,” said Thomas Wu, head of Asia fixed income at Pictet, highlighting Sunny Optical, JD.com and Tencent. “The tech-internet sector has been quite defensive in terms of how it’s faring in the trade war.”While the trade tariffs have seen some component makers like Sunny Optical look to set up factories outside China, their revenues are still largely dependent on customer demand, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.Domestic consumers accounted for 84% of Sunny Optical’s revenue last year, while exports to the U.S. contributed only 2.1%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For online retailer JD.com and internet giant Tencent, domestic demand accounted for at least 97% of their revenue in 2018.Even Huawei bonds aren’t faring too badly. The tech giant’s parent Huawei Investment & Holding Co. saw a strong onshore yuan bond debut last week, spurred in part by nationalistic buying. Its dollar bonds due 2026 and 2027 have returned at least 18% this year, beating the 10% from a Bloomberg Barclays index for emerging markets in Asia. Local demand accounted for more than half of the firm’s revenue last year.U.S. regulators are set to vote next month on a proposal to prevent government subsidies from being spent on gear from Huawei. The Trump administration in May moved to restrict U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese tech giant, but it has since issued temporary licenses allowing some sales to the company.For the best returns from investing in Chinese corporate bonds, “technology selections need to be internally focused rather than exposed to what’s going on outside,” said Leo Hu, senior portfolio manager for hard-currency emerging market debt at NN Investment Partners Ltd., who doesn’t expect the U.S. to lower the tariffs on Chinese goods in the near term.Firms focused on certain parts of technology as well as the consumer sector will be the “rising stars” for China credit, according to Hu. The country’s large population and established industrial ecosystem will support its tech sector, he said.(Corrects name of fund in second paragraph of story initially published Oct. 29)To contact the reporters on this story: Rebecca Choong Wilkins in Hong Kong at rchoongwilki@bloomberg.net;Annie Lee in Hong Kong at olee42@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Neha D'silva at ndsilva1@bloomberg.net, Magdalene FungFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","China Tech, at Center of Trade War, Is Haven for Bonds"

2019-11-01,"Since its 2014 initial public offering, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has been measured against its rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). For its part, JD stock has been on a bumpy upswing for most of the year, but that's not the only similarity.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Alibaba's share of the market is much larger, which has made it to some investors the simplest play on long-term growth in China. But JD's logistics expertise and room for market share gains have given it potentially higher growth, making it (usually) a higher-reward, if higher-risk play.For public investors, in particular, JD stock and BABA stock basically have been the only choices in Chinese eCommerce. Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) has had a more narrow focus on the discount space and clearly has lost market share in recent years. (Before a recent rally, VIPS stock had fallen 80%-plus from 2015 highs.). Other large retailers like Gome and Suning are privately held.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the two-horse race has a new entrant: Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD). Pinduoduo has existed for less time than JD.com has been public, but its growth has been extraordinary. And with JD stock again hitting resistance at $32 ahead of third-quarter earnings next month, it's fair to wonder if that growth is starting to impact investors' perception of, and appetite for, JD shares. When Will Pinduoduo and JD.com Collide?From a broad perspective, Pinduoduo and JD.com don't necessarily look like competitors. Both companies are Chinese e-commerce plays, admittedly. But JD.com has taken a broad approach to online retail. (It, as I and others have noted, is much more &quot;the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China&quot; than is Alibaba, which often is given that designation.) It owns its inventory, unlike Alibaba and Pinduoduo. It's building out a world-class logistics network.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November Pinduoduo, meanwhile, has more of a niche business model. It's targeted rural and smaller cities. Its selection tends toward the lower end in terms of price, to the point that the company remains dogged by a reputation for counterfeit goods. With the help of Tencent Holdings' (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) WeChat the company offers special buys for groups.But the two companies likely are heading for more direct competition. On recent conference calls, JD.com management repeatedly has talked up its effort to move into &quot;lower-tier&quot; (ie. smaller) cities. Meanwhile, Pinduoduo is going in the opposite direction, targeting urban consumers. It's even sold the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 11, a noted departure from its core assortment.In other words, each company is moving onto the other's turf. So while the battle between JD.com and Alibaba remains important, the fight against Pinduoduo now matters for JD stock as well. Who Will Win?As far as stock prices go, PDD is the clear winner of late. While JD stock has traded sideways for seven months, Pinduoduo stock has more than doubled since July. At Wednesday's closing prices, Pinduoduo actually has a modestly higher market capitalization than does its rival.In terms of the businesses, JD.com remains ahead. JD.com no longer discloses gross merchandise value, the total value of goods ordered on the platform. But 2018 GMV for Pinduoduo was barely one-fourth that of JD.com. (The revenue gap is far larger, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Since JD.com owns its inventory, it books 100% of a sale as revenue, while Pinduoduo does not.)But Pinduoduo no doubt is closing on JD.com for second place in eCommerce market share. Its revenue increased 159% year-over-year in the second quarter. JD.com's sales grew a still-impressive, but far smaller, 23%. Meanwhile, Pinduoduo actually has more users, even if the GMV gap shows that those users clearly spend less on that platform than do JD.com shoppers.And there's some evidence that Pinduoduo is starting to become a real rival to both JD.com and Alibaba. CEO Colin Huang said on the Q2 conference call that 48% of GMV in June came from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, up from 37% as recently as January. He claimed that competitors were framing its products as &quot;cheap, because they are low-quality or even knockoffs, [but] today our results have firmly demonstrated otherwise.&quot;Meanwhile, last week Huang reportedly claimed that Pinduoduo had surpassed JD.com in gross merchandise value. Given figures released by both companies, that seems unlikely (and, according to the report, Huang didn't cite exact numbers). But Pinduoduo has aimed to move its GMV past that of JD.com for some time now, and at the least it's making progress toward that goal.Between 150%-plus revenue growth and the expansion into JD.com's existing territory, Pinduoduo clearly is becoming a threat. The question for JD stock is to what extent that threat might be priced in. The Case for JD StockIt's possible Pinduoduo's rise -- again, the company was founded only in 2015 -- has impacted JD stock of late, particularly with the recent impressive top-line performance from Pinduoduo. JD.com shares have rallied nicely so far this year, gaining 51%. But the stock threatened an all-time low in December, and it still sits over 35% below late 2017 highs.And at these levels, JD stock still looks somewhat attractive. It's managed to expand margins nicely this year, and should do so again next year. The current price just below $32 suggests just a 26x multiple to 2020 consensus earnings per share estimates. In this market, that's not a terribly aggressive valuation, particularly if the company can keep growing revenue by a double-digit percentage clip.Even with a rising Pinduoduo, that target should be reachable. After all, Chinese e-commerce is not a zero-sum game. Despite trade war pressures, the overall economy continues to rise. E-commerce penetration should increase for some time to come. There is room for more than one winner in China, just as there is in the U.S. And both companies have ambitions to expand internationally, even if those plans remain years off.Meanwhile, JD.com has responded to Pinduoduo with a text-based app of its own, Jingxi. Jingxi too will have access to WeChat, a notable edge given that Tencent has blocked shopping links from Alibaba's Taobao for years.That said, resistance for JD stock has held firmly at $32 for months now. And as I wrote last month, there are risks to the stock. Pinduoduo increasingly looks like another one. It's going to aggressively compete for market share. In the process, it can drive pricing downward, which can resurrect the margin concerns that plagued JD.com stock in 2018.I still like JD stock long-term, and I'd bet the stock will break through resistance at some point. But this is not a simple, 'set it and forget it' play, and that's doubly true given Pinduoduo's rise. JD.com investors will be watching their company's earnings closely next month -- but they should take a long look at Pinduoduo's results as well.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-01,"Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is expected to report its third-quarter earnings during the last week of November.Currently trading at $31.40, JD stock rose 12.3% in October and it's up 50% so far in 2019. That's a huge improvement over the company's performance in 2018, when JD surpassed the $50 level -- an all-time high -- but ultimately lost nearly 48% of its value. However, its 2019 recovery has been effectively stalled for months, with JD stock unable to surpass the $32 level. Will those Q3 earnings re-ignite the recovery of JD.com stock?Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Here are some of the big factors to consider when evaluating JD stock, starting with why 2018 turned into such a miserable year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2018: JD.com Hits a Record High, Then Drops Like a RockAt the start of 2018, JD stock was on a tear. Shareholders had seen their investment gain rapidly through much of 2017 before JD stumbled through the fall. But at the beginning of 2018, it took off again at a rapid clip.After ending 2017 at $41.42, JD closed at a new all-time high of $50.50 on Jan. 26, 2018. But it was all downhill from there.  By mid-November, JD had bottomed out below $20 and it ended 2018 at $21.71, little more than half of what it had been worth at the beginning of year. So what happened that was so catastrophic to JD stock?A number of factors hurt JD. The trade war between the U.S. and China was simmering. Tariffs the U.S. imposed began to have an impact on the Chinese economy, and anything that hurts the economy negatively impacts consumer spending. That's never good news for an e-commerce company like JD.Also of concern to investors was a slowdown of JD's revenue growth. In Q3, the company blamed lower demand for big-ticket items for a year-over-year revenue increase of just 25%, its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth. In September, JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu was arrested in Minnesota after being accused of raping a university student. That only added to the declines of JD stock. Will Economic Factors Derail JD?That takes us to 2019. JD.com started strong, but since April it has been stuck in the $31 to $32 range, repeatedly slipping, then recovering, but unable to break out. The company has had some big wins -- its record-setting sales during its June annversary celebration gave JD a boost in June.  Two months later,  the company's Q2 results shattered expectations, with EPS of 33 cents compared to the expected 7 cents.The macroeconomic factors that can impact the success of JD.com aren't going away, though. The trade war continues to be an issue, despite recent signs that it might be cooling. But China's economy continues to slow. Several weeks ago, it was reported that its quarterly growth had dropped again to just 6%, the lowest level in three decades.  What Do the Pros Think About JD Stock?Should JD.com be in your portfolio, and if so is now the right time to buy it? Among the 41 investment analysts polled by CNN Business, the consensus is that JD is a &quot;buy.&quot; If the company's Q3 earnings are in-line with its earlier guidance, expect JD stock to pop.However, it's possible that China's poor economy could cause the company's results to miss expectations.  In that case, JD would take a hit, at least in the short-term. Even in a worst-case scenario, no one expects a repeat of 2018, and no one is suggesting that the owners of JD.com stock have to sell their shares.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But let's hope that a phase one deal gets done, and that it leads to a phase two agreement. China and the U.S. coming together could be the catalyst that the global economy needs. Singles DayMonday, Nov. 11 will kick off the Singles Day holiday, a massive one-day annual shopping event in China that was coined by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). The stock has been trading quite well leading up to the event, hitting its highest level since May -- when trade-war tension crushed BABA lower.In any regard, it's not just Alibaba that benefits from the holiday, although it is certainly the biggest winner when it comes to sales and gross merchandise volume.Much like when Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and others benefit from Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) mid-summer Prime Day event, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and other Chinese retailers enjoy Alibaba's Singles Day.One cool feature from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is how much of a role it plays in e-commerce and analytics. From its outlook, the company believes, &quot;Singles' Day (Nov. 11) is expected to generate more revenue than the popular U.S. shopping holidays Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the weekend in between combined.&quot;One last thing worth mentioning?Alibaba is still planning a secondary offering in Hong Kong, despite continued unrest in the nation. According to reports, the company plans to do the offering in the last week off November (Thanksgiving week here in the U.S.). Alibaba is looking to raise $10 billion to $15 billion in the sale and would represent the world's &quot;largest-ever cross-border secondary listing.&quot;Alibaba IPO'd in 2014 on the New York Stock Exchange. Movers in the Stock Market TodayShares of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) had a relatively mellow closing price, about flat on Friday. Despite the headline finishing result, the stock had a much wider trading range on Friday after reporting its third-quarter results.Earnings of 32 cents per share topped expectations by 9 cents, while net bookings of $1.21 billion beat estimates by $50 million despite falling 12.3% year-over-year. Surprisingly, shares are holding up despite underwhelming fourth-quarter guidance. Management expects Q4 earnings of $1.15 per share and net bookings of $2.65 billion vs. expectations off $1.27 per share and $2.7 billion, respectively.In an interesting M&A twist, HP Inc. (NASDAQ:HPQ) actually tried to buy Xerox (NYSE:XRX) within the past few months. At the time, HP asked for more time to conduct due diligence. That apparently prompted XRX to make a $22 per share offer for HP earlier this week. It's an interesting proposition, given that HP has a market cap about four times the size of XRX.A combination going the other way -- HP acquiring XRX would have seemingly made more sense -- but the former's interest in the latter may increase the odds that the deal goes through. Remember, Carl Icahn owns about 10% of Xerox at the moment. What Else Happened in the MarketBoeing (NYSE:BA) just can't catch a break when it comes to the 737.

2019-11-08,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.U.S. stocks keep rising, with all three major indices at all-time highs. Those gains represent a welcome change in pattern for the market. After all, the fear just a few weeks ago was that history might repeat.Last year's fourth quarter saw equities plunge amid cyclical fears. The peak of last quarter's earnings season led to a 6% decline in major indices in just six sessions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis time has been different, however. Earnings reports have been well-received. Cyclical fears appear to have receded, as housing stocks continue to soar and even major industrials have gained nicely.That said, risks remain. The trade war remains unresolved. The U.S. presidential election is less than a year away, which combined with an impeachment process could increase volatility in the equity market. And with the U.S. economy now in an unprecedented eleventh consecutive year of expansion, fears that a recession is &quot;due&quot; can return at any time.Meanwhile, the earnings calendar might lack some of the market's biggest names -- but it's hardly empty. A number of key companies release earnings reports this week and next, as companies on the retail fiscal calendar report. Next week's reports look particularly important, as they include leaders from several key sectors.  * 7 of the Best Internet Stocks to Buy More good news from those leaders can keep the rally going -- or, in one case, provide some hope for a sector that has been the worst in the entire market this year. But there are enough major companies releasing earnings next week to dim investor optimism if there's any sign of weakness. Rockwell Automation (ROK)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 12, before market openRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) isn't the best-known name to report next week, but the company's fiscal fourth quarter report on Tuesday morning could move some of the market's most widely-held stocks.After all, industrial names have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of earnings season. General Electric (NYSE:GE) rallied nicely. 3M (NYSE:MMM) bounced back after a huge earnings plunge in April. Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has broken out to a new all-time high.Industrial stocks are gaining despite the fact that U.S. manufacturing clearly is in a recession. That seeming contradiction of weakening demand and higher stock prices makes Rockwell's guidance for fiscal 2020 an important data point.After all, investors clearly are pricing in a rebound for the group. And few companies have a better picture of forward demand than Rockwell, who serves manufacturers through both software and motor components and other products. If Rockwell's guidance is strong, that could confirm the rising investor sentiment toward many of its customers. But if Rockwell undercuts that sentiment, it could be a sign that many industrial stocks have rallied far enough -- or too far. D.R. Horton (DHI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 12, before market openHousing and construction stocks like D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) have been some of the market's best performers this year. DHI stock has gained 47.8% so far this year. It hasn't been alone. Shares of rival Lennar (NYSE:LEN) have increased 47%. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, is up 46%.Those gains alone would add import to and increase expectations for any earnings report from D.R. Horton, the country's largest homebuilder. But specific aspects of this release magnify its significance.After all, D.R. Horton will detail its outlook for fiscal 2020, which can move not just homebuilding stocks but residential construction suppliers and distributors. And that outlook comes at a critical point: housing-related stocks actually have weakened in recent weeks despite strength in the broad market. It's for this very reason Louis Navellier -- a savvy investor who made a name for himself picking undervalued stocks -- recommends that his subscribers buy &quot;bulletproof&quot; stocks.In less than a month, DHI shares have pulled back over 6%, and LEN almost 8%. The ITB ETF has retreated almost 5%. Either sentiment has weakened and/or valuation fears are starting to return.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Stock Up On Whatever the precise cause, the sector clearly looks a bit wobbly as the rest of the market gains. The outlook from D.R. Horton thus will either assuage investor fears or stoke them. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 13, after market closeCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) heads into Wednesday's fiscal first quarter report in a strong position. CSCO stock has rallied from an important pivot point on its chart, moving off a multiple bottom and above moving averages. There's a clear path for CSCO stock to continue its breakout to $50 and beyond.From a broader standpoint, CSCO seems to be one of the few value names left in a tech sector at all-time highs. The stock trades at less than 14x next year's EPS estimates, a seemingly soft multiple for a tech giant.Technically and fundamentally, Cisco stock can move higher. But Cisco needs to deliver on Wednesday afternoon -- and there's some sign of weakness in the industry. Fellow networking play Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) plunged 24% last week after disappointing guidance for the calendar fourth quarter.A strong quarter from Cisco -- and, given Arista's stumble, a solid outlook -- would show that Arista's problems are specific to that company, and calm long-held investor worries about networking industry demand. That almost certainly drives Cisco shares higher, and given valuation and the technical setup could catalyze a longer rally.Anything less, however, and industry fears return, which almost certainly interrupts the recent bounce in CSCO stock. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, before market openCannabis stocks like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) have had a disastrous 2019. CGC stock is down 63% from its 52-week high, and other pot stocks have fallen even further.The one piece of good news is that the earnings calendar provides the industry a chance to drive some sort of positive sentiment heading into 2020. Reports from Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) before the open on Tuesday and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) after that day's close precede Canopy's Thursday morning release.At this point, the three cannabis companies simply need to deliver any kind of good news. Commentary on pricing will be closely watched, as it's clear that investors are starting to price in oversupply in the Canadian market. Commentary on the regulatory front, where a backlog of applications has slowed industry growth, will be another focal point.But one question at the moment is whether even good news will be enough to drive a long-awaited rebound. Aphria (NYSE:APHA) posted back-to-back impressive quarters, including guidance for EBITDA profitability, yet APHA stock trades near the lows too.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now As I wrote last month, I'm skeptical the bottom is in for CGC stock and other pot plays. But the sector at least has a chance to prove skeptics like myself wrong. Though as bearish as sentiment remains, it likely will take three monster earnings reports to do so. Walmart (WMT)Source: fotomak / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, before market openThe dominance of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in brick-and-mortar retailing means its results always are important. The company's sheer size makes it an indicator of the health of the U.S. consumer. Walmart's commentary on pricing moves grocery stocks like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and can impact the share prices of its suppliers as well.This time around, however, the report has a little extra significance. KR shares soared this week after a bullish forecast at its Analyst Day. Walmart's results could support that company's optimism -- or undercut that stock's gains.In contrast, shares of major consumer packaged goods suppliers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) look a bit wobbly. Fears of pricing pressure and private-label penetration have dogged that group for some time, and Walmart earnings could re-ignite those worries. To counter these fears, buy dividend-paying stocks that can thrive in most markets -- i.e. bulletproof stocks. Louis has spent the past two decades helping people like you and I beat the market, and he doesn't intend to stop now. Want to know what's on his buy list? Here's the secret.More broadly, this is a market at all-time highs in an economy that is almost solely reliant on the U.S. consumer for growth. Weakness in Walmart results would raise new questions about the health of that consumer, and thus the health of the economy going forward.Meanwhile, for Walmart stock itself, the report looks important. WMT stock sits at an all-time high at the moment after a 28% gain. The company's successful e-commerce strategy has positioned it as a legitimate competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In other words, expectations are rising. Walmart has to meet those expectations to keep its rally going. But how it does so may have an effect on many other stocks in the market. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, after market closeChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has basically no room for error on Thursday afternoon. Save for a stumble by Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), results across the sector have been strong. A poor quarter from Nvidia followed by beats from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) raises real concerns about market share and competition.With NVDA stock approaching a 52-week high heading into the report, those concerns are not priced in. The third quarter earnings report a year ago, when NVDA stock plunged on weak guidance, shows what the downside can be if Nvidia disappoints.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over That said, I wrote this week that I expect Nvidia stock to keep rallying. The strength in the sector suggests Nvidia should comfortably beat expectations. And this has been a second-half story all year. Increasingly it seems like that story is going to play out. But if it doesn't, NVDA stock is going to see some ugly trading on Friday. JD.com (JD)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Friday, Nov. 15, before market openChinese retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) heads into its third quarter report in a strong position. JD stock finally has broken through resistance at $32 and now trades at a 15-month high. At 27x forward earnings, valuation still isn't prohibitive, and a strong quarter can keep the rally going.Like NVDA, however, JD has little room for error. Larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) delivered an impressive quarter last week. Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) is nipping at JD.com's heels. The market understands that an apparently slowing Chinese economy may have an impact. But any market share losses will be untenable with JD stock at a 52-week high.This also is a case where the reaction to earnings might be as important as the results themselves. PDD has skyrocketed in recent weeks. BABA is at a six-month high. Investors clearly are coming around to Chinese stocks. A good quarter from JD.com and a good gain for its stock would suggest that sentiment can continue to improve. Anything less could be a problem for JD shares -- and for other Chinese names as well.Legendary investor Louis Navellier has opinions of his own.

2019-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. logged more than 268 billion yuan ($38.3 billion) of purchases during its Singles’ Day bonanza, exceeding last year’s record haul after a 24-hour shopping marathon.An estimated half-billion shoppers from China to Russia and Argentina swarmed the e-commerce giant’s sites to scoop up everything from Apple Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. gadgets to Ugandan mangoes. The company again hosted a televised entertainment revue in Shanghai to run alongside the bargain-hunting, this time enlisting Taylor Swift and Asian pop icon G.E.M. to pump up sales.The world’s largest shopping event has become an annual ritual for Asia’s largest company, part showcase of commercialism and part publicity blitz. Also referred to as “Double 11” because it falls on Nov. 11, it’s closely watched by investors keen to gauge how willing Chinese consumers are to spend as economic growth threatens to slip below 6%.Tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to fuel uncertainty and roil global commerce. Among China’s largest corporations, Alibaba is expected to better ride out the storm, thanks to booming online consumption in the world’s No. 2 economy. On Sunday, Alvin Liu, a Tmall general manager, said Alibaba doesn’t expect any impact on its cross-border import business from an ongoing trade spat.“Alibaba will probably be the one that will be able to circumvent and come out from the trade war in better shape” versus Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Richard Wong, head of ICT for the Asia Pacific at Frost & Sullivan, told Bloomberg Television. “The current sentiment and confidence in terms of spending is still relatively high.”While Alibaba and its rivals routinely trumpet record sums in the event’s aftermath, it’s unclear how much Nov. 11 sales actually will contribute to the bottom line given the enormous discounting involved. A good result however could bolster Alibaba’s effort to raise as much as $15 billion in a landmark Hong Kong share sale this month, according to people familiar with the matter.Singles’ Day emerged as a uniquely Chinese antidote to the sentimentality surrounding Valentine’s Day. Emerging on college campuses across the country, it takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached.It’s now become an excuse for people to splurge. Last year, sales at Alibaba climbed 27% to 213.5 billion yuan, equivalent to $30.7 billion at the time. This time, purchases grew 26% from the year earlier. More merchandise is sold online over the 24-hour period than during the five-day U.S. holiday buying spree that begins on Thanksgiving and ends on Cyber Monday.Alibaba’s U.S. traded shares were down 1.9% Monday to $183.70 at 11:25 a.m. in New York.Alibaba saw 100 million new users join the shopping festival this year, according to Jiang Fan, president of the company’s e-commerce marketplaces Taobao and Tmall.“This is the power of expanding into less developed regions,” he said. “We hope this event can help more factories and farmers.”Read more: Alibaba Said to Seek Up to $15 Billion in Hong Kong ListingIt’s Time for Alibaba to Slay Jack Ma’s Monster: Tim CulpanBut the company faced stiff competition this year from smaller platforms including JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. -- the aggressively expanding upstart that’s encroaching on the market leaders’ turf. They vied for the wallets of Chinese shoppers particularly in relatively untapped rural areas. All employ heavy discounting and hard-sell tactics in the run-up to and during the 24 hours in a bid to best the previous year’s record.“Overall, we think this year will likely see a more competitive Double 11 period,” Ella Ji, an analyst at China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., said in a report. “We anticipate each platform will spend more on subsidies.”Daniel Zhang, who took over as Alibaba chairman from billionaire Jack Ma in September, pioneered the show in its present form in 2015. The Singles’ Day impresario passes the baton this year to Fan, a potential successor to Zhang himself.“Over the years, we’ve seen consumers become more diverse and younger. Each generation of consumers needs their own peers to serve them,” Zhang said in a post on Alibaba’s blog. “I think this young team is the future.”The 2019 edition came with slight twists to the formula. Alibaba, stung by criticism it harmed the environment by shipping an estimated 1 billion packages in a single day -- has enjoined its logistics arm Cainiao to set up recycling centers at 75,000 locations. It says it will also work with courier companies to pick up used boxes and wrapping.An expansion into Southeast Asia and less-developed areas in China plus newer services -- such as transactions on food delivery site Ele.me, grocery store chain Hema and travel service Fliggy -- bolstered the total. The company also brought in livestreamers including Kim Kardashian to appeal to younger buyers.Other aspects remained the same. Singles’ Day has always been an opportunity for Alibaba to test the limits of its cloud computing, delivery and payments systems. Leaving little to chance, Alibaba sent teams across the nation ahead of Nov. 11 to help myriad outlets prepare for the festival. Some 200,000 brands had been expected to participate in 2019‘s edition of the festival.“Singles’ Day is becoming popular outside of China, especially in the ASEAN region,” said Patrick Winter, Ernst & Young Asia Pacific managing partner. “You’re also seeing how it’s growing in smaller cities in China.”(Updates with new user number in tenth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Seals $38 Billion Singles’ Day Sales Record

2019-11-11,"After a strong finish last week and with equities still hanging around all-time highs, Monday's action continues to consolidate those gains. Here's a look a few top stock trades.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Starbucks (SBUX)Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock was unstoppable for about a year, doubling from its summer 2018 low to its summer 2019 high. Over the last 10 weeks though, SBUX has been ice cold. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares have broken down without reason, crashing through prior support levels and moving averages. The company even delivered strong earnings results in late October, as highlighted on the chart. The stock has been finding its footing here near the 200-day moving average, though. It gives investors an excellent risk/reward, now down almost 20% from its highs.   * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth Below the October low of $81.03 (or $80 for those that are comfortable with additional risk), bulls can consider exiting the trade. Below $80 and shares will need more time to set up again on the long side. Above $83 to $84 and the bulls could regain control.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: JD.com (JD)All the talk is about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Singles Day right now, but what about JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), as it too benefits from the event?Both stocks have made very nice moves through multi-month resistance, while recent pullbacks suggest that these former resistance marks will act as support. Specifically related to JD stock, shares made a powerful breakout through the $32 mark. After chopping around for a few sessions, shares have pulled back toward this level. Buyers instantly stepped in, giving bulls a measurable risk setup, should they take a long position in the name.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: The Trade Desk (TTD)What a powerful move investors saw on Monday in several growth stocks, the most notable of which came from The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). After a mixed earnings reaction late last week, TTD investors made it clear on Monday: They want to own more Trade Desk. Shares continue to put in a series of higher lows (blue line), but more importantly, they are pushing through key resistance marks. Both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages had been acting as resistance amid this high-growth selloff. TTD is reclaiming these marks on Monday. If bulls can maintain the stock above these marks -- especially the 50-day moving average -- they may be regaining momentum in the name.   The 50-day is a must-hold mark should The Trade Desk pullback. If it continues higher, the 100-day moving average is the next upside target, near $225.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Boeing (BA)Boeing (NYSE:BA) jumped over 5% on the day after reports suggested deliveries of the 737 MAX may resume in December. BA has a really tough and choppy chart. But Monday's action is putting in a bullish outside day, which could bode well for continued upside from here. Amid the move, BA is reclaiming all of its major moving averages, as well as the key $360 to $362 area.   Should it continue higher, it puts $375 to $380 on the table, with $390 being a possibility above that. Back below $355 and $335 is possible.

2019-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- An epic stock rally for China’s e-commerce upstart just faltered, clipping the fortune of its founder.Pinduoduo Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colin Huang lost almost a quarter of his fortune as the company’s stock plummeted 23% on Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth tumbled to $16.3 billion, down $4.8 billion from a day earlier.PDD’s stock drop was the biggest since it held an initial public offering in July last year, reducing this year’s gain through Wednesday to a still-respectable 40%. The sell-off was triggered by the company’s worse-than-expected quarterly results. Sales more than doubled to 7.51 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) for the three months ended September, but fell short of the average analyst projection of 7.65 billion yuan. Net loss widened to 2.3 billion yuan from 1.1 billion yuan a year earlier.The disappointing results came after arch-rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. chipped away at the Chinese e-commerce upstart’s dominant position in smaller cities.Founded by Huang in 2015, PDD has carved a niche with social commerce that encourages making purchases with others. But the Shanghai-based startup is now working to shake off its reputation for hawking cheap products, just as Alibaba and JD delve deeper into PDD’s base of smaller cities. In September, JD rolled out a group-buying app which, like PDD, entices purchases with generous discounts.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:Despite heavy marketing expenses, the company’s marketplace model can sustain high gross margin and should lead to profit as revenue scales up.Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.PDD said in a statement that many brands and small merchants must “choose one of two” platforms to be listed, without naming rivals. “Forced exclusivity has a material impact on Pinduoduo, we had to row upstream against the pressure,” it said.Sales and marketing expenses surged 114% to 6.9 billion yuan, helping China’s No. 3 shopping app to add 64 million new active users during the quarter. Its founder signaled that the company can afford to buy growth.“When there is opportunity, we should spend our money aggressively. We shouldn’t put our money into the piggy bank,” Huang told analysts on a conference call.To contact the reporters on this story: Venus Feng in Hong Kong at vfeng7@bloomberg.net;Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, David ScheerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Pinduoduo’s Founder Loses $5 Billion Overnight as Earnings Miss Estimates
2019-11-24,"Which stocks are investors thankful for? The answer is clear: massive growth stocks. This is because these names demonstrate the potential for plenty of share price growth. We don’t just mean in the short-term. No, we’re talking over the course of the next few years. However, no one said finding these stocks with stellar growth prospects was going to be easy. At the end of the day, any investment is accompanied by some degree of risk, with no sure-fire way to predict which names will come out on top. So what’s an investor supposed to do?One option is to take advantage of TipRanks.com. The platform’s wealth of market data arms investors with the information they need to see the bigger picture. During our own search, we used the platform to zero in on 3 stocks primed to outperform the market in the coming year and beyond.Let’s dive right in.   Mercadolibre, Inc. (MELI)Mercadolibre was developed as an online marketplace for consumers in Latin American countries, with it now expanding its services to cater to the region’s under-banked community through its digital payments system, Mercado Pago. Given that $13.4 billion worth of goods are sold on the marketplace as well as its 93% year-to-date climb, it’s no wonder Wall Street is intrigued. After its third quarter earnings release, its growth story sounds even more promising. In terms of total payment volume (TPV), MELI flew past the $7.2 billion consensus estimate, with the figure coming in at $7.6 billion. In local currency, this amounts to a 190% increase for off-platform and a whopping 300% gain for digital wallet. On top of this, the company was able to add 1.6 million active payers. That being said, the postal strike in Brazil did take a toll on gross merchandise volume (GMV) by $35 million. In spite of this obstacle, GMV still gained 37%, up from 33% in Q2. While some expressed concern regarding its realized EBITDA margins of -9%, J.P. Morgan analyst Andre Baggio notes that this is a result of MELI’s investment back into the business. “Most of the year-over-year pressure came from a 9pp increase in branding initiatives inside marketing expenditure, which is not used to boost short-term results but rather to help build a stronger brand for the future. On top of marketing, MELI is also investing more in fulfillment and credit,” he commented.The four-star analyst added, “We see MELI as very well positioned in the Latin American e-commerce and Fintech environments.” To this end, he kept his Overweight rating while reducing the price target from $750 to $700.  Even at this lower target, Baggio thinks shares could surge 24% over the next twelve months. (To watch Baggio’s track record, click here)Similarly, other Wall Street analysts have been impressed by MELI. It earns a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating thanks to the 7 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months. In addition, the average price target of $692 implies 22% upside potential. (See Mercadolibre stock analysis on TipRanks) JD.com, Inc. (JD)The Chinese e-commerce company just posted an earnings beat of monster proportions. As a result, several members of the Street believe that now is the time to add JD (up 53% year-to-date) to your shopping cart.To kick off its third quarter earnings announcement, JD reported that revenue had grown at its fastest rate since Q2 2018, up 29% year-over-year. Not to mention even with the intense competition it faces in the space, annual active users increased by 13 million, with the new total landing at 334 million, and monthly active users were up 36%. Credit Suisse’s Tina Long argues that JD’s focus on gaining users from “lower-tier” cities could drive this figure to further accelerate. She cites the fact that “(1) 70% of new users are from lower-tier cities; (2) Order and GMV growth in lower-tier cities was the highest in the past six quarters; (3) It performed particularly strongly in large ticket sized items like electronics & home appliances. Avg. ticket size in lower-tier cities was Rmb200, higher than peers” to back up this conclusion. As a result, she maintained her bullish call and bumped up the price target from $41.40 to $43.50, suggesting 36% upside potential. (To watch Long’s track record, click here)Meanwhile, Alex Yao of J.P. Morgan reminds investors that the year-over-year decline in GPM and weak net margin guidance don’t impact the strong profit growth outlook. “We suggest investors focus on profit growth: 1) the GPM YoY decline in 3Q19 didn’t affect the solid OPM YoY improvement (2.2% from 0.6%); 2) higher revenue growth can also lead to solid profit growth even if JD sacrifices discretionary profit; and 3) acquiring more new buyers is positive for longer-term upside,” he explained. This prompted the four-star analyst to stay with the bulls, boosting the price target by $1 to $43. (To watch Yao’s track record, click here)When it comes to the rest of the Street, the consensus is split right down the middle. 3 Buys and 3 Holds add up to a ‘Moderate Buy’. Based on the $39 average price target, the potential twelve-month gain is 23%. (See JD.com stock analysis on TipRanks) Yandex N.V. (YNDX)Yandex is a Russian internet and technology company that operates a popular search engine. On the heels of its announcement that it will be updating its corporate governance, some analysts are standing firmly behind YNDX, stating that the company’s 48% year-to-date growth is just the beginning. In order to align its corporate governance with country interests, the Priority Share, which is currently held by Sberbank, will get more rights and will be held by the Public Interest Foundation (PIF). The PIF is set to be governed by a board of 11 directors, including members from the five top Russian universities, three non-governmental institutions and the company’s three representatives. These new rights include the option to prevent a single entity from accumulating economic or voting interests in Yandex of 10% or more, down from the current 25% level, to make binding nominations for two members of the board, to temporarily replace the General Director of the Russian subsidiary and appoint the Interim General Director in special cases and Class A shareholders will be assigned with additional rights, including a requirement to get an approval from them for certain material transactions. Founder and CEO Arkady Volozh will also see his stake be moved to a family trust, with shares no longer being converted into Class A upon his death.UBS analyst Ulyana Lenvalskaya sees the changes as a good thing for YNDX shares. “We think the proposed changes i) address the single-man risk/outline a clear succession plan and ii) create a new layer of Russian IP and data protection; as a result recently intensified regulatory pressure on Yandex is likely to diminish, we believe,” she noted. Bearing this in mind, she reiterated her Buy rating and $54.30 price target. This conveys her confidence in YNDX’s ability to rise 34% in the next twelve months. (To watch Lenvalskaya’s track record, click here)      Looking at the consensus breakdown, 2 Buys published in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells amount to a ‘Moderate Buy’. Its $52 average price target also implies 29% upside potential. (See Yandex stock analysis on TipRanks)",3 Monster Growth Stocks That Can Outperform in 2020

2019-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is counting on a smartphone app known for cheap deals to lure Chinese consumers during the Black Friday online spree, in a partnership that extends to the end of the year.The U.S. e-commerce giant’s cross-border unit has just opened a storefront on Pinduoduo Inc., China’s No. 3 online retailer after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc.Starting from Nov. 28, the three-day sales campaign will offer Chinese consumers a range of overseas products from Australian baby formula to luxury watches and Nintendo Switch consoles. Pre-sales for some brands are already underway for the U.S.-inspired annual shopping extravaganza.PDD and Amazon said their partnership would continue until the end of December. In a statement, Amazon said its pop-up store on PDD will provide about 1,000 branded foreign products.In July, Amazon shut down its Chinese marketplace business in yet another example of how U.S. tech companies struggle to contend with local competitors in China. The company still runs businesses including Kindle e-books and international operations in the country. Kindle has flagship stores on Alibaba’s Tmall, JD and PDD.While Chinese buyers are accustomed to splurging during shopping festivals created by local retail giants, they also seek out bargain foreign products during Black Friday. The tie-up will help Amazon tap the half billion annual active buyers on PDD’s addictive app.It comes on the heels of Alibaba’s Singles Day promotion on Nov. 11, which has overtaken Black Friday to become the world’s biggest shopping event. Alibaba logged a record $38 billion of purchases during the 24-hour shopping marathon this year. JD and PDD also launched similar campaigns around that date.Founded in 2015, PDD has carved out a niche with social commerce that encourages making purchases with others in return for generous discounts. But the Shanghai-based startup is now working to shake off its reputation for hawking cheap products, just as rivals Alibaba and JD delve into PDD’s base of smaller cities. Last week, the company posted worse-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, triggering its biggest share drop since its July 2018 debut. Its partnership with Amazon now offers the company a chance to recover some of the lost ground.“The move works disproportionately in Pinduoduo’s favor,” said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. “It adds credence to its claims that it’s a space for consumers to buy branded goods, and accelerates internal plans to be active in cross-border e-commerce.”(Updates with Amazon statement in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Matt Day.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Teams Up With China Upstart for Black Friday Sale

2019-11-27,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) should be able to deliver strong growth in 2020 as a number of macro obstacles fade away. If Alibaba stock is valued on the fundamentals of the company, it should get a much better valuation multiple. One of the biggest challenges BABA faces is the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. There are strong signs that there will be a trade truce and a possibility of &quot;phase one&quot; trade agreement.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com The phase one agreement will include reversing some tariffs on both sides. This should boost consumer demand in China and also improve the sentiment around Alibaba stock. Alibaba has reported 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the latest quarter and good growth numbers in the past few quarters. It is also showing strong growth in the cloud segment with 64% YoY growth. The trade truce and a steep growth trajectory make Alibaba stock a strong buy for 2020. Reduction in Trade TensionsRecent announcements from both the U.S. and Chinese administration signal strong support for a &quot;phase one&quot; trade agreement. This first phase will include a rollback of some of the major tariffs. An important date to watch is 15th December when an additional round of tariffs will be announced. These tariffs are more broad-based and could hurt consumer sentiment in both the U.S. and China. In order to prevent these tariffs, negotiators on both sides are looking to secure a phase one agreement as soon as possible.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter the holiday season, we should see a kick start of the presidential election cycle of 2020. According to Reuters, the current administration is looking to show progress in the trade talks with China. This should reduce the trade rhetoric in 2020 and improve the market sentiment toward a broader trade agreement.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy Now for the Future BABA would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade truce. Since the first announcement of trade tariffs in March 2018, BABA stock has been gripped by a bearish sentiment that has led to lower price growth in the stock. On the other hand, its trailing twelve-month revenue has increased by 70%, while earnings per share has increased by 135% during this time period.A definite signal about the completion of a &quot;phase one&quot; trade agreement should provide an instant boost to Alibaba stock and improve the bullish estimates for the company. Alibaba Stock: Improvement in FundamentalsAlibaba continues to show rapid growth in key metrics. As mentioned earlier, the revenue growth in the past 18 months has been good. In the latest quarter, Alibaba reported 40% growth in core commerce and 64% growth in its cloud computing segment. At the current pace, Alibaba Cloud should be able to reach a $10 billion annualized revenue rate by the end of 2020. This would improve the standalone valuation of the cloud segment and Alibaba stock.Source: Company filingsThe EBITA margins of Alibaba Cloud in the latest quarter were down 6%. Currently, Alibaba's management is focusing on revenue growth in this segment. As the revenue base of cloud computing expands, we should see a rapid increase in margins. The trailing twelve-month operating margin of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is 25%. Hence, there is an over 30 percentage point gap between the margins of AWS and Alibaba Cloud. AWS reported a growth of 35% in the recent quarter, which is lower than Alibaba Cloud. As the revenue gap between Alibaba Cloud and AWS decreases, we should see a reduction in the margin gap between these two cloud players.Alibaba's core commerce services continue to show strong growth. Despite the larger size, Alibaba's revenue growth has been higher than JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), its main competitor in China. This shows the wide moat enjoyed by Alibaba's platform and its ability to monetize different services effectively. Impact on ValuationStrong fundamentals and a trade truce should provide a major boost to BABA stock in 2020. The stock is trading at close to 22 times its trailing twelve months price-to-earnings ratio. This is quite low for a company showing 40% revenue growth and significant upside from its cloud operations. The forward EPS estimates for Alibaba have also increased rapidly in the last few months. This makes BABA stock more attractive as a long-term buy and hold investment.  * 7 Entertainment Stocks to Buy to Escape Holiday Blues Alibaba stock is trading at a reasonable valuation and has a number of tailwinds that can lift the stock in 2020. The stock is a good buy from both fundamental metrics as well as the macro trade situation. Investor TakeawayAlibaba stock has given great returns since the start of the trade tensions in March 2018. During this time, the company has improved its trailing twelve-month revenue by 70% and EPS by 135%. There are strong signals that a trade truce will be declared by the signing of a &quot;phase one&quot; trade agreement. This will remove the bearish headwinds for Alibaba stock and allow the company to be valued at its fundamental performance.Alibaba is not only showing YoY growth of 40%, but it is also increasing the ecommerce market share in China. The revenue growth in Alibaba has been higher than JD for a number of quarters. This should allow the company to launch new services and improve its margins. I believe that BABA stock can be a big winner in 2020 as it would be valued on fundamental growth prospects instead of fears about the trade war.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

From Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to JD.com Inc., more than a dozen Chinese companies listed there have a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. But Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing may be changing things. The e-commerce giant raised about $11 billion in the city’s largest issuance of stock since 2010, with about one-third of the tranche taken up by mainland Chinese fund managers. Other regional buyers were enthusiastic, too. Taiwan’s life insurer Fubon Financial Holding Co., for instance, placed a $500 million order.This all goes to show that Asian investors are just as wealthy and eager as those in New York, which could go a long way toward making Hong Kong and Singapore more attractive listing venues. The region’s aging savers have amassed more than $10 trillion of wealth in the form of pension funds, mutual funds and insurance policies, HSBC Holdings Plc estimates.(1) With billions to deploy, Taiwan’s insurers and China’s mutual funds may find benefits to trading stocks in their own time zone, if only for their portfolio managers’ work-life balance. Asia’s bustling IPO market also bodes well for the region’s restless unicorns, whose listing window in the U.S. is closing fast after a series of high-profile flops. If Americans can’t stomach Uber Technologies Inc., how will they have an appetite for Southeast Asian clones like Grab or Go-Jek? To make matters worse, U.S. investors have been pulling money out of emerging markets over the past several months. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index peaked in January 2018, while the S&P 500 Index continues to hit daily records.There's one major caveat, however. Local investors can be a tough sell. Foreign money managers tend to think of Asia's biggest startups as a proxy for the macro scene, much in the same way that New York investors saw Alibaba as a bet on China's rising consumer class. Domestic players, on the other hand, are living and breathing the macro picture, so they’re concerned primarily with company metrics. If you’re sitting in Jakarta traffic, you’re acutely aware of the challenges a ride-hailing company there faces; a foreign billionaire like Masayoshi Son just sees a thriving population with thousands of young, mobile-phone users.Super-apps are another example. The region’s hottest unicorns like to pitch these all-in-one platforms to venture-capital investors. To improve operational efficiency, they argue, more cash is needed to expand regionally. But that business model relies on the assumption that the social-media habits of a 22-year-old Vietnamese wouldn’t be too different from an Indonesian’s. This might not fly with a local investor, who's more adept at discerning cultural differences.Deeper local knowledge can also help avoid expensive mistakes. In October, Indian startup Oyo Hotels and Homes raised $1.5 billion from SoftBank Group Corp., among other investors, as it looked to expand into foreign markets. Yet Chinese fund managers largely stayed away — and for good reason. This week, Reuters reported that Oyo is unlikely to hit profitability in India and China until 2022. Similar reports had circulated in local Chinese media months ago, pointing out that the company had no traction on the mainland, even though it boasted of being the largest single hotel brand there. SoftBank’s Son may now have a tough time convincing investors in Hong Kong that Oyo is worth more than $10 billion, the valuation at its latest funding round.In truth, Alibaba may not be the best test case to determine if Asia’s pool of money will slosh toward young companies. Within two business days, institutional investors can swap their Hong Kong-listed shares for stocks in New York, should they feel liquidity in the Asian city is thin. That option to flee to a U.S. haven may have brought hesitant investors on board in the first place. As Asia’s unicorns grow bigger, many are looking at dual listings to ensure there’s enough demand to absorb their sizable offerings. Indonesia’s e-commerce platform Tokopedia PT, for instance, is considering a listing on multiple bourses as it seeks a pre-IPO funding round. This, to me, is a sign that Asia isn’t ready to be self-sufficient just yet. Saudi Arabia may be able to jam Aramco down local investors’ throats; but Asia’s startups are still stuck with a New York investor base that has a diminishing appetite for them. (1) This figure excludes Japan.To contact the author of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2019-12-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s landmark $11 billion share sale and listing in Hong Kong on Nov. 26 was galvanized by expectations the Chinese e-commerce giant will attract a vast pool of capital from its home country. But some investors caution against unrealistic expectations, especially by mainland investors, and highlight certain restrictions that still govern -- and potentially curtail -- trading activity in Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares.The company’s sheer size and the unprecedented nature of its secondary listing (the primary listing is still in New York) and unique management structure present challenges for investors hoping to gauge everything from Alibaba’s inclusion in indexes -- crucial because they direct the flow of capital from tracker funds -- to its listing status.Here’s what we know.1&#92;. Will Alibaba get added to the Hang Seng Index?Not right now. Alibaba will be added to Hang Seng Composite Index on Dec. 9, but it isn’t qualified to join the benchmark Hang Seng Index or the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index because they comprise only primary listings and corporations without so-called weighted voting rights (WVR).Membership of the 50-member Hang Seng is coveted by corporations because it could trigger billions of dollars of inflows from funds tracking the 50-year-old gauge. Hang Seng Indexes Co. plans a consultation in the first quarter to discuss issues including whether firms with weighted voting rights, like Alibaba, should be eligible for the HSI. Any conclusions should be published by May, Daniel Wong, its head of research and analytics, said in a statement. Even if the index compiler decides to overhaul its rules, the required process means it may not be until late 2020 before Alibaba could join the major Hang Seng benchmarks.Representatives for HKEx and Alibaba declined to comment.Read more: Why Now, and Why Hong Kong, for Alibaba’s Share Sale?: QuickTake2&#92;. Will Alibaba be included in the stock connect program?Maybe, but a lot hinges on policy makers. China doesn’t spell out criteria or qualifications for joining the program, which allows mainland investors to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Unlike the HSI, the program isn’t limited to primary listings. It does require review by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the stock market watchdog.The first companies in stock connect with weighted voting rights were Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp., which mainland investors got access to in late October through the program. That’s after similarly structured Chinese firms started listing in July on Shanghai’s new tech-focused Star board. Many investors expect Beijing to ultimately allow Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares to trade through the stock link with the city as well.But it may not necessarily be in China’s best interest to do so. That’s because other U.S.-listed Chinese firms -- among the country’s largest corporations, from JD.com Inc. to Baidu Inc. -- may be encouraged to follow in Alibaba’s footsteps and conduct their own secondary listings in Hong Kong, bypassing the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourses. That may run counter to Beijing’s longstanding ambitions of developing healthy, vibrant mainland exchanges, particularly as unrest grips Hong Kong.3&#92;. Can Alibaba change its primary listing to Hong Kong?It’s possible -- thereby attracting investors with a preference for main listings, and at the same time scoring brownie points with some in Beijing who could view that as supporting China’s policy ambitions. Alibaba was given the green light to list in Hong Kong based on a new “Secondary Listing” rule, or Chapter 19C. It allows companies to conduct follow-on share offerings without complying with more stringent rules laid down by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. governing first-time listees.Alibaba may enjoy special status in having more freedom to comply with Hong Kong listing requirements. Under rules laid out in a consultation paper in April last year, Chinese firms that went public before Dec. 15, 2017 don’t need to comply with “WVR” safeguards if they later switch their primary listing to Hong Kong. Alibaba, which debuted in New York in 2014, said in its Hong Kong listing prospectus it’s a “WVR” company similar to Meituan and Xiaomi.Meanwhile, Alibaba employs a fairly unique structure in which a group of partners have the right to nominate a majority of the firm’s board -- exerting outsized influence on Alibaba’s direction.In addition, Hong Kong listing rules say if trading volume there exceeds 55% of global turnover over an entire fiscal year, the stock has to adopt primary listing status in Hong Kong. HKEx gives such Chinese companies a year to comply. But with Hong Kong’s stock registration office listing just 23% of outstanding Alibaba shares as of Nov. 28, a majority of trading volume occurring there may be a tall order.&#92;--With assistance from Paul Geitner and Fox Hu.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Kevin KingsburyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba’s Hong Kong Rally Is At Risk From Three Misconceptions

2019-12-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. will soon release the $300 Switch console in China. But for all the name recognition, marketing muscle and fan base behind it, the device is unlikely to get off to a fast start in the world’s largest gaming market.Teased by Tencent in a social media post Tuesday, the Switch’s impending release in China has excited Nintendo investors hopeful of tapping a new market. Yet it’s constrained by the rise of smartphones as the dominant gaming platform in China, and by the reluctance of gamers to buy consoles via official channels because of their limited range of Beijing-approved games.Nintendo’s Switch retains its global popularity three years after launch, but growth will slow in coming years in an industry where consoles are often revamped every half-decade or so. Getting into China could extend its longevity, but Nintendo’s first issue is that fans in China who might have wanted and could afford a Switch are likely to have one by now.“Many Chinese people buy Switch in Japan and come back to their home country with it,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Chinese people know Mario, Zelda and Pokemon through the media, and the more income they get, the more they want to buy Switch and software.”Tencent scheduled an event in Shanghai to discuss its collaboration with Nintendo for 10:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to local media. Tencent-backed JD.com Inc., one of the country’s largest online retailers of electronics, has already listed the console for online pre-order at 2,099 yuan ($297) -- about the same as elsewhere around the world. Sales will run Dec. 10 to Dec. 11 in limited quantities.Read more: Nintendo Will Prove the Switch’s Longevity This Holiday SeasonAt the packed Switch booth in August during ChinaJoy -- the country’s biggest gaming show -- fans waited as long as two hours to try marquee titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Many in line brought their own Switch -- whether acquired overseas or on the gray market -- and just wanted to check whether the Chinese versions of their favorite games would be any different due to censorship.Worries about Tencent’s potential influence on Nintendo’s content are not unfounded. Two of the Chinese internet giant’s recent hits have been patriotic versions of SimCity and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, and it has also imposed strict playtime limits on minors -- all in an effort to appease Beijing. Nintendo, for its part, has said that its games are designed for the family and shouldn’t have trouble with regulators.“The Chinese government often changes the regulations,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co., warning about the unpredictability of a regime that earlier this year granted Tencent approval to distribute Super Mario Bros. U in the country.“We have always been developing game consoles that parents can rest assured to let their children play, that are family-friendly, and that are highly praised by parents,” Nintendo Senior Executive Officer Satoru Shibata said at ChinaJoy.Read more: Tencent Teams Up With Nintendo-Backed Pokemon to Create GamesThis isn’t Nintendo’s first attempt to crack the market. Official console sales in China remain a fraction of the overall gaming arena, as region locks and delayed hardware releases push gamers toward imported options. Nintendo confronted similar challenges in attempts to enter China dating back to 2003. It tried to sell, via a joint venture, its Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 3DS and a peculiar China-only portable console called iQue Player. Rampant piracy and slow game launches made those products unappealing.The rise of smartphone gaming places a new obstacle in Nintendo’s path, as the Japanese company will have to convince players to carry yet another handheld gadget. Its library of first-party franchises like Super Mario will help, though China already has an inventory of copycat titles -- Let’s Hunt Monsters, a commercially successful Pokemon Go clone, was authored by partner Tencent.For Nintendo and Tencent, selling Switch consoles in China is just one component of a partnership that’s ratcheting up. The two are reported to be working together on games for the U.S. as well as China, and Tencent this summer announced a collaboration with the Nintendo-backed Pokemon Co.For now, the Japanese company “does not count on business in China,” said Kazunori Ito, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Services in Tokyo. “Nintendo needs to get know-how for selling games in China” and has chosen a good partner in Tencent instead of trying to go it alone.(Updates with pricing in the first and fifth paragraphs)&#92;--With assistance from 院去信太郎, Yuki Furukawa and Takashi Amano.To contact the reporters on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.net;Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Nintendo Faces Familiar Foes in Return to China With Switch

2019-12-06,"Following President Donald Trump's recent declaration that he may wait to finalize a U.S.-China trade deal, stock markets are off to a volatile start in December. As investors wonder whether China-based stocks might be adversely affected by the president's statement for the rest of the month, this column will analyze the short- and long-term outlook of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock, China's largest e-commerce company by revenue.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com In 2019, JD stock is up about 57%. Needless to say, JD.com has been hot this year, but in the short-run, the share price could drop due to profit-taking.  JD.com's Q3 EarningsOn Nov. 15, JD.com released strong Q3 results, beating expectations from top to bottom. Its net revenue rose 29% year-over-year to $18.9 billion. Its earnings per share was 29 cents, versus analysts' average estimate of 17 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIts income from operations was $695.8 million, compared to a loss from operations a year ago.JD.com's YoY user growth accelerated last quarter, while its mobile user count surged 36% YoY.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Its monthly active mobile users  increased 36% YoY in September. The owners of JD stock cheered the  results. JD.com has a robust business model and is poised to benefit from the expanding Chinese e-commerce market. The company has about a 25% share of the nation's online retail market.JD.com also has hundreds of warehouses and thousands of delivery stations as well as fresh food stores across China.  JD Logistics' revenue grew over 75% YoY in Q3. JD.com claims that approximately 90% of the unit's orders are delivered the same day or the next day. JD.com's E-commerce Strength Will Propel JD Stock HigherIn addition to being one of China's most valuable enterprises, JD.com is a member of the Fortune Global 500.Online shopping represents about 35% of China's  $5.5 trillion retail market. By comparison, e-commerce in the U.S. represents about 11% of the nation's total retail sales.According to recent research by the China Center for Economic Research, &quot;the most popular products sold online at JD are cell phones, followed by food and beverages, makeup and cosmetics, digital products, and lifestyle and travel goods.&quot;Mobile device users are still a driving force of consumer spending. China has the most mobile users in the world. And the mobile market is expected to grow further  as China's cellular infrastructure improves.Although China's economy may slow further in 2020, China's GDP is still expanding at an average annual rate of at least 6%. Over the longer term, China is likely to overtake the U.S. as the world's number one economy.China's unemployment rate dropped to an all-time low of 3.6% in 2019. And average wage increases have been  high enough to improve consumer sentiment. In other words, the country's growing middle class will continue to drive increases in consumer spending and the expansion of China's e-commerce market.And when Chinese citizens have more money in their pockets, they can spend more on online shopping sites like JD.com, which has already become an internet juggernaut. Short-Term Headwinds for JD.comAlthough it is hard to quantify the exact effect of continued trade wars on JD.com, the uncertainty they create will likely make JD stock more volatile in the short-run.As the economy cools off, the owners of JD.com stock will also pay more attention to JD's competitors. JD's main competitor is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), whose Tmall and Taobao platforms are China's largest online business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer marketplaces, respectively.In the past few years, new players have entered the internet commerce marketplace in China. One example is Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)-style  retailer, which  launched its IPO in 2018.One of the main criticisms of JD.com by analysts  over the years has been JD stock's low margins. For example, throughout 2018, JD's revenue growth slowed and its operating margins dropped. If the Chinese economy slows further, JD's growth metrics could also slow. Additionally,  more companies are likely to enter the lucrative, growing Chinese e-commerce sector.Finally, political instability in Hong Kong could also negatively affect JD.com. Analyzing the Movements of JD StockJD stock  has been volatile over the years. It shot up from $20 in 2014 to $50 in early 2018. Then things went downhill. In Nov. 2018, JD.com hit $19.21.Throughout 2019, the shares have recovered as the company's quarterly profits and revenue growth have improved.On Nov. 15, 2019, JD.com stock hit a 52-week high of $35.43. Currently, the stock is hovering around $33.Because of the impressive jump of  JD.com over the last year, its technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended.But if you already own JD stock, you might want to stay the course and hold onto your position. Or you may also consider opening a covered call position in conjunction with buying JD stock.If you do not currently own shares of JD.com, there will likely be opportunities to pick up the stock more cheaply.However, if the U.S. and China reach a trade deal soon, JD.com, along with many Chinese stocks, are likely to rally. The Bottom Line on JD.com StockAlthough JD stock has been a strong performer in 2019, its price is still considerably lower than its all-time highs of January 2018.Since JD.com stock is a growth name, it trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. The markets are likely to continue to be choppy in the next few weeks, especially since investors may decide to take profits as the year ends.The volatility of JD stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should be cautious about buying the shares in coming weeks.However, long-term investors shouldn't scramble for the exits just yet. JD stock and many of the other Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges enable investors to benefit from the growing spending of Chinese consumers.Because of the hugeness of the Chinese market,  many Chinese e-commerce companies can thrive. And there are plenty of long-term catalysts that could drive JD.com higher in the years ahead.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Only a few days after Nintendo Co.’s Switch made its long-anticipated entry into China, one analyst is making a bullish case for Mario and Zelda’s prospects in the world’s biggest gaming arena.Nintendo could sell as many as four million Switch units in China in the fiscal year ending March and 12 million units of software, London-based tech equity researcher Pelham Smithers wrote in a note to clients. That could add as much as 23 billion yen ($212 million) to the Kyoto-based company’s full-year operating profit, Smithers said.Nintendo and its local partner Tencent Holdings Ltd. began selling the Switch console in China on Dec. 10, a move that has excited Nintendo investors hopeful of tapping a new market. But the optimism has been tampered by the historically lackluster performance of Sony Corp.’s PlayStation and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox consoles, which have had several years to crack the market where smartphones are the dominant gaming platform. Video game giants are also hampered by Beijing’s insistence on vetting all games, which limits the library available to fans and slows new releases. At launch, the Switch only had one state-approved game to play.“While the history of the game console in China is not a happy one, lack of success is not necessarily down to lack of interest on the part of the consumer,” Smithers wrote in the report. “After all: if China’s consumers didn’t play console video games, the authorities wouldn’t have bothered banning them in the first place.”Key Insights:Switch hardware sales in China may range between 2 million and 4 million units in fiscal 2019 and between 3 million and 6 million the following year. Software sales will range between 6 million and 12 million in the current period and 15 million and 30 million in the period ending March 2021.China could contribute between 11.6 billion yen and 23.1 billion yen to Nintendo’s operating profit this year and 27.8 billion to 55.6 billion yen in the next.Smithers forecasts a ratio of three game purchases for each hardware unit sold in both years.He also assumes Tencent takes a 30% share of software sales income, while all of the hardware revenue goes to Nintendo, and that the two companies split the marketing costs.Nintendo’s sales in China may be capped by the company’s unwillingness to significantly increase production volume of the console and risk building up unsold inventory.Nintendo’s signature device is selling for 2,099 yuan ($298), about the same as elsewhere around the world. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe have been green-lit by the government. Nintendo is also preparing to introduce the Switch Lite -- a cheaper version of the console intended to boost the device’s mainstream appeal -- to China at a future date, development partner Tencent said in a social media post last week.Sales of the Switch might have topped 50,000 units on launch day, according to market researcher Niko Partners, which gathers data from online retailers. Some 20,000 units were sold via JD.com and another 10,000 through TMall, it said in a report. Niko Partners forecasts the sales will reach 100,000 units by the end of the year, far below the 1 to 2 million estimated by Smithers.This isn’t Nintendo’s first attempt to crack the market. Official console sales in China remain a fraction of the overall gaming arena, as region locks and delayed hardware releases push gamers toward imported options. Nintendo confronted similar challenges in attempts to enter China dating back to 2003. It tried to sell, via a joint venture, its Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 3DS and a peculiar China-only portable console called iQue Player. Rampant piracy and slow game launches made those products unappealing.Elsewhere, Nintendo’s Switch retains its popularity three years after its launch, in an industry where consoles are often revamped every half-decade or so. The company has so far stuck with a conservative outlook for 18 million Switch units this fiscal year. Smithers thinks full-year sales outside of China could range between 20 and 21 million.Read more: Nintendo Will Prove the Switch’s Longevity This Holiday SeasonThe company’s shares have climbed more than 50% this year on the anticipation of the Switch’s China debut, the release of a smartphone edition of the Mario Kart franchise and the launch of the cheaper Switch Lite. Nintendo is likely to revise upwards its full-year earnings forecasts when it reports results in January, which could tempt some investors to sell and lock in gains, Smithers wrote.“Even if it doesn’t, this quarter’s figures should impress,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Zheping Huang.To contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Nintendo Switch China Sales Could Reach 4 Million by March, Analyst Says"

2019-12-20,"The bull thesis on Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) heading into 2020 is strikingly simple. It goes something like this.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com In 2018 , JD.com stock struggled. That's because escalating U.S.-China trade tensions led to slowing Chinese economic activity, which weighed on JD's profits. But that dynamic reversed course in 2019. Specifically, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions started to ease, and economic activity in China began to rebound, causing all aspects of JD's financial results to bounce back.Consequently, JD.com stock soared in 2019. In 2019,  its shares are up more than 66%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn 2020, this same, favorable dynamic will persist. U.S.-China trade tensions will continue to cool. Economic activity in China will continue to rebound. JD's revenue growth rates will stabilize in the 20%-plus range, and its margins will keep ticking higher, while its profit growth will remain robust.This favorable dynamic pushed JD.com stock materially higher in 2019. It will do the same in 2020. According to my estimates, JD stock can make a run towards $50 in 2020. That means JD can climb roughly 40% over the next 12 months, and that's just too attractive to pass up on. Why JD Should Perform Well in 2020JD looks good heading into 2020 because its fundamentals should continue to improve over the next several months.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd For all intents and purposes, the quality of JD's results are dictated by the performance of the Chinese economy. In other words, because JD.com is the second-largest e-commerce platform in China and is used by many consumers in many parts of the nation, the growth rates of China's economy largely determine JD.com's revenue growth. For example, when China's economy started to meaningfully slow in 2018, JD's revenue growth rates sank from 40% to 20%. When China's economy started to rebound in 2019, JD's revenue growth improved from 20% to nearly 30%.In 2020, China's economy should continue to accelerate because U.S.-China trade tensions will ease further, since neither side wants to upset the egg carton heading into the American election.Thus, in 2020 there will be a stalemate of global trade tensions. This stalemate will inject a level of global geopolitical and economic stability which was notably lacking in 2019. This injection of stability will cause corporate confidence levels to rebound. That, in turn, will lead to a similar rebound of global capital spending plans, especially those involving China.  As a result,  China's entire economy will be boosted.So in 2020, China's economy will continue to rebound amid easing geopolitical tensions, and that rebound will cause JD.com's revenue growth to stabilize in the mid-20% range. At the same time, its profit margins will continue to improve as it grows.So in 2020, JD's revenue growth will be high, while its margins will continue to rise. That dynamic pushed JD.com stock way higher in 2019. It will do the same in 2020 because the valuation of JD.com remains favorable. JD Stock Will Make a Run Towards $50The numbers at this point indicate that JD stock can make a run towards $50 in 2020.According to numbers from eMarketer, China's retail e-commerce market grew by over 27% in 2019 to nearly $2 trillion, and JD controlled about 17% of that market. Given that only  40% of China's consumers are using e-commerce and that internet penetration rates in China remain well below the norms of developed nation, it is clear that China's e-commerce sales will continue to grow 15%-20% annually for the next several years.As a result,  JD.com will maintain a 15%-20% revenue growth rate for a few reasons. First, the company has its own logistics network and is known for delivering things very quickly in China. Second, smaller e-commerce players should disappear as the market matures, providing more  opportunities for the bigger names, including JD, to gain market share. Third, JD.com is expanding overseas, which should boost its top and bottom lines.Meanwhile, JD.com's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins will come in at roughly 3% this year. That's very low. The average operating profit margin among  e-commerce companies is around 9%. Thus, as JD.com grows, the company has a huge opportunity to improve its profit margins.JD's revenue looks poised to rise 15%-20% over the next few years, with huge, positive margin drivers. I estimate that the company's earnings per share will rise towards $3.30 by fiscal 2025. Based on an FY25 price-earnings multiple of 21-times forward earnings, which is average for the information technology sector,  and a 10% annual discount rate, that equates to a 2020 price target for JD stock of nearly $50. The Bottom Line on JDJD stock surged 2019 because easing U.S.-China trade tensions sparked a rebound of China's economy, which boosted JD's growth. This dynamic will persist in 2020. As it does, JD.com stock will march towards $50.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD.

2019-12-20,"The most dominant e-commerce stocks are Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the next tier of companies in this space is compelling, too.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and China's JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) are among the names in this category. Unbeknownst to some -- due in large part to the sprawling nature of Alibaba's business model -- JD is one of China's largest dedicated e-commerce companies. And JD.com has outperformed its larger rival by about ten percentage points this year.With JD stock up 69% in 2019, it's appropriate to wonder how much more gas is left in the tank. The good news is that, while JD stock may not replicate its 2019 performance in 2020, betting on more gains by JD.com isn't a far-fetched idea.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsJD stock lures investors because, as an e-commerce name, it operates in a growth arena. Plus, its share price appreciation gives it the feel of a growth stock. More importantly, JD.com is a growth company with a balance sheet that would make many other growth names, foreign and domestic, green with envy.&quot;JD.com's liquidity remains strong, with RMB56.6 billion (around $8.2 billion) in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the end of September 2019 and no debt maturing over the next 12 months,&quot; Moody's Investors Service wrote in a recent note. &quot;Moody's expects JD.com's planned capital spending and investments will be adequately covered by its cash reserves and estimated operating cash flow of around RMB20 billion-RMB25 billion ($2.9 billion-$3.6 billion) over the next 12 months.&quot;In other words, JD's cash hoard of $8.2 billion is about 17% of its market capitalization. That's a trait that many investors arguably do not fully appreciate. A Smart StrategyOne of the primary reasons for embracing stocks like BABA and JD is the sheer mass of China's e-commerce market. The country has more internet users than the U.S. has citizens, and its middle class is continuing to grow. However, those factors are already baked into JD.com stock. It's time for management to generate some fresh catalysts.And that's exactly what management is doing. The company is boosting its customer base and focusing on opportunities in smaller, but still growing, Chinese metropolitan areas.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd &quot;Encouragingly, we see JD's ability to attract more users from lower-tier cities and its enhanced relationship with suppliers solidifying its online retail market positioning,&quot; Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap said in a recent note.Integral to the long-term thesis for JD stock is the company's ability to expand its margins while keeping its fulfillment spending under control. The outlook on both fronts appears to be encouraging. Morningstar estimates that in the next decade, operating margins should expand to 4.7%. That's up from 0.4% in 2018. The same researcher also sees it starting to rein in fulfillment spending. The Bottom Line on JD.comStill looking for more to love about JD.com? Well, it's making a foray into luxury brands through partnerships with Armani, DKNY and Prada. The company's Fashion and Lifestyle unit -- which still generates insignificant revenue -- runs this endeavor. However, thanks to these new partnerships, the unit has meaningful growth potential.Investors shouldn't overlook JD's luxury play as a possible catalyst for JD stock. By some estimates, more than half the Chinese consumers who are likely to buy those glitzy products live in the aforementioned &quot;lower-tier&quot; cities. Don't forget that's where JD.com is currently taking steps to raise its market share.Given the company's strong balance sheet and its new business initiatives, JD stock could hit the mid-$40 range next year. It just needs to boost its margins and keep a lid on costs.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While Huya (NYSE:HUYA) has been enjoying a rebound, it's not climbing as much as its peers. As Huya stock rallies into the end of the year, should investors buy the shares before it's too late?Source: Shutterstock Look at the one- and three-month returns for a handful of Chinese equities in the table below. It's pretty clear that Huya stock is continuing to struggle, even after its latest rebound. Worse, the stock's technicals do not favor the bulls at the moment, unless it suddenly gets a large burst of momentum that will send it over its resistance.Stock 1M Return 3M Return (NYSE:BABA) 14.6% 20.8% IQ 15.7% 17.6% (NASDAQ:JD) 13.3% 19.5% BILI 11.2% 22.3% (NASDAQ:BIDU) 9% 25.3% (NASDAQ:YY) (8.7%) (10.6%) HUYA (18%) (34.2%) As you can see, this stock has been displaying relative weakness at a time when its peers, Chinese stocks, and the overall markets are rallying. That's worrisome for the owners of Huya stock. Given the price action, it's hard to get overly bullish on the name. Let's look at the charts, which also aren't too encouraging.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trading Huya Stock  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comFor much of 2019, Huya stock was trapped between range support near $19 to $19.50 and range resistance around $26. When the stock failed to overcome its resistance in November, Huya sank below all of its major moving averages. Instead of Huya Inc finding buyers at range support, though, the sellers of the shares stepped on the gas.Huya stock cascaded through the $19 to $19.50 support area and bottomed at $16.40. The stock has since found its footing around $17 and has broken through its steep downtrend resistance (depicted by the blue line).  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way So now what?The charts look ever-so-slightly more constructive at the moment. A short-term bottom has been reached, while a short-term uptrend  (depicted by the purple line) is in place. Further, the MACD (depicted by the blue circle) is rotating into bulls' favor  as the momentum of Huya stock begins to turn more positive. That said, the sellers remain in control.Bulls' first hurdle is the 20-day moving average. If they can push HUYA through this mark, there's a much larger hurdle overhead. Prior support at $19 to $19.50 is likely to act as resistance. If that's the case, the tone will shift to a much more bearish note for Huya stock.If the bulls can reclaim the former range support, higher targets would become realistic. But before we can even begin discussing those, the following test will prove most notable. Long story short, the bears need to defend $19, turning former range support into resistance, while the bulls need to defend the $17 level and avoid making new lows. The FundamentalsHuya stock has been lagging its peers, and its technicals do not favor the bulls. Because of that, the stock should not be bought until it clears some vital levels. That said, Huya Inc is still a quality company.Analysts, on average,  predict that its revenue will surge 71% this year and another 36% in 2020. Unlike some of its peers, including iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and BiliBili (NASDAQ:BILI), HUYA is actually profitable.Average forecasts call for earnings of 45 cents per share this year, up 50% from last year. For 2020, the mean estimate calls for an acceleration up to 75% earnings growth, good for earnings of 79 cents per share. That's lofty, but if the company can achieve it, Huya stock would currently be trading at just 22 times its forward earnings.That valuation would look cheap to many investors, given the company's strong growth and profitability, even if Huya stock is far from being a blue-chip name.Finally, its balance sheet is solid. The company's cash and short-term investments of 9.53 billion CNY easily outweigh all of its current liabilities, which stand at just 2.17 billion CNY. Further, Huya Inc does not carry any long-term debt. The Bottom Line on HuyaWhen the fundamentals and technicals do not align, some investors (like me) are in a tough spot. There is a solution, though.Technical investors can wait for the charts to confirm that bulls are back in control with a move over $19. Fundamental investors can take a long position near current levels, but use a stop-loss below the recent low of $16.40. If Huya Inc falls  below that mark, it could reach the all-time low of $14.44.Investors should not get caught in a plunge. even if the company's fundamentals are good. Remember, risk can be defined and if investors sell due to a stop-loss being triggered, they can always get back in. Finally, some investors may find it best to take a partial position, while using proper risk controls on a decline  and adding to the position if the technicals begin to look more favorable.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-12-31,"For over a year-and-a-half, one of the biggest concerns for the markets and the global economy was (and technically still is) the U.S.-China trade war. One only needs to look at the price chart of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) shares for confirmation. Since the beginning of October, Alibaba stock has gained nearly 29%.Source: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com Naturally, other Chinese stocks, such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) have experienced dramatic bullish sentiment. Due to the escalating war of words and later, the punitive tariffs, the trade war at one point seemed to have no end. While it hurt U.S. economic interests, the dispute also exposed the vulnerability of investments like BABA stock.Yes, China has emerged into the global stage, becoming the world's second-biggest economy. According to sobering data from Standard Chartered, China could eclipse the U.S. at the top spot. If that wasn't bad enough, the U.S., according to this forecast, will never regain its throne. Initially, this augurs well for Alibaba stock and its ilk.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, China depends not just on its exporting machinery but also its other industries, such as manufacturing. As the Asian juggernaut learned, trade wars don't necessarily have clear winners and losers. Instead, both or all parties involved could experience negative economic impacts.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places Therefore, the thawing in U.S.-China relations was vital for BABA stock, if only to instill confidence back among investors. Even better, China's top negotiator agreed to meet with U.S. delegates. Insiders suggest that a &quot;phase one&quot; deal will be signed in the first week of January. If so, that could spark another leg up in Alibaba stock.But with shares having jumped so quickly, does Alibaba Group still have legs to run? Questions Still Linger about Alibaba StockIf the trade negotiations move beyond phase one toward more substantive deals, obviously, this puts BABA stock in an enviable position. And should negotiations continue to progress positively, most Chinese investments will likely move higher.Furthermore, our own political environment suggests that the bull case for Alibaba stock remains strong. Primarily, we're entering a critical election year. At the latest count, President Donald Trump's approval rating has increased to 50%. This indicates that he's winning back support from swing voters and is positioned slightly advantageously relative to Democratic frontrunners.As the last election cycle proved, give Trump even a small chance of victory and he'll deliver. But what absolutely won't get Trump reelected is if the economy tanks. Or, if he implements policies that hurt American workers, the voters will not be kind to him.Therefore, you can see how the red carpet is rolling out for Alibaba stock. Nevertheless, investors should exercise vigilance.First, China was not uninjured during the heated moments of the trade war. In fact, the country lost millions of jobs. And export data demonstrates that the Chinese economic machinery was already slowing well before Trump took office. That means the trade dispute exacerbated problems that already existed.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto Since Alibaba stock is levered largely to discretionary spending (e-commerce), a hurting labor force isn't exactly helpful.Second, while China's propaganda machine screamed loudly during the trade war, their economic data is probably worse than they're letting on. Asia Times recently investigated the issue of fake numbers in China's economic metrics. Interestingly, even BABA stock is not a true equity stake but rather, a stake in a Cayman Islands holding company.This adds uncertainty to an overheated stock that you wouldn't normally get anywhere else. Fuzzy Forecast for BABA StockBecause Alibaba stock is tied to Chinese consumer confidence, I'm not gung-ho on the opportunity. If things go awry during the trade negotiations, shares could once again find themselves on a downward trek.As I mentioned above, Trump will do anything to keep the economy moving, at least in 2020. At the same time, he can't afford to look weak against China. Regarding the Asian country's record on human rights violations, both Republicans and Democrats agree: China must be held accountable.In other words, just caving to China to get a trade deal signed is not an answer. If Trump goes that route, he'll be looking for another job come January 2021.Thus, the bottom line is that BABA stock is a tricky animal. Considering that shares have jumped so much, investors are probably best served waiting for a discount. Despite a potential phase one deal, there are many questions that yet to be answered.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Chipotle (CMG)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comOne of my favorite things to do when we see turbulence in the market? Find relative strength. That is, stocks that are outperforming the overall market. Case in point? Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which hit new all-time highs on the day.This stock has bounced hard off the 200-day moving average and its November low at $728. Shares of Chipotle are trying to push through this difficult $840 to $850 area now after breaking out of its rising channel (blue lines).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow what?  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers Let's see if CMG can gain momentum over this area, potentially up to $900. If it can't (or if the broader market weighs it down), look for former channel support to buoy the name. Below breaks the short-term bull thesis and puts the 50-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Tesla (TSLA)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been on fire, and that didn't change on Friday. The stock ripped to new all-time highs of $454 before retreating like CMG did. The question now is, can TSLA continue to power higher?As long as shares are over $430, it's hard to get bearish on the name. Look to see how it handles next week. Does it trade down to $430 or up to $454?If it's the former, see if $430 supports the stock. Below there puts the recent low of $402 on the table, as well as prior channel resistance (blue line) and the 20-day moving average. If it's the latter and Tesla rallies back up to its current high, see if it can breakout or if this mark acts as resistance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: JD.com (JD)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was a beauty on the day, giving day-traders a quick and profitable red-to-green trade.This stock has been on fire lately -- and in fact, many Chinese equities have been. JD.com hit a new 52-week high on Friday as buyers continue to bid it higher. Shares are riding uptrend support (blue line) and the 20-day moving average higher.For now, the stock is a buy-on-dips into this zone. Below it could send JD down to the 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Coupa Software (COUP)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCoupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) was the &quot;one that got away&quot; for me this morning. I had it on my list, but didn't pull the trigger with the morning mayhem and with $155 resistance looming overhead.Instead of weighing the stock down though, COUP ripped right through resistance, jumping more than 6% and hitting $162.50. It was a powerful breakout, particularly given that it came on such a rocky day in the stock market.Bulls now need to see $155 hold up as support. Falling below that level likely sends it to uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Kansas City Southern (KSU)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comKansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) is setting up in an ascending triangle pattern. That's a bullish technical pattern where rising uptrend support (blue line) squeezes a stock into a static level of resistance (black line).The stock poked its head over resistance on Thursday, but was battered lower on Friday as volatility jumped in morning trading. However, bulls bid the stock up off uptrend support and the 20-day moving average.This area is now support for longs. Below it sends it to the 50-day moving average, at a minimum. If KSU can reclaim $155, see that it takes out the November high of $156.57, opening the door to $157.50 and possibly $160-plus.Resistance has been in place for two months now. It's make-or-break time.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- China has included the internet industry for the first time in an envisioned overhaul of its anti-monopoly laws, potentially giving regulators the power to rein in the country’s increasingly dominant technology giants.Proposed revisions to the Anti-Monopoly Law, published last week, included language that accords regulators responsibility to monitor the impact that internet companies have on the online sector, their scale and their ability to control products and services. More broadly, any company found to have violated the law could be fined as much as 50 million yuan ($7.2 million), about 100 times the previous cap, according to the revised rules posted on the State Administration for Market Regulation’s website. The draft is currently open to public consultation.China is home to some of the world’s largest corporations, from e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and WeChat-operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. to up-and-comers such as ByteDance Inc. A handful of players control swaths of online businesses from retail to social media, and their backing is often key to the success of newly emergent startups. It’s unclear what punishments regulators could mete out but the industry’s leaders have drawn criticism for years for over-aggressive competitive tactics.“Online platforms and consumers don’t have equal bargaining powers, and platforms will tend to abuse their dominant positions in the market,” said Zhan Hao, managing partner with Beijing-based Anjie Law Firm. “Over the past years, China has encouraged innovation and development in the internet sector, going through a phase where regulators are more tolerant. There will be closer scrutiny going forward.”China Steps Up Antitrust; Foreigners Feel Stepped On: QuickTakeChina’s authorities took two decades to draft the anti-monopoly law before enacting it in 2008. Foreign governments and businesses have long urged China to enact clear laws and procedures for enforcing them. But critics say the antitrust crackdown is being enforced unevenly, and that the business environment for overseas companies is worsening as a result. The latest revisions appear to be targeted at domestic operators, Susan Ning, antitrust partner at King & Wood, wrote in a report published on the law firm’s social media account.JD.com Inc., for instance, has accused bigger rival Alibaba of unfairly locking in exclusive agreements with merchants, which Alibaba has denied. Regulators have investigated the legality of ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing’s acquisition of Uber Technologies Inc.’s Chinese business. And Tencent’s WeChat dominates many aspects of daily Chinese life from payments to gaming, though upstart ByteDance has in recent years begun to eat into its advertising business through video service Douyin and news platform Toutiao.“This definitely casts a spotlight on the internet sector and how it does business,” Ning wrote. “As we understand it, singling out the internet sector signals a new-found focus on the industry’s unique characteristics and is intended to ensure room for its expansion. Also, it signals a renewed focus on the internet, and on internet platforms in particular.”&#92;--With assistance from Dong Cao.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Targets Internet Giants in Sweeping Antitrust Law Overhaul

However, technology's growing influence across all aspects of society, as well as the maturation of dozens of companies, has widened the field. Now, you can tap technology for consistent blue-chip growth, and in some cases, even for reliable dividends with decent yields.The following are the 15 best tech stocks to buy for 2020, with options for several portfolio needs.

Income winners have a nice track record of making (and raising) payouts, established growers boast leadership positions and profits, and great speculations are either developing a new market or have a clear opportunity to disrupt entrenched leaders.

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese flexible display maker Royole Corp. has filed confidentially for a U.S. initial public offering to raise about $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said.The startup seeks funding to expand its sales and marketing and research facilities, the people said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private. It had originally planned to raise that amount via a private financing round at a valuation of about $8 billion, people familiar with that deal said in March. But the Chinese company is now tapping U.S. markets after liquidity tightened during a downturn in China’s venture capital sector, the people said.Royole, known for manufacturing the world’s first commercial foldable phone, competes with Samsung Electronics Co. and BOE Technology Group Co. to produce bendable screens using cutting-edge organic light-emitting diode technology. The company, which gave away wraparound-screen hats at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, this month unveiled a smart speaker that packs a bendable display around a cylinder.It’s unclear what timeframe the company’s looking at, the people said. A Royole representative declined to comment.Royole is regarded as one of a coterie of Chinese technology startups working to dismantle the decades-old image of China as a clone factory by leading in design and innovation. Like Huami and Insta360, these upstarts aim to take advantage of home bases in China close to where devices are manufactured, developing products faster and more cheaply.Founded by Stanford alumni Bill Liu, Peng Wei and Xiaojun Yu, Royole needs capital to plow back into research and expand production. The company, valued at about $5 billion in a previous funding round, invested 11 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) into a flexible display plant in Shenzhen that commenced production in June. Royole is working with Airbus to install displays in planes and also collaborates with clothing, furniture and kitchen-supply customers. Royole has said it secured a deal with Louis Vuitton that will see the two companies putting flexible screens on handbags of the future.Its full line of products encompasses head-mounted displays intended for use as so-called mobile theaters and other wearable flexible displays. The company even has a smart writing pad that it sells on Amazon.com, JD.com and in stores across China, the U.S. and Europe.Royole’s earlier investors include Knight Capital, IDG Capital, Poly Capital Management, AMTD Group, the funds of Chinese tycoon Xie Zhikun and the venture capital arm of the Shenzhen city government.Read more: The Trade War Spurs China’s Technology Innovators Into Overdrive(Updates with details on Royole’s inception from the fifth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Julia Fioretti in Hong Kong at jfioretti4@bloomberg.net;Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Display Maker Royole Is Said to Have Filed for Confidential U.S. IPO

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese ride-hailing startup Dida Chuxing is seeking to raise as much as $300 million and is considering an initial public offering, escalating competition with larger rival Didi Chuxing, according to people familiar with the matter.IDG Capital-backed Dida is raising between $250 million to $300 million in a pre-IPO round that it pitched to a wide range of investors, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Dida has mulled floating on exchanges in mainland China or Hong Kong, but prefers the latter, one person said. A Dida spokeswoman declined to comment.Ride-hailing operators are grappling with dwindling investor sentiment after Uber Technologies Inc. went public last May only to see its shares tumble. Dida, which infuses social elements into its car and taxi-hailing operation, has been trying to raise capital since around the middle of last year, the people said. It’s unclear what valuation the Chinese company is targeting.In May 2015, Dida received a $100 million funding from China Renaissance Capital Investment, according to Dida’s website. In March 2017, Chinese private equity fund Nio Capital led a new round in Dida. Hillhouse Capital, IDG, JD.com and Nio Capital participated in the company’s last funding round, according to a slide deck created in August but that’s been recently circulated to investors and viewed by Bloomberg News.Dida says it became profitable last April, earning 29 million yuan ($4.2 million) in the second quarter of 2019, according to the investor presentation slides. The company generated 151 million yuan in revenue for 2018, and expects that to have jumped to 643 million yuan last year, the same presentation shows.Beijing-based Dida is a distant second to Didi in China’s ride-hailing arena but its popularity grew after two female passengers were murdered while using the services of competitor Didi. Dida operates a network of 1.2 million taxi drivers and its daily orders has surpassed 3.65 million, according to the deck.To contact the reporters on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.net;Dong Cao in Beijing at dcao59@bloomberg.net;Manuel Baigorri in Hong Kong at mbaigorri@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Didi Rival Is Said to Seek Up to $300 Million in Pre-IPO Round

Asia markets fell Tuesday, and U.S.-listed tech companies are also under pressure. Shares of iQiyi Inc. , Baidu Inc. , Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , and JD.com Inc.  are all off in morning trading.

2020-01-22,"Coronavirus, shmoronavirus. The market just doesn't care, with the S&P 500 hitting another new all-time high on Wednesday. That said, let's look at a few top stock trades for Thursday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Boeing (BA)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBoeing (NYSE:BA) shares remain under pressure, as its 737 MAX woes continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Now though, the stock is breaking through critical range support.Over the past 18 months, only the market-wide, fourth-quarter meltdown was enough to take BA stock below $320 range support. For the past year, any negative 737 MAX news was met by buyers near this mark -- until now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips$320 support gave way this week, and now BA is knifing through its 150-week moving average. For many, BA is a no-touch. That is, until it reclaims $320 range support, or gets to a lower price. In the event of more downside, let's see if BA revisits the 2018 Q4 lows between $285 and $290.  * 10 Stocks to Buy as the 2020 Presidential Election Approaches Below puts the 200-week moving average near $265 on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Aphria (APHA)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAphria (NYSE:APHA) stock was one of two cannabis plays that I liked coming into 2020, along with Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). APHA is moving nicely on the day, up nearly 8%.The stock is hitting its highest level since it closed at $5.50 on Dec. 13, as it breaks out over that same price and continues to gain after pushing through downtrend resistance (purple line).Bulls would love to see APHA power through the 200-day moving average, although it may very well act as resistance on its first test.If Aphria shares pullback, bulls need to look for two areas of support. The first is $5.50, which had been resistance for months, while the second is the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below, and $4.50 is back on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: JD.com (JD)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAbove is a multi-year, weekly chart of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which shows the impressive bullish volume in the stock over the past few quarters. The stock hammered out a nice bottom near $20 in late 2018, and has been working higher ever since.For most of 2019, JD.com was setting up in a beautiful long-term ascending triangle. That's where rising uptrend support (blue line) squeezes a stock against a static level of resistance. The latter came into play near $32 and the 200-week moving average.Bulls got what they were looking for in the form of a big-time breakout. JD has since reclaimed $36, and continues to rise. If it can maintain this week's gain, investors are looking at a bullish, engulfing candle -- suggesting more upside could be in store.  * 7 Energy ETFs to Buy for a Rebound in 2020 Over $42, and the $44 to $46 range is on the table. Historically, JD.com has struggled above this area. Above it, and $50 is possible. Below $39, and perhaps we can get a test of $36. Should the market really unravel, I'd love to scoop JD up at $32. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Virgin Galactic (SPCE)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comYou want to talk about volume, though? Just check out the profile on Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE). This stock continues to erupt higher and higher, leaving the stratosphere.We flagged the stock on its breakout over $12, paving the way to some tremendous gains, although I have been more cautious on the name north of $15. Like I said then, there could certainly be more upside, but no way can we be buyers here near $20 when SPCE was at $11 just a few days ago.Maybe we can buy a pullback, if there are signs that bulls still have momentum.

2020-01-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hong Kong is missing an opportunity to displace the U.S. as an offshore listing venue for Chinese companies by keeping trading fees too high. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $11 billion offering in November showed the potential for the city’s stock exchange to attract U.S.-listed mainland enterprises amid an unsettled trade relationship between the two largest economies. Relatively expensive costs threaten to undermine that appeal.Investors get more for their dollar when they trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In Hong Kong, bid-ask spreads are wider and minimum investment requirements are higher. That increases the chance of so-called slippage, when there is a difference between the expected price of a trade and the level at which it is actually executed. With zero stamp duty and lower minimum trade requirements, the NYSE has a more favorable environment for active investors.Alibaba’s Hong Kong trading volume has slumped since the internet giant made its debut on the local exchange. On Nov. 26, shares valued at the equivalent of about $1.79 billion changed hands. Since mid-December, that figure has dropped to a daily average of about $322 million. The Hong Kong listing has made no dent in Alibaba’s stock trading in New York, where volume has averaged $3.2 billion since late November.To be sure, trading costs are by no means the only factor — or even the main one — in deciding where to buy and sell. To begin with, the U.S. is a more deep and liquid market. It has other advantages, including a more active and developed options market that gives traders more ways to hedge or speculate on stocks. That said, Hong Kong could do a better job of rolling out the welcome mat.Since losing out to New York for Alibaba’s record $25 billion initial public offering in 2014, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has made a number of rule changes to enhance its viability as a platform for technology startups from China and elsewhere. In April 2018, the exchange amended its provisions to admit companies with dual-class shares. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.  and internet services company Meituan Dianping listed soon after, demonstrating that when HKEX makes smart decisions, the exchange benefits.More U.S.-traded Chinese companies are looking at Hong Kong for potential secondary listings. They include travel services provider Trip.com Group Ltd., formerly known as Ctrip; game and website operator Netease Inc.; web search provider Baidu Inc.; and e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. The way is open for Hong Kong to create a new offshore ecosystem for U.S.-listed Chinese companies seeking better positioning for the mainland while hedging their bets against a renewed deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship after the phase one agreement was signed this month.It makes little sense to squander this opportunity by maintaining trading costs that are a major barrier to entry. The Hong Kong government and the exchange must work together to make dual listing opportunities both beneficial and attractive to companies while encouraging investors to trade here. However, HKEX regulators seem to have their heads in the sand when it comes to reducing fees and the minimum buy-in to entice more companies. That may be a reflection of its monopoly status: Unlike the NYSE, which must compete with Nasdaq, HKEX has no local rival.Reducing fees would lower the barrier to entry for active investors and increase trading volume. As I wrote in September, cutting stamp duty would help improve liquidity and make Hong Kong stocks more attractive to retail and institutional investors. The ripple effect from this would further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a global financial center. It’s time for the government and exchange to look beyond the immediate impact of reduced revenue and consider the long term.  To contact the author of this story: Ronald W.

2020-02-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.The deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has pushed the Chinese medical community into overdrive, has also prompted the country’s hospitals to more quickly adopt robots as medical assistants.Telepresence bots that allow remote video communication, patient health monitoring and safe delivery of medical goods are growing in number on hospital floors in urban China. They’re now acting as a safe go-between that helps curb the spread of the coronavirus.Keenon Robotics Co., a Shanghai-based company, deployed 16 robots of a model nicknamed “little peanut” to a hospital in Hangzhou after a group of Wuhan travelers to Singapore were held in quarantine. Siasun Robot and Automation Co. donated seven medical robots and 14 catering service robots to the Shenyang Red Cross to help hospitals combat the virus on Wednesday, according to a media release on the company’s website. Keenon and Siasun didn’t reply immediately to requests for comment. JD.com Inc. is testing the use of autonomous delivery robots in Wuhan, the company said in a statement. Local media has also reported robots being used in hospitals in the city as well as in Guangzhou, Jiangxi, Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.The rapid spread of the coronavirus has left provincial hospitals straining to cope and helped accelerate the embrace of robots as one solution, turning the gadgets into medical assistants. These bots join China’s tech-heavy response to the coronavirus outbreak, which also includes airborne drones and work-from-home apps. The jury remains out on how effective these coping tactics will be.China’s rapid buildout of fifth-generation wireless networking in areas around urban hospitals has also seen a rise in 5G-powered medical robots -- equipped with cameras that allow remote video communication and patient monitoring. These are in contrast to robots like little peanut, whose primary function is to make indoor deliveries.“The technology of robots used in Chinese hospitals isn’t high, but what this virus is also highlighting -- and it could be the next stage of Chinese robots -- is the use of medical robot deployment,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nikkie Lu.China Mobile Ltd. donated one 5G robot each to both Wuhan Union Hospital and Tongji Tianyou Hospital this week, according to a report by ThePaper.cn. Riding the 5G network, these assistant bots carry a disinfectant tank on board and will be used to safely clean hospital areas along a predetermined route, reducing the risk to medical personnel.Zhejiang People’s Hospital used a 5G robot to diagnose its first coronavirus patient on Sunday, according to a report by the Hangzhou news center run by the State Council Information Office. Beijing Jishuitan Hospital performed remote surgery on a patient in Shandong province via China Telecom Corp.’s 5G network last June.While it may take patients a moment or two to get over the shock of being helped by a robot rather than a medical professional, bots have already permeated a growing number of sectors in Chinese society including nursing homes, restaurants, warehouses, banks and over 200 kindergartens.Financial services company Huachuang Securities Co. believes even more robots are in China’s immediate future. Pointing to National Bureau of Statistics data suggesting that domestic production of industrial robots increased by 15.3% in the month of December, they predict similarly fast growth in the current quarter, according to a report published by Finance Sina.The increased quantity of robots deployed to combat the coronavirus has helped accelerate China’s path to the goal it had already set for itself. The country wants to become one of the world’s top 10 most intensively automated nations by the end of this year.To contact the reporter on this story: Kari Lindberg in Hong Kong at klindberg13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Virus Pushes Robots to the Frontlines of Hospitals

2020-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.Like their counterparts in Silicon Valley, China’s largest tech companies struggled to prove online groceries can be a viable business. Then the novel coronavirus struck.Its spread has extended a lifeline to a slew of money-burning businesses -- many backed by big name venture capital funds and tech giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- that in some cases were on the brink of collapse in 2019. Millions of consumers shunning supermarkets and meal-delivery services are testing promises by Tencent-backed Missfresh or Alibaba’s nationwide Hema chain to ship fresh food to their doorsteps. Those that deliver can expect many of first-time customers to stay even after the epidemic burns itself out.The boom is one more way in which the abrupt onset of the epidemic is transforming consumer behavior in the world’s No. 2 economy. Usage of other online services from mobile gaming to internet malls is surging as the epidemic confines millions to their homes.“Before the Chinese New Year, many of these firms were looking precarious and their only lifeline was the deep pockets of their big backers,” said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. “Right now, fresh grocery delivery platforms are seen as an essential for consumers to minimize risk of infection.”Not all of them are equipped to handle the sudden increase in demand. The most immediate obstacles include a shortage of delivery staff, inventory management and the difficulties of navigating physical roadblocks put up by local governments trying to curb the disease’s spread. And if the coronavirus outbreak hurts the economy, expect that also to squeeze funding overall for all tech startups.The epidemic has led consumers to seek eating options that are healthier than takeout, especially with online chatter about the risks of take-out delivery people transmitting the disease. There’s less of a concern around fresh food since delivery frequency is lower than takeout and many people take comfort in cooking their own meals.Norris sees the outbreak ushering in another boom era for e-commerce in China. Overall, he expects online to account for a third of China’s retail sales in 2020, up from around a quarter last year.Alibaba’s Hema chain, including 18 stores at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, have operated non-stop during the extended Lunar New Year break. Online orders have spiked, prompting Hema to increase its vegetable supply across Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the company said in a statement.Missfresh saw a quadrupling in online orders for groceries during the first five days of the Lunar New Year compared with the same time last year. The company sold 40 million food items including eggs, lettuce and beef during the seven-day period. And JD.com Inc. said its sales of fresh food increased by 215%, reaching almost 15,000 tons during the 10-day period ending Feb. 2, compared with the same period last year.Twenty-one-year-old Ye Xie would ordinarily be back at Fudan University in Shanghai by now, starting her last semester. But because of the epidemic, she’s stuck in her native Zhejiang province and her family has come to depend on the app Dingdong Buy Vegetables. “Before the outbreak, they would average once a week,” she said. “Now we use it three to four times a week.”It’s an unexpected windfall for grocery delivery services that have perennially struggled with the logistics of transporting perishables like fruit and vegetables and shoppers’ innate preference for testing and selecting the freshest produce on sight. That’s good news for a sector that faces a broader funding squeeze. Last year, a raft of startups raced to replenish their war chests before what many foresaw as a capital winter brought on by a slowing economy. Missfresh was said to be seeking a new round of fundraising last July at a $3 billion valuation. The company hasn’t announced completion of that financing.“The spike in online grocery demand presents an education opportunity,” said Snow Hua, managing partner of Cherubic Ventures, which has also invested in online grocery startups like China Fresh. “Long-term though, investors will still be looking at fundamentals like whether this business model is sustainable and which companies have a better supply chain, storage and delivery system.”For some, the boost may have come too late. Dingdong, backed by Sequoia and Qiming Ventures, halted expansion in certain regions last year amid setbacks in operation, Caijing reported. Dingdong discontinued all their services in Xie’s hometown of Ningbo as of Feb. 7. The suspension was to help combat the epidemic, a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that it’s fully operational in other cities including Shanghai, Hangzhou and Shenzhen.Signs of strain are also emerging. Missfresh manager Liu Guofeng said that, during the first week of the Lunar New Year holiday, its vegetable supply ran out every day around 4 p.m., whereas it would normally take three to four days to deplete. Users rush to place orders before midnight every day when the company replenishes its stock.It’s also tried to court drivers working for meal delivery services Meituan and Ele.me, doubling the payout for riders per order from Feb. 1 to Feb. 8 and handing out 1,000 yuan ($143) in subsidies if they work eight days straight. “There’s a huge shortage on deliverymen,” said Liu. “Also a lot of villages are blocking the roads so not many people have been able to return to work.” To address labor shortages, Hema has agreed to hire staff from Chinese restaurants now that dining out has plummeted.Delivery times too have elongated. Requests that used to take 30 minutes to deliver can now need half a day to arrive, Xie said.Yet once the chaff is weeded out, the remaining players will end up with a far more established and loyal customer base. The current crisis has forced customers to turn online and at least some will remain active buyers, while surviving startups will have had the chance to hone their infrastructure and offerings.“Even though the virus outbreak brings a lot of challenges, it will also create opportunities for these online grocery startups,” said Richard Peng, founder of Genesis Capital, a Missfresh backer. “It’s fundamentally changing user habits, as they open up to the idea of buying groceries online.”&#92;--With assistance from Colum Murphy.To contact the reporters on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.net;Kari Lindberg in Hong Kong at klindberg13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Coronavirus Outbreak Drives Demand for China’s Online Grocers
2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors betting on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s inclusion in a program allowing mainland Chinese investors to buy its shares in Hong Kong could be in for a disappointment.China’s largest e-commerce company, valued at HK$4.56 trillion ($587 billion) in Hong Kong, can’t be included in the stock connect program linking the Asian financial hub with Chinese investors at present, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.The exclusion of companies with secondary listings and weighted voting rights from the program was part of an arrangement agreed to by the mainland and Hong Kong exchanges before Alibaba’s Hong Kong debut last year, the people said. The Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges haven’t agreed to make an exception or revise the agreement for Alibaba, though that could change in the future, they said.With the bourses competing to draw the listings of local firms already floated in the U.S., allowing companies in Alibaba’s position into the program would run contrary to Beijing’s ambitions of developing its mainland exchanges, particularly as unrest grips Hong Kong. Other Chinese firms -- among the country’s largest corporations, from JD.com Inc. to Baidu Inc. -- may then be encouraged to also pick Hong Kong, bypassing the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourses.The Hong Kong Stock Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has proposed changes to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which hasn’t yet made a decision to revise the previous arrangement, one of the people said.Companies with weighted voting rights and a secondary listing are not currently included in the stock connect and there’s been no precedent for such a move, a Hong Kong Exchange spokesman said in response to questions on the agreement. “We look forward to discussing the potential for this with relevant parties in the future,” he said. “More generally, HKEX is not in the habit of banning things that it considers positive for the market.”Alibaba is not among the current batch of companies to be included in the stock connect, said a separate person, adding that the list will be updated on Feb. 17.Representatives for Alibaba and the Shanghai Stock Exchange declined to comment. Shenzhen Stock Exchange and China’s stock market watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment.Alibaba’s landmark $13 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong last year was in part spurred by expectations that it would attract a vast pool of capital from its home country if included in the stock connect.In the Hong Kong offering, Alibaba preserved its governance structure: Granting a partnership of top executives the right to nominate a majority of board members. That system falls broadly into the definition of having weighted voting rights in Hong Kong.Alibaba’s shares are up about 20% since the November listing, prompting other U.S.-listed technology companies including Trip.com to look at a secondary listing in Hong Kong, people familiar have said. Alibaba fell as much as 2.5% in Hong Kong Tuesday, the biggest drop in two weeks, before paring losses. In the past, China has green-lit companies with weighted voting rights that conducted primary share sales in Hong Kong to join the stock connect program. For example, food delivery giant Meituan Dianping and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. joined in late October. Chinese firms with dual class shares started listing in July on Shanghai’s new tech-focused Star board.(Updates with shares)&#92;--With assistance from Kiuyan Wong and Lucille Liu.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Evelyn Yu in Shanghai at yyu263@bloomberg.net;Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Jonas Bergman, David ScanlanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Blocked From Hong Kong Stock Link to China
2020-02-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The decision to exclude shares of China's biggest e-commerce company from a cross-border trading link is a blow to Hong Kong. Is it a punishment, or simple self-interest at work? The answer matters, both for the city’s exchange and for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Alibaba can’t be included in the stock connect program linking Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges at present, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. China’s securities regulator has yet to agree to rule changes proposed by Hong Kong Stock Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. that would allow the internet company to participate, one of the people was cited as saying.Granted, the Jack Ma-founded internet giant doesn’t qualify under the stock connect program’s existing arrangements, which exclude companies that have secondary listings with weighted voting rights. These were already in place before New York-listed Alibaba raised $13 billion selling shares in Hong Kong late last year.But exceptions have already been made. In October, China allowed companies with dual-class shares to join the connect, giving investors in the mainland access to Hong Kong-listed technology companies Xiaomi Corp. and Meituan Dianping. Rules can be changed when there is the desire to do so.Clearly, that was the expectation among investors here. The notice on dual-class shares was posted by the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in mid-October and took effect Oct. 28. Three days later, Alibaba was reported to be planning its secondary listing in Hong Kong the following month. The shares started trading Nov. 26.Investors in Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock will have a right to feel short-changed if the shares lose steam as a result. They dropped as much as 2.5% after the Bloomberg News story published, before recovering to close little changed. Alibaba has rallied more than 20% since its debut in Hong Kong, at least partly on anticipation that the stock will draw a wall of money from mainland Chinese investors who wouldn’t otherwise be able to buy.The lack of support for Alibaba to join the stock connect is a severe blow to Hong Kong’s aspirations of marketing itself as the offshore listing venue of choice for Chinese technology companies, in an environment where the U.S. has become increasingly inhospitable and businesses are considering their options. Trip.com Group Ltd. and Netease Inc. are among U.S.-listed Chinese enterprises that are said to be looking at listing in Hong Kong. Bankers have talked of pitching other names including JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc.The prospect of acquiring an enthusiastic mainland investor base that would help to buoy valuations is a key selling point for those who might be tempted to decamp from a U.S. exchange. If Alibaba — a marquee name with a $578 billion market capitalization — can’t get the nod, what’s the hope for any of the others?More worrying for Hong Kong is what the reluctance may say about China’s support for the city, as it contemplates the hit to its own economy from the coronavirus epidemic. HKEX, after all, is a competitor as well as a partner with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. If Hong Kong becomes too attractive a venue for China’s leading companies, that may hold back development of the mainland’s markets.In 2018, Hong Kong relaxed its listing rules to admit unprofitable technology companies, competing with the U.S. and making the exchange even more alluring to Chinese hopefuls than the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. In turn, Shanghai introduced the tech-focused Star Board in July, a Chinese answer to the Nasdaq that accepts money-losing companies with weighted voting rights. After a lively start, the board’s performance has been underwhelming. It has drawn few big names and has thin turnover.All may not be lost. Smartphone maker Xiaomi had been public in Hong Kong for 15 months before it joined the connect, while food-delivery app Meituan had to wait 13 months. HKEX and Alibaba will have to hope this is the slow arm of bureaucracy rather than the cold shoulder. To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-02-27,"Given the hysterical headlines about the coronavirus from China, you might expect that Chinese stocks are getting pummeled. That's widely the case, but many are not. Take JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) for instance. JD stock is down a little less than 10% since their recent 52-week high. Given all the dour news and dreadful stock market trading of late, one might wonder why JD stock isn't down more.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com One explanation is that JD was on a huge winning streak right until the coronavirus started to hit. The company went through a couple of lean years in 2018 and the early part of 2019, as revenue growth dipped, the CEO was arrested on suspicion of rape, and the company's profit margins wavered. Investors were understandably nervous. In the second half of 2019, however, the company totally turned things around. Combine that with the first stage trade deal agreement between the U.S. and China, and JD appeared all set for a blockbuster 2020. Strong Earnings & Value UnlockingJD's last earnings report was a strong one, with both revenues and earnings coming in way ahead of expectations. Subsequently, the company posted strong holiday sales. This brought in analyst upgrades, such as from Barclay's, citing accelerated profit margins and strong Singles Day sales as a reason to get bullish on JD.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnother factor in JD's favor is that the company is starting to realize the value in its other business units beyond the core e-commerce segment. It already divested JD Finance while retaining a substantial profit share and potential equity stake. It is making plans for a gigantic JD Logistics IPO outside of China, perhaps in Hong Kong or New York. And the company's fast-developing JD Health division could also fetch a solid asking price in coming months or years.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip  Make No Mistake: Coronavirus Is Bad For BusinessWe're hearing a narrative out there that the coronavirus will, counter-intuitively, actually be good for e-commerce leaders like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD. It's not a totally crazy proposition on its face either. Given that as many as 700 million Chinese people are under quarantine, folks won't want to go out shopping. And in many cases, brick and mortar stores themselves will be closed for the time being. So, that should naturally lead to a big pop in online sales, right?Not necessarily. The e-commerce industry has a reputation for being fairly recession-resistant. This, however, is largely based out off of the Great Financial Crisis, when online commerce was still a far smaller portion of the overall sales environment. E-commerce is now large enough, both in China and in the U.S., that it is likely to feel a similar impact as brick and mortar when the economy turns down. While a virus is somewhat less harmful to online retail versus physical, that dynamic won't outweigh a broad economic slowdown. JD Isn't Just RetailIt's also important to consider that JD is more than just its core retail business. You have its broad logistics network for example, which is a great source of value. It seems probable that JD will do a partial spin-off or sale of logistics to raise capital and generate shareholder value. The value of logistics networks, logically, tends to fall sharply during recessions though.You have JD's finance business. There's a whole lot of stuff under the umbrella there, including consumer finance, securities, supply chain financing, insurance, and the like. The value of elements of this business could drop sharply in a recession.Also, don't forget that JD has an investment arm that puts money into a lot of other businesses, both private and publicly-listed. JD's investment in luxury retailer Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), for example, has gone poorly in general, and it's veering from bad to worse now: Farfetch stock is down 20% just over the last week alone. JD Stock ConclusionThere's certainly something there with the idea that the virus will change consumption habits. And it's certainly better to be an e-commerce business than a physical retailer during a global health scare. That said, if China goes into a recession, consumers will pull back spending across all distribution channels. People that are out of work simply aren't making huge discretionary spends, whether in-store or online.If you want to play a coronavirus effect-type stock, social media platforms or streaming sites seem to make more sense. Something like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the U.S., or video streamers like IQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) in China. People stuck at home will certainly use their time on something, but it might not be shopping.Over the long haul, I remain a firm JD stock bull. I haven't sold any of my holding in the company despite both the trade war and now the coronavirus. That said, it's rather strange that JD stock is down less than 10% from its highs given the recent developments. This is a good time to hold, but wait for a steeper pullback to buy JD stock.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

The company has once again caught strong support at its 50-day moving average, and there are plenty of near-term catalysts that could send the stock to $50, near-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Two Top Reasons Not to Worry about JD Granted, there have been some recent issues.One, China's consumer economy slowed in recent years, thanks to the trade war.However, as our own Luke Lango writes:&quot;Those trade tensions are finally de-escalating, and should continue to meaningfully de-escalate into 2020 as neither side wants to up the trade war ante. Easing trade tensions in 2020 will breathe life back into China's consumer economy, as well increased fiscal stimulus from the People's Bank of china, and resurgent consumer spending will create a rising tide for all Chinese consumer stocks.&quot;Two, the economy will take a hit in the first few quarters on the coronavirus story. However, it appears that much of that fear has been priced in, creating &quot;blood in the streets&quot; opportunities. In addition, coronavirus won't hit e-commerce too hard, since shopping online doesn't put too many folks at risk of the virus.In fact, Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu called companies like JD &quot;shelters in the storm, as people stuck at home flock to play games and shop - cementing online habits,&quot; reports Barron's contributor Reshma Kapadia. Also on that list are companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). JD Stock Is Still Fundamentally StrongIn its most recent quarter, JD saw surging sales that crushed estimates.  For the third quarter, revenue grew 28.7% to 134.8 billion yuan ($19.2 billion), which beat company guidance. All thanks to strong growth in China's &quot;fast-growing lower-tier cities,&quot; as highlighted by CEO Richard Liu. JD's revenue forecast of between 163 billion yuan and 168 billion yuan also came in above expectations.Better, &quot;Analysts have remained optimistic that China's e-commerce sector will continue to grow, led by the spending power of the country's 400-million strong middle class,&quot; notes Barron's contributor Callum Keown. The Bottom Line on JD StockWith the trade war cooling off, and the coronavirus sending more folks online, JD has become one of my top blood in the street opportunities. Plus, with eCommerce still explosive, I wouldn't be shocked to see shares of JD at $50 by year-end. After all, it's tough to argue against the strength this stock has been exhibiting.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

The $0.08 in adjusted EPS exceeded analyst's expectations of $0.06.During the period, U.S. $1 was worth slightly less than RMB 7.Management said that large ticket durable goods and discretionary items have declined the most since the outbreak of the virus.

Concerns around home delivery and installation were stated as some of the reasons for diminished appliance demand. Recent increases in laptops and small appliances &quot;as more people stay home and cook their own food&quot; have provided an offset to declines in larger appliances.Management did state that they &quot;believe that the epidemic situation is getting better for some regions&quot; and noted that some provinces are coming back online.JD.com saw annual active customer accounts increase 19% year-over-year to 362 million in 2019 with full-year net revenue increasing 25% to RMB 577 billion, or $83 billion.&quot;We are pleased to conclude 2019 with another strong set of results in the fourth quarter.

2020-03-03,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. surged to its highest since June 2018 after its forecast for at least 10% revenue growth this quarter suggested online retail in China was proving more resilient to the coronavirus epidemic than anticipated.Its shares rose more than 12.4% in New York, their biggest gain since August, after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue of 170.7 billion yuan ($24.5 billion), surpassing the highest analyst’s estimate thanks to a strong performance during November’s Singles’ Day shopping event and robust user growth.China’s No. 2 online retailer stressed that the sales forecast was a preliminary estimate while it gauges the extent to which the nationwide spread of Covid-19 will dent the world’s No. 2 economy. At its lowest point of 10%, the company’s outlook is less than half the 21% revenue rise that analysts on average anticipated for the March quarter. But JD was more upbeat about the industry impact than larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which expects the outbreak to hurt revenue growth and said business on its retail marketplaces will decline because of widespread logistics disruptions. And on Friday, Baidu Inc. predicted its sales may slide as much as 13% this quarter.For now, JD foresees business bouncing back. Demand remained strong during the epidemic for consumer goods and fresh produce, popular among the millions of Chinese confined to home. The company is in fact growing daily active users and orders at a faster pace, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Sidney Huang said. On Monday, the company announced Senior Vice President Sandy Xu will take over from September, replacing the retiring Huang.Read more: Alibaba Warns Virus Having Broad Impact on Chinese EconomyWhat Bloomberg Intelligence saysJD.com’s call for at least 10% sales growth in 1Q is a shift from Alibaba’s warning of a decline two weeks ago, suggesting the shakeup from the virus outbreak is fading faster than Alibaba expected.&#92;-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Read more: Coronavirus Outbreak Drives Demand for China’s Online GrocersJD may fare better than its peers because it employs a direct-to-consumer sales and in-house logistics model that may prove more resilient to short-term disruptions than platforms that connect merchants with buyers, some analysts say. Away from the outbreak, JD continues to win more consumers from smaller Chinese cities and towns, while demand for the electronics it depends on should rebound after the outbreak subsides.“JD’s in-house logistics is a clear advantage over the other players during the virus outbreak,” said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Blue Lotus Capital. “The buy side will be happy about the 10% guidance compared with Alibaba’s.”Longer term, the company will continue to go head to head with upstart Pinduoduo Inc., which now rivals JD in market value. In September, the latter company rolled out a group-buying platform called Jingxi, which, like Pinduoduo, entices purchases with incentives, rebates and other promotions. It’s also available to the billion-plus users on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s all-in-one app WeChat.“The coronavirus situation in March is still unknown. We have tried to take into consideration the potential downside, but so far we’ve been doing relatively well,” JD’s Huang told analysts on a conference call. “We do hope once the coronavirus situation stabilizes, we will resume our increasing margin trends.”To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",JD Leaps to 20-Month High After Sales Outlook Quells Virus Fears

2020-03-06,"U.S. stocks are trying, and failing, to find a bottom. A 3.4% decline on Thursday leaves the S&P 500 more than 10% below its highs -- and again testing the 3,000 level.In this environment, any kind of good news would be welcome. And a surprisingly strong earnings calendar next week could provide some reason for optimism.Several tech giants will release earnings, and give updates on the current state of their respective industries. Retailers will deliver fourth-quarter numbers, along with commentary on both the U.S. consumer and overseas supply chains. One of China's fastest-growing companies will test -- or maybe move -- sentiment toward that key market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be sure, panicky trading may offset any good news these companies can deliver. It's also possible the news is worse than investors realize, even with U.S. indices off double-digits from their highs.  * 9 Stocks to Buy If People Get Stuck at Home So, investors looking for hope should keep an eye on earnings next week -- Including these seven reports in particular. Earnings Reports to Watch: Pinduoduo (PDD)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, March 11, before market openChinese stocks have held up surprisingly well in recent weeks, and e-commerce provider Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) has been no exception. PDD is down 3.8% so far this year, but has been mostly flat since the coronavirus from China first began to spread in late January.That sideways trading, however, likely comes to an end next week. The options market right now is pricing in a roughly 13% move in Pinduoduo stock by next Friday, and recent history suggests that might even be conservative. PDD gained 16% after second-quarter earnings in August before plunging 23% following November's Q3 report.Those past moves alone show how important earnings next week will be to PDD stock. But it's not hard to imagine the report moving other Chinese names, as well. Pinduoduo's commentary on customer demand will read across to larger e-commerce rivals Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). It should also show the resilience -- or lack thereof -- of the Chinese consumer to factory shutdowns, temporary wage cuts and travel restrictions.For Pinduoduo itself, there seems to be little room for error. At over 11 times revenue, Pinduoduo stock is not cheap. Alibaba and JD.com both posted strong results, meaning third-place Pinduoduo needs to show it's keeping pace.And for the group, next week provides a intriguing test. The strength shown by Alibaba and JD strongly suggests that Pinduoduo, too, will post an impressive quarter. However, the more interesting question might be how investors react. If investors are aggressive enough to boost a high-valuation Chinese stock back near -- or past -- all-time highs, that has to be considered a good sign for the rest of the market. Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, before market openFiscal fourth-quarter earnings from Dollar General (NYSE:DG) on Thursday morning will provide a snapshot of demand closer to home. For Dollar General itself, the goal is simple: no surprises.After all, DG stock has been mostly unaffected by the market-wide selloff. Shares actually have dropped less than 1% so far this year, but they've dropped 6% from new highs reached last month. Investors seem to see DG stock as a defensive play, and Dollar General needs to keep it that way.Overall, a surprise does seem unlikely. Rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported this week, and though guidance was light, that seems attributable to long-running issues with that company's acquisition of Family Dollar.  * 3 Hot Stocks to Trade After the Correction If results are mostly in line, then DG -- like PDD -- could provide an interesting test of sentiment. Does a solid, if unspectacular, quarter remind investors of the potential in quality companies? Or is anything short of a blowout simply not good enough in this nervous market? We will find out. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, after market closeFiscal first quarter earnings from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are part of a big Thursday afternoon for tech stocks. Broadcom earnings will be of particular importance to the semiconductor sector, which has struggled during this selloff. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is down more than 12% from last month's highs, and a 3% decline on Thursday interrupted a bounce that began last week.That said, strong numbers from Broadcom could provide a boost to the group. But investors should, and will, pay particularly close attention to commentary from chief executive officer Hock Tan. Tan is one of the industry's most well-regarded CEOs. His company has a diverse business with total market share around 30 percent.There are few CEOs better-equipped to take the temperature of the industry -- and Tan has done so before. Indeed, on last year's Q1 call, Tan called the bottom in chip demand. However, the sector rallied on the news. And though Tan was a bit early in his call, the SOXX has gained 24% since. With that, chip investors can only hope Tan delivers a bullish outlook again. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, after market closeFiscal first-quarter earnings from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) provide an interesting test case for market sentiment. We know Adobe is one of the best software companies in the U.S., and maybe just one of the best companies, period. That said, I've long been a bull for that reason. We can bet Adobe's earnings will beat consensus analyst estimates, as the company hasn't missed Street numbers on either revenue or earnings in almost four years.Furthermore, as with Dollar General, what seems uncertain in this market is how investors will react. ADBE stock hasn't dropped that far in this rally, with shares currently 11% below their highs. But even that relatively modest discount, combined with an earnings report that reminds investors of Adobe's impressive growth, should be enough to bring in buyers.If it isn't, however, that's a warning sign for all of tech. ADBE stock isn't cheap, at about 36 times earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2021. But that multiple hardly is out of line in this market. If investors see ADBE as &quot;too expensive&quot; next week, that's bad news for other quality names with premium valuations -- and for weaker companies receiving modestly lower multiples.  * 3 Dividend Stocks to Ride out the Market Volatility Put another way, if investors sell ADBE next week, there's still a long list of other stocks they're going to sell, as well. Slack Technologies (WORK)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, after market closeSlack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) has been one of the few winners over the past six weeks. Shares bottomed around $20 in late January, and since have gained 28% as coronavirus fears likely have been a positive catalyst. Like Zoom Video Technologies (NASDAQ:ZM), investors figure the company can more easily acquire customers as offices close and employees work from home.After that rally, Slack management needs to confirm the optimism on Thursday afternoon. Fiscal Q4 results won't get much help, as the quarter closed on Jan. 31. But guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2021 will be closely watched.Wall Street is looking for 37% revenue growth in FY21. So if Slack tops that figure while boasting of record sign-ups, there's a good chance WORK can keep its rally going. ZM might get a bounce, as well.And here, too, the reaction to the report will be interesting. WORK is one of the market's most expensive stocks, trading at about 26 times the high end of FY20 revenue guidance. Many such high-flyers have held up surprisingly well in this selloff, as we haven't quite seen the valuation-driven crash that skeptics long have predicted.If that group is going to tip, however, WORK would be the first to go. And so a selloff in Slack stock Friday after a strong outlook on Thursday might suggest that valuation concerns finally have returned in full. Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, after market closeFiscal third-quarter earnings arrive at a pivotal time for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). After sideways trading for much of 2019, ORCL has tumbled in 2020. Shares are down almost 10% so far this year, and off about 14% in a recent plunge to a 13-month low.However, there are more than just short-term considerations at play. Oracle is trying to execute a turnaround, and playing a bit of catch-up as it tries to transition its business to the cloud. Progress on both fronts has been uneven; the same is true of ORCL stock, which has gained less than 12% over the past three years.  * 9 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for Every Investor As a result, the question I asked more than two years ago remains the core question for Oracle: Is it the next Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), or the next IBM (NYSE:IBM)? Oracle hasn't answered that question well enough yet. But Thursday's report gives the company another chance to do so. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, March 12, after market closeUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) too has seen its stock tumble recently. Shares have dropped almost 17% in the last ten sessions. That selloff interrupted a recovery from August lows reached when ULTA fell almost 30% following the fiscal Q2 report.ULTA would gain 11% after a better Q3 release in early December, and trading next week again could be volatile. The options market is pricing in a nearly 15% move by next Friday. So with Ulta delivering guidance for 2021, a spike -- or plunge -- wouldn't be stunning.That's particularly true since results and guidance could determine where ULTA sits within its sector. Unsurprisingly, given rising recession risk, the group has sold off in recent weeks. But within the sector, the same multi-year trends have held. Mall-exposed names continue to get hammered, as they have for years. And larger, higher-quality retailers have done relatively better.Overall, the question for ULTA is in which camp it falls. Is it another brick-and-mortar retailer doomed to eventually lose share to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), or a unique omnichannel business model with real growth potential -- a la Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU)? Over the past two weeks, investors haven't treated Ulta like one of the &quot;better&quot; retailers. If the company can prove on Thursday that it is, there's big upside coming on Friday.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s parcel and meal delivery arms have returned to pre-coronavirus outbreak staffing levels, the latest example of how China’s largest corporations are getting back to work after Beijing’s entreaty to safeguard economic growth.Cainiao, of which Alibaba owns more than 60%, is again at full strength after a few weeks during which the epidemic disrupted transport and held up shipments. Meal delivery unit Ele.me and grocery chain Freshippo are also back at full strength and operating at “full capabilities” at present, an Alibaba spokeswoman said.That recovery underscores how the world’s No. 2 economy is slowly getting up to speed after Covid-19 confined millions to their homes and paralyzed roads and rail nationwide. Cainiao, the company at the heart of Alibaba’s e-commerce business, oversees a network of millions of delivery people that can handle upwards of a billion packages daily at their peak.Last week, Alibaba-rival JD.com Inc. forecast at least 10% revenue growth this quarter, suggesting online retail in China was proving more resilient to the coronavirus epidemic than anticipated.Read more: Chinese Abandon Food Delivery Fearing Drivers Will Spread VirusTo contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba’s Chinese Delivery Arm is Back at Pre-Outbreak Levels

Governments around the world are racing to protect the public. At the same time, it's crushing just about every stock on the market, some unfairly, like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).Source: testing / Shutterstock.com However, just as we noted about JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), BABA provides shelter from the storm.In fact, that's how Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu described companies like JD and BABA. All &quot;as people stuck at home flock to play games and shop -- cementing online habits,&quot; reported Barron's contributor Reshma Kapadia.

It is often described as an e-commerce giant -- but it is far more than that,&quot; said Veljko Fotak, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Finance, School of Management at University at Buffalo. &quot;While factory shutdowns all over China cannot be good news for a company that is, at its core, a business-to-business marketplace for the mainland, some aspects of the business are set to prosper.&quot;  * 10 Ways to Diversify Your Portfolio at This Time of Crisis In addition, &quot;There is something surreal about how resilient this stock has been, in the face of such shock to domestic industrial activity. A couple of weeks ago, the company revealed that its logistic arm was operating at 20% capacity, with couriers unable to return to work and local mobility restrictions hampering deliveries. This week, we have seen news that Alibaba's research labs have developed an artificial intelligence system that can diagnose the COVID-19 virus based on images from CT scans.&quot;At the same time, Alibaba is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China. Not only is it best known for e-commerce, it's also involved in the explosive cloud computing business. As I noted in November, with the global cloud market expected to grow 17.5% this year to $214.3 billion from $182.4 billion in 2018, according to Gartner, BABA stock could be a major beneficiary. Analysts are Still Bullish on AlibabaWhile Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang did say the virus is a &quot;black swan&quot; event that would negatively affect the company's suppliers and employees, analysts aren't too concerned.

2020-03-13,"China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, may already be getting back to normal. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock, considered the country's second-leading e-commerce merchant after Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), closed March 12 higher than where it started the year.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The gains in JD stock have continued in U.S. trade as well. The company's market cap is over $56 billion on a sales growth rate of 25%. For the year it generated free cash flow of $2.8 billion.JD's Christmas quarter, announced early in March, dazzled investors, with net income of $116 million, 8 cents per share, and revenue of $24.5 billion. The company now has 362 million customers, 70% of them from smaller cities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is China Back?China is already sending doctors to countries like Iran, Italy and Pakistan, where caseloads are increasing. China's leading expert on the virus says the global outbreak could be over by June if proper measures are taken.  * 7 Game-Changing Tech Stocks to Buy Now There have been over 80,000 cases of the coronavirus in China, by the government's estimate, and over 62,000 have already recovered. The government is signaling that the worst is over there.If that's the case, the Chinese economy, and JD, could see even faster growth. The company is due to report its March quarter on June 1, with a loss of 13 cents per share expected on revenue of $19.21 billion. That would represent growth of 11.6% over last year's first quarter.Some analysts are beginning to call JD undervalued, pointing to its growth rate and higher margins. By all reports JD.Com is also stable at the top, having already announced a successor for its retiring CFO, Sidney Huang. Is JD An Outlier?If JD and other Chinese companies are already seeing growth after the virus, it could mean the outbreak won't take the toll on global growth analysts had feared.During the worst of the outbreak, JD switched from delivering luxury goods to staples in the impacted areas, creating 35,000 new jobs in the process. CEO Liu Qiangdong, also known as Richard Liu, used his experience running the company during the 2003 SARS epidemic to prepare JD for the coronavirus.InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer recently called JD a better pick than Alibaba. He writes the company keeps beating expectations. He suggested the drones and robots of its logistics unit are proving more successful during the outbreak than Alibaba's outsourced delivery. He expects growth to accelerate and market share to increase as the year goes on.Long-term investors are also starting to like JD because of its logistics network. Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), once considered a major low-cost rival to JD, is now seeing decelerating growth and is burning cash. Its most recent quarter missed estimates, even as it ramped up promotions and subsidies. The Bottom Line on JD StockIt may be that JD is an outlier, one of the few Chinese companies that are succeeding despite the coronavirus.It also may be true that the threat from this virus is overestimated. Wuhan has 11 million people, the Hubei province has 58 million, but China has only reported 90,000 cases of coronavirus.I wouldn't buy JD stock here because, if these estimates are accurate, the rest of the market is dirt cheap and offers an unparalleled buying opportunity. But the company's results represent good news. With millions of Americans in panic mode, with so much about the coronavirus unknown, the success of JD in getting through what looks like the worst of the outbreak should at least be reassuring.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

The company’s shares dropped 11.4 percent in U.S. trading closing at $35.24.    JD.com’s repurchase program will be funded from its existing cash balance, the company said in a statement.

2020-03-20,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s e-commerce sector is beginning to emerge from a months-long logistics ordeal brought on by the coronavirus outbreak, judging by the latest data on delivery volumes. But a longer-term rebound hinges on a recovery in demand for goods beyond the essentials.Industry leaders Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. struggled to meet a surge in demand for household staples and gear such as surgical masks, after the epidemic forced authorities to shut highways and rail nationwide and couriers stayed home. But an analysis of publicly available information by Barclays showed shipping activity in many areas had approached pre-outbreak levels as people resumed work and roadblocks came down.Based on official data showing 3% year-on-year growth of online physical product sales during January and February, e-commerce growth will approach normality in the second quarter, Barclays analysts Gregory Zhao, Ross Sandler and Jane Han wrote. By March 11, full-truck load delivery capacity nationally was 72% of its November 2019 peak, they said, pointing to data from logistics websites G7.com.cn and Chemanman.com. This month, Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao -- which ships upwards of a billion packages daily at its peak -- said it was already operating at full capacity.Beijing released data on Monday that suggests the world’s No 2 economy may contract for the first time since 1989, denting consumer spending. Brick-and-mortar merchants have been particularly hard hit and almost half of China’s listed consumer companies don’t have enough liquidity to survive past September, according to a Bloomberg analysis. The situation is less dire online but a full e-commerce recovery will come only when consumers resume buying the big-ticket items that dropped off priority lists at the height of the outbreak, when people rushed to stock up on essentials like groceries, protective gear and household staples.Most middle-class consumers are cautiously tightening spending, said Ashley Galina Dudarenok, founder of China insights and training company Chozan. “That’s the gravest long-term impact of the virus,” she said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","China Online Retail Giants Alibaba, JD Emerge From Coronavirus Deadlock"
2020-03-20,"Investors looking for stocks to buy at the beginning of this year most likely picked wrong. U.S. stocks have been routed. The S&P 500 is down 25% year-to-date. It's safe to say that the declines have been broad as well as deep.Of over 4,500 stocks with a market capitalization over $50 million, only 200 -- less than 5% -- have gained so far this year. And many of those few winners actually have benefited from the spread of the coronavirus from China.In biotech, Co-Diagnostics (NASDAQ:CODX) has rallied as it works to deliver a coronavirus test; the likes of Inovio (NASDAQ:INO) and iBio (NYSEMKT:IBIO) have gained on hopes for a treatment or vaccine.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMakers of protective gear have soared. Lakeland Industries (NASDAQ:LAKE) has gained 55%. Allied Healthcare Products (NASDAQ:AHPI) has been the market's best stock this year, gaining almost 1,370%.There have been second-order winners as well. Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) has gained amid higher demand for its video conferencing solution. The same is true for telehealth leader Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC). Micro-cap delivery plays Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) and Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH) have seen enormous jumps on hopes that widespread restaurant closures can save businesses that looked headed for bankruptcy.Those rallies all make at least some sense (even if a few seem to have gone too far). But there have been very few stocks in 2020 whose businesses have been strong enough to survive the crashing market without concrete near-term tailwinds.  * 10 of the Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy in a Bear Market These seven stocks make that list. That alone means they should be given consideration from a long-term perspective. After all, if a stock can hold up in this market, it might well be able to soar when and if positive sentiment returns. Survivor Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Ioan Panaite / Shutterstock.com To be fair, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is getting a bit of a sales boost of late as brick-and-mortar retail in the U.S. essentially shuts down. But in the context of a market capitalization now back over $1 trillion, a few weeks of brisk sales aren't on their own enough to allow AMZN stock to dodge the plunging broad market.Rather, Amazon has executed well. Fourth-quarter results last month were a blowout, and assuaged investor fears about the cost of one-day shipping. More recently, Amazon has delivered essential goods worldwide, managing amid supply shortages and spiking demand.Amazon has reminded investors and customers why it's one of the world's best businesses. And that's been enough to keep Amazon stock positive in 2020 despite a still-hefty headline valuation and potential pressure on the Amazon Web Services cloud business.That trading suggests AMZN is one of the better large-cap stocks to buy going forward. After all, if the stock can hold $1,800 in this environment, there should be a path back to $2,000 and beyond if and when the bull market returns. Rite Aid (RAD)Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) is one of the more surprising names on this list. This is a company that just last summer looked to be on a path to bankruptcy. And while investors might think that consumers stocking up on pharmaceuticals are driving a big bounce in revenue, the coronavirus hasn't done much for Rite Aid's largest peers.Over the past month, RAD is up 17%. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has declined 23% and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is off 8%. That outperformance isn't new -- following the recent gains, Rite Aid stock now has more than tripled from August lows.There could be more upside ahead. Shares have gained nicely in recent sessions after strong guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and for full-year fiscal 2021. Rite Aid still has a heavily leveraged balance sheet, which brought the stock down as profits plunged. That leverage can amplify gains on the way back up, and with the company guiding for same-store sales growth in FY2021, the trajectory of the business remains positive.Indeed, I've become steadily more bullish on RAD stock of late after seeing too much risk in the past. Clearly, I'm not the only one whose opinion has changed. Stamps.com (STMP)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) probably is receiving a bit of help from coronavirus concerns. Consumers choosing to avoid the post office may be using the company's offerings instead. And as with Zoom Video or even Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the hope would be that some of those new users can be converted to longer-term customers.That said, STMP stock slid along with the market for most of the past few weeks, which suggests that investors weren't necessarily pricing in a huge near-term upswing. And Stamps.com has earned its rally as well.Shares were crushed last year after the company announced the loss of exclusivity with the U.S. Postal Service. It then slashed full-year guidance following the first quarter report in May. But since then, Stamps.com has performed better and steadily won back investor confidence. The stock rallied 65% after the Q4 release last month, in large part because adjusted earnings per share were guided to $4 to $5 in 2020, against Street expectations of $3.24.STMP did wind up giving back nearly all of those gains -- but has caught a bid of late. Particularly if the broad market can stabilize, the combination of short-term tailwinds and improved performance makes it one of the more attractive stocks to buy right now. Simply getting back to post-earnings highs suggests upside of almost 50% on top of the 42% year-to-date rally. JD.com (JD)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) would seem to be a prime candidate for selling right now. The Chinese economy only now is starting to recover from its coronavirus outbreak. JD stock isn't cheap, at about 30x current consensus EPS expectations for 2020. Few stocks seem more poorly positioned for a &quot;risk off&quot; environment.To be sure, shares have struggled of late. The stock is down about 15% from levels seen earlier this month. Still, the stock is up 11% so far this year and is maintaining support that's held repeatedly in the $36-$37 range.That performance is particularly impressive in the context of rivals. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has declined 12% YTD, and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) 8%. Investors are fleeing stocks in the category, and in the market, but mostly hanging on to JD.If that outperformance continues, and JD can deliver on its long-term growth potential, the current price under $40 may prove to be a massive buying opportunity. ShotSpotter (SSTI)Source: Shutterstock Like Stamps.com, ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) saw a huge bounce following fourth-quarter earnings last month. And like STMP, SSTI stock gave back its gains.In fact, a one-day 32.6% rally after earnings not only was erased, but SSTI dipped below pre-earnings levels. The stock then rallied 26% on Thursday -- likely due to updated guidance for this year.ShotSpotter said after the close on Wednesday that it was cutting its revenue outlook -- but only by about $2 million. The company still expects to be profitable on a GAAP basis for the first time. And it's been able to virtualize its Incident Review Center, allowing staff to work from home but still monitor covered neighborhoods for gunfire detected by the company's namesake solution.Even with the recent volatility, SSTI has gained 18% so far this year. More volatility may follow; this remains an early-stage company still expecting less than $50 million in revenue in 2020.Still, the company is delivering on its promise, and there's an enormous runway for growth. Investors may well believe that if ShotSpotter can grow this year, amid so many challenges for local government, it will grow even faster once some sense of normalcy returns. Veeva Systems (VEEV)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) may receive some modest benefit from the response to the coronavirus. The software developer focuses primarily on the life sciences vertical, and increased activity from customers working on treatments, tests, or vaccines for the new virus could drive higher sales of Veeva products.That said, a modest short-term boost to revenue wouldn't seem like enough to counter valuation fears for a still-expensive name. Yet VEEV, save for a brief decline last week, has performed rather well even as many software-as-a-service peers have fallen sharply. With the selloff now reversed, the stock is up 3% so far in 2020.That bounce makes VEEV an attractive choice for investors both bullish and bearish on the market. Investors looking for stocks to buy no doubt will consider a growth darling that can hold up in all but the most panicked environments.But bears looking for stocks that would struggle in another selloff also might consider VEEV from the short side. For all its positives, this still is a stock valued at a stunning 20x trailing 12-month revenue. Most stocks with similar valuations have sold off sharply over the last few weeks. The fact that VEEV hasn't could be proof of its underlying strength -- or a signal that it's due for a reversal. J.M. Smucker (SJM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com For a few sessions now, J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) participated in the rally in consumer staples. Investors this week seemed to remember that consumer spending on food and household products would hold up -- and potentially accelerate as U.S. households stocked up.And so we've seen nice gains this week in names ranging from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to food plays Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) and Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB).Those rallies did fade a bit on Thursday, as investors looked for stocks to buy in more challenged (and cheaper) sectors. But SJM still looks like one of the better stocks to buy in its own space. The company's transition into safer and faster-growing coffee and pet markets continues apace. It's valuation is attractive. And like peers, SJM should see strong results over the next few months.To be sure, I've been bullish on the stock for some time -- and the bull case simply hasn't played out yet. The stock has traded sideways since September. But, in this market, sideways trading is nothing to sneeze at. Like the other stocks on this list, if SJM can hold up now, it can rally when investor optimism returns.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-27,"With the rout in the stock market, investors are looking for things that will bounce back quickly. One obvious place to go looking is in the big data stocks. Coming into 2020, these companies were delivering stellar results. And now, the coronavirus serves as a potential catalyst to help them recover quickly.The current outbreak caught the world flat-footed. Vast chunks of the medical system were not adequately prepared. With the aging of the population in particular, authorities must upgrade hospital systems to avoid similar catastrophes in the future.Big data can play an integral role in this. By making the medical system more efficient, artificial intelligence can help governments and companies make more of the resources they already have. In addition, investments in IT can, in many cases, be more effective than other approaches. Investorplace spoke via e-mail with University of Connecticut  Business Professor Sudip Bhattacharjee, Ph.D., about how tech companies are using big data amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bhattacharjee said:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Big Data and AI can heal, steal or kill - depending on how its used. China and South Korea have used Big Data and AI techniques heavily to track movement of infected persons. In general, such techniques can be used in the following ways: * Airline manifests -- clusters of nearby passengers can identify potential contamination in confined spaces.* GPS coordinates of persons using mobile phone information. This is a very powerful method, where precise location and path followed by infected and potential persons can be tracked, and congregations and movement of people can be re-created.* Facial identification can be used as a complement to GPS movement re-creation.* Travel document scanning and comparison to understand movement of people across geographies.&quot;This offers many advantages compared to traditional methods. Humans simply aren't that good at containing viruses on their own. Bhattacharjee explained:&quot;The upshot of using such Big Data and AI technology is that humans may not always remember their travel and precise paths. Big Data techniques can easily and quickly help to pinpoint movement of infected and other people in crowded places. It also requires fewer resources, during an emergency, to identify and track movement. This process can help to quickly isolate or contain a contagious outbreak.&quot;Bhattacharjee warns, however, that there needs to be more clarity on data sharing. Privacy is a major concern. In some Asian countries in particular, there are more codified rules on these fronts. This helped countries such as Taiwan stop the virus in its tracks using big data. However, Bhattacharjee warned that the U.S. is behind the curve on data sharing as it relates to disease tracking, saying: &quot;While there are examples of such Big Data and AI techniques in other countries, there is very little evidence of this approach in the U.S.&quot;  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem So what's an investor to make of all this? Certainly it's worth looking at big data stocks in Asia that have already shown expertise in the healthcare sector. And while the U.S. is lagging the field now, don't count out America's leading tech companies either. Here are seven big data firms to have on your radar as the world fights the coronavirus pandemic. Big Data Stocks Fighting Coronavirus: IBM (IBM)IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a clear play on data, particularly within the healthcare space. The company is famous for Watson, its Artificial Intelligence technology with a wide range of applications across the medical industry. From detecting cancers to optimizing health data tracking and many other things, Watson can make a huge impact across the sector.Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com More specifically, IBM has entered the fight against the coronavirus directly. The Trump Administration recently announced that IBM has partnered with the White House to create the IBM Summit super-computing system.This network allows rapid-fire calculations. According to IBM's head of research, Summit allows &quot;researchers to run very large numbers of calculations in epidemiology, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling,&quot; quickly, when these tasks would take months or years via other methods. Already, the government is using IBM's computing systems to test possible compounds to cripple the coronavirus. While IBM isn't getting as much limelight as some of the drug companies, it's playing a central role in the nation's fight against the pandemic. JD.com (JD)JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is best-known for its e-commerce platform. But like many emerging tech companies in China, JD has a lot more going on beyond its core business.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Included in that is JD Health. Of the 2019 class of newly-minted tech unicorns, JD Health became the second-most valuable as it successfully raised funds at a $7 billion valuation. That made it the second-best of the year, trailing only Uber's (NYSE:UBER) advanced technology unit subsidiary.And it shouldn't be surprising that JD Health is attracting substantial investor interest. Sure, the business at its heart is a standard e-commerce platform, serving, in effect, as an online pharmacy.That's a large, if relatively mundane, market. However, JD Health is doing a ton of stuff to build a broader platform, such as providing customers access to genetic testing.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem It also has data-driven operations in areas such as wholesale drug buying, and web-based hospital services. JD is well on its way toward becoming a one-stop healthcare shop. Alibaba (BABA)I'm not a huge fan of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in general. The company has complex accounting and has many moving pieces that make analysis more complicated. That said, if you're talking about big data stocks with a healthcare angle, Alibaba is clearly part of the discussion.Source: Shutterstock Alibaba has earned praise for relief efforts during the coronavirus outbreak. It has offered no charge medical consultations to Chinese citizens that are overseas during the outbreak. Alibaba founder Jack Ma has also donated tons of medical equipment to the fight against the virus.In addition to Alibaba's efforts at the parent level, it also has its Alibaba Health Information Technology. Alibaba's health information company is not listed in the United States, however it is publicly-traded in Hong Kong. Its shares there have soared from 4 Hong Kong Dollars in 2018 to as much as 16 HKD earlier this year, and the company now carries a 150 billion HKD market capitalization (approximately $19 billion USD at time of writing).Shares soared in particular during the coronavirus outbreak, seemingly showing the impact of Alibaba's big data approach to tackling problems including pressing medical needs. The company has made partnerships with big-name firms such as Merck (NYSE:MRK) that help establish its credibility as an emerging star in the field. While investors primarily own Alibaba for its commerce and cloud businesses, the health care business could surprise folks as well. Google (GOOGL)It's not just the Chinese internet giants that are interested in the healthcare space. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an obvious leader among the big data stocks and is increasingly making its move in the medical system.Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com Google gets high-profile attention for some of its healthcare-related ventures. For example, sister company Verily recently helped the White House create a website that shows people where to find coronavirus testing kits. The big play for Google in medicine, however, is assembling all the data it already has on users and figuring out new ways to improve user experience with that information.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem The possibilities are already amazing, and will only continue to grow. Google's proposed acquisition of FitBit (NYSE:FIT), for example, would give Google a trove of personal medical data. Who knows what Google's data scientists will be able to accomplish in coming years as they analyze all this information through some of the world's most advanced algorithms. Amazon (AMZN)Google will need to act quickly, because it's far from the only American tech giant making an entrance into the healthcare arena. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hasn't made its plans for the sector entirely clear, but it certainly has something in mind.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com Over the years, there were rumors that Amazon would make a big splash into brick and mortar pharmacies to complement its Whole Foods acquisition. This hasn't happened yet. However, Amazon has ambitions in the online pharmacy space. And we're seeing that start to bear fruit during the current viral outbreak.Amazon recently launched a service to deliver and pick up coronavirus at-home testing kits. This should help reduce the spread of the disease while making life easier for patients that are already suffering from severe symptoms. Amazon is also a founding member of the COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition.More broadly, expect Amazon to continue to use its scale and vast troves of data to build out a powerful healthcare infrastructure. Its leadership in the home speaker market could be a particular edge. Amazon could develop an unmatched knowledge of its clients through Alexa and other voice-powered means. This, in turn, could enable Amazon to become the one-stop digital pharmacy in coming years. Cerner (CERN)Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) is another big data stock focused directly on healthcare. It provides software systems and other related services to hospitals and other medical facilities. It currently has more than 27,000 clients in dozens of countries around the globe. As you can imagine, with that level of access, it is one of the most direct and biggest plays on big data within the healthcare space.Source: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com Adding to that, Cerner recently acquired AbleVets. AbleVets launched in 2012 to offer healthcare consulting and information services to the federal government. It focuses on key needs including cybersecurity and data analytics.You can be sure that after the uneven response to the coronavirus, the government will be authorizing far more funds to these efforts in coming years. Companies like Cerner will stand to benefit as the federal government shores up its capabilities here going forward.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem The stock has fallen from record highs to 52-week lows in recently, with the share price sliding from $80 to less than $60. That means that Cerner is now selling for less than 20x forward earnings. And unlike so many companies, the coronavirus does nothing to change demand for Cerner's mission-critical solutions. Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH)Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is a diversified play on information technology spending. As companies ramp up their efforts in big data, they need more and more tools to support their IT systems. Cognizant is set to profit as this trend accelerates.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The company is by no means a pure-play on healthcare. It has three major business lines: financial services, healthcare and logistics and manufacturing. Overall, analysts forecast that the global technology consulting market will grow at nearly 12% annually in coming years, giving a huge headwind for firms like Cognizant.Also, of note, it gets more than 80% of its revenues from the United States, differentiating it from IBM and Asian-based rivals that are more exposed to international markets. It seems highly probable that the U.S. will spend huge sums of money to bring its healthcare systems up-to-date after getting blindsided by the coronavirus. Cognizant, as a U.S.-focused player specializing in healthcare, should be a winner.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-03-27,"By one measure, the bull market returned on Thursday. As we noted in yesterday's Big Stock Charts, there was a technical argument that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had done so yesterday. The case is easier to make after the Dow rallied another 6.4% on Thursday.Source: Shutterstock As Barron's noted, the term &quot;bull market&quot; isn't set in stone. But the Dow, incredibly, has rallied 21.3% in just three sessions, satisfying one common definition. Add in a late-day rally Monday and the bounce nears 24%.A snapback rally in Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been a key contributor. But the S&P 500 itself has gained 18% in three days. The rally has been broad as well as steep.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem As U.S. stocks look to close what could be the best week of trading since the 1930s, optimism seems to have returned. Friday's big stock charts look to tap into that optimism. Like the market, all three stocks found support. And all three could see more upside ahead. JD.com (JD)Source: Provided by Finviz To look at the first of Friday's big stock charts, one might not even know a sell-off had occurred. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has mostly rallied through broad market declines, and there's a case that the rally should continue:  * For the most part, this simply looks like a solid chart. A broadening ascending wedge that's held since August suggests new highs are on the way. Excluding a short-lived dip, JD stock mostly has held the 50-day moving average, which can provide support going forward as well. An investor might worry about short-term resistance as a few rallies have reversed this year, but that aside it seems like JD stock should head higher.  * Fundamentally, there's a strong case. Just last week I highlighted JD stock as one of seven stocks that had survived the market carnage and could keep rallying. Shares aren't all that expensive relative to trailing earnings. China is getting back to normal. Its e-commerce market is big enough for both JD and larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).  * That said, JD probably needs this rally to hold, or at least not reverse. Trading earlier this month shows that broad market weakness can bring JD.com down with it. In-country risk remains elevated. As with the market as a whole, investors can be hopeful but they still need to mind the downside. Charter Communications (CHTR)When we highlighted Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) in Big Stock Charts almost two months ago, the chart looked fantastic while the fundamentals were questionable. Even with CHTR stock 15% cheaper, this edition of Big Stock Charts sounds much the same:  * CHTR stock managed to bounce nicely off support that held in August. Thursday's rally retook the 200-day moving average. There seems to be a path to at least the 50DMA, which suggests roughly 8% further upside.  * But the fundamentals still look questionable at this price. Charter still has to deal with the effects of cord-cutting going forward. A valuation of 23x forward earnings hardly seems cheap in that context.  * Charter has been a wonderfully-managed company as it's built out its business through acquisitions. As a result, it was one of the best stocks of the bull market: at February highs, CHTR had rallied almost 1,500% from financial crisis-era lows. After this bounce Charter stock is basically back where it was in mid-December -- and 'only' up about 1,200% from the 2009 nadir.  * For investors who believe the bounce of the last three days has gone too far, this chart can serve as Exhibit A. As steep as the decline seemed to be, there are a significant number of large-cap stocks like CHTR who now trade back where they did just months ago. Fundamentally, CHTR shows that the buying opportunity in the market as a whole might not be quite what a 30%-plus decline in major indices would suggest. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Provided by Finviz Market bulls might see it differently, however. Those that do should take a look at the third of Friday's big stock charts, which suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has a rally ahead:  * As with CHTR, TMO stock has seen support hold, save for a brief decline during the worst of the market panic. But it hasn't received quite the same bounce: shares are up 'just' 13% from their low (and even less looking to closing prices). There's whitespace toward moving averages which can be reached if market stability holds.  * Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher shouldn't have much, if any, real impact from pandemic fears. The life sciences supplier serves customers that have little or no macroeconomic exposure. The scramble to treat the coronavirus may cause some short-term supply chain issues, but hardly enough to drive a 17% decline from February highs.  * Again, market bulls should consider TMO here just above support. But skeptics might respond that the decline here makes more sense than it seems. Many believe that market valuations simply had run too far in February. From that perspective, the fall in TMO stock isn't an unjustified sell-off. It's a correction. And the same trend explains at least a portion of the big fall elsewhere in U.S. stocks.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s consumers are shopping online again. But their purchases signal they plan to stay indoors for the foreseeable future, dashing hopes for a spending recovery as the nation contemplates its post-virus world.Lunch boxes saw 120 times more searches in the last 30 days as the virus pushes people to prepare their own food even after returning to the office, according to March 26 data from Index.1688, which collects information from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shopping sites.Portable tableware, foldable spoons and work clothing also surged in popularity, while items typically given as gifts or used for travel and outdoor activities haven’t shown signs of recovery.Yoga mats and hula hoops for home exercise also climbed in demand, a bad sign for gyms waiting for the return of patrons.The data undermines predictions of a V-shaped recovery in the world’s biggest consumer market that has seen more than 80,000 infections and 3,000 deaths from Covid-19. While big operators like Starbucks Corp. and Yum China Holding Inc. have been reopening outlets, they face a public that’s preferring to stay home after work and continue to social distance, even though official data indicates China’s number of new infections fallen to zero.China’s experience may prove an important indicator for how the rest of the world recovers. Even after outbreaks are contained, lingering fear is likely to change consumer behavior for longer than expected.“Consumers are still cautious about going out and many of those venues are not yet back to full working mode,” said Jason Yu, Shanghai-based general manager of Kantar Worldpanel. Items for a return to work, such as instant coffee, hair and skin-care products, are recovering ahead of the market, he said.Other products to post a spike in searches include contact-less thermometers, suits and stationery, according to Index.1688.A report by JD.com Inc.’s research center also shows work-related consumption speeding ahead of other categories. China’s second-largest e-commerce company sold five times more lunch boxes in late February than a month earlier, while powerbanks, office equipment and stationery are also high up the list.“Consumption of staples is clearly outshining discretionary or luxury goods in what is still very much a lukewarm and uneven recovery,” Ned Salter, head of global research at Fidelity International, said in a statement. “We need to see more consumer confidence to sustain the improvement and that will depend on how well China deals now with imported cases to contain the virus fully.”A Coronavirus Vaccine in 18 Months? Experts Urge Reality CheckRetailers in China have been cautious in their forecasts since the virus emerged.Yum China Holding Inc., which operates KFC and Pizza Hut in the country, has said the second quarter will be “challenging” and patience is needed. Anta Sports Products Ltd., the country’s biggest sportswear maker, forecasts the first six months of 2020 will be “tough throughout”.About 60% of listed restaurant operators in China are at risk of running out of cash within six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and company reports.With the food and beverage industry reeling, local governments are trying to boost consumption by urging officials to dine out in restaurants and shop in malls. Vouchers are being given out by cities including Hangzhou and Nanjing as well as shopping platforms Meituan Dianping and Suning.com Co. to spur spending.While China’s new infection numbers have plunged, the pandemic is widening globally with cases worldwide now topping 786,000 and more than 37,800 dead. Chinese factories are experiencing a second shockwave as western clients cancel orders en masse.Luiz Chen, a 31-year-old auditor in Guangzhou, recently bought moisturizing masks and a new dress before returning to the office but said she won’t be treating herself to anything expensive after her employer froze bonuses for the past two months.“I’m scared to get a salary cut or even lose the job,” said Chen. “Economic crisis seems not far away.

2020-04-01,"[Editor's note: This story was written prior to the news that Luckin Coffee allegedly fabricated its sales. Given these allegations, all investors should approach this stock with great caution.]Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK) is the fastest-growing name in coffee in China. As LK stock struggles this year, coffee is a cyclical business. When consumers feel good about the economy, they're willing to indulge their caffeine habit, perhaps even paying up to do so.Source: Keitma / Shutterstock.com When it appears economic contraction is afoot, consumers rein in spending. An easy way to do that is to nix the daily coffeehouse visit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmerican investors' experience with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) confirms as much. The stock typically performs well as the economy expands, but consumer cyclicals usually aren't the place during crises.The Chinese consumer is being pinched by the COVID-19 pandemic. This month, the MSCI China Consumer Discretionary 10/50 Index is off about 10.30%, while LK stock is more than three times as bad with a March loss of 35.29%.  * 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch Given the state of affairs in the world today, it would be easy to dismiss a consumer cyclical company that derives all of its revenue in China. But with Luckin knocking on the door of profitability, investors shouldn't be hasty in glossing over this name. China Risk and RewardLet's be honest: the Chinese Communist Party is controversial to those of us in the West. That's to put things delicately, but Beijing is proactive in protecting the economy. That much was on display on March 30 when the People's Bank of China (PBOC) cut its reverse repo rate to 2.2% from 2.4%. That move came along with the central bank pumping $7 billion into money markets.More easing is widely expected, if not needed. How do central bank policy and coffeehouses intersect? Again, use the example of Starbucks in the U.S. In order for &quot;regular&quot; folks to allocate $20, $30 or more per week to have indulgences, they need to feel confident about the economy, secure in their jobs, and that financial markets are firm. Whether or not they are consistently effective is up for debate, but central banks play a part in fostering that confidence.Said differently, it's not a stretch to say that essentially the entire world knows that China's first and second-quarter GDP numbers are going to be abysmal. Even the fudging Beijing is accused of engaging in won't save those figures. However, some assistance from the PBOC can potentially assuage consumers in the aftermath of the coronavirus, sending them back to Luckin stores in the process.Another factor to consider is China's ongoing shift to a consumption-driven economy. Part of that equation includes the rise of smaller cities, which jibes with Luckin's plans to open thousands of new stores in its home country.&quot;In particular, the accelerated rise of smaller cities will make a key contribution to growth: during the next two decades, the dozens of cities with current populations of less than 1.5 million will contribute 40 percent of the total increase in urban GDP,&quot; according to McKinsey. Bottom Line on LK StockLK stock isn't a risk-free bet. Trading at nearly 13x sales, the stock isn't cheap. It's actually expensive compared to larger, steadier (though not directly comparable) Chinese consumer discretionary names such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).Additionally, it could take some time for the Luckin rebound story to unfold in earnest - perhaps most or all of the second quarter. However, when that story is embraced, Lukcin could offer investors an epic second-half rally.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-03,"After a recent bounce, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is down almost 20% from its 52-week highs. That's notably better than the S&P 500, which is down about 27% from its highs. Given all the circumstances at the momentum, it's hard to determine if Alibaba stock is outperforming or underperforming expectations.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com While Alibaba is easily outperforming the S&P 500, it's lagging what many would consider its peers. For instance, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is down just 6.5% from its highs, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down 11.3%.So while there are some positives with Alibaba's performance, there are some questions as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China Is BoomingBefore getting into Alibaba, something must be said about the bigger picture here. The company operates out of China, which surely every investor knows at this point. With a population of 1.38 billion, it has the most people of any country on earth. China's middle class is booming and growing at a staggering rate.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from Sina.com.cn; Euromonitor For illustrative purposes, check out these two charts. The first shows the sheer size of China's middle class. In 2002, the figure stood at just 80 million. This year, it's projected to be 700 million people. That's up almost 900% in less than two decades, and more than double the entire United States population.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Buy for a Big Rebound The second chart, below, shows that in 2010, just 5% of China's population was considered middle class. This year, that figure is expected to stand at 48%, highlighting just how much wealth has been created in the country.These are the people who are driving growth in China. The middle class is fueling consumption, online ordering and GDP growth in China. As the world's second-largest economy and most populous country, China is set for steady and strong growth down a long runway.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from Sina.com.cn Admittedly, COVID-19 will deal a setback to the Chinese economy. But it will do that across the world -- it's not as if China will be singled out amid this nasty outbreak. In time, though, China and the world will recover. A Deeper Dive on Alibaba StockBecause of the secular growth in China's wealth, consumption plays are an obvious choice. It's why we like JD.com so much too. But not only is Alibaba a much bigger play in commerce than JD, it's also more diverse.In 2019, 66% of Alibaba's revenue came from China commerce revenue. That's down notably from 79% in 2016, even though Alibaba saw a drastic increase in total China commerce revenue, (up more than 100% from 2017 to 2019). The reason that its share of revenue decreased, despite rising sales, is due to other growth segments making up a larger portion of the revenue pie.For instance, cloud-computing revenue was up almost four-fold from 2017 to 2019, now making up Alibaba's largest non-commerce revenue stream. Digital entertainment, it's second-largest revenue generator ex-commerce, climbed 63% from 2017 to 2019.The diversity is great, but the reality is Alibaba generates most of its revenue from commerce, for which it has a dominant position in China. Its Tmall platform represented more than 61% of total gross merchandise value (GMV) market share in Q4 2018. While shopping may take a hit in the short term, online shopping is a long-term secular growth story.COVID-19 is bad for everyone, but at the end of the day, consumers still need to buy things. They aren't leaving their house to do it, which leaves e-commerce -- and Alibaba -- there to answer the call. BABA By the Numbers  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from Alibaba Over the last four quarters, Alibaba has generated $24.7 billion in net income on $70.6 billion in sales. Profit of $9.48 per share values Alibaba stock at roughly 19.6 times earnings. That's a pretty darn good price for a company with multiple secular growth drivers (cloud, commerce, etc.) in motion in a country with a booming middle class.A reasonable valuation for unreasonably solid growth is simply too good to pass up. Alibaba stock is a buy on dips, especially as it continues to outperform the broader market amid the coronavirus outbreak.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-09,"Like most others, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock has been hammered due to the coronavirus. However, BAB stock hasn't rebounded as aggressively as some hoped.Source: Colin Hui / Shutterstock.com Shares of Alibaba stock are currently 15% off January highs. That's still better than the overall market, with the S&P 500 down 21.5% even after its big rally on Monday April 6th.But that performance lags direct competitors like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and similar comparisons like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). These stocks are down just 8.3% and 8.6% from their respective 2020 highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne could make the argument that Alibaba should be doing even better than these stocks right now. Even though the virus outbreak has been a huge negative for the global economy, Alibaba has several catalysts working in its favor. Valuing Alibaba StockWe're seeing a pretty clear coronavirus-induced trend play out: Consumers still want and need things, and are therefore seeking them out via convenient channels. In effect, the virus has forced a series of lockdowns and quarantines which is accelerating, not stymieing, secular growth trends.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential I am talking about things like streaming video, telehealth platforms, social media, remote working solutions and e-commerce.For Alibaba stock, the company is not necessarily involved in all of these themes, but it's involved in more than one. The key driver for the company is obviously commerce. Its Tmall business is a leading e-commerce platform in China, a country that has four times the population of the U.S. and a booming middle class.On top of that, Alibaba is leveraging its overall revenue thanks to other outlets, like digital entertainment and cloud computing. In that sense, it's similar (although not identical) to Amazon. I am not one to fight the market, but it seems like Alibaba should be doing at least as good as its peers, if not better.When the market turns lower, perhaps BABA will continue to underperform. But that's all the more reason to consider a long-term position in Alibaba stock.In its most recent earnings report from mid-February, Alibaba reported a 38% increase in revenue and a 49% increase in earnings. The company also reported a 49% increase in free cash flow. With trailing earnings of $7.50 per share, Alibaba stock trades at 26.6 times earnings.Is that too expensive? For such impressive growth in wide-reaching secular growth themes, many will say no. In times of uncertainty, such as now, many will say yes -- particularly for a foreign entity.Let's look at the charts. Trading BABA Stock  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe charts are improving for BABA stock as shares push higher and attempt to reclaim the $200 zone. I personally do not think the market's move has been all that rational. The employment numbers were bad and the jobless claims reports have been dismal as well.The global economy slammed on the brakes and that will not result in an overnight recovery. But I am not a doom-and-gloom type of investor, and the market is a forward-looking investment vehicle.What I mean by that is that investors will attempt to look past the next six months of bad news and poor earnings and play for the coming rebound. In other words, stocks do not bottom when the economic numbers bottom, it is before.However, I have my reservations about the current rebound. Should it eventually wobble, those looking to buy Alibaba stock will likely get a better price. Likely something in the $175 to $185 range, which is between the 50-week and 150-week moving averages.The latter has been strong support for the past several years and also comes into play near uptrend support (blue line). That to me would be a better buying opportunity, even though I consider Alibaba stock a leader in China and a long-term winner.If shares continue lower through the 150-week moving average, a retest of the $170 low is possible. Below that and the 200-week moving average is possible. On a continued move higher, see if Alibaba stock can push through downtrend resistance (black line). Above puts $220-plus in play.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Over two decades, Richard Liu built a tiny suburban electronics outlet into China’s second largest e-commerce empire. Now, the billionaire entrepreneur is retreating from the spotlight and entrusting fast-rising lieutenant Xu Lei with steering JD.com Inc. through the greatest crisis since its founding.Liu is gradually ceding more control to Xu, who runs JD’s core retail operation and devised its answer to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s widely celebrated Singles’ Day phenomenon. Xu has led JD’s delegation to Davos since 2019 and replaced Liu as head of a key subsidiary this month, burnishing his credentials as presumptive heir.In an exclusive interview, the 45-year-old sketched out how JD’s business withstood the initial shock of Covid-19 and where it plans to go in the future. In five years, the flagship JD.com website and platform should contribute less than half of the company’s revenue as consumers gravitate toward social media town squares like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat. Xu wants to create more platforms tailored toward different consumers and shopping behavior along the lines of JD’s recently launched Groupon-like discounts app. The Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating that by pushing people toward apps that support multiple functions from live video streaming to chatting, making bespoke or specialized services more appealing.“Many people still know JD as online shopping, but we have many businesses and sales that come from all channels, both online and off-line,” Xu said in a video-conference interview. “JD will connect with users more closely. JD will be everywhere.”Xu spent much of the past decade climbing the corporate ladder at a company with more sales than Boeing or Sony, till he assumed formal stewardship of JD’s main operation in 2019. He’s viewed as Liu’s hand-picked choice to lead the company into the future of hyper-retail, where the lines between physical and online commerce blur through technology such as augmented reality. JD made it through China’s outbreak and subsequent lockdown by relying on its own warehouses and delivery personnel -- a costly approach rivals and analysts have questioned.Read more: JD Leaps to 20-Month High After Sales Outlook Quells Virus FearsJD, China’s closest analog to Amazon.com Inc., already serves more than 360 million people -- surpassing the U.S. population. Xu now hopes to extend its presence on social media and invest in hot new areas like grocery delivery.Xu’s steady ascent now places him in the unenviable position of piloting the company’s bread-and-butter business through potentially the greatest global economic shock in at least a generation. That came on the heels of a Chinese slowdown as well as the rise of upstarts such as Pinduoduo Inc., which in 2019 overtook JD in market value.Born and raised in a military compound in Beijing, Xu decided early on to take a different tack by going into sales and marketing. He maintains a subtly rebellious patina to this day, sporting a tattoo on his left arm and ear-stud to go along with a passion for the Rolling Stones. After early careers with PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. and digital ad agency Allyes, he joined JD in 2009 to oversee marketing for its then-nascent online mall. After taking a two-year hiatus to try and get a footwear-selling startup off the ground, he returned in 2013 to oversee an overhaul of JD’s main online website, scrapping its years-old 360buy appellation, and launched the site’s now-familiar dog mascot.How Singles’ Day Became Biggest Shopping Spree Ever: QuickTakeBut by far his biggest success was a riposte to Alibaba’s Nov. 11 Singles’ Day sales bonanza. It was Xu who insisted in 2014 that JD needed to come up with its own signature gala to counter an event that was racking up records annually. But opposition to the idea was fierce because executives knew it couldn’t afford to host a 24-hour deals-fest that could cast its logistics network in disarray -- for context, in 2019, Alibaba’s partners delivered upwards of a billion packages. “When I made the call, most people were against me,” Xu recalled.His solution was to stretch it out over several weeks around the company’s June 18 anniversary and use JD’s longstanding expertise in electronics. “6.18” was born and others including Alibaba played catch-up. In 2019, sales during the campaign hit a record $29 billion.“Apart from Liu, those who did real jobs at JD are now emerging from the backstage, which is a good thing to investor confidence,” said David Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Bernstein. On Liu, he said: “I don’t think he has a clear succession plan, but it’s clear that he now has a second in command.”To be sure, no one’s predicting Liu will relinquish all control imminently, and many things could change during a volatile post-Covid 19 era. The billionaire maintains an iron grip on the company thanks to a dual-share structure in which he owns roughly 15% of equity but 79% of the vote. Tencent and Walmart Inc. have stakes in the firm as well.But that’s precisely what investors worried about after Liu was arrested in the U.S. on suspicion of rape in 2018. Authorities in Minneapolis decided not to press charges after reviewing evidence, but the investigation highlighted key-man risk at the e-commerce giant, forced Liu to back away from the public spotlight and hurt JD’s stock in 2018.Read more: Police Release Files on China Billionaire’s Alleged Rape CaseLiu’s travails coincided with a low point in JD’s history. That year, customers shrank in the third quarter -- the first time that’s happened since listing. Pinduoduo came out of seemingly nowhere to wrest shoppers away, particularly in poorer markets. After a year of relentless share-market losses, a frustrated Liu took to social media in early 2019 to declare that people who slacked off weren’t his “brothers.”“2018 was indeed a low point in JD’s past decade, whether we are talking about business performance or employee morale,” Xu said. “We had no major breakthroughs.”Xu again stepped up. JD cut headcount across teams, eliminated 10% of its higher-level managers, and scrapped base salary for its couriers. He combined or canceled a lot of operations that were bleeding money or “didn’t have logic,” focusing instead on where he saw growth coming from. Examples included the Jingxi app targeting buyers from lower-tier cities and a supply chain initiative that let partners like Walmart and Coca-Cola deliver to JD users directly.His profile climbed further when he headlined 2019’s 6.18 for once without his boss. In an internal meeting just after Xu’s 2019 promotion, the founder told assembled senior executives: “If you don’t obey Xu Lei, that means you don’t obey me.”“I didn’t ask for this, nor did I like it,” Xu said, confirming Liu’s previously reported remarks. “He was probably anxious, hoping his endorsement will hasten the company’s transformation.”To all appearances, JD appears back on track. It just posted an annual net profit for the first time since going public in 2014, and its sales and buyers grew faster than expected. Its direct-to-consumer sales and in-house logistics model now wins plaudits from analysts for allowing better control of shipping times and quality during China’s Covid-19 outbreak. JD’s logistics arm said in March it’s creating more than 20,000 front-line positions in roles from drivers to couriers.The company forecast at least 10% revenue growth for the first quarter. For February, sales of fresh food on JD increased 260% from a year ago, while sales of consumer electronics like handsets and laptops also began to pick up in March. That’s one reason JD’s shares have outpaced China’s largest tech companies this year.“The epidemic has taught a serious lesson about cash flow management for all companies and all industries,” Xu said. “Frankly speaking, in the past one or two decades in China, everyone got used to fast business growth.”Xu argues that JD is now well-positioned to catch a recovery in consumer spending by May, when China embarks on a five-day Labor Day holiday. Merchants and brands are already stocking up on goods for the mid-year promotions, he added. For the third quarter, however, the Covid-19 pandemic will likely cause a shortage of imported items like cosmetics and gadgets with foreign chips, he said.Longer term, Xu wants to bring about new initiatives to help speed JD’s transformation into an omni-channel retailer with supply chains at the core. But it remains far behind on some fronts. Fresh produce has proven a hot spot during the pandemic but JD is late to the game: its 7Fresh supermarket chain has around 20 stores across China, versus Alibaba’s hundred-plus Freshippo outlets.Some investors including APS Asset Management argue that JD’s thin margins may further compress as rivalry intensifies. “At such margins, we think there is no chance for JD to survive unless an unlikely scenario happens, which is Alibaba easing considerably on its price war,” the Singapore-based fund wrote in March.But Xu takes all that in stride. Briefly lapsing into militaristic speak -- perhaps a holdover of his upbringing -- the executive said the key was getting his troops prepared.“When facing a war, you need to unify the minds,” he said. “The whole organization is now adjusted and ready for the war.”(Updates with comment on third-quarter snags in the 22nd paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",JD’s Retail Chief Takes Lead as Billionaire Founder Recedes

2020-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Just before the coronavirus-induced U.S. lockdowns began in March, some of the world’s investing elite gathered at an invite-only event in Silicon Valley.Representatives for super-rich families and endowments crowded into Vina Enoteca, an Italian restaurant right by the Stanford University campus. They were there to hear from Lei Zhang, the charismatic founder of Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. and from some of his top investments, including Zoom Video Communications Inc.’s Eric Yuan.In a packed room -- before social distancing became the norm -- Zhang and Yuan discussed how technology can change work-life balance. Neither could have predicted how much Covid-19 would change Zoom, or the world. One attendee said the evening was typical of his interactions with Hillhouse, with the rustic-chic eatery decked out in temporary drapes to maximize privacy: A mix of showmanship and exclusivity.Less than two decades after Zhang started Hillhouse with $20 million from Yale University’s endowment, the 48-year-old has become an object of fascination to those in finance yet remains an enigma. The firm has mushroomed from a boutique hedge fund into a $60 billion behemoth that’s made prescient bets on stocks, private equity and venture capital.For Yale, it’s among their most profitable investments. David Swensen, chief investment officer for the university’s endowment, said Hillhouse has generated $2.4 billion of gains for the school.Zhang is worth at least $5 billion, making him one of the world’s richest financiers, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and the firm is in no mood to retreat amid the pandemic. Hillhouse is seeking to raise as much as $13 billion from investors, according to people familiar with the matter, so it’s ready as the coronavirus-battered economy throws up opportunities. Zhang has also started accepting an increasing number of requests to invest in his hedge fund, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential business.“I can see why big institutions would be lining up,” said Christopher Schelling, former director of private equity at the Texas Municipal Retirement System who recently joined Windmuehle Funds. “They’re super connected -- there’s literally nothing that happens in China that they don’t see. And their returns are incredible.”Zhang, through a representative, declined to comment on his net worth and the firm’s fund raising plans.Hillhouse doesn’t disclose performance figures but information from the University of Texas’s endowment shows that Gaoling had annualized gains of about 20% for the decade through June, net of fees, roughly double the MSCI World Index.The hedge fund is up this year after having one of its strongest years in 2019, a person familiar with its performance said.Swensen told Yale University alumni during a 2018 speech that Zhang was the preeminent fund manager in China.“We took what some people would think is a big risk,” Swensen said at the event. “I didn’t feel like it was a big risk because I knew this man.”Zhang, a native of central China’s Henan province, arrived at Yale’s business school after studying finance at Beijing’s Renmin University. At Yale, he got to know Swensen after interning in the investment office, volunteering to translate his 2000 book, ‘Pioneering Portfolio Management,’ into Chinese.Eager to return to Asia, Zhang got a job in 2004 representing the New York Stock Exchange in China, putting him in front of emerging tech companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. that later became his best early investments. The timing was perfect -- China’s economy was taking off and some western institutions were being permitted to invest in the country’s publicly traded companies. When Zhang decided to launch an investment firm, Yale bankrolled him.Zhang named the company after a street in New Haven, Connecticut, near Yale’s investment office. His hedge fund Gaoling roughly translates to “high view from the mountain top.” He employed a buy-and-hold strategy and built a network among China’s emerging tech entrepreneurs as well as with elite backers such as U.S. endowments.“We don’t think about it as investing in Asia,” said Andy Golden, chief investment officer at Princeton University’s endowment, another early Hillhouse backer. “We think about it as investing in Lei doing what he does -- Lei and his team are brilliant.”One of Hillhouse’s first big bets was Tencent -- Zhang believed its QQ instant messaging service was a more significant player in China than many realized. Tencent today is among the world’s most valuable companies, an internet and social media giant best known for its ubiquitous WeChat app.The bet on Tencent provided more than just financial returns. The two firms are so close they’ve co-invested in at least 20 companies. Tencent’s influence can at times outweigh even private equity titans, due to the internet traffic and mobile users it brings to the table.“It’s a unique thing in China,” said Xia Mingchen, co-head of Asia investments at Hamilton Lane Inc., which manages more than $66 billion and is a backer of Hillhouse. “Some private equity funds, if they have a very strong relationship with a specific giant, they tend to co-invest, because they know each other very well, they trust each other and can have strategic partnerships.”Online retailer JD.com Inc., which was private at the time, was another early big bet. Those investments came to define Hillhouse -- backing emerging consumer technology plays both in public and private markets. The firm’s assets today are about evenly split between private equity and public markets.Hillhouse has become China’s flagship money manager for many Western institutions but it’s also racked up wins outside of the world’s second-largest economy.Zhang met with Zoom’s Yuan in Menlo Park, California, before an early funding round in February 2015. Yuan explained the business and his engineering work at another video conferencing site WebEx, according to a person familiar with the talks. Zhang soon made the investment, the person said, and added to its bet after the San Jose-headquartered firm went public last year. The stock has soared as global stay-home orders have fueled the need for its services.Other bets that have paid off include snack maker Bestore Co., a Wuhan-based company that sells cashews to preserved plums and beef jerky. It listed in February with its shares debuting 44% above their issue price.Hillhouse helped Bestore use big data to determine whether certain neighborhoods had sufficient demand and whether stores were running at full capacity. Another investment -- healthcare platform WeDoctor -- is expected to be one of Hong Kong’s biggest share sales this year as it mulls raising as much as $1 billion.But not everything has been one way and a pair of high profile investors have pulled their money.Brown University and Soros Fund Management were early backers who later liquidated: the former after a change in chief investment officer in 2013 and the latter around the same time as it reassessed its Asia strategy, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials for both organizations declined to comment.For investments that have taken a hit during the virus outbreak, Hillhouse has tried to assist companies shift their strategy. For example, when Meicai, a $7 billion startup that supplies groceries to restaurants in China, saw business plummet, Hillhouse helped it switch to delivering groceries to individuals stranded at home.Hillhouse is also navigating Chinese markets scarred by accounting irregularities. One of its investments, Beijing-based TAL Education Group, said earlier this month that an employee wrongly inflated sales, sending the stock down 12% since. Still, the stock has surged more than 80% since the end of 2018.The spreading coronavirus has hurt some of its investments too. Uber Technologies Inc. has dropped about 33% since its May 2019 IPO, after the pandemic tanked rider demand and after earlier allegations of sexist behavior forced co-founder Travis Kalanick out of the company.And although China is slowly getting back to work, Covid-19 has blighted the outlook. The nation’s economy contracted for the first time in more than 40 years in the first quarter and private equity deals are in limbo with transactions poised to drop this year.“There’s a reason Lei Zhang is regarded as among the sector’s best executives,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer of Adamas Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “But not everything of late has gone according to plan. After the current pandemic passes, China’s economy is unlikely to recover quickly. Moreover, a further U.S.-China split is at least highly plausible.”Still, Hillhouse, with its gold-star backers, retains “tremendous access to capital,” and Zhang should be able to pivot off that, Silvers said. The last time Hillhouse raised money in 2018, it was inundated, raising $10.6 billion.Of the $13 billion Hillhouse is seeking this time, almost $10 billion will be allocated to buyouts, with the rest split between growth equity and venture, one of the people familiar with the matter said.Zhang’s celebrity has flourished in Asia even as he’s kept a lower profile outside of China. Long an unknown entity, he’s become a frequent speaker at conferences and helped back a movie celebrating philosophy called ‘Paths of the Soul,’ released in 2015.A Chinese idiom Zhang likes to reference is that of the peach tree and the plum tree. Both can’t speak but their fruit and blossoms are so beautiful that followers will always trample a path beneath them.Yu Kai, whose artificial intelligence startup Horizon Robotics Inc. got multiple rounds of funding from Hillhouse, said Zhang is always reminding people not to “do things that focus on the short term.”“He likes to quote a saying from a Ming Dynasty emperor,” Yu said; Secure your food supplies; build your fortress. Do not rush to be king.(Updates with Meicai investment in 27th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Hillhouse Reloads After Building $60 Billion Asia Juggernaut

2020-04-29,"This a precarious time to be investing in China. But many Chinese stocks, particularly in the technology and service sectors, look attractive if you're willing to deal with some volatility.Even before the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan province, relations between China and the West were strained. The U.S. and China have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war for most of the Trump presidency, and there is widespread fear in Western capitals that 5G telecom equipment manufactured by Huawei is capable of state espionage.Trade tensions alone were reason enough to make many investors wary of Chinese stocks. Then the COVID-19 pandemic happened, exposing the risks of a globalized supply chain.Consider Apple (AAPL). The world's leading consumer electronics maker has been reporting supply disruptions since February stemming from Chinese factory closures, and JPMorgan recently estimated that the launch of the new iPhone, which usually comes out in September or October, might be delayed by a few months.Going forward, a lot of companies might be reconsidering the merits of cheap Chinese manufacturing and opt to stay closer to home. But the truth is that China has long evolved past the smokestack stage of development. The country is a major technology and digital entertainment hub, even if the vast majority of its products and services are destined for domestic use.You have to be careful when investing in Chinese stocks, as shareholder protections aren't quite up to Western standards. Already this year, major accounting scandals have upended iQIYI (IQ) and Luckin Coffee (LK). But that's a risk you take when you invest in emerging markets, and that's why it's important to diversify and avoid heavy concentration in any single stock.Here are 10 of the best Chinese stocks on the market right now.

2020-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese smartphone sales plummeted by an unprecedented 22% during the first quarter after the Covid-19 outbreak forced brands from Apple Inc. to Xiaomi Corp. to shut stores and created nationwide supply bottlenecks, according to Counterpoint Research.Huawei Technologies Co. was the only major name to grow sales in the first three months, by 6% to 28.7 million phones -- more than No. 2 and No. 3 brands Vivo and Oppo, combined. Xiaomi’s unit sales plunged 35%, worst among the top five, Counterpoint said. Apple’s iPhone sales dipped about 1%, the consultancy estimated after tracking sell-through volume, a figure closer to units actually bought by consumers rather than shipped or produced.The pandemic has gutted the global smartphone market, stoking uncertainty across a tech industry that supplies components for mobile devices from memory chips to displays and processors. On Wednesday, Samsung Electronics Co. warned of a profit decline this quarter, stemming in large part from a dismal outlook for the mobile device arena.The domestic outlook remains uncertain. Smartphone vendors with extensive retail networks such as Apple and Xiaomi began reopening stores in February and March, but consumer spending is volatile after China’s historic economic contraction. Counterpoint noted that roughly half of smartphones was sold online through online marketplaces such as JD.com and Alibaba in the first quarter. In a sign of potentially stronger longer-term demand, sales of faster fifth-generation or 5G phones more than doubled during the period.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Chinese Smartphone Sales Fall a Record 22% Though Huawei Shone
2020-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. has filed confidentially for a second listing in Hong Kong, according to people with knowledge of the matter, joining rival Alibaba in tapping the city’s stock market for funds.The offering could raise at least $2 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The Beijing-based company, which currently trades on Nasdaq, has a market value of $64 billion.The deal comes after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. raised $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. That much larger deal was hailed as a homecoming for Chinese companies and a win for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which lost these deals to its U.S. counterparts a decade ago because it didn’t allow dual-class share voting at the time. The bourse, which relaxed the rule in 2018, was up as much as 2.4% Wednesday.JD’s listing could come as early as the second half of the year, according to one of the people.

Away from the outbreak, JD continues to win more consumers from smaller Chinese cities and towns, while demand for the electronics it depends on should rebound after the outbreak subsides.The company’s shares slid 4.4% Tuesday, but have risen more than 23% this year while the S&P/BNY Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is down 5.2% during the same period.

2020-05-12,"Following in the footsteps of its bigger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (NYSE: BABA), JD.Com Inc (NASDAQ: JD) is planning to test the IPO waters in Hong Kong very soon, if reports are to be believed.Alibaba undertook a secondary listing of its shares in the  Hong Kong market  late last year, raising $12.9 billion in the process.JD.com Homebound? JD.com is planning to raise as much as $3.4 billion by listing its shares on the Hong Kong Exchange,  local media reports  said. The e-commerce company is expected to set the ball rolling on the IPO May 25, with the listing likely to occur as early as June.A slew of other U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also reportedly exploring this option of dual listing. Chinese search engine Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU), online gaming and entertainment company NetEase Inc (NASDAQ: NTES) and online travel company Trip.com Group Ltd (NASDAQ: TCOM) are also reportedly prepping for Hong Kong listings. Why The Newfound Interest In Chinese Exchanges? Most Chinese companies appear to be stung by the stereotyping effect following revelations of fraud by fellow firms. The case in point is coffee retailer Luckin, which  admitted  in early April that its COO fudged transactions over the last year to boost sales.Chinese video streaming company IQIYI Inc (NASDAQ: IQ) was also accused of inflating financial numbers. Online educational services company GSX Techedu Inc (NYSE: GSX) was at the receiving end after Citron Research accused  it of falsifying enrollment numbers.The mushrooming of fraud cases among U.S.-listed Chinese companies has caught the attention of U.S. lawmakers, some of whom are calling for regulations that would make it mandatory for Chinese companies to comply with U.S. federal auditing rules and disclosure requirements.The pressure to abide by more stringent disclosure requirements could be one reason why some companies are looking elsewhere. Another reason is the worsening of U.S.-China ties. After the trade deal impasse affected relations for a while, the COVID-19 pandemic has only served to deteriorate it further.President Donald Trump has accused China of spreading the virus from a lab, putting him at odds with U.S. intelligence agencies, while there is also a feeling among some quarters in the political echelon that gross mismanagement of the virus by China led to the epidemic graduating to the scale of a pandemic.What The Hong Kong Listings Mean For The US If any of these companies choose to delist from the U.S. exchanges, the U.S. will lose its clout as a conduit for international capital, according to the investment firm Jefferies, which was quoted by Reuters. The flurry of Chinese listings in the U.S. may also become a thing of past. About 23 China-based companies listed in the U.S. in 2019, raising about $3.4 billion in total, according to Renaissance Capital.This, according to the firm, accounted for 14% of U.S. IPOs and 7% of total proceeds.JD Price Action At last check, JD.com shares were rising 2.24% to $47.76.Related Links:Alibaba Plans Massive Cloud Investment, Wedbush Sees 'Key Turning Point'Best International ETFs Right Now See more from Benzinga  * Apple's iPhone 9 Launch Could Be Imminent(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hong Kong’s stock-exchange operator is at a crossroads. Just like its home city, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. needs to find a path through a turbulent era that reconciles its international and Chinese identities.HKEX is hunting for a new chief executive officer after Charles Li said he will step down by October next year at the latest, when his contract expires. Nicknamed “Mr. China” for his success in building trading links with mainland exchanges, Li doubled revenue during his decade leading the company. An attempt to vault HKEX into the top ranks of global exchange operators failed last year when the London Stock Exchange Group Plc rejected a $37 billion takeover approach, citing concerns over its relationship with Hong Kong’s government, which is appointed by Beijing.Li’s successor will have to carry forward his work of deepening ties with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, while keeping foreign investors happy by improving corporate governance. It’s a delicate task. The mainland Chinese markets are competitors as well as partners. Hong Kong is trying to position itself as the venue of choice for Chinese technology companies seeking to go public, especially as the U.S. market becomes less hospitable. Shanghai and Shenzhen are undertaking their own initiatives to persuade companies to list at home.Shanghai has been particularly aggressive, becoming the world’s top destination for initial public offerings in 2020 (albeit without a single overseas listing), a title that Hong Kong has held for years. While its Star market aimed at tech companies has yet to attract any big names, competition is heating up. Shenzhen, the southern city that borders Hong Kong, is preparing to emulate Shanghai by moving to a registration-based IPO system and scrapping limits on price movements on its Nasdaq-like ChiNext board.That will put a premium on finding a CEO who can match Li’s mainland connections and diplomatic prowess. With international expansion seemingly blocked off after the LSE rebuff and the coronavirus outbreak, HKEX’s growth will continue to rely heavily on cooperation with Chinese exchanges and regulators. Expanding the stock-trading pipes that Li established with Shanghai and Shenzhen is one route. HKEX scored a coup when New York-traded Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China’s biggest company by market value, raised $13 billion in a Hong Kong secondary offering last November. Some of the sheen came off the celebrations when it emerged that Alibaba wouldn’t be included in the so-called Stock Connect programs, blocking mainland-based investors from trading the shares. Getting secondary listings on the Connect should be a priority — especially given Hong Kong is looking to woo other U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as JD.com Inc.There are further opportunities for expanding the cross-border trading links, including letting mainland investors buy overseas bonds. Currently, the three-year-old Bond Connect is a one-way system, allowing Hong Kong investors to buy mainland securities but not vice-versa. The next HKEX chief may also push for Hong Kong ETFs and IPO subscriptions to be admitted to the connect programs.At the same time, Hong Kong needs to keep its international flavor if it’s to appeal to Chinese punters who want access to global investments. HKEX slowed efforts to attract foreign listings in recent years, as volumes dimmed, having drawn some notable names including Italian luxury house Prada SpA. It should restart these. Hong Kong’s role as an international market depends critically on sustaining confidence among global investors that it is relatively clean and well governed. Under Li, the Hong Kong exchange bowed to the commercial imperative by opening the door to dual-class share structures and presided over a market where bad behavior among small-caps was endemic. His replacement will need to change Hong Kong’s reputation as a playground for short sellers such as Carson Block’s Muddy Waters and Gillem Tulloch’s GMT Research Ltd.Managing these push-pull conflicts — moving closer to China while becoming more international, building up business while improving governance — will take some dexterity. Li has said he may leave before the end of his term if a successor is found. An early exit is far from assured.&#92;--With assistance from Zhen Hao Toh. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-05-17,"(Bloomberg) -- The 50-year old Hang Seng Index is poised to embrace change, and it couldn’t come soon enough for investors forced to put up with years of dismal underperformance.On Monday at around 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, the compiler of the gauge is expected to announce whether companies with secondary listings and unequal voting rights will be included for the first time, namely Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Doing so would open the door to transforming the Hang Seng from a gauge overstuffed with banks and insurers to one that better reflects the technological dynamism of China’s economy.Alibaba -- one of China’s most valuable companies -- launched a secondary listing in Hong Kong in November. Another potential candidate for inclusion is Meituan Dianping, China’s largest food-delivery website, while JD.com Inc. is considering a secondary listing of its own in the city. With almost $30 billion of pension-fund assets and exchange-traded funds tracking the gauge as of December, such a change could spur a flood of local share sales by U.S.-listed firms.“The decision is going to completely change the nature of index, which has been characterized as one with low valuation and low growth rate for a long time,” said Yang Lingxiu, strategist at Citic Securities Co.About half of the total weighting of the Hang Seng Index is in financial firms, compared with about 15% on average for benchmarks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and mainland China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has gained 1.7% a year on average in the past decade, versus 5.2% for the MSCI All-Country World Index. In January, the Hang Seng approached its lowest level relative to the MSCI measure since 2004.The process of adding the likes of Alibaba may take some time, however. “In order to reduce the one-off impact on the market, the index may propose adding the weight of Alibaba gradually,” said Chi Man Wong, analyst at China Galaxy International Financial Holdings. Alibaba is the biggest company listed in Hong Kong by market cap and is the second most actively traded stock in the past 30 days, just after the Hang Seng Index’s largest component Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The index would need to delete two companies to add Alibaba and Meituan, as current rules require the number of firms on the gauge to be fixed at 50. Component maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. and snack firm Want Want China Holdings Ltd. are among likely candidates for deletion due to their smaller market capitalization, according to traders.The addition would raise the Hang Seng Index’s forward price-to-earnings ratio to about 12 from the current 11, making it more expensive than Shanghai Composite Index, data show.Ultimately, the weight of technology and consumer discretionary sectors’ could surge from the current single digits to more than 30%, if all U.S.-listed Chinese companies that match the Hang Seng’s requirements list in the city and are included in the index, according to Citic Securities Co.To be sure, giving greater weight to companies with unequal voting rights could raise investor concerns.“The key issue is that weighted voting rights create an opportunity for someone to have greater influence than their economic ownership would suggest,” said Gabriel Wilson-Otto, head of stewardship Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “The underlying concern is that this heightens the potential for agency risk, and reduces avenues of recourse if the company does something that’s not in the best interests of the minority shareholders.”Investors in some U.S-listed Chinese firms have recently been burned by accounting scandals, raising questions about the standard of corporate governance at some companies.Two Accounting Scandals in a Week Burn China Inc. Investors (1)The Hang Seng Index would nevertheless benefit from luring more U.S.-listed companies, said Cliff Zhao, head of strategy with CCB International Securities Ltd.“More funds will be attracted to follow the index, which is a good thing for Hong Kong’s stock market.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Hang Seng Index Set for Major Revamp That Paves Way for Alibaba
2020-05-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index will include dual class shares and secondary listings, allowing Chinese giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. into the city’s benchmark to provide a potential boost for passive investors who have for years struggled with lackluster returns.Hang Seng Indexes Co., announced the long-awaited change on Monday in Hong Kong, a step that will help move the benchmark away from a heavy dominance of financial shares. Dual class and secondary listings will each be subject to a 5% weighting cap, surprising some investors who had been hoping for a 10% weighting for Alibaba, for example.The move came after “overwhelming market support,” HSI said. Any changes will come into effect during the August 2020 index review and encompass only companies coming from Greater China.The shift will affect about $30 billion in pension fund assets and exchange-traded funds that track the index, and could spur a flood of local share sales by U.S.-listed firms. Dual class shares were long blocked from listing in Hong Kong due to concerns over the unequal voting rights until Xiaomi Corp. became the first in 2018. Alibaba joined the bourse last year after a $13 billion secondary listing.Meituan Dianping, China’s largest food-delivery website, is also a potential candidate for inclusion, while JD.com Inc. is considering a secondary listing of its own in the city.“It’s a bit surprising to me that Hang Seng caps the market weight at 5%,” said Kenny Wen, wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. “But it’s understandable, since the indexer might want to take it step by step to avoid a sudden change on the Hang Seng Index, since each tech firm is relatively very big by market cap.”Wen expects the cap to lifted eventually to 10%, “but it won’t happen in the next 3 to 6 months.”Daniel Wong, a director at HSI, said at a press conference that the cap “has room to rise.”About half of the total weighting of the Hang Seng Index is in financial firms, compared with about 15% on average for benchmarks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and mainland China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has gained 1.7% a year on average in the past decade, versus 5.2% for the MSCI All-Country World Index. In January, the Hang Seng approached its lowest level relative to the MSCI measure since 2004.HSI said that any shares that carry weighted voting rights, typically those held by the founders of the company, will be considered as non-freefloat, and not eligible for the index. While for secondary listings, any shares held as overseas depositary receipts will be ineligible, further limiting the impact of Alibaba on the index.“Aibaba has about 20% of total outstanding shares in Hong Kong and the remaining are in the U.S.,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd., by phone from Hong Kong. “Even if WVR shares and U.S. portions are not counted as free float in Hang Seng’s calculation, it still easily has a 5% weight if included into the index.”Separately, the HSI consultation conclusion also said no additional limits will be placed on financial stocks.Managers of passive index pension funds will now have to follow the adjustment to include weighted voting rights shares, said Michael Chan, managing director of Hong Kong-based Gain Miles MPF Consultant Ltd. Despite institutional concerns over the corporate governance issues of dual class share companies, which gives some shareholders more weight than others, Chan said it won’t create much stir locally since retail investors are largely indifferent to how their pension money is placed.(Adds comment from HSI in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Hang Seng Revamps Benchmark Index to Open Door for Alibaba

2020-05-20,"Exchange-traded funds that allow investors to bet on Chinese companies were knocked lower midday Wednesday after the U.S. Senate approved sweeping new legislation that could ultimately bar many Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. exchanges. The Invesco China Technology ETF , which offers exposure to a basket of popular Chinese technology firms that are listed in the U.S., including the American Depositary Receipts of Baidu Inc., , was down 0.7%; those for KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF , which offers exposure to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and JD.com , was trading 1.4% lower, at last check, according to MarketWatch's website. The Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF  was down 1% on Wednesday, with that ETF also tracking Alibaba and JD.com.

U.S. stocks came off their highs of the session Wednesday afternoon following the passage of the bill, which comes amid increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, with representatives from the world's biggest economies fighting over Beijing's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China.

2020-05-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nasdaq is tightening rules on initial public offerings in an effort that looks to be targeted primarily at Chinese companies. To appreciate just how tepid its proposals are, consider this: They wouldn’t have screened out Luckin Coffee Inc., the most notorious accounting scandal involving a U.S.-listed Chinese issuer in years. On this evidence, IPO hopefuls have little to worry about — as long as they’re not too small.Companies will need to raise at least $25 million, or sell stock equal to a minimum 25% of their post-listing market capitalization, according to a Bloomberg News report that cited Nasdaq filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Luckin sold $645 million of shares in its IPO last May. There’s little comfort in this for the would-be Starbucks Corp. challenger: Nasdaq is seeking to delist Luckin after the company acknowledged fabricating sales transactions and fired its chief executive. Its shares, which will resume trading Wednesday, plummeted more than 75% in a single day last month. For other companies, though, the message is that the lure of IPO business still trumps U.S. government pressure to deter the flow of money into Chinese assets.The revised standards aren’t particularly punitive. Only three of 10 Nasdaq IPOs by Chinese issuers in 2020 raised less than $25 million. Last year, 10 of 29 flotations failed to meet the threshold, which is about the price of an upmarket New York townhouse. The requirement to sell at least a quarter of the business may be more painful. Half the companies selling shares this year floated less than 25%.Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised at the low bar. Chinese companies are big business after all, with a combined current market value of $380 billion on Nasdaq. The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has almost $760 billion of Chinese listings — most of that accounted for by internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.There’s no sign that a rising U.S. climate of hostility to China is deterring IPO candidates. Beijing-based Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd. raised $510 million this month after increasing the size of its float. Dada Nexus Ltd., an operator of crowd-sourced delivery platforms backed by Alibaba rival JD.com Inc., is currently sounding out investors for a $500 million offering. Such sales must come as welcome relief after a deals drought caused by the coronavirus lockdown.A bigger issue in rooting out fraud and malpractice is U.S. regulators’ access to company financial records and audit papers, something that China prevents. Current rules already allow Nasdaq to deny listings of companies from countries with such restrictions. Nasdaq is proposing more stringent criteria, including requiring auditors to show that they have sufficient expertise with international accounting standards in the offices doing the audit. This looks like a Band-Aid.The impression persists of an exchange that was under pressure to do something about Chinese companies — and came up with little more than the bare minimum. Just in case there was any doubt about the U.S. government’s stance, President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow weighed in Tuesday to say that nobody can invest confidently in Chinese companies and the U.S. needs to protect investors from the country’s lack of transparency and accountability.Problems tend to be concentrated among the smallest and least liquid companies, so it makes sense to target them. Shares of Nasdaq-listed Chinese companies that raised less than $25 million since the start of 2017 are down an average of 60% from their IPO price — compared with a 34% average increase for all Chinese issuers selling shares during the period.(1)No one wants bit players in a world where investors have become increasingly skeptical of unprofitable technology companies.

2020-05-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Netease Inc. aims to list shares in Hong Kong on June 11 and JD.com Inc. a week after, a person familiar with the matter said, completing two mega stock sales for the city at a time of escalating market volatility.U.S.-listed Netease and No. 2 Chinese online retailer JD hope to gain approval for local debuts during listing-committee hearings on Thursday, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. JD’s stock sale could raise $2 billion or more to help the e-commerce giant shore up its position in an increasingly competitive home market. The retailer’s June 18 target coincides with its largest annual online sales event.The twin debuts follow Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $13 billion Hong Kong stock sale last year, hailed as a homecoming for Chinese companies and a win for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which lost many of the largest tech corporations to U.S. bourses because it didn’t allow dual-class share voting at the time -- a requirement that’s since been relaxed. Netease and JD are also listing at a time of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, now spilling over into Chinese companies’ access to U.S. capital markets after the downfall of Luckin Coffee Inc. -- one of the country’s brightest startups.Representatives for JD, Netease and Hong Kong’s exchange declined to comment.Read more: JD Is Said to File for $2 Billion Hong Kong Second Listing Shares in U.S.-listed Chinese companies have see-sawed since senators overwhelmingly approved legislation Wednesday that could bar the country’s firms from American exchanges.

2020-05-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. expects revenue growth to slow this year, reflecting post-Covid 19 economic uncertainty at home as well as the potential for U.S.-Chinese tensions to disrupt its business.The e-commerce giant forecast sales growth this year of at least 27.5% to more than 650 billion yuan ($91 billion), down from 35% previously and slightly below analysts’ estimates. While it posted a better-than-expected 22% rise in March quarter revenue of 114.3 billion yuan, that marked its slowest pace of expansion on record. Alibaba’s shares slid more than 5% in New York.Online shopping began to bounce back from March, executives said Friday. But the tepid outlook demonstrates the world’s second largest economy has yet to fully shake off Covid-19, with consumers still hesitant about spending on big-ticket items. Asia’s largest corporation is tackling also the rise of rivals such as ByteDance Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc. And the Tmall operator is going head-to-head with Tencent Holdings Ltd. for internet leadership in everything from online media to payments and cloud computing.Alibaba has lost more than $40 billion of market value since the coronavirus first erupted in January, and now has to grapple with not just an uncertain global economic environment but also any potential fallout from U.S.-Chinese financial tensions. On Friday, executives sought to assuage concerns about a U.S. bill that mandates much closer accounting scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese companies and may bar them from American bourses.Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said Alibaba’s financial statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting measures and were beyond reproach. “The integrity of Alibaba’s financial statements speak for itself, we have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the highest standard,” she told analysts on a conference call. “We will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges.”The bigger short-term challenge is in reviving growth: Alibaba’s bread-and-butter customer management or marketing business grew just 3% in the March quarter. Much of that stems from weaker consumer sentiment during the coronavirus-stricken quarter, when total Chinese e-commerce rose just 5.9% or at less than a third of 2019’s pace, according to government data.Rival PDD posted a revenue rise of 44% on Friday, down sharply from 91% in the previous quarter, although that still beat expectations. Its sales and marketing expenses jumped 49%.Alibaba’s net income was 3.2 billion yuan, down 88% from a year ago when it booked an 18.7 billion yuan one-time gain on investments. In February, Alibaba declared a waiver of some service fees for merchants struggling financially during the outbreak on its main direct-to-consumer Tmall platform. In April, the company rolled out a new 10-billion-yuan subsidy program for Tmall users to buy electronics, encroaching on JD.com Inc.’s traditional turf. These initiatives may further compress margins for the June quarter.“The challenging part is for them to achieve the same amount of growth this year,” said Steven Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst with Pacific Epoch. “Just because they are too big, for the same amount of growth, they need to spend much more effort.”But executives were confident in a gradual e-commerce recovery over the year. Beyond its main business, younger divisions such as its cloud computing arm should buoy its bottom line. That division’s revenue jumped 58% in the quarter.“Despite a challenging quarter due to reduced economic activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, we achieved our annual revenue guidance,” Wu said in a statement. “Although the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen a steady recovery since March.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe company’s businesses most impacted by merchant and logistic disruptions are also its most lucrative, such as retail marketplaces Taobao and Tmall, while faster-growing segments like cloud computing and digital entertainment don’t contribute to profit. Subsidies for users and merchants will add to costs. Alibaba may provide an improved growth outlook for the June quarter given the retreat of the pandemic in China, but the recovery could be gradual as consumption sentiment remains weak.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Sales Growth Plumbs New Lows While Uncertainty Escalates
2020-05-22,"It's all about the news for many on Wall Street. But headlines are also prone to fading away or even revision, as we've seen this week. It literally can be ""yesterday's news"" in a jiffy. And opportunistic investors can occasionally turn to the price chart and use others' distress from the latest news report to find excellent stocks to buy cheap. Let me explain.In Friday's first half of trade, the headlines are insisting it's all about escalating tensions between the world's two largest super powers. But that's not exactly new news, is it? We've seen this type of political theater before. And on each of those countless headline warnings, as others were fearfully selling, investors purchasing the panic were rewarded.  * 7 Inexpensive, High-Dividend ETFs to Buy Still, the fact is, extracting profits from headlines or timing entries and exits based on the latest news is tricky business. This week's bullish stimulus promises from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell following last week's scary recession warning, or Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) countering novel coronavirus vaccine reports, are other news headlines that have drained more wallets than they've fattened.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO)  * JD.com (NASDAQ:JD)  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)To be clear, sometimes headlines suggesting a specific course of action are the real deal. But more often than not, Wall Street is buying those sold goods as others are dumping. As such, let's explore three stocks to buy with bearish stories of their own this week … and much more durable price charts to buy into. News Stocks to Buy: Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)  Source: Charts by TradingViewBig-time video game publisher Take-Two Interactive is the first of our stocks to buy. Shares fell nearly 6% Thursday as investors digested a stronger-than-forecast earnings release. The company behind wildly popular series like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and NBA2K also detailed a five-year plan which will deliver Take-Two's ""strongest pipeline in company history."" That's good news, right?The report does appear to have been a solid Q4 print. However, management did warn 2021 will be light on new releases and that the company will invest slightly more into R&D. And an in-tow modest revision to revenues just beneath analyst views appears to have been sufficient incentive for investors to take profits.But the game for bullish investors is just getting started on Take-Two's price chart.Technically, yesterday's profit-taking is today's opportunity. Shares have pulled back to test their prior pattern and all-time-high after staging a sizable and very constructive breakout from a two-year long bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. This news stock to buy is in position for purchase and I'm personally still confident our  price target of $180-$200 for Take-Two stock will be captured. JD.com (JD)  Source: Charts by TradingViewOne of China's two largest Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) clones, JD.com, is our next stock to buy. Along with fellow imitator Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), shares of JD were off Thursday and are continuing to get hit Friday on raised U.S. China tensions as lawmakers also look to pass a bill to delist China-based ADRs.The real story I'm seeing right now in JD shares is to trust the price chart rather than politicians and buy into today's weakness. Technically, shares of JD.com have pulled back into a full-blown testing position of its former and pattern high. The decline in stock price follows Monday's bullish earnings-driven breakout to all-time-highs from a failed and very bullish monthly chart head-and-shoulders formation.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy With Fortress-Like Balance Sheets In this strategist's view, the powerful price signal and demonstrated relative strength trump today's headline worries and make this a great stock to buy. Without being totally dismissive of other investors' obvious worries, I'd advise using an intermediate-term, out-of-the-money bull call spread in lieu of buying JD shares with their open-ended risk profile. Netflix (NFLX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewNot that I've saved the best for last, but it may be the most interesting of our stocks to buy. Our final play is streaming video on demand giant Netflix. Shares were off nearly 4% during the session Thursday and finished down more than 2.5% . The news? The company announced plans to proactively cancel inactive subscriptions, which account for less than .005% of its total membership. Ho, hum, right?Further, the step was already telegraphed during a recent earnings announcement.So, what gives? Could the real bearish driver in shares have been an even more dated case of being yesterday's news?An article on Thursday from Investopedia which landed up at the top of Google's search list discussed Netflix's new, but not terribly exciting inactive accounts policy. Moreover, the story also noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives warning of growing antitrust momentum for Netflix shares.The warning was real. However, it appears to have been old news from months ago discussed on an interview on Bloomberg. Could that have been the actual, but mistaken, driver behind the sell-off? In this day and age of juiced-up algorithmic trading, I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss the possibility.The good news is the price drop is being offered to the advantage of today's investors. Technically, the pullback in Netflix puts shares within 3% of April's massive 'W' base breakout. I'd recommend buyers give this stock a bit more room down to $385 and size the position accordingly. Conservatively, this powerful and well-built pattern should reverse higher, continue to climb through 2020 and reach an eventual price target of $600 based on the structure's overall size.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management does not own any securities mentioned in this article.

2020-05-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong has spurred speculation of capital flight and an erosion of the city’s status as an international financial center. As a venue for share offerings, at least, the near-term future is looking bright. For that, the territory can thank worsening U.S.-China relations.U.S.-listed Chinese technology companies are lining up to sell stock in Hong Kong, seeking refuge from an environment that has become increasingly less hospitable. Nasdaq-traded JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. are planning secondary listings in the city next month, following a trail blazed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in November. Optimism that more companies will join them drove shares of Hong Kong’s exchange operator up more than 6% on Monday.There’s every reason to expect these stock offerings to do well, and push Hong Kong back up the rankings of the world’s largest fundraising centers. So far this year, the city is the sixth-largest market by capital raised. It topped the table for the whole of 2019 when New York-listed Alibaba sold $13 billion of stock, underscoring the existence of a strong local investor base for China’s most successful companies.The reception for Alibaba suggests that Asian institutional investors want to be able to trade China’s leading enterprises in their own time zone. JD and NetEase are also among the nation’s technology champions. Beijing-based JD competes with Alibaba in e-commerce, while Hangzhou-based NetEase is behind some of the most popular mobile games in China. Beyond these two, search-engine operator Baidu Inc. is considering delisting from Nasdaq and moving to an exchange nearer home, Reuters reported last week. The coronavirus has exacerbated tensions between Washington and Beijing, while scandals such as fabricated sales at Luckin Coffee Inc. have spurred politicians to push for tighter regulation, giving Chinese companies an incentive to list elsewhere.Hong Kong is an obvious choice. The city burnished its appeal for U.S.-traded companies last week when the compiler of the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index said it would change its rules to admit secondary listings and companies with dual-class share structures. Stocks that join the benchmark can expect inflows from passive investors such as exchange-traded funds that track the index.Citigroup Inc. reckons that 23 of the 249 Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. meet Hong Kong’s criteria for a secondary listing, which require companies to have a market value of $5.2 billion or, alternatively, a combination of $129 million in annual sales and a $1.3 billion market cap. JD tops the group with a value of $73 billion.An even more alluring prize would be inclusion of secondary listings in Hong Kong’s stock-trading links with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, which would enable mainland Chinese investors to buy these shares. Alibaba wasn’t included in the stock connect, to the disappointment of some investors. China’s government could yet decide to make this happen.It’s a reminder that Beijing has levers at its disposal to help shore up Hong Kong’s economy and financial industry, which accounts for a fifth of the city’s gross domestic product — as it did after the SARS epidemic in 2003, when half a million people demonstrated against the Hong Kong government’s first, aborted attempt to introduce national security legislation. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. surged the most in 18 months Monday even as unrest returned to the city. Listing of American depositary receipts may double the exchange operator’s revenue, Morgan Stanley said. The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, stabilized after slumping 5.6% on Friday.An exodus of businesses, people and capital may yet imperil Hong Kong’s role as an international financial center. The IPO outlook suggests that, rather than a sudden demise, that’s likely to be a long drawn-out process.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-05-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is India’s richest man betting on a tech cold war?Petrochemicals czar Mukesh Ambani plans to list his fledgling digital business overseas, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of Jio Platforms Ltd.’s initial public offering, which is planned for the next 12 to 24 months.Going to the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq would make sense. U.S.-traded Chinese technology firms such as JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. are looking for an alternative home closer to the mainland in case tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate, as my colleague Nisha Gopalan wrote this week. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. held a secondary listing in Hong Kong in November. With Washington considering a range of sanctions against Chinese officials and firms as punishment for Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong, now may be the perfect time to pitch American investors on the potential of the other internet market with a billion-plus people.A splashy overseas foray will be an unusual step for a family that brought the retail equity culture to India. Dhirubhai Ambani, Mukesh’s late father who founded the empire, booked a football stadium in Mumbai in 1985 to hold a shareholders’ meeting for the polyester textile maker that he had floated eight years earlier. But then, Mukesh Ambani is already moving old furniture around as he pivots flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. away from an oversupplied energy and chemicals market. At the same time, he’s beefing up the balance sheet after a seven-year, $100 billion debt-fueled expansion. A big chunk of that was for Jio, the wireless carrier that has become India’s largest in less than four years.A $7 billion rights issue, Reliance’s first in three decades, buttressed by more than $10 billion raised in a month from the sale of shares in unlisted Jio Platforms may help cut the company’s $20 billion of net debt to zero before Ambani’s March 2021 target. A U.S. IPO should give Jio’s new backers, including Facebook Inc., KKR & Co., Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic, a better valuation in a capital market that’s deeper than Mumbai’s.Will Wall Street be so hospitable as to give Ambani, say, a $100 billion valuation?  (Alibaba, a more mature business, was valued at $168 billion six years ago.) Jio Platforms, which is centered on the the 4G mobile network, is the cornerstone of Reliance’s emerging triple play on carriage, content and commerce. With almost 400 million customers under his belt, Ambani needs to prove he can garner at least $3 from each of them every month. Modest as that sounds, it isn’t an easy task when per-user revenue is at present only a little over half as much. The coronavirus lockdown has ravaged India’s economy, setting its growth prospects back perhaps by several years. Mass market consumers, who comprise Jio’s user base, have been badly hurt.That’s where a tech cold war may help. Wall Street investors have been able to profit from the explosion of e-commerce in China, even though the likes of Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. are largely shut out of the People’s Republic. If that access gets curbed by geopolitics, then Ambani’s story becomes more compelling. He can offer the vision of a vast retail network that has Facebook’s popular WhatsApp messaging system processing orders and payments for neighborhood shops connected digitally to a billion-plus buyers. That could be a big draw. A U.S. home is within Ambani’s reach, especially if Chinese firms are forced to vacate.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-05-29,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. have won approvals to forge ahead with their Hong Kong share sales that could raise billions of dollars, as political turmoil leaves the city’s status as an international finance center clouded in uncertainty.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. approved the secondary listing applications by the U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. Online gaming firm NetEase filed a preliminary prospectus with the exchange later on Friday, a confirmation that it has received the official green light.NetEase plans to list in Hong Kong on June 11, while China’s No. 2 online retailer JD aims to debut on June 18, Bloomberg News has reported. JD’s stock sale could raise at least $2 billion to help the e-commerce firm shore up its position in an increasingly competitive home market.Representatives for Hong Kong’s stock exchange, JD and NetEase declined to comment.Escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing are increasing risks for Chinese companies like JD and NetEase who seek to broaden their investor base. U.S. capital markets are becoming frosty toward Chinese firms, and fears over the impact of national security legislation set to be imposed on Hong Kong, including the resumption of protests in the city, have sent the local market into convulsions.What Hong Kong Losing Its ‘Special Status’ Would Mean: QuickTakeThe twin debuts would follow Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $13 billion Hong Kong stock sale last year, hailed as a homecoming for Chinese companies and a win for Hong Kong stock exchange, which lost many of the largest tech corporations to U.S. bourses because it didn’t allow dual-class share voting at the time -- a requirement that’s since been relaxed.Shares in U.S.-listed Chinese companies have see-sawed since senators overwhelmingly approved legislation on May 20 that could bar the country’s firms from American exchanges.

But alas, sometimes, I wish Hong Kong could be just another Chinese city.Hong Kong is defined by its financial hub. With a common law system, a currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, and sitting at the gate to mainland China, the city’s banking industry has blossomed, especially since the global financial crisis.Seeking exposure to China's great economic engine, investors have funneled billions of dollars into the city. For evidence, look no further than its monetary base. The so-called aggregate balance has swollen to as much as $51 billion since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.It’s no surprise the economy has morphed. Financial services now contribute about 20% of gross domestic product, from 10% two decades earlier. Meanwhile, manufacturing has become almost nonexistent. Once we include real-estate services, the finance industry would overtake trading and logistics — Hong Kong’s traditional bread-and-butter — as the city’s most important sector.But such economic growth hasn't been matched by a surge of good jobs. In the decade after the 2008 crisis, the added value from financial services grew an annualized 6.8%, but employment rose only 2.5%. As of 2018, the sector comprised 6.8% of the workforce, or 263,000 people. Tourism, which constitutes only 4.5% of GDP, employed almost as many.This is because finance is capital intensive, not labor intensive. An experienced banker can arrange a mega initial public offering just as well as a mid-cap listing, and a star trader can execute a $1 billion order just as efficiently as a $100 million one. As the industry grew, what it needed was experience and access to China, not more headcount.Read More: Hong Kong isn’t becoming just another Chinese cityAcross the border, Shenzhen has taken a very different turn. A dozen years ago, it was a still a small city, where Hong Kong residents went for cheap food and shopping. Now, its economy is bigger than Hong Kong’s. Industrials, a labor-intensive sector, remains prominent, accounting for about 40% of the city’s GDP.Many technology companies made Shenzhen their home: Tencent Holdings Ltd., Huawei Technologies Co., Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., ZTE Corp., Warren Buffett-backed electric-vehicle maker BYD Co., to name a few. Along the way, billions were made and millionaires were minted. Publicly listed companies headquartered in Shenzhen now command $1.5 trillion in total market cap, almost three times as much as those based just across the border. Hong Kong is where bankers live, but Shenzhen — China’s Silicon Valley — is where they spend their time, searching for the next Tencent.This is the outcome of a deliberate decision made by the Shenzhen government. Its most recent five-year land plan says it all. Just like Hong Kong, the city has vowed to keep at least half of its land in its natural ecological condition. Of the space allocated for urban use, at least 30% is intended for industrial development, such as traditional manufacturing and science parks. By comparison, Hong Kong’s planning department reserves only 3.6% of its usable land for such purposes.Along with big plots came generous subsidies. Always keen to lure tech firms, Shenzhen mandated that corporate tax rates at the Qianhai free trade zone be lower than Hong Kong’s. To weather the coronavirus-induced slowdown, the local government is offering to reimburse up to 70% of tech startups’ bank-loan interest repayments.Most likely, Hong Kong’s high-finance industry will survive all the negative headlines, because the conditions that have spurred its prosperity remain. U.S. President Donald Trump’s China rant at his press conference Friday has been seen as all bark, no bite. The billions of dollars unleashed by the Federal Reserve’s new quantitative easing programs will once again find their way to Hong Kong, and bankers and corporate lawyers have shown some willingness to stomach Beijng’s new security law.The industry may even thrive from a great divorce between the U.S. and China. Mega IPOs are on the horizon again, this time not from China’s state-owned giants, but its U.S.-listed technology titans such as JD.com Inc. and Netease Inc. Both are seeking refuge in Hong Kong in case they get kicked out off U.S. stock exchanges. And despite all the political uncertainty, index provider MSCI Inc. said last week it would move licensing for 37 derivatives from Singapore to its rival financial hub, simply because Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has “the access to Chinese institutional and retail investors.” Hong Kong is still the gateway to China.But this is bad news for the rest of the city. It takes a crisis for a government to devise drastic measures. If its key industry remains intact, Carrie Lam’s administration has no incentive to seek new sources of economic growth.The dominance of finance has created a social mobility problem in Hong Kong. The industry naturally favors bilingual “sea turtles” like me over local university graduates, for our business and cultural connections to China. But in Shenzhen, your socioeconomic background doesn't matter as much. Oftentimes, all it takes is a product prototype, a PowerPoint presentation, and suddenly you've got office space — and subsidized housing nearby, too. Hong Kong has a lot to learn from its tech savvy neighbor.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-06-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- So get this. A U.S.-listed, Cayman Islands-domiciled, Chinese internet company is seeking to sell shares in China(1), so that it can become more internationalized.That’s among the bizarre rationales for NetEase Inc.’s offering in Hong Kong, 20 years after the company first debuted on the Nasdaq. The elephant in the room, which gets the briefest of mentions in its 458-page prospectus, is that NetEase is among a raft of Chinese companies that may be booted from U.S. bourses entirely.In his letter to shareholders, William Ding, the founder and chief executive officer, outlines the future of NetEase. Among the plans: going global while solidifying its position in China. He’s putting shareholder money where his mouth is. Around HK$9.6 billion ($1.2 billion), or 45% of the expected HK$21.3 billion to be raised in the initial public offering this week, will go toward strategies to make the business more international, the document says. A mere 10% will be put toward general corporate purposes, including mergers and acquisitions.According to Ding, NetEase has been exploring the world over the past few years, though “some people might not have noticed these efforts.” He’s right about that. The world’s second-largest mobile games company, behind Tencent Holdings Ltd., has launched more than 50 mobile titles since 2015, but garners a mere 11% of gaming revenue outside China. With a huge team of developers and a 20-year history, you’d think that if NetEase was truly going global, it would have a bit more to show for it by now.So, the money to be put toward globalization is around 165% of the sales reaped overseas last year. It’s not like NetEase needs even a dime of that Hong Kong IPO cash. It had around HK$82 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of March, almost four times the amount to be raised in the new share sale. It generated free cash flow of HK$18.2 billion last year.But when you’re asking investors for HK$21 billion in cash that you don’t really need, “going global” is a much better sales pitch than, “We might get kicked off one of the world’s major stock exchanges.”You can’t really blame NetEase for that. It’s among dozens of companies left in limbo as the Beijing-Washington spat escalates to the point of Congress passing laws requiring U.S.-listed Chinese companies to be transparent. As the prospectus notes, Beijing doesn’t allow Chinese auditing firms to be subject to the inspection of the U.S.’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. That leaves NetEase in a race to list elsewhere, soon to be joined in Hong Kong by Nasdaq-traded e-commerce company JD.com Inc.The problem with doing an IPO two decades after doing an IPO is that you can no longer crib from that youthful “the future is ours” playbook. You’re saddled with the realities of being a middle-aged internet company in a huge market that’s peaked.While NetEase is a global leader, with titles such as the “Westward Journey” series and “Knives Out,” the market is slowing — from average annual growth of 13.4% over the past five years to 8.8% in the next four years, according to estimates from researcher Newzoo, which NetEase cites.That’s why you play fast and loose with metrics like monthly active users, as NetEase does by double-counting some customers who may have logged into its Youdao education platform from multiple devices. Or talk up a new sector called innovative businesses. Even though that division, which includes music and live-streaming,  accounts for 36% of the workforce and costs, it contributes just 19% of revenue. What’s more, it garners a third of the gross margin level of the rest of the company. Which brings us back to a share sale that NetEase doesn’t really need, and a reason for that cash which doesn’t really exist. Rather than raising money to be a power abroad, this IPO looks more like a Chinese company wanting to come home.(1) Reminder: Hong Kong is part of China.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Next Up: JD.com and NetEase.
2020-06-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bankers hoping for a bonanza from Hong Kong share sales by U.S.-listed Chinese companies should contain their excitement. Low fees and the hangover of the Luckin Coffee Inc. scandal are likely to put a damper on the rewards.Hong Kong’s market for stock offerings is booming. Online retailer JD.com Inc. is raising as much as $4.1 billion in the world’s second-biggest share sale this year, days after internet gaming company NetEase Inc.’s $2.7 billion listing. There’s a line of candidates for Hong Kong flotations, driven by the prospect that the U.S. will delist companies that can’t commit to proving they are free from foreign government control.That’s a boon for the city and its stock-exchange operator, after China’s plans to impose a national security law raised questions over Hong Kong’s future as an international financial center. The NetEase and JD.com offerings were both heavily oversubscribed by retail and institutional investors, showing the strength of demand for U.S.-traded Chinese tech companies. These and upcoming deals may not deliver the windfall to investment bankers that such a pipeline would usually promise, though.For one thing, secondary listings earn a lot less in fees than initial public offerings. NetEase is paying the banks that worked on its Hong Kong flotation just 0.25% of the proceeds, compared with a standard rate for IPOs of 2% to 3%, as my colleague Julia Fioretti notes. Such deals earn less because the companies are already listed, meaning less work is required from banks to introduce their businesses to investors.Secondly, not all companies eligible to sell shares in Hong Kong can be expected do so. There are 42 Chinese companies in the U.S. that qualify for Hong Kong secondary listings, according to analysts at UBS Group AG. Should they issue 5% of their stock over the next 12 months, that would mean $27 billion in funds raised. The actual amount may come in far short of that. Blame the fall of Luckin, the Starbucks competitor that faces delisting from Nasdaq after acknowledging that it fabricated sales. The episode has damaged the reputation of Chinese companies overseas and is having a cautionary impact on investors, banks and potential listing candidates.Unlike Hong Kong, the U.S. market has a disclosure-based system that makes listing — and delisting — easier. Investors subject to corporate fraud can seek redress through class-action lawsuits (Luckin and its IPO arranger, Credit Suisse Group AG, have both been sued). Lacking such legal safeguards, Hong Kong has a gatekeeper for its market, with regulators vetting listing candidates. Companies and their sponsoring banks need to factor in this added scrutiny.As for investors, they may feel they’ve already had the pick of the U.S.-listed Chinese contingent. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the first to sell shares in November, JD.com and NetEase are three of the four biggest by market capitalization (the other is Pinduoduo Inc.). They are all well known and with track records as listed companies stretching back years. As the list goes down to encompass smaller and lesser-known enterprises, investor enthusiasm may wane.Not all businesses can match the excitement of the tech trio. Will investors flock to Yum China Holdings Inc., operator of KFC outlets in the country, for example? American investors have taken to Yum, which has the highest percentage of U.S. institutional ownership among the group. This investor base may be unwilling to switch to Hong Kong shares, a factor that may affect demand and post-listing liquidity.Then there’s online travel agency Trip.com Group Ltd., also on the roster of upcoming secondary listings. It has the technology sheen, but will investors be able to overlook the hammering that the world’s tourism companies have taken from the coronavirus pandemic?The reality is that while secondary listings are good business, “there are bigger opportunities in other products for investment banks in the region,” according to Amrit Shahani, London-based research director at analytics company Coalition Development Ltd. First-quarter IPO fees for the top 12 investment banks that Coalition follows in the region, from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Citigroup Inc., were around $150 million, Shahani said; they made a combined $1.5 billion from foreign-exchange trading during the period.So things are looking up after all.

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The two archrivals of Asian finance have competed so intensely for so long that it’s impossible to believe that Hong Kong’s fading autonomy and the resumption of anti-government protests isn’t filling Singapore with even a little bit of schadenfreude. It was a surprise, therefore, to see the Monetary Authority of Singapore rebut news reports that there had been large flows of deposits from Hong Kong. The MAS was responding to data that showed a near-fourfold jump in one corner of the Singapore banking system’s foreign-currency deposits over the past year:The central bank has a valid objection. The above chart only shows foreign-currency deposits in domestic banking units (DBUs). Include deposits in the the Asian currency units (ACUs), a fancy name for a different set of ledgers that the same banks use for their international business, and the fourfold growth turns out to be a 20% increase, to S$781 billion ($564 billion). Not exactly a deluge, though perhaps more than a puddle of rainwater on Singapore’s Orchard Road:There are plenty of reasons why deposits are rising, and not just in Singapore. Central banks everywhere are flooding lenders with liquidity to ease the pain of the coronavirus pandemic. Governments are putting money into people’s accounts, while cautious firms are stuffing theirs by drawing on previously unused working-capital lines.Besides, if deposits are fleeing Hong Kong, then banks in the territory must be feeling the pinch? That doesn’t seem to be the case: It was only in late May that China said that it would impose a national security law in Hong Kong. April data may not be capturing the gloom about Hong Kong’s future. Still, the immediate challenge for the special administrative region is capital inflows, which are forcing the monetary authority to buy billions of U.S. dollars to prevent the Hong Kong dollar from strengthening beyond 7.75, the outer boundary of the 7.75-7.85 range in which it is allowed to trade against the greenback.  Money is pouring in because Hong Kong dollar interest rates are higher than U.S. dollar rates, and also because JD.com Inc., China’s No. 2 online retailer, is selling shares in the city in what’s likely to be the world’s second-biggest initial public offering this year.A few mainland companies that no longer feel welcome in U.S. capital markets won’t be Hong Kong’s ticket to perennial preeminence. However, if the territory does bleed deposits, will Singapore want them? The two-ledger system, the reason for confusion about capital inflows, has its roots in the rivalry. In 1968, when founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew decided to turn his tin- and rubber-exporting port into an international financial center, he had no real advantage over Hong Kong, then a British colony. But the devaluation of the pound in 1967 created demand for dollars in Asia, and Singapore grabbed the chance with the help of Dick van Oenen, a Dutch currency trader at Bank of America. Hong Kong, reluctant to admit new banks, took almost a decade to catch up. It was hesitant initially to host an offshore finance hub because those, like casinos, are best left to places that don’t have much other activity to protect. Singapore insulated its domestic economy from instability thanks to the different domestic and international ledger units, which demarcated banks’ high-stakes global commerce from their more humdrum local franchise. For five years now, authorities have been planning to end the divide, and in January parliament approved the merger of the two accounts. Since regulatory scrutiny of financial intermediaries has gone up in all the major economies from which Singapore hosts its foreign banks, there’s little point in continuing with a dual-track system. Even so, this chart should give the authorities pause:From roughly similar levels in 1991, deposits in Singapore — across both the ledgers, and including all currencies — have risen to $1 trillion, while Hong Kong’s have exploded to $1.8 trillion because of its outsize role in securing capital for Chinese firms. Singapore may have the competence and confidence to ensure that banks can backstop their IOUs, with or without help from their home countries. But will the regulators be comfortable if the state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. — the largest shareholder of both London-based Standard Chartered Plc and homegrown DBS Group Holdings Ltd.— sees value in combining the two banks, an idea that’s been doing the rounds for the better part of two decades, though never seriously entertained? Such a merger would give Singapore an institution at least half as big by deposit size as HSBC Holdings Plc, the gorilla of Hong Kong banking:But size isn’t everything. Deposits come from loans, and too much credit causes “financialization.” It’s a term economists use to describe situations in which a society sacrifices other priorities — such as manufacturing competitiveness, affordable housing and less leveraged firms — for a mirage of affluence.Singapore’s planners know that unlike London, New York or Hong Kong, which sits at the mouth of China’s planned Greater Bay Area, their island nation doesn’t have a hinterland to accommodate the losers of financialization.Orbigood, a Singaporean exclamation for others getting their comeuppance, is best kept for its rival’s cramped housing and noxious air. Singapore wouldn’t really want deposits to rush in from Hong Kong. It might do more harm than good.   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-06-11,"JD.Com Inc's (NASDAQ: JD) Hong Kong IPO has raised about $3.9 billion, making it the biggest of the listings on the exchange so far this year.What Happened:  Chinese online retailer JD.com, which is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange,  opted  for a secondary listing closer home and had earlier indicated plans to sell 133 million shares.The shares were priced at 226 Hong Kong dollars/share, or $29.16 per share, raising about $3.88 billion in the process, Reuters  reported, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.With each ADS of JD.com representing two ordinary shares, the Hong Kong IPO pricing of $29.16 per share or $58.32 per ADS is at a discount to the $60.70 at which the ADSs closed Wednesday.JD.com shares will begin trading on the Hong Kong exchange June 18.Why It Matters:  The move to a secondary listing is keeping in line with the recent trend of Chinese companies hedging against the risk of a potential U.S. delisting amid escalating tensions between the countries.Additionally, the U.S. has not taken kindly to the questionable reporting standards of domestically listed Chinese companies, especially after the unearthing of fraud in some cases. Chinese online gaming company NetEase Inc (NASDAQ: NTES), which undertook an IPO in Hong Kong, saw its shares rise about 5.7% in the  debut session Thursday.

JD.com Inc.’s planned $3.9 billion share sale, which would be the world’s second-largest of the year, is also oversubscribed. China Bohai Bank Co. is planning to launch its own $2 billion offering.Such listings are reviving interest in Hong Kong’s market, boosting inflows and helping strengthen the local dollar at a time when the passing of a national security law has raised concerns about the city’s status as a financial hub. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have threatened to curtail Chinese companies’ access to U.S. capital markets, making such secondary listings closer to home more appealing.“Introducing another technology giant to Hong Kong is definitely good for market sentiment,” said Banny Lam, managing director at CEB International Corp. “It will help Hong Kong to attract more longer-term investors and demand for future listings like JD.com will be boosted since the investment now looks very profitable.”Trading as high as HK$135.2 ($17.4) per share in Hong Kong at their highest intraday level, NetEase shares were valued at about a 3% premium to those listed on the Nasdaq -- which are near a record high. One U.S. share is equivalent to 25 Hong Kong stocks. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. rose 6.6% on its Hong Kong debut.The prospect of NetEase potentially joining the benchmark Hang Seng Index is also helping buoy investors’ confidence, Lam said.

The top five investors accounted for about 40 per cent of the institutional tranche, the people said.The oversubscription of the Hong Kong retail tranche triggered the highest level of a clawback mechanism that increased the size of the local offering to 12 per cent of the overall global offer.The final pricing came as sentiment soured dramatically on Wall Street on Thursday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.9 per cent and the S&P; 500 Index dropped 5.9 per cent as investors reacted negatively to a spike in coronavirus infections in parts of the United States that were among the first to reopen their economies.

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to inch out of the coronavirus slump in May, though a reliance on industry amid sluggish consumer demand underlines the fragility of the recovery as further infections appear.Industrial output rose 4.4% from a year earlier, versus a median estimate of a 5.0% expansion. Retail sales fell 2.8%, compared to a projected 2.3% drop. Fixed-asset investment declined 6.3% in the first five months, versus a forecast 6% drop. The surveyed urban jobless rate fell to 5.9% from 6% the previous month.A jump in cases in Beijing over the weekend has raised fears of a resurgence of the pandemic in China, threatening to blunt recent government efforts to revive the economy. Beijing has shuttered the city’s largest fruit and vegetable supply center and locked down nearby housing districts after nearly 100 people associated with the wholesale market tested positive for the coronavirus.The Monday data showed the gradual recovery in China’s economy was still mainly driven by the supply side thanks to continued policy stimulus, while demand remains weak. Industrial production has rebounded from a contraction in February, while private consumption is still shrinking and investment hasn’t recovered.Mixed Performance“The recovery is on the track while mixed performance can be observed everywhere -- manufacturing still better than services, cars better than catering,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore. “However, the virus concerns will cloud the economic outlook.”While highlighting the moderate improvements in May and reiterating the pledge to strive to achieve the full-year economic and social development goals, the statistics bureau also acknowledged downside risks.“The overseas epidemic situation and the world economic situation have become more severe and complicated, and the stable operation of the domestic economy still faces many risks and challenges,” the bureau said in a separate statement.With the rest of the world in recession, exports dropping and China’s relations with the U.S. continuing to worsen, a rebound relies to a large extent on domestic consumption.“It’s quite clear that production has recovered pretty nicely, but the consumption, as well as investment actually are lagging behind,” Shen Jianguang, chief economist at leading online retailer JD.com Inc., said on Bloomberg television after the data. “So it’s the lack of demand that’s the main problem of the Chinese economy right now.”Output in the consumer goods sector shrank 0.6%, compared with the 0.7% increase last month, the statistics bureau said, while export orders were “insufficient.” The value of delivered exports shrank 1.4%, and dropped more than 10% in some important sectors.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...The new surge in coronavirus cases raises the risk of a second wave of infections, which -- depending on the public reaction and the nature of the countermeasures -- could hold back the recovery. Supportive policy is likely to stay in place for an extended period. The main focus now is on making sure the stimulus gets traction.Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg EconomicsFor the full note click hereThe People’s Bank of China supplied banks with 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) in fresh liquidity Monday while letting some previous loans expire, leaving the financial system needing further injections if a looming cash crunch is to be avoided.

2020-06-18,Chinese ecommerce group JD.com jumped almost 6 per cent on its trading debut in Hong Kong after raising nearly $4bn in the second-largest share sale globally this year.  JD.com had raised $3.9bn earlier this month through the secondary sale of 133m new shares at an offer price of HK$226 each.  Hong Kong is likely to benefit from a wave of large equity capital raisings this year as US-listed Chinese companies trading in New York face regulatory pressure from the Trump administration and the prospect of forced delistings.,JD.com shares jump on Hong Kong debut
2020-06-19,"JD.com’s annual “618” online shopping extravaganza racked up a total of 269.2 billion yuan ($38 billion) worth of transactions, as consumers splurged during China’s first major e-commerce sale since the pandemic began.",JD.com racks up $38 billion in sales in China’s first post-lockdown shopping spree
2020-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. handled record sales of $136 billion during the country’s biggest online shopping gala of the post-pandemic era, suggesting China’s nascent consumer spending recovery has legs.The twin e-commerce giants put nationwide consumption to its first major test since the pandemic with the annual “6.18” summer extravaganza that concluded Thursday. Transactions across JD’s online platforms during the 18-day marathon leapt 34% to 269.2 billion yuan ($38 billion), a faster pace than in 2019. And Alibaba said it handled 698.2 billion yuan during its own campaign, without a year-earlier comparison. JD’s shares stood largely unchanged after rising 3.5% in their Hong Kong debut.China’s largest retailers counted on pent-up demand during the event -- created by JD to commemorate its June 18 founding anniversary -- to make up for lost sales during a coronavirus-stricken March quarter. Global brands and smaller merchants alike stocked up on goods for months in anticipation of an online bargain spree surpassed only by the Nov. 11 Singles’ Day in scale. The final tally underscored how hundreds of millions of shoppers remain willing to spend after the world’s No. 2 economy contracted for the first time in decades, especially given huge discounts as Covid-19 shifted buying to the internet.“The strong GMV at 6.18 will help to dispel market anxiety about virus-related disruptions,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “Chinese e-commerce platforms will probably deliver strong 2Q sales and profit recovery due to pent-up consumer demand and an accelerated shift to digital consumption channels driven by the virus.”This year’s deals-fest culminated with the biggest bargains Thursday and featured more generous subsidies than ever before, as well as an unprecedented cohort of live-streaming personalities. Competition also intensified with the likes of ByteDance Ltd. and Kuaishou -- whose video app now sells JD goods -- vying for buyers.“Chinese and foreign brands had sluggish sales due to the pandemic, and 6.18 has become their most important opportunity in the first half,” JD Retail Chief Executive Officer Xu Lei said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. For discretionary items like home appliances, “we’ve seen a recovery in consumption.”Read more: Chinese Shoppers Can Go Out Again. Online Buys Show They Won’tChinese retail suffered a record collapse in the first three months of 2020. While it’s on the mend, latest data shows private consumption still sluggish, dashing hopes of a V-shaped recovery as people head back to work. The picture is complicated by the fact that Covid-19 has kept people away from stores and shifted an unknown proportion of retail activity online, propping up online purchases.JD has projected revenue growth of 20% to 30% this quarter. Xu -- widely viewed as the front-runner to succeed billionaire founder Richard Liu -- says JD is on track to meet that goal and isn’t threatened by competitors encroaching upon its turf, like in consumer gadgets.“I don’t dance with them, I dance with users,” he said.Signs had grown this month that China’s e-commerce giants were on track for record sums as measured by gross merchandise value, or total value of goods sold. During the first ten hours of its 6.18 campaign, Alibaba’s Tmall business-to-consumer marketplace logged sales 50% higher than during the same period last year, after participating brands doubled. JD has said sales of imports like HP laptops and Dyson hairdryers soared, while it’s selling more fresh produce in smaller cities.Read more: JD’s Outlook Beats After E-Commerce Surges in China LockdownInitiated in 2014 as a riposte to Alibaba’s Singles’ Day, 6.18 has become yet another annual ritual for e-commerce companies and their offline partners from Walmart Inc. to Suning.com Co. Beyond headline figures, it’s less clear how much it contributes to the bottom line given the enormous discounting involved.“The result is good as far as growth is concerned, but in terms of margins, all the players will see the consequences,” said Steven Zhu, analyst at Pacific Epoch. “It’s just what I call paid-GMV for all the platforms. It’s the time that people have to have a good number after the coronavirus, so they just do it at whatever the cost.”Alibaba, along with brands on its platforms, committed cash and other coupons worth a total of 14 billion yuan, according to the company. JD said it offered 10 billion yuan in subsidies.“User growth and retention, and the digitization of brands and merchants are key considerations” when Alibaba pushes subsidies during promotions like 6.18, said Alibaba Vice President Mike Gu, who heads Tmall’s fashion and consumer goods businesses.Read more: Alibaba Drops After Projecting Slowing Growth in Uncertain TimesMore broadly, sales of fast-moving consumer goods on the Tmall and Taobao marketplaces in the June quarter have so far exceeded the pace of 2019’s final quarter, Gu said in an interview. Thanks to 6.18, apparel growth this month has also climbed back to pre-Covid-19 levels, he added.Live-streaming is also playing a bigger role during this year’s 6.18, at a time Covid-19 is fueling an unprecedented boom in online media. Alibaba’s Taobao Live championed the use of influencers to sell everything from lipstick to rockets, prompting rivals like JD and Pinduoduo Inc. to follow suit.Social media companies like TikTok-owner ByteDance and Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed Kuaishou are jumping on the bandwagon. Their mini-video platforms in China have lured a long list of tech chieftains hawking products of their own to live-streaming fans: The latest was NetEase Inc.’s usually reclusive founder, William Ding. Last week, his debut on Kuaishou amassed 72 million yuan of sales in just four hours.“I’ve never eaten beef jerky as tasty as this in the last twenty years,” the billionaire said during the livestream.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s $136 Billion E-Commerce Haul Signals a Consumer Comeback
2020-06-19,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com Inc.

2020-06-26,"This year has been somewhat quiet for Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Alibaba stock has gained a little less than 5%. That's a solid performance, given some broad indices remain negative year to date. But it's surely not what bulls hoped for at the beginning of the year.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com Alibaba has seen some volatility along the way. From January highs to March lows, the stock dropped a little over 25%. But many quality names saw much bigger moves. Relative to the market as a whole, Alibaba's stock just hasn't stood out.At this point, perhaps that's not all that surprising. Alibaba is the sixth-most valuable company listed on U.S. exchanges. Its market capitalization is larger than those of giants like Visa (NYSE:V) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company accounts for a staggering percentage of the Chinese economy: over 5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBased on size alone, investors shouldn't expect sizzling returns from Alibaba stock. They should expect more muted volatility. That's pretty much how 2020 has played out.That said, looking at the company's peers, Alibaba's performance seems surprising -- and even disappointing. And that relative performance suggests that the stock should have another rally ahead in the not-too-distant future. Alibaba's Peers SoarAgain, it's easy to argue that Alibaba's YTD performance makes sense. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the on-again, off-again trade war on the Chinese economy have kept a ceiling on upside. But the quality of the business kept drawdowns relatively manageable, even as investors panicked in March.  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave But that story starts to fall apart when taking even a cursory look at the company's peers. Other Chinese e-commerce plays have soared. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which sits behind Alibaba in terms of market share, has gained a sizzling 72% so far this year. It held up even better in March than Alibaba stock.Upstart Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), meanwhile, has gone parabolic. PDD stock has rallied 127% in 2020. The stock has nearly tripled from March lows.Clearly, investors are bullish on Chinese e-commerce. Indeed, they're bullish on Chinese tech more broadly. With the exception of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), basically every large-cap tech stock in the country has outperformed Alibaba in 2020.If Alibaba was performing poorly, that might make some sense. That doesn't appear to be the case. Fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings last month handily beat analyst estimates. Alibaba stock sold off anyway.Pinduoduo, in particular, has gobbled up some market share. But it's also a far smaller company that is growing off a smaller base.The performance of Alibaba stock relative to Chinese tech plays is surprising. And it undercuts any real bear case. If investors were bearish on e-commerce, PDD and JD wouldn't be soaring. If they feared the Chinese economy more broadly, smaller names would be selling off across the board.That's not what's happening. That in turn suggests that Alibaba should catch up at some point. Alibaba vs. AmazonOf course, there's also the comparison to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).To be sure, the two companies are not quite as equivalent as some observers claim. Alibaba is not quite the &quot;Amazon of China.&quot;That said, AMZN stock has gained 49% so far this year. It has added about $450 billion in market value in six months, a figure equal to nearly three-fourths of Alibaba's market capitalization.And while the two companies have their differences, there are two core reasons why AMZN stock has soared. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce adoption. Just as importantly, if not more so, its accelerated cloud adoption.Alibaba has those exact same drivers. Obviously, it's an e-commerce giant. And as I detailed earlier this year, it's investing heavily to extend its early dominance in the cloud business in Asia.Yet -- again -- the stock hasn't been rewarded. Amazon's stock has. Here, too, the divergent performance doesn't make a ton of sense. Alibaba Stock Looks Like a Long-Term BuyAs a result, it seems like there are two potential outcomes. Either Alibaba stock rallies sharply and catches up to these other names. Or those other names decline due to unsustainable gains of late.The latter outcome admittedly isn't impossible. There is no shortage of skeptics toward Amazon's valuation. Some investors see cause for caution toward China more broadly.But I'm not one of those investors. China still literally has hundreds of millions of citizens that are headed for the middle and upper classes. Their increasing disposable income creates a long-term tailwind for Alibaba sales.Meanwhile, the company's stock traded at an enormous discount to Amazon, even heading into this year. The gap now is even wider.And at some point, that gap will close. And it's most likely to close because Alibaba stock rallies, not because Amazon stock tumbles.It seems like right now, investors are chasing the &quot;hot&quot; names, and ignoring the biggest and best operator in China. That will change, and it's then that Alibaba stock will get the credit it deserves.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Colin Huang’s ascent is one for the history books: In just six months, his fortune swelled by $25 billion -- one of the biggest gains among the world’s richest people.His Pinduoduo Inc., a Groupon-like shopping app he founded in 2015, has become China’s third-largest e-commerce platform, with a market value of more than $100 billion. In the first quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic caused most of the nation’s economy to grind to a halt, PDD’s active users surged 68% and revenue jumped 44%, the company said in May.Now Huang, who has overseen the firm as its American depositary receipts have more than quadrupled in less than two years, has stepped down as chief executive officer.At one point, his net worth climbed as high as $45 billion, placing him just behind China’s wealthiest people -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Jack Ma -- on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That’s even as PDD continued to post losses, primarily because it chases growth with the help of generous subsidies and has been known to spend more on marketing than it earns in sales.“Pinduoduo was perfectly positioned for people being stuck at home,” said Tom Ronk, CEO of Century Pacific Investments in Newport, California.Huang, who controlled 43.3% of PDD shares, has reduced his stake to 29.4%, according to a June 30 regulatory filing. His fortune now stands at $30 billion.That excludes a $2.4 billion charitable holding that he shares with PDD’s founding team, and $7.9 billion that went to Pinduoduo Partnership, of which Huang and newly named CEO Lei Chen are members. The partnership will help fund science research and management incentives, according to a letter following Huang’s resignation. The wealth estimate also excludes $3.9 billion that people familiar with the matter said was transferred to an angel investor.PDD declined to comment on Huang’s holdings or net worth.Facing ChallengesHe will remain chairman and work on the company’s long-term strategy and corporate structure to help drive the future of the e-commerce giant, PDD said.“PDD is still facing some high-level challenges in product supply, relationship with brand merchants, logistics and payments,” said Shawn Yang, an analyst at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors. “Colin may want to focus more on these issues.”PDD’s success hinges on deals, which have become particularly popular with customers looking for bargains as the world’s second-largest economy slows. Most of its users come from smaller Chinese cities, and the app gives them extra discounts when they recommend a product through social networks and get friends to buy the same item.Fen Liu, a homemaker in Quanzhou, a provincial city in Fujian, said she accrued enough coupons with her friends’ help to reduce the price of a suitcase to zero.“I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw my suitcase arrive in the mail,” she said. “It’s made me a loyal Pinduoduo user ever since.”‘Bargain Hunters’While PDD’s aggressive price-reduction strategies have helped win over people with lower incomes, they may stifle the company’s efforts to attract wealthier consumers, according to Charlie Chen and Veronica Shen, analysts at China Renaissance Securities in Hong Kong.“PDD’s users are largely bargain hunters reluctant to buy large-ticket items,” they wrote in a June 29 note, adding that the company’s image remains a key obstacle to users spending more. “We believe PDD is working to change its low-price brand image -- but this could be costly.”That may require heavy marketing and hurt margins further despite a strong user-base foundation for future growth, the analysts said. And PDD’s management has offered no clear path to profitability.Last year, the company’s “10 Billion RMB Subsidies” campaign, which is ongoing, led to a $2 billion increase in sales and marketing expenses to $3.9 billion, and those costs have been at 90% to 120% of revenue for the past two quarters, China Renaissance said.For the nation’s June 18 shopping festival, PDD provided a subsidy program with no cap across different product categories to push spending and attract more users. Other fast-growing Chinese startups -- including rival Meituan Dianping, ride-hailing app DiDi Chuxing and Starbucks Corp. competitor Luckin Coffee Inc. -- have also adopted subsidies strategies to maintain customer loyalty.Huang, 40, grew up in the eastern city of Hangzhou, where Alibaba has its headquarters. After receiving a degree at Zhejiang University, he went to the University of Wisconsin for a master’s in computer science. He began his career at Google in 2004 as a software engineer and returned to China in 2006 to help establish its operations in the country.He then became a serial entrepreneur. He started his first company in 2007, an e-commerce website called Ouku.com that he sold three years later after realizing it was too similar to thousands of others. He then launched Leqi, which helped companies market their services on websites like Alibaba’s Taobao or JD.com Inc., and a gaming firm that let users play on Tencent’s messaging app WeChat. Both took off and Huang found himself “financially free,” according to a 2017 interview.After getting an ear infection, he decided to retire in 2013 at age 33. But following a year of pondering what to do with his life -- he contemplated starting a hedge fund and moving to the U.S. -- he came up with the idea of combining e-commerce and social media. At the time, Alibaba dominated the online business, and WeChat became a must-have application on smartphones in China.The tables have turned since. In 2018, Alibaba launched a PDD-style app in an attempt to lure smaller-town users with bargains. It came months before Huang took his company public in New York, raising $1.63 billion in its July 2018 initial public offering. Since then, PDD has surged 389%, while Alibaba has gained just 13%.In 2017, Huang had said he was unlikely to spend the rest of his life at PDD. While he’s still chairman of the company, he now wants to give more responsibility to younger colleagues to keep the entrepreneurial spirit as PDD matures, he wrote in a letter to employees.“We envision Pinduoduo to be an organization that creates value for the public rather than being a showoff trophy for a few or carry too much personal color,” Huang said. “This will allow Pinduoduo to continually evolve with or without us one day.”(Updates PDD, Alibaba moves in 22nd paragraph.

2020-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese flexible display maker Royole Corp. is weighing an initial public offering in China while its planned U.S. listing is put on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.Royole had filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO that could raise about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. However, the startup is now considering a listing in China, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.Considerations are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made, the people said. A representative for Royole declined to comment on the matter.Royole, known for manufacturing the world’s first commercial foldable phone, had originally planned to raise funds via a private financing round at a valuation of about $8 billion, people familiar with that deal said last year. But the Chinese company turned to the U.S. markets after liquidity tightened during a downturn in China’s venture capital sector, the people said.Since January relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated sharply, with tensions spanning trade, technology and Hong Kong. Many U.S.-listed Chinese companies are considering second listings closer to home in Hong Kong, while China has been actively seeking to lure innovative technology companies to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Royole competes with Samsung Electronics Co. and BOE Technology Group Co. to produce bendable screens using cutting-edge organic light-emitting diode technology. The company, which gave away wraparound-screen hats at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, in January unveiled a smart speaker that packs a bendable display around a cylinder.Its full line of products encompasses head-mounted displays intended for use as so-called mobile theaters and other wearable flexible displays. The company even has a smart writing pad that it sells on Amazon.com, JD.com and in stores globally.Royole’s earlier investors include Knight Capital, IDG Capital, Poly Capital Management, AMTD Group, the funds of Chinese tycoon Xie Zhikun and the venture capital arm of the Shenzhen city government.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Display Maker Royole Said to Mull China IPO as U.S. Plans Stall
2020-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., one of China’s biggest drink makers, is weighing an initial public offering that could raise more than $1 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter.A listing could come as soon as next year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The beverage company is working with an adviser on preparations for the share sale, and has been considering Hong Kong among potential listing venues though no final decision has been made, they said.Founded in 1987 by entrepreneur Zong Qinghou, Wahaha has grown into a food and beverage giant with products ranging from bottled water, yogurt drinks and juice to instant noodles. The company has 80 production bases and employs about 30,000 workers, according to its website. Its products are available in more than 30 countries including Canada, Singapore and the U.S., the website said.Wahaha, which literally means a “laughing child” in Chinese, has signaled its intention for a listing last year as competition in China’s food and beverage market intensified. A listing would be “the right choice” and provide Wahaha with more resources, Kelly Zong, the founder’s daughter and an executive at the company, said in an interview with the 21st Century Herald in 2019. She didn’t provide details on preparations and timing.The company joins fellow Hangzhou-based beverage firm Nongfu Spring Co. in seeking a first-time share offering. The bottled water company filed for its Hong Kong IPO in late April and plans to raise about $1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News earlier.Chinese companies have become the force behind a surge in share sales in Hong Kong after a slow first quarter. JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. last month raised $7 billion through second listings in the financial hub.

2020-07-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Time will be the next frontier in India’s digital battlefield; dollars will follow the hours consumers spend online.India has left a void in their day by banning 59 Chinese apps after a border dispute with its northern neighbor led to violent clashes. The video-sharing platform TikTok, which became a craze in towns and villages as a medium of expression, is gone. So are its smaller cousins, like Bigo Live and Likee.What can fill the gap? Thanks to the world’s cheapest data charges of 9 cents per gigabyte, Indian smartphone users are guzzling content for six hours plus. For local startups like Glance, which offers games, news and video on the mobile lock-screen, the ban on Chinese competition is a chance to add to its tally of 100 million daily active users. The country’s youth bulge also makes it a perfect occasion for homegrown education technology unicorns like Byju to scale up.But the ultimate prize may go to super-apps that meld content and commerce in the 16 Indian languages besides English that boast anywhere between 5 million to half a billion speakers. To not have to download multiple apps to do different things will save phone memory, an important consideration for those who access the internet on low-end devices. Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, which offers everything from messaging to gaming and financial services, provides a successful template. Chinese users are also online for six hours a day, mostly to browse content, particularly social media. Although only 4% of their time is spent on e-commerce, it’s enough to drive $1.5 trillion in annual online sales. The smaller Indian market, with online sales of $40 billion, will want to copy the playbook.  The most obvious super-app candidate is billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms Ltd., a four-year-old startup with an equity value of $65 billion, including more than $15 billion recently raised from investors including Facebook Inc., KKR & Co. and Silver Lake Partners. Before Jio eventually seeks a listing on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, Ambani would probably want it ready as a carriage-content-and-commerce powerhouse for half-a-billion people.Jio’s 4G telecom service already has roughly 400 million subscribers, though they currently don’t even pay $2 a month. The trick to a $100 billion-plus initial public offering would lie in using the partnership with Facebook to introduce features such as the WeChat mini-program via the popular WhatsApp messaging service. It lets users book hotels, order taxis, explore augmented reality to try on a new L’Oreal beauty product, or test-drive a Tesla — without leaving WeChat. When it comes to building product awareness and interest, these embedded mini-apps in China are now a fourth as effective as regular online stores run by JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to McKinsey & Co. They will offer brands in India a chance to sell more — and more profitably — even in remote towns. The consulting firm found that younger consumers in smaller Chinese cities give more weight to advice from social-media influencers and referrals by friends than their counterparts in larger metropolitan areas. This will probably hold true for India as well. As for the actual commerce, JioMart, Ambani’s new e-commerce platform, would take orders and — if the regulator permits it — accept payments via WhatsApp. Staples could be delivered by traditional neighborhood stores, with Jio helping connect them to buyers. For discretionary products, Ambani may use his Reliance Retail Ltd., already the country’s largest bricks-and-mortar retailer. It won’t be too hard to grease the wheels of super-app commerce with credit. Local lenders will be desperate for a new source of balance-sheet expansion after absorbing inevitable losses from the pandemic and lockdown. Still, the road to satisfied digital customers will be long and bumpy because of India’s creaky infrastructure. Keeping users hooked with novel content will therefore be crucial. Facebook is building a new version of Quest virtual reality headsets; the Silicon Valley firm is also acquiring studios that make VR games. Jio, which wants its set-top box to support online gaming, could find opportunities for collaboration.However, the main entertainment fare will still be cricket and Bollywood. Last year, Ambani promised Jio First Day First Show — movies streamed to broadband customers on the day of their theater release. With Covid-19 shutting down cinemas, producers in India need digital alternatives; audiences need their fix.  Although Ambani appears to be ahead, his won’t be India’s only super-app. Amazon.com Inc. has pledged to invest $5.5 billion in the country, while Walmart Inc. has plowed in $16 billion to acquire local e-commerce leader Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Potentially, they — or Alphabet Inc.’s Google — could seek telecom and digital media partners.Western tech firms were broadly shut out of China’s digital revolution. In India, they’ll join the fray, hoping for insights that will come in handy in other emerging markets. But India will still prefer local control over the super-apps. Six hours a day of 1.3 billion people — and all the data that flows from it — is a coveted resource, something politicians won’t want slipping out of their sphere of influence. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-07-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Traveloka, Southeast Asia’s biggest online travel startup, is close to raising fresh funds at a private-market valuation of about $2.75 billion -- roughly 17% less than its most recent fundraising, according to people familiar with the matter.The Jakarta-based firm is in advanced negotiations with new strategic investors such as Siam Commercial Bank Pcl and Richard Li’s FWD Group Ltd., as well as existing backers GIC Pte. and East Ventures to secure about $250 million, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are private. The primary fundraising will be at a $2.75 billion valuation, while a secondary sale will be at $2.4 billion, one of the people said. Traveloka counts online travel site Expedia Group Inc. and JD.com Inc. among its existing backers.Terms of the fundraising could still change, they said. A Traveloka representative declined to comment.Traveloka, which has had its business hammered by the coronavirus fallout, is one of the first unicorns in Southeast Asia to experience a down-round -- raising funds at a lower valuation than the previous funding round. It reflects the sharp drop in business after lockdown orders halted flights and travel. Since the outbreak, the company has cut an unspecified number of positions, including about 80 jobs in Singapore in April.The travel industry is witnessing a sharp decline in business since the spread of the coronavirus. Expedia saw its total gross booking fall 39% in the first quarter, while its share price has dropped 21% this year. Vacation-rental startup Airbnb Inc. cut 25% of its workforce and raised an additional $2 billion in debt to help weather the downturn.Despite the slump, some Traveloka investors are betting on the travel industry’s eventual recovery, led by a rebound in tourism within countries, and a series of cost-cutting measures at the company, one of the people said. In Vietnam -- a model case in containing the pandemic with fewer than 400 cases and no deaths -- domestic travel has restarted.With a population of 570 million and growing middle class, Southeast Asia’s six largest economies are expected to see their online travel market more than double from $34 billion in 2019 to $78 billion in 2025, according to the most recent report by Google, Temasek and Bain released in October.Read more: Southeast Asia’s No. 1 Travel App Jumps on Fintech BandwagonSince its inception in 2012, Traveloka’s valuation climbed to $3.3 billion, according to the people. It has expanded across Southeast Asia, making it easier for consumers to book flights and hotels across countries. Like other startups in the region, Traveloka followed a popular playbook of providing multiple products and extending into financial services to complement its travel, accommodation and lifestyle offerings.Traveloka Chief Executive Officer Ferry Unardi said in an interview at the New Economy Forum in Beijing in November that the company is considering an initial public offering in Indonesia and in the U.S. in two to three years.Traveloka Looking to Grow Into Lifestyle, Financial Services: CEO (Video)(Adds forecast of Southeast Asia’s digital market in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Traveloka Nears Fundraising at Lower Valuation

2020-07-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s timing is frequently spot-on. Now, he’s signaling to a host of Chinese startups it’s time to race ahead with multi-billion-dollar stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic or trade war does more damage to the global economy.Ant Group, Ma’s financial services juggernaut, is seeking to raise about $10 billion in Hong Kong and potentially more in Shanghai for its initial public offering. That decision is likely to encourage smaller brethren to accelerate their own public debuts, catching markets at multi-year peaks and avoiding longer-term uncertainty. China has birthed more than a hundred startups valued at $1 billion or more in recent years, led by TikTok-parent ByteDance Ltd. and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.“The economy has its own timeline. Right now liquidity is available, but the Chinese and global economies are fraught with risk,” argues Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Adamas Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Everyone thus wants to strike now, while the iron is hot.”Chinese companies have raised $36 billion of share sales this year in Hong Kong alone and Ant’s IPO is almost certain to push that total past $45 billion. That raises questions over whether the greater China market is deep enough to sustain a flood of listings. Like a summer Hollywood blockbuster steamrolling smaller films, Ant’s enormous undertaking threatens to overshadow even the largest would-be debutantes.Bankers and investors say there’s no lack of eager buyers, at least for now. Ant is riding a swell of interest in the world’s No. 2 economy, which has sprung back faster than anticipated from the pandemic. A series of spectacular summer debuts -- chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. tripled on opening day -- demonstrate there’s ample money chasing outsized returns in an era of highly volatile markets.At least a dozen corporations are seeking to tap the well: Chinese search leader Baidu Inc. and Ctrip are said to be exploring secondary listings in Hong Kong. ByteDance, owner of viral video sensation TikTok, is a possible contender. Local media report Didi is about to kickstart its own IPO process in Hong Kong, though a spokeswoman denied that Wednesday. UBS estimates 42 U.S.-traded Chinese firms are qualified to list in Hong Kong over the next 12 months and could raise an estimated $27 billion assuming a 5% float.Ant will be the largest of that cohort, a potentially $200 billion-plus first-timer that’s likely to dwarf all peers apart from major backer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and arch-foe Tencent Holdings Ltd. Depending on when Ant floats -- it could be a matter of months if everything goes smoothly -- some may seek to get in ahead of the financial services titan or make sure they debut well after liquidity loosens again.“With China being the only major economy to offer clear growth prospects, the appetite for China related securities will only increase,” said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization. “Despite the large size of the Ant IPO, the pool of liquidity seeking acceptable returns is even larger.”Hong Kong and Shanghai have become red-hot IPO destinations in 2020, hosting household names from JD.com Inc. to SMIC in a span of months. China’s biggest corporations are selling stock closer to home after a proposed U.S. bill threatened to force its companies to delist from New York by imposing stricter disclosure requirements -- - a prospect that looks increasingly plausible as the Trump administration amps up action against its geopolitical rival. That will only contribute to the impending deluge.Ant’s float will create other unwelcome ripple effects. Share sales from Meituan, JD.com and Netease Inc. have all strained available capital and triggered consequent spikes in the Hong Kong dollar. Demand for the currency had already begun to swell Tuesday -- before Ant has even had a chance to pin down a timeframe.“There could be liquidity pressure in the short term,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB Kay Hian. “It’s likely for example that people will sell some of their shares in Alibaba to buy Ant.”There’re signs the city may not be fully equipped to handle the deluge. Since last year’s $13 billion secondary listing, Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock has drawn just a fraction of the trading activity it typically generates in New York, partly due to a local stamp duty that curbs high frequency trading. While the city led the world in listings last year, volume on the exchange is just about a quarter of its U.S. peers in dollar terms.Longer term, a growing roster of bona fide tech giants can only benefit the city’s exchange, diversifying its investment base while finally helping it fulfill its ambition of becoming the go-to destination for a new generation of technology enterprises. The Hong Kong exchange is now pushing out a series of efforts to increase liquidity and turnover.“While there might be liquidity pressure in the short term when Ant lists, it’s a good thing for Hong Kong in the longer run,” said Hong Kong-based Bernstein analyst David Dai.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Jack Ma Is Telling China’s Startup Founders It’s Time to Go Public
2020-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed MissFresh closed $495 million of financing from backers led by China International Capital Corp., underscoring strong investor interest in online commerce and groceries during the pandemic.The Beijing-based company also attracted Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s asset management arm, Tiger Global Management, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Abu Dhabi Capital, as one of several online services that thrived during nationwide lockdowns. The financing round was on track to value the startup at about $3 billion before investment, people familiar with the deal have said.Beijing MissFresh Ecommerce Co. -- one of dozens of startups Tencent backed during China’s internet boom -- is competing in a cash-burning sector with deeper-pocketed corporations including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. Consumers sheltering at home during the pandemic have reinvigorated a once-difficult groceries arena, and Missfresh now needs ammunition to attack a Chinese online fresh foods sector that could reach $178 billion by 2025.The company, founded in 2014, has more than 1,500 mini-warehouses that promise deliveries as fast as within an hour, it said in a statement last year. Missfresh had nearly 25 million monthly active users as of May last year. It handled 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of transactions in 2018 and had generated positive cash flow by the end of that year, the company said at the time.China Renaissance served as the exclusive financial adviser on its latest deal. The funding will help tide Missfresh over in an uncertain venture capital environment. VC funding plummeted at the start of 2020 with investors stranded at home and increasingly risk-averse.But online commerce is one sector that continues to draw investor attention. Investors including Tencent and private equity giant Primavera Capital are pitching in on a separate funding round that values rival Xingsheng Youxuan at $3 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.Excluding the latest effort, MissFresh has raised nearly $900 million since its inception via eight funding rounds from investors including Jeneration Group and Genesis Capital, the company has said.Read more: Tencent, Primavera Said to Fund Grocery App at $3 Billion ValueFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",CICC Leads $495 Million Funding for Tencent-Backed MissFresh
2020-07-24,"Back on April 6, I wrote about how Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock would be a winner in the Covid-19 era. In the three-plus months since that column was published, Alibaba stock is up over 20% and recently made new all-time highs.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com It's always scary buying a stock near all-time highs. However, I believe Alibaba stock has a number of long-term bullish catalysts. In addition, it's valuation is much more attractive than that of its  U.S. counterparts, potentially limiting its potential decline. Here are six reasons to buy Alibaba stock. 1&#92;. Alibaba Stock Is China's E-Commerce LeaderAs of mid-2019, Alibaba was by far the leading e-commerce market share leader in China. Alibaba holds a 55.9% share of total retail sales in China, according to Statista. Alibaba has roughly three times the market share of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which is a distant second with  a 16.7% share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo put that in perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has only about a 44% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, according to Bank of America.China is the world's second-largest economy and is growing at a much faster pace than the U.S.. China also has more than four times the population of the U.S. If you are bullish on China's e-commerce sector, Alibaba stock is the best play.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever  2&#92;. Live-StreamingWithin the e-commerce space, live streaming is an emerging marketing method.&quot;The live-streaming format offers consumers interactive shopping experiences, entertainment values that do not come with traditional shopping experiences, and access to exclusive discounts that are not available elsewhere,&quot; Needham analyst Vincent Yu says.Yu is bullish on live streaming as an e-commerce marketing tool and says Alibaba's Taobao Live is the gold standard of e-commerce marketing in China. Taobao's sales model involves live streamers promoting products and offering promotions and discounts to viewers. Viewers click on links provided by the streamers to purchase products from Alibaba's Tmall or Taobao platforms. In return, the streamers receive commissions on their sales. 3&#92;. Local Delivery ServicesAlibaba's Ele.me delivery service is the second-largest delivery platform in China. Market leader Meituan Delivery is the top delivery service in China with 67% market share. However. Ele.me is a solid second at 32%, according to Needham. In other words, Alibaba is part of a delivery duopoly in China. Yu says Alibaba has been closing the market share gap with Meituan since the Covid-19 outbreak.Ele.me is currently focused only on food delivery and has about 90 million monthly active users. Yu says Alibaba stock should benefit from the Alipay App driving its more than 700 million active users toward Ele.me over time. 4&#92;. Cloud ServicesAlibaba's AliCloud cloud services business is the clear market leader in China, with market share of about 46%. Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have risen to more than $1.5 trillion market capitalizations due to the digital transformation of the U.S. economy. Alibaba stock is headed in the same direction, but China's economy is growing a lot faster than the U.S. economy. Last quarter, Alibaba reported $1.72 billion of cloud revenue, up 58% from a year ago. That high-margin cloud revenue will continue to boost the company's overall gross margins over the long-term. And you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who expects cloud services' growth to slow anytime soon. 5&#92;. Ant FinancialAnt Financial is the company behind Alipay, one of the most popular mobile payment apps in China. In addition, the company has been growing its wealth management and lending business in recent years. Alibaba holds a 33% stake in Ant, which recently announced plans to go public in both Shanghai and Hong Kong.At this point, the pricing of Ant's initial public offering is unclear. However, analysts estimate the company could fetch a $210 billion valuation. That valuation suggests Alibaba's stake is valued at about $70 billion. Even a conservative $150 billion valuation estimate represents a value of $19 per share for Alibaba. 6&#92;. Alibaba Stock Is UndervaluedIt's rare to find a stock near its all-time highs that is still undervalued. However, Alibaba stock might be an exception. The shares are valued at an enterprise multiple of just 24.5, making them attractive, especially compared to Amazon which has a 39.3 enterprise multiple. That valuation gap has widened in recent months as U.S. investors seem to realize how much Amazon's business is benefiting from Covid-19.&quot;We think Alibaba's market-leading position in the e-commerce segment, the new retail segment, and the cloud computing segment, which all benefited from the Covid-19 outbreak and the secular shift in consumer behavior post-Covid-19, should drive Alibaba's multiple expansion following Amazon,&quot; Yu says.Based on a sum-of-the parts valuation, Needham has a &quot;buy&quot; rating and a $275 price target on Alibaba stock.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-07-27,"(Bloomberg) -- A new index focused on China’s technology giants is set to give investors greater access to their growing dominance in Hong Kong’s market.The Hang Seng Tech Index, which launched Monday with backdated prices, tracks the 30 largest tech companies listed in the city, including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp. Tracking the gauge this year would have returned 44% for investors, versus a loss of 13% for the Hang Seng Index. The tech measure fell 1.3% Monday.“All the conditions are now ready for large China tech stocks whether in China or already listed elsewhere,” Vincent Kwan, chief executive officer of index compiler Hang Seng Indexes Co., said on Bloomberg Television Monday.The move comes at a time when further listings of Chinese technology firms are in the pipeline, such as Jack Ma’s Ant Group, following those of NetEase Inc. and JD.com Inc. Listing closer to home has become more attractive as tensions between Washington and Beijing threaten to curtail Chinese companies’ access to U.S. capital markets.The compiler of the Hang Seng Index has already embraced change through moves such as scrapping a weighting limit for dual-class shares on some of its gauges. The tech index is seen helping investors bridge a gap between a Hong Kong benchmark overstuffed with old economy banks and insurers, and the technology companies that have emerged as big winners in the city’s beaten-down market.“There are too many laggards in the Hang Seng Index,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong. “With overseas-listed Chinese firms deciding to list closer-to-home, the Hong Kong market falls short in terms of having a representative index for these stocks. This new index serves to fill this gap and drive capital flows.”Citi analysts led by Pierre Lau wrote in a recent note that the index will attract investors to other Hong Kong tech stocks, facilitate the issuance of index-linked funds and derivatives as well as boost turnover at Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. That stock is up 40% this year, most in the Hang Seng Index.Supported by strong mainland inflows through stock connect links, Chinese technology shares have emerged as big winners in Hong Kong this year. Tencent has surged 38% while Meituan is up 82%.The Hang Seng Index, on the other hand, has underperformed. Nearly half of its members have fallen at least 20% this year.Morgan Stanley sees the new technology gauge providing a bigger sentiment boost near-term to the MSCI China Index than the Hang Seng, which has few components that will also be in the tech index. “The direct stock-level positives cannot translate into a meaningful index-level boost,” analysts led by Laura Wang wrote.(Updates Monday’s prices throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Hang Seng Debuts New Index of Benchmark-Beating Tech Stocks
2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. has offered to buy out and take private search engine Sogou Inc. in a $2.1 billion deal, adding to a slew of Chinese technology giants seeking to delist from U.S. bourses.Shares of the social media heavyweight climbed as much as 4.7% Tuesday, buoyed by speculation it will more closely integrate Sogou’s AI technology with its own services and devices to gain an edge on rivals like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd.Tencent has in past years come under pressure from ByteDance and other up-and-coming rivals in the emergent short-video arena. Beijing-based Sogou -- whose name translates as “search dog” -- has long been the default in a slew of Tencent products including its marquee social app WeChat. It’s also been making a push into artificial intelligence.A takeover of Sogou also raises the prospect of a lucrative listing in Hong Kong or Shanghai in the future, on the heels of well-received debuts by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. It’s become an increasingly attractive route for tech giants such as Jack Ma’s Ant Group, which is speeding toward what could be the city’s biggest float in years. Sogou Chief Executive Officer Wang Xiaochuan in 2018 declared his ambition to list on mainland bourses when regulations permit.Chinese internet companies are exploring listings closer to home after a proposed U.S. bill threatened to force them to delist from New York by imposing stricter disclosure requirements -- a prospect that looks increasingly plausible as the Trump administration amps up action against Beijing on multiple fronts. Online gaming company Changyou.com Ltd. got taken private this year by Sohu.com Ltd., and 58.com Inc. is being bought out by a private equity consortium for $8.7 billion.The “market has been anticipating more companies to pursue secondary listing in Hong Kong,” Jefferies analysts led by Thomas Chong wrote. “We consider there will be more synergies between Sogou and Tencent in search and smart devices in the future.”What Blomberg Intelligence SaysTencent’s return to the search engine business may pose a challenge to China leader Baidu, and help fend off competition from potential market entrants ByteDance and Alibaba. Tencent sold search engine Soso to Sogou in 2013. Its bid to buy the 61% of Sogou it doesn’t yet own at $9 per ADS will cost more than $2 billion.&#92;- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Tencent is offering $9 in cash for each American depositary share it doesn’t already hold in Sogou, backed by fellow internet giant Sohu. That’s a 57% premium to the target company’s Friday close. Sogou said in a statement it was considering the takeover offer, though Tencent already owns about 39.2% of Sogou but controls a majority of voting power.Sogou, founded in 2005 and merged with Tencent’s Soso search business in 2013, has counted on its partnership with the larger company to help it catch search leader Baidu Inc. Its 2017 IPO also helped bankroll a longer-term AI effort -- about three quarters of its employees are now involved in research and development, according to its website.Sohu’s shares gained 40% in New York, their most in a decade, while Sogou leapt a record 48% to close the gap with the offer price.(Updates with Tencent share action from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Offers $2.1 Billion for Chinese Search Giant Sogou
2020-07-29,"(Bloomberg) -- When the coronavirus put a halt on people’s lives in China in February, Justin Jin’s old university classmates thought about selling face masks to make money. The 21-year-old suggested they instead try their luck with two stocks: Tesla Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.That’s when Jin’s two friends began using the Futubull app, one of the Chinese platforms that allow mainland investors to buy foreign equities. The decision paid off. Both stocks soared as part of a global rally that has enticed a wave of novice investors.“When I first started, there were only three or four friends who used Futu,” Jin said. “Now there are at least three or four dozen.”Thanks to them and many others, Futu Holdings Ltd., a Chinese online brokerage and wealth-management platform, now counts more than 1 million registered users, a 23% increase from the first quarter. Its American depositary receipts have almost quadrupled since a low in March, propelling the fortune of its founder and chairman, Leaf Hua Li, to $1.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tencent EmployeeLi, 43, was Tencent’s 18th founding employee and left to start Futu after growing frustrated with the software he used to trade Hong Kong stocks, according to a CapitalWatch interview in January. The online broker, backed by the Chinese internet giant, was formally incorporated under Hong Kong law in April 2012. Li owns 40% of its outstanding shares.A company spokesman declined to comment on Li’s net worth.Retail investors have always been a driving force in China’s stock market, but with the pandemic keeping people home, more amateur traders have emerged. Futu reported a 60% surge in new paying clients -- those with assets in their trading accounts -- in the first quarter, with much of it coming from Hong Kong. Big-name stocks like Tencent, Tesla and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fueled the surge during the peak of China’s coronavirus crisis in February, according to a statement.One of Futu’s main draws is that, unlike mainland competitors, it has licenses that allow users to go beyond the domestic market and buy equities from the U.S. and Hong Kong. This year’s high-profile secondary listings in the city from JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. have enticed more investors, as has the months-long rebound in U.S. stocks, according to Bank of China International analyst Nanyang He.“Futu has benefited from strong market sentiments in terms of raising trading velocity and increasing IPO subscription revenue,” He said.Shares SurgeFutu shares have risen 148% since the company listed in New York in March 2019, outpacing rival Up Fintech Holding Ltd., which went public the same month.While the competition is rife -- Chinese brokerage firm Huatai Securities Co. just launched its own U.S. stock-trading app -- Futu is betting on the increasing number of Chinese citizens looking to diversify their investments globally, He said. The company started a series of MSCI index futures products this month.Li began his career at Tencent after receiving a bachelor’s degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University in 2000. He was an early researcher of the QQ messaging software and founded Tencent Video, now one of the largest video-streaming platforms in China.Li credits his time at Tencent for building his business acumen and said he was inspired by the company’s founders, Pony Ma and Zhang Zhidong, according to the CapitalWatch interview. Tencent remains Futu’s largest institutional backer, and several of its employees were key in helping the online broker grow over the past decade.Still, Li hopes he’ll ultimately be defined by his legacy at Futu.“For a long time, people wondered why I left Tencent at its peak of growth,” Li said in the interview. “Now that Futu has made it, the weight of importance has changed.”(Updates share move since IPO in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Founder Hits Jackpot Thanks to China’s Love of Stock Trading
2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. pulled off a strong quarter in China by switching up retail tactics and pushing a cheaper iPhone, becoming one of the few U.S. tech giants to ride the country’s post-pandemic recovery despite Washington-Beijing tensions.IPhone shipments there surged a surprising 35% in the April to June period, research firm Canalys estimates, driving a 2% rise in Greater China revenue to $9.3 billion. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said sales actually grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, propelled by demand for Macs and iPads from millions now accustomed to working from home. Its out-performance in Greater China -- Apple’s single biggest international market -- drove quarterly revenue well above Wall Street’s forecasts.Apple’s strength in the world’s No. 2 economy surprised analysts who’ve seen local consumers turn increasingly to homegrown brands, at a time Washington accuses the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and ByteDance Ltd. of spying or jeopardizing national security. Huawei -- the company most squarely in Trump’s cross-hairs -- eclipsed Samsung Electronics Co. in global smartphone sales for the first time last quarter, thanks in large part to an upswell of home-crowd support.Apple, whose Chinese-based suppliers employ upwards of a million people, was swift to adapt its tactics after Covid-19 emerged in February, turning to third-party distributors after shutting most of its stores. It also focused on marketing and selling online, tapping the surge of internet activity that followed a rolling nationwide lockdown.The iPhone maker jumped aboard a plethora of online sales promotions hosted by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. in June, traditionally one of several peak spending months. Apple moved more than 500 million yuan ($72 million) of devices in a single day during JD’s “6.18” shopping marathon, the Chinese company said. It probably also benefited from the introduction of a lower-cost smartphone, the iPhone SE.“Apple defied expectations in Q2. Its new iPhone SE was critical in the quarter,” Canalys analyst Vincent Thielke said. “Apple is also demonstrating skills in new user acquisition.”Read more: Apple Smashes Revenue, IPhone Estimates on Pandemic DemandFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Blockbuster Quarter Boosted by Strong Sales in China
2020-07-31,"Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com has bought a stake in the century-old supply chain manager Li & Fung, in a strategic partnership that marries 21st century digital technology with one of the world's largest logistics and supply chain networks.JD.com has subscribed for US$100 million worth of Li & Fung's newly issued shares at HK$1.25 each, the Hong Kong-based supply chain manager said in a statement, adding that the Fung family will retain control of 60 per cent of the company's voting rights. As part of the agreement, Li & Fung will seek to increase its business in China by partnering with JD.com on private-label initiatives for the Chinese domestic market, the company said.The investment also will help accelerate the development of the 114-year-old company's end-to-end digital supply chain, known as the &quot;supply chain of the future&quot;, by partnering with JD.com, Li & Fung said.&quot;Our goal to create the supply chain of the future and to improve the lives of one billion people in our global supply chain remains more relevant than ever in this turbulent world,&quot; Spencer Fung, Li & Fung's chief executive and great-grandson of its founder, said in a statement.The investment came just over two months after Li & Fung delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange following a privatisation by a consortium of investors, led by the Fung family and Singapore logistics assets investor GLP. The company paid HK$1.25 per share to buy back its listed stock, listed in Hong Kong since 1992.Last month, JD.com raised US$3.8 billion in a secondary listing in Hong Kong, as part of spate of fundraising by Chinese tech companies in the city amid worsening US-China relations.Li & Fung Group logo photographed in Lai Chi Lok in Hong Kong on 22 August 2018.

Photo Edmond SoJD.com's alliance with Li & Fung comes at a difficult time for the supply chain manager, whose fortune over more than a century had been intricately connected with Hong Kong's geopolitical role as the midway stop between China and the rest of the world.Escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing - and tit-for-tat tariffs as part of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies - forced companies to dramatically revamp their supply chains, including shifting manufacturing from mainland China. At the same time, the global coronavirus pandemic has roiled economies around the globe for much of this year and dramatically cut into consumer demand.Spencer Fung, Li & Fung's chief executive, wants to digitise the company's supply chain management process to better adapt to the changing consumer environment.

It employs about 17,000 people in more than 230 offices around the world and operates distribution centres across 40 different markets.Li & Fung worked for years to digitise its supply chain management process as it saw its core customer base - bricks-and-mortar retailers - hit hard by the rise of online shopping and slowing economic growth in recent years.The company said the JD.com alliance &quot;fits well&quot; with its goal of digitising its supply chain management process, given the tech giant has developed its own &quot;proprietary supply chain technologies&quot; and &quot;created digital retail and supply chain platforms that are fully integrated to support its omnichannel strategies&quot;.&quot;This partnership is one of the important initiatives in JD's digital supply chain,&quot; the e-commerce giant said in a statement. &quot;Li & Fung is a leader in global supply chain with expertise in international trade and private label, while JD has developed unique capabilities in digital technologies as well as retail infrastructure.&quot;This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-08-06,"With some help from the e-commerce boom, which itself is benefiting from the coronavirus pandemic, internet exchange-traded funds are soaring this year.What HappenedThat theme isn't confined to U.S borders as some of this year's best-performing emerging markets ETFs are heavy on e-commerce and online retail fare. On the geared side of the ledger, there's the high-flying Direxion Daily CSI China Internet Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: CWEB).CWEB, which looks to deliver double the daily returns of the CSI Overseas China Internet Index, jumped 4.26% on Wednesday on above-average volume, extending its one-week gain to almost 16%. No, leveraged ETFs shouldn't be held for more than a few days, but CWEB's 90-day return of almost 120% is sure to attract some traders.Why It's Important Recently bullishness in the only leveraged ETF focusing on Chinese internet stocks is built on solid fundamentals, plenty of which stem from the pandemic.&quot;The performance differential between online and offline retail in China has been stark during the coronavirus pandemic, with e-tail sales of goods continuing to rise even as total retail sales have fallen,&quot; said Fitch Ratings in a recent note.Data support the notion as in the U.S., Chinese e-commerce giants are benefiting from shutdowns, but there's also reason to believe this trend will prove durable, meaning CWEB bears monitoring over the remainder of 2020.&quot;Official lockdowns and public fears about exposure to the coronavirus favoured online retailers and contributed to weaker footfall at shopping locations in the first half of the year. However, e-tailing has continued to outperform even as overall consumer spending has recovered,&quot; according to Fitch.What's Next CWEB's underlying index allocates over 18% of its combined weight to Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY) and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), but other components are benefiting from China's shift to online retail.&quot;The trend should provide underlying support for the ratings of companies that are able to engage with and benefit from the shift towards online retail,&quot; said Fitch. &quot;For example, home appliance producer Midea Group maintained a compound average annual growth in online sales of over 42% during 2016-2019, with online sales accounting for 25% of its total in 2019. This has provided support to its revenue growth, market share and cash flow.&quot;Roughly 39% of CWEB's index's holdings are dedicated online retailers while close to another 40% have leverage to the shelter-in-place trade.See more from Benzinga  * KraneShares Jumps Into ESG ETF Fray With New China Fund  * 3 Exciting China ETFs For A Hot Summer  * A China ETF Proving Its Potency As A Coronavirus Play(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-07,Opportunities to profit in IPOs and other Chinese stocks could recede under a new Trump policy and growing U.S.-China tensions. TikTok and Alibaba's Ant Group are just two examples.,Chances For Americans To Invest In Chinese Stocks 'TikTok' Down As U.S.-China Rift Grows
2020-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- With the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump made his strategic fight with China hit home for potentially billions of people -- generating confusion, panic and fear around the globe.The U.S. president’s move to ban the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat in just over six weeks from now sent shockwaves through the tech industry and the many American businesses who rely on the apps to sell goods in China.The decision also spurred alarm on Chinese social media, with WeChat users in the U.S. posting contact information so friends and family could reach them if the app disappeared. An online forum popular with stock investors asked users if they would give up their iPhones or WeChat if Apple Inc. eliminated the app from its store: They voted to ditch their phones by a margin of 20 to one.Of all Trump’s shots against China, from imposing tariffs to battling Huawei Technologies Co. to ending Hong Kong’s special trading status, the executive orders against TikTok and WeChat potentially have the widest impact. Beyond the financial blow, they threaten to sever communication links among the people of the world’s biggest economies in addition to spurring a decoupling of the tech industry that could ripple around the world.“This move points to a hegemonic war -- the U.S. is trying to suppress China’s rise as a super power,” said Yik Chan Chin, who researches global media and communications policy at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. “All these things will leave a bad impression in China, and the tide of nationalism is already very high right now.”It’s hard to overstate how ingrained WeChat and Tencent are in China and among its diaspora: WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users and is owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd., is relied upon so heavily that many people have never exchanged phone numbers or emails. From Wal-Mart Inc. and Starbucks Corp. to the NBA and Nike Inc., nearly every major American consumer brand with business in China is deeply intertwined with Tencent and its network, which includes WeChat and investee JD.com.Jason Gui, co-founder of San Francisco-based startup Vue Smart Glasses, said his team has to rely on WeChat to communicate with suppliers in China and a ban would be very “disruptive.” Emails sent to manufacturers in China are often unanswered for days, whereas inquiries through WeChat will get immediate attention, he said.“When the U.S. imposes these bans, they may not realize how intertwined the relationships between U.S. and China have become,” he said. “Our communication lifeline with China depends on WeChat. It hurts small businesses that have limited resources to figure out how to circumvent these bans.”‘Hot War’China officially reacted with caution on Friday, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin defending the companies and saying the U.S. “is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses.” Just a day earlier, Foreign Minister Wang Yi tried to offer an olive branch by urging the U.S. to “reject decoupling” and stop “any attempt to artificially create a so-called ‘new Cold War.’” Yang Jiechi, a Politburo member, said the door for talks with the U.S. is still open.Trump’s administration has stepped up its campaign against China in recent weeks, betting that a hard line against Beijing will help him win November’s election despite upsetting millions of younger TikTok users. The U.S. also announced on Friday it is placing sanctions on 11 Chinese officials and their allies in Hong Kong, including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, over their role in curtailing political freedoms in the former U.K. colony.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo meanwhile has urged American companies to bar Chinese applications from their app stores, part of his “Clean Network” guidance designed to prevent China from accessing the personal data of U.S. citizens. Pompeo’s comments have generated alarm in China. Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, suggested a division of the internet that stifles commerce and ties between people would prompt the risk of a “hot war” to rise.But for many U.S. officials, the bans are simple reciprocity. China walled off its own online sphere years ago, creating an alternate universe where Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. stood in for Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Yet while President Xi Jinping was an early proponent of cyber-sovereignty, China’s view has changed as its tech champions have become fierce global competitors. By banning certain apps, the U.S. is also looking to deprive China of valuable data that is essential for honing the algorithms that will fuel the modern economy powered by artificial intelligence.The U.S. also potentially has a lot to lose in terms of soft power. Beyond angering the roughly 5 million Chinese Americans, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in America, there’s also the risk that other countries start to ban U.S. technology.‘Awful for America’“Pretty much any large country can kick out Facebook and make their own social network if they want to legislate that,” said Matthew Brennan, managing director of marketing consultancy China Channel. “That would be awful for America. But that’s the road we’re going towards with this kind of legislation.”While the short-term economic impact won’t be large, the decoupling of the tech industries will ultimately lead to slower global growth in the long run, according to Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. And they could ultimately be more significant than the trade deal, which is one of the few areas of cooperation that remain.“These sorts of measures on technology are as serious if not more serious than tariffs because these are the growth industries of the futures,” Roache said. “Once you erect barriers how do you take them down? That’s the question.”(Updates with Hong Kong sanctions detail in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump’s WeChat Ban Brings Cold War With China Into a Billion Homes

2020-08-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. threat to delist Chinese companies just got a lot more real. Yet businesses from Asia’s biggest economy continue to line up to sell shares on American exchanges — and are thriving. What’s going on?The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets has told U.S. exchanges to set rules that would require companies to grant American regulators access to their audit work papers, something that China has refused to allow. Firms already listed will have until Jan. 1, 2022, to comply, with removal from U.S. exchanges the ultimate penalty. Those seeking to sell shares will need to adhere to the new rules, according to the high-powered group of U.S. regulators, which includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.You might think this ratcheting up of pressure, which reflects increasing geopolitical tensions and the fallout from accounting scandals at Chinese companies such as Luckin Coffee Inc., would put a damper on the rush of enterprises looking to go public. Anything but. Almost every day, it seems, another Chinese company announces plans to list in the U.S. — and they’re finding no shortage of takers. Late last month, Beijing-based electric-car maker Li Auto Inc. raised $1.1 billion selling shares in an initial public offering that priced above the marketed range. It was the biggest IPO by a Chinese company in New York since Shanghai-based rival NIO Inc. sold $1.15 billion of stock in September 2018. Xpeng Motors, based in Guangzhou, is poised to follow this month.Shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also outperforming the broader market. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has surged 30% this year, compared with a 3.7% gain for the S&P 500.The phenomenon may be partly the product of a craze in day-trading fueled by pandemic lockdowns, which have left many Americans stuck at home looking for amusement. If the Robinhood crowd can drive shares of bankrupt companies to illogical heights, then why not Chinese stocks, too?On a more rational level, some investors may be betting that threats to delist Chinese companies are largely noise, and a compromise will eventually be worked out. Chinese listings are a gravy train for the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and both sides have a financial interest in ensuring that it doesn't get derailed.On this point, it’s worth noting that the U.S. regulators left some wiggle room. Chinese companies can hire a “co-auditor,” effectively having a second inspection performed by a U.S. accounting firm after a Chinese affiliate does the first. That would be a potential workaround for Beijing’s rules that prevent the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board from reviewing audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies.To count on peace breaking out may be rash, though. There’s plenty of evidence that the move toward a U.S.-China decoupling is serious and tangible. Just look at the lengthening list of U.S.-traded Chinese companies that are selling shares in Hong Kong, giving them a secondary outlet into international capital markets in the event that they are forced to leave: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. among them.Or witness Tencent Holdings Ltd., which lost $30 billion of market value in Hong Kong on Friday after the Trump administration moved to ban U.S. residents from doing business via its WeChat app. It will be a brave investor who bets on this trend reversing itself.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-08-17,"Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc (NASDAQ: JD) has acquired a controlling stake in Chinese express transport company Kuayue Express Group for 3 billion yuan ($432 million). JD Logistics, the logistics arm of JD.com, will now work with Kuayue Express, a firm regarded as a front-runner in &quot;limited-time express service&quot; — integral to JD.com's idea of same- and next-day delivery. &quot;Kuayue Express is a reliable delivery services provider and industry leader in express courier services with innovative technology and advanced operations,&quot; said Wang Zhenhui, CEO of JD Logistics. &quot;Collaborating with Kuayue Express advances our integrated supply chain management, technology initiatives and service expansion to third-party merchants.&quot;During the filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), JD.com stated that it would acquire existing shares from Kuayue Express and also buy the company's newly issued shares. Kuayue Express was valued at over $2.9 billion but has since struggled with cash flow. Before JD.com's announcement, market speculation since May was about courier company ZTO considering acquiring a stake in Kuayue Express.Shenzhen-based Kuayue Express has over 50,000 employees, 13 chartered cargo planes and 17,000 trucks, handling more than 300,000 orders daily across 500 cities in China. The company was one of the earliest to offer same- and next-day delivery options in the country, since its inception in 2007. &quot;The cooperation between Kuayue Express and JD Logistics is expected to rewrite the current competitive pattern of China's logistic market,&quot; Kuayue Express said in a statement on WeChat. For JD.com, this acquisition would build on its idea of scaling up from an e-commerce company to one that can exercise control over end-to-end supply chain operations. The company already operates futuristic warehouses with a high degree of automation and runs its own last-mile delivery fleets — while delivering everything from fresh food to electronics. However, the Chinese e-retail market is heavily competitive, with JD.com's rival Alibaba strengthening its logistics capabilities of late. Alibaba's affiliate Cainiao Network is the world's second-largest cross-border cargo carrier. This helps Alibaba cover its international mid-mile transport needs, while also gaining sizable control over the delivery experience it provides its overseas customers. This year, JD.com has been active in acquiring companies aside from building its own fleets, having bought a $100 million stake in Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based supply chain management firm for primarily U.S. and European brands. This partnership will help JD.com push its e-commerce platform further into Western markets, where it has had less reach compared to its presence in China. Since successfully mitigating the spread of COVID-19, China has rebounded to nearly pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. The widespread quarantine and lockdown of Chinese cities meant more e-commerce sales, which saw a 19% increase in Q1 2020 compared to the same quarter last year, while offline sales dropped by 13% in the same period. ***Recent from Vishnu Rajamanickam  PowerFleet secures COVID-19 healthcare supplies across Africa  Delivering envelopes to refrigerators, all in a few hours  Lead times longer, sourcing patterns in disarray due to COVID-19 volatilitySee more from Benzinga  * Alphabet-Backed Startup To Build Self-Driving 'Road Of The Future'  * Record Heat Wave Continues In Western U.S. (With Forecast Video)  * NFI Acquires CAI Logistics, Non-Asset Division In Intermodal, Flatbed And Marine(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company has opened its technology and infrastructure to partners, brands and other sectors, as part of its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation across a range of industries. JD.com is the largest retailer in China, a member of the NASDAQ100 and a Fortune Global 500 company.Non-GAAP MeasuresIn evaluating the business, the company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements, gain on sale of development properties and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements and non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain and foreign exchange impact in relation to sale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital expenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the periods, including the dilutive effect of share-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two.The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company’s core operating results and business outlook.The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company’s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.CONTACTS:Investor Relations  Ruiyu Li  Senior Director of Investor Relations  +86 (10) 8912-6804  IR@JD.comMedia  +86 (10) 8911-6155  Press@JD.com     Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. unveiled better-than-expected revenue and a major investment from Hillhouse Capital, after China’s second-biggest e-commerce firm rode a bounce-back in spending across its online malls.Shares in JD rose 7.9% in New York after it reported a 34% jump in sales to 201.05 billion yuan ($29 billion) in the June quarter, its fastest pace of revenue growth since 2017. The company also disclosed its JD Health division would get more than $830 million from Hillhouse -- the investment firm founded by Zhang Lei with money from Yale University -- through the purchase of Series B preference shares. The funds will also be used to strengthen its pharmacy supply chain.The company’s out-performance provides more evidence that China’s economy is among the world’s fastest to recover from the pandemic, aided by strict virus control measures and a rebound in industry output and consumer sentiment. Both JD and larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. racked up record sales during the annual “6.18” shopping extravaganza this year, as heavy discounting drew shoppers who had delayed purchases during the worst of Covid-19. Annual active customers grew 30% to 417 million, the quickest rate of expansion in more than two years.The continued shift toward e-commerce has benefited JD, which is expanding into smaller towns and tapping on strategies like live-streaming to reach new customers and fend off growing competition from the likes of ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin.”Our supermarket category, including FMCG and fresh produce, became the single largest product category as revenue in the first half of 2020, surpassing mobile phone, home appliance, home computers,” Chief Financial Officer Sandy Ran Xu told analysts on a post-earnings call.Read more: First Into the Virus Slump, China Is Proving the Fastest OutWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysOperations in 2Q benefited from pent-up consumer demand due to China’s 1Q lockdown, and strong sales at the company’s “6.18” anniversary promotion, which won’t recur in 3Q. However, the rapid gain of users from lower-tier cities could drive a sustained increase in long-term demand in categories such as consumer goods, fresh produce, household and health-care products.&#92;- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Hillhouse had backed JD before its IPO. The transaction will close in the current quarter, and the retailer will remain the majority shareholder of JD Health, according to the statement.JD completed a second listing in Hong Kong in June, raising $3.9 billion to build its logistics and delivery network. That self-operated web of warehouses, personnel and transport links proved instrumental in controlling shipping during the worst of the pandemic, when nationwide lockdowns snarled supply lines. The shares jumped as much as 8.6% in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Chinese retail suffered a record collapse in the first three months of 2020 but has since bounced back, though concerns remain about the strength and sustainability of domestic consumption.“While the YoY growth rate for electronic and home appliance products is expected to normalize in 3Q20, we expect the momentum for general merchandise to persist, as the demand for consumer goods remained strong in July even without promotion,” Bocom International analysts led by Brandy Sun wrote.(Updates with shares and analyst’s comments from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","JD.com Sales Beat, Scores $830 Million Hillhouse Investment"

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A doubling of revenue coupled with a 263% surge in Sea Ltd.’s shares aren’t enough to make the Southeast Asian internet company profitable, but they do provide something almost as important: opportunity.Investors seem besotted with Sea, propelling it to a $69 billion market value despite its net loss widening 41% from a year earlier in the second quarter. Analysts, overwhelmingly bullish with 14 buy ratings to two sell calls, don’t even expect the games and e-commerce company to post net income this year or next.Once known as Garena, Singapore-based Sea gets 44% of sales from digital entertainment such as online games and 41% from e-commerce and other services. The rest comes from direct sales of products. Those have proven to be great businesses to be in during a pandemic when customers are cooped up at home bored, hungry and in desire of some retail therapy. It doesn’t matter whether I believe Sea is worth as much as Target Corp., Square Inc. or even Airbus SE — investors do. And that means others probably have the same confidence.Sea’s stock price gives it a valuable currency. Management could seize this moment to undertake some strategic acquisitions and plug possible holes in its product offering. It can use its market value to do share deals, or sell equity or convertibles to fund them.Among the areas to explore is logistics. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. saw the value of investing in their own logistics supply chain. Both now view that as a competitive advantage.Sea might do well to follow the same path. Revenue from its e-commerce business climbed 120% from a year earlier, and 37% from the prior quarter, driven by pandemic demand. Importantly, its take rate — the amount Sea receives from each dollar of orders — expanded 1.8 percentage points to 6.4%. Admittedly, that boost was fueled in part by a 73% increase in sales and marketing expenses.This momentum, if sustainable, could justify taking a punt on logistics through a joint venture, minority stake, outright acquisition or even building from scratch. Management declined to answer multiple questions about M&A in a conference call Tuesday night.Sea’s success in games, and the huge potential for growth as Southeast Asia’s high-speed mobile penetration expands with a 5G rollout, makes the purchase of games studios another worthwhile bet. Tencent Holdings Ltd., a backer of Sea, deployed that strategy well with investments in Supercell Oy and Riot Games Inc. The upside of owning your own titles is twofold: taking a greater cut of revenue, and being able to license them to external parties (the risk is developing games that flop and lose money).Finally, there’s payments, a new area for which Sea has great hopes. This is fast becoming a crowded field, with both Gojek and Grab Holdings Inc. keen to stake out their own territory. Ant Group’s pending Hong Kong listing, with a possible $150 billion valuation, is all the incentive Sea needs to take this business seriously. It could face a brutal battle against some well-funded competitors, but investors’ love for the stock and its New York listing could be just the leverage Sea needs to buy out local partners or sign deals that give it an edge.The best thing Sea can do is grab the advantage offered by the run-up in its stock and double down.

2020-08-19,"In recent years, China's online shopping titans have been muscling into the prescription drug market.  When JD.com,  Alibaba's archrival, realized the health market spans well beyond retail, it spun out its healthcare unit into a subsidiary last May for a potential initial public offering.

2020-08-20,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to slap TikTok-style sanctions on more Chinese companies. But for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the largest of them all, the bigger challenge is coming from its own backyard for now.Landing in the White House’s cross-hairs could endanger a roughly $695 billion empire spanning online retail, food delivery and internet computing, but growing competition at home is the most immediate challenge. Alibaba’s long-standing dominance in China’s e-commerce sphere is under steady erosion from JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc., while in social retail channels Tencent Holdings Ltd. and TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. are vying for merchants and buyers like never before after Covid-19 spurred online shopping.China’s economy is among the world’s fastest to recover from the pandemic, aided by strict virus control measures and a rebound in industrial output and consumer sentiment. No. 2 online retailer JD rode this bounce-back to its fastest pace of sales growth and new customer additions in two years.Alibaba executives unfurling earnings Thursday will seek to reassure investors it will emerge stronger from the pandemic, much like its competitor. Revenue growth plunged to a new low during China’s lockdowns, but a record haul during the “6.18” mid-year sales promotions suggests its comeback has legs. Analysts expect top-line growth to re-accelerate, though the rate still lags pre-Covid-19 levels. Investor sentiment is similarly taking longer to recover: Shares of Alibaba have risen roughly 20% this year, lagging substantially behind peers like JD, Pinduoduo and Meituan.“Alibaba is fighting two key battles at the same time: one in core commerce online, and the other in local services offline,” said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Blue Lotus Capital. “This is a combative company, and investors will want to see achievements in at least one of the two fronts.”Read more: China’s $136 Billion E-Commerce Haul Signals a Consumer ComebackIt remains unclear whether the Trump administration will ever single out Alibaba: this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business News there were no formal proceedings undertaken against the e-commerce company at the moment. But Alibaba in any case has other, more immediate concerns at home.Amassing nearly 800 million Chinese consumers, Alibaba’s e-commerce leadership is cemented by a wide array of platforms pulling together the physical and virtual worlds to suit daily needs. Bargain hunters can search on its Ebay-style Taobao site for cheap clothes and handbags, while fans of big brands will hop on Amazon-like Tmall to buy imported baby formula and cosmetics. Its supermarket chain Freshippo delivers groceries to consumers’ doorsteps and the Ele.me unit does that for restaurant takeouts. And the payments for these transactions are handled by its 33%-owned financial spinoff Ant Group, which is preparing for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.But Alibaba’s approach means it faces competition on all fronts. Upstart Pinduoduo has lured small-town buyers away with even cheaper bargains, while the never-ending battle against Tencent-backed Meituan for market share in food delivery drags down margins. And as the pandemic spurs more people to shop online, Alibaba and its rivals have all set their eyes on the new arena of fresh produce. JD -- whose traditional strength has been in consumer electronics -- saw supermarket goods emerge as the product category contributing the most to revenue in the first six months of the year.Alibaba’s leadership in discretionary items like apparel means its post-pandemic recovery may take longer than its smaller rivals. Retail spending in China suffered a record collapse in the first three months of 2020 and while it’s since climbed back, concerns remain about the strength and sustainability of domestic consumption.Read more: Chinese Buy Up Real Estate But Hold Off on Dining Out, GamblingMore broadly, social media companies like ByteDance and Tencent are increasingly reaching out to shoppers through live-streaming, after Covid-19 fueled an unprecedented boom in online entertainment. Alibaba’s Taobao Live has championed the use of influencers to hawk everything from lipstick to crayfish. While rival video apps like Tencent-backed Kuaishou and ByteDance’s Douyin typically direct traffic to Alibaba platforms, they are now seeking to handle the transactions themselves. In July, Tencent also launched a new feature within its WeChat super-app that helps small merchants build digital storefronts, right alongside consumer giants like Walmart and Starbucks that are already using its so-called mini programs to tap a pool of 1.2 billion users.Longer term, it appears to be in cloud services where Alibaba and Tencent are locked in fierce battle with each other. Alibaba’s cloud division -- which contributes roughly a tenth of revenue and continues to grow -- saw expansion slow in the March quarter, though it remains the regional leader ahead of rivals Tencent and Baidu Inc. It has a 9% share of the $44 billion global cloud market, ranking after only Amazon and Microsoft, according to Gartner estimates.Alibaba has pledged to invest 200 billion yuan ($28.9 billion) on cloud infrastructure such as data centers over the next three years, and hire 5,000 tech workers globally for the division by the end of the 2020 financial year.Beyond its home market, Alibaba has so far evaded most of the sanctions slapped on rivals like Tencent and ByteDance. Still, the U.S. president, who has issued orders barring American individuals and companies from doing business with WeChat and TikTok starting Sept. 20, has said he’s considering extending a ban to other Chinese companies. The State Department on Tuesday asked American colleges to divest from Chinese holdings in their endowments and Congress is moving closer to passing legislation that could effectively bar Chinese firms from trading on U.S. bourses.“We will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges,” Alibaba Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said in a post-earnings call in May.Elsewhere, Alibaba’s UC Web browser was included in a list of 59 apps banned in India, following clashes between troops that killed at least 20 soldiers from the South Asian country. The tech giant also operates the Lazada online bazaar for Southeast Asian markets and the AliExpress platform popular in countries like Russia and Spain.“Although their main revenue drivers are domestic and their main expansion has been south, regulators in ASEAN and Indian markets may be paying more attention to Alibaba activities should the U.S. draw more attention to them with such a ban,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based marketing and research agency China Skinny.(Updates with Wilbur Ross’s comments in the sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Adds to Earnings Threat as Alibaba Challenged in China

2020-08-21,"In mid-August, JD.com (NYSE:JD) stock soared to all time highs after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported second-quarter numbers that were very, very strong.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com But the numbers were supposed to be great because of the Covid-19 pandemic which forced Chinese shoppers to buy products online in Q2.Still, the report showed that JD had positive catalysts beyond Covid-19.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd the results proved that JD is becoming, in-line with bulls' longtime prediction, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China.As a result, I think investors should stick with JD stock. The company has tons of momentum, its fundamentals are rock solid, and its valuation remains favorable.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now  JD Reported Strong EarningsJD's Q2 earnings report was strong.Thanks partly to the Covid-19 pandemic, JD.com's  top-line growth is accelerating meaningfully. Its customer count jumped 30% year-over-year in Q2, and its revenue soared 33.8% YOY; that was its fastest revenue growth since 2017, and its sales have climbed 28% in the first half of the year.Importantly, its first-half revenue growth rate of 28% was materially higher than China's overall online retail sales growth rate of 16%. Thus, JD's share of the booming Chinese e-commerce market is increasing.At the same time, JD's profit margins are being boosted by its growth. The margins of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding certain items, rose about 0.5  percentage points YOY to 3.4%. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 55.8%. Its full-year EBITDA margins look poised to come in at record highs.Overall, JD reported a really solid quarter, which included strong revenue and profit numbers.Given the strong earnings, it should not be surprising that JD stock is rallying. JD's Fundamentals Are ImprovingThe fundamentals supporting JD stock are rock solid.Chinese retailers generate more revenue than those of any other nation, as its consumers are expected to spend $5.1 trillion on retail products in 2020.That huge retail market is rapidly digitizing, as e-commerce penetration in the country is expected to jump from 6% in 2012 to 25% in the first half of 2020.  Further, the top 20 retailers in China control only 18% of the market, versus the 48% share that the top 20 retailers in America have.Consequently, over the next several years, China's e-commerce market will continue to grow at an average annual pace of 10%-plus, while the market share of a few large companies will  jump.JD.com will be one of those players.China's largest direct-to-consumer retailer with its own fully developed logistics network, JD looks a lot like the Amazon of the Asian country. And, as the Amazon of China, JD will use its size, growth strategies and enhanced transportation network to dominate China's e-commerce market and sustain 15%-plus revenue growth.On top of that, JD will, like Amazon, be able to increase its profit margins. That is, JD will leverage its large size to raise its profit margins towards the 5%-plus range.Given all of these points, JD's profits are poised to surge. The Valuation of JD.com Stock Remains ReasonableSome, but not all, of that profit growth is priced into JD stock today.Based on 15%-plus revenue growth over the next several years and steady margin expansion to the 5%-plus range, my estimates indicate that JD is on track to generate about $5.50 in earnings per share by 2025.Consumer discretionary stocks typically fetch a forward price-earnings ratio of 20 times. That forward multiple and 2025 EPS of $5.50 results in a 2024 price target for JD stock of $110.Discounted back by 8.5% per year, that equates to a 2020 price target for JD of about $80.Thus, at $75 today, JD isn't overvalued. The Bottom Line on JD StockStick with JD. The company is firing on all cylinders right now and will continue to fire on all cylinders for the foreseeable future. At the same time, its valuation remains reasonable.As long as that remains the case, JD stock will keep powering to new highs.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

That underscored how the e-commerce giant is riding a pick-up in consumer spending in a country among the first to recover. But Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said it will keep a close eye on “very fluid” U.S. policies toward China.President Donald Trump has made a tough position on the world’s No. 2 economy a key element of his campaign in the lead-up to the U.S. elections, sanctioning or threatening to clamp down on the Asian country’s biggest technology companies. Both sides have clashed on issues from the coronavirus to trade, while lawmakers brandish regulations that may force Chinese corporations like Alibaba off U.S. bourses.“We face uncertainties from not only the global pandemic but also increasing tensions between U.S. and China,” Zhang told analysts on a call. “We are assessing the situation and any potential impact carefully and thoroughly, and will take necessary actions to comply with any new regulations.”Read more: Alibaba Appeals to Trump, Says Supports China and AmericaAlibaba reported sales of 153.8 billion yuan ($22.2 billion) and net income of 47.6 billion yuan in the June quarter, both surpassing projections.

And India is growing increasingly hostile, though Alibaba said the withdrawal of its UCWeb browser service there shouldn’t have a material impact on its overall business.But growing competition at home is the more immediate challenge. Its market position is being chipped away by multiple competitors. Upstart Pinduoduo Inc. has lured small-town buyers away with cheaper bargains.

While rival video apps like Tencent-backed Kuaishou and ByteDance’s Douyin typically direct traffic to Alibaba platforms, they are now seeking to handle the transactions by themselves.Competition in food delivery is also intensifying.

2020-08-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Meituan Dianping shares surged the most in five months after reporting quarterly revenue that beat estimates, as demand for takeout services bounced back from disruptions caused by the pandemic in China.The world’s largest meal delivery service reported sales climbed a better-than-expected 8.9% to 24.7 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in the June quarter. It also reported a surprise net income of 2.2 billion yuan, helped by tax returns and preference gains. Its stock gained as much as 11% Monday, the biggest intraday gain since March, after brokerages including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup lifted their recommendations or price targets.Backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., Meituan has seen a gradual pick-up in its core food delivery business after the company posted its first quarterly revenue decline in the three months ended in March during the Covid-19 shutdowns. In August, the daily peak of delivery orders for both food and other categories exceeded 40 million, growing by 10 million in about a year, founder Wang Xing said in a post-earnings call.He told analysts that the online grocery business would be a key arena for Meituan to compete with rivals like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com as the country recovers from the pandemic. With sluggish economic growth and the possibility of a resurgence in virus cases, consumers have pulled back from restaurant dining, hotels and other hospitality services.“Online grocery is a very important business for us, potentially the most important initiative for us,” Wang said. “Meituan has never been afraid of competition.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe strong efficiency improvements at Meituan’s food-delivery segment could continue to lift the company’s operating profit even with its hotel business struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Operating profit from food deliveries jumped 66% in the June quarter, signaling a return to growth following a slump earlier in the year, while new initiatives including grocery retail also expanded sales faster during the period. But in-store dining recovered at a slower pace and its hotel and travel businesses continued to suffer the effects of the pandemic as travelers stayed away, Meituan said in its earnings statement.“We expect all business lines to accelerate [year over year] on the back of a recovery story and as food delivery enters a peak season,” Jefferies analysts led by Thomas Chong wrote in a research note.Meituan’s stock gains came on top of a 4.5% gain Friday. The shares have more than doubled this year, lifting the value of the company to about $200 billion. The stock was unexpectedly left off a list of new entrants into Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index last week, following a change in rules that allowed dual-class shares.Amid increasing competition in its core takeout business from rivals including Ant and SF Express -- both supported by Alibaba -- Meituan had expanded into a wide array of services including online travel, groceries delivery and ride-hailing. Alibaba’s food-delivery arm Ele.me is also engaging in a subsidy battle with the startup for market leadership.

2020-08-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The bidding for London’s next big IPO starts and ends at 4.5 billion pounds ($5.9 billion).The owners of The Hut Group Ltd. are so confident in the e-commerce company’s initial public offering, they aren’t going to haggle. Investors who want a piece must take that valuation. The traditional process of setting a range, narrowing it down and letting market demand determine the final number won’t apply here.Hut knows full well it’s a seller’s market for assets that have a technology theme and can demonstrate resilience to the pandemic. The company has two online businesses, one in cosmetics, the other offering protein shakes, snacks, vitamins and sportswear. It also sells its e-commerce platform to consumer multinationals such as Nestle SA. Sales have accelerated in the pandemic, growing 36% year-on-year in the first half of 2020.Assume that growth continues and margins hold steady. Underlying Ebitda could then plausibly be around 140 million pounds this year. The roughly 5 billion-pound valuation on a debt-free basis is 36 times that expected profit measure. That’s in line with e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc. and JD.com Inc., but a big premium to cosmetics groups like L’Oreal SA and Coty Inc.There is some opportunism in Hut’s listing, but the move also suggests the private capital markets would rather take profits now than finance the next leg of growth. The stock market will provide some backers with an exit, as well as nearly 1 billion pounds to cut leverage and put the company in a net cash position.That future expansion will be driven increasingly by the currently small technology services business, based on Hut’s divisional growth targets. Its roster of partners points to the value of its platform. And a stable of wholly owned brands provides a moat against competition on the cosmetics side, which is growing faster than nutrition.But these are still very competitive markets. The company’s statement that its recent performance shows cosmetics are “non-discretionary” is dubious. A lot of investment and acquisitions lie behind Hut’s phenomenal expansion. The three-year record is littered with one-time charges and losses at the pretax level. Growing revenue at 25% has not come for free.Tech investors don’t care about this year’s results. They also tolerate undemocratic oddities such as the veto that founder and lead shareholder Matthew Moulding will have over hostile takeover bids in the medium term.The fixed IPO price suggest a high degree of confidence that there are buyers out there at the mooted price, and it gives Hut’s owners certainty over the valuation now. But they won’t control the price after IPO.Some investors will still recall the London market’s IPO boomlet of 2014, when e-commerce pioneer AO World Plc was setting out a similar stall, a founder-led business with sales growth of 30% from online domestic appliances. It too sold its know-how to third parties. Its shares had nearly halved by the end of the year. Some on Hut’s very long list advisers worked on that deal.

2020-08-28,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is at an all-time high. After middling around in the early summer, Alibaba stock broke out in early July and it hasn't looked back. But at the time of this writing the stock is up over 11% since the e-commerce giant reported earnings on August 20. That has some investors wondering if Alibaba might be ready to take a pause.Source: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com If you put any stock in stochastic indicators like the relative strength index (RSI), there might be a case. Alibaba is sitting at an RSI of 76, which is getting on the uncomfortable side. And stocks don't move in the same direction all the time.However, the smarter play may be to buy Alibaba now and ride it on the way up. And where is that? Luke Lango recently made an educated guess and gave Alibaba stock a 12-month price target of around $310.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run At the time Lango wrote his article, Alibaba was trading around $268. Now it's almost at $290. So, the 20% gain from $268 is now down to about 7.5%. Still, if you're looking for a &quot;buy on the dip&quot; possibility, you may be waiting for some time. Welcome to the Hang Seng IndexAlibaba recently received approval to become a constituent stock of the Hang Seng Index beginning on Sep. 7. Alibaba, along with Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) will be the first companies with weighted voting rights (WVR) or a secondary-listing in the Hang Seng index. This will allow any exchange-traded fund (ETF) with at least $20 billion of assets and is tracking the Hang Seng to invest in these companies.The move is a clear signal that Hong Kong is looking for technology stocks to play a more prominent role on the index. And perhaps an example of political gamesmanship as the United States threatens to delist Alibaba and other Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges. Tensions Will Simmer for AwhileThe relationship between the United States and China is being fueled by red hot rhetoric. But as the calendar moves to fall, the temperature between the two nations should start to simmer. In the first place, the one benefit of a presidential election is that neither political party is inclined to do anything. So, despite anything you hear on the campaign trail, nothing will happen until after the election.And after the election, any talk of delisting will be a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing (I'll leave it up to you to decide if the tale is told by an idiot).If you take away anything from this, it's that the United States and China will be making nice for the foreseeable future. That means you can look at Alibaba for the company it is. And there's a lot to like. Alibaba Stock Is Still GrowingOne similarity between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba that is worthy of note is that neither company pays a dividend. And there's a reason behind that. Both companies are still growing. In the case of Alibaba, its core e-commerce business is the only business unit that is turning a profit.But like Amazon, it's using the strength of that business to push into other areas. This includes the cloud, digital media and entertainment just to list a few. And let's not forget how embedded Alibaba is in Chinese culture. The United States talks about the &quot;Amazon effect&quot; on the retail market. And it's very real. But there are many more e-commerce outlets for U.S. consumers. In China, Alibaba, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) serve as the consumer's primary e-commerce outlets.And with that in mind, you can probably ignore an RSI of 76 (Amazon's is 70 as of this writing, by the way) and buy Alibaba for the stock it's going to be for the next ten years.Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

2020-08-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Ant Group’s potentially record-sized initial public offering could propel technology capital-raising in 2020 past the dizzying heights of the dotcom bubble, an extraordinary showing in a pandemic-stricken year fraught with geopolitical uncertainty.Jack Ma’s Chinese financial titan aims to raise at least $30 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai in October, which could push global first-time share sales by tech firms well past $57 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the highest since 1999, when tech companies raised $62 billion and famously ushered in a plethora of now-defunct internet outfits.After an initial pandemic-induced lull, corporate share sales have come back with a vengeance, luring many of the same investors who pushed Apple Inc.’s market cap past the $2 trillion mark and ignited a broad rally in internet companies worldwide.Ant joins a stampede of companies that began trying to sell shares in recent weeks, from food delivery behemoth DoorDash Inc. to Airbnb Inc. July’s almost $19 billion in new listings was the busiest month for U.S. IPOs since September 2014, when 36 companies including Ant-affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public while raising $36 billion.“The multiple environment for technology companies is at the highest since the dotcom bubble,” said Lauren Cummings, co-head of technology equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley. “2020 is the year a lot of companies are going public but there are still many high quality companies, probably multiple times of what we have this year, that are quality companies, that are scaled, that can go public next year.”Read more: Tech Unicorns Rushing to Go Public Defy Sleepy Summer SeasonInvestors have questioned whether a 2020 run-up that’s lifted marquee names from Apple and Facebook Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. is fueling a bubble akin to that of two decades ago, which brought down much of the fledgling internet economy when it popped. Beyond the fundamentals however, there are several unique aspects to this year’s tech mania.One is sheer size. Ant’s giant offering may skew comparisons with 1999, particularly if it surpasses Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion IPO last year as the largest in history.The past year has featured an unusual number of first-time share sales on Hong Kong or mainland bourses by Chinese companies already listed abroad, fearing a backlash from an increasingly belligerent Trump administration. They include Alibaba, JD.com Inc. and top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.Read more: Ant Group Cites U.S. Risks in Filing for Hong Kong, Shanghai IPOThe rise of the hyper-local ChiNext and Star markets in China has also inflated 2020’s pipeline. Punters on the mainland have gobbled up loss-making debutantes like never before -- triggering first-day rallies of more than 2,000% in some cases -- in part because they believe Beijing will offer financial and other forms of aid for a Chinese tech sector perceived as essential given the Trump administration’s restrictions on trade.Finally, the unknown extent of the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led some companies to rethink their capital needs or speed up plans. Airbnb, which was previously seen as a candidate for a direct listing, said this month it filed for a traditional initial public offering. Last week, on Monday alone, four biomedical companies, four blank-check companies and five software companies, including Unity Software Inc., filed to go public.“The year has been really busy for equity capital markets deals so far despite all the headline news,” said Tucker Highfield, co-head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at Bank of America Corp.. “We expect to see strong IPO markets to the end of year as investors continue to look for higher returns.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Jack Ma’s Ant Fuels Tech IPO Frenzy Not Seen Since Dotcom Bubble
2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have lamented the lack of depth in the U.S. stock market, marveling at how a handful of big tech companies have grown to dominate almost a quarter of the S&P 500 and become responsible for all of this year’s gain. But that lopsidedness is nothing next to China, where the top three stocks in the benchmark MSCI China Index now have more than a 38% weight. At this rate, instead of buying passive funds that track the MSCI index, investors might as well just pile into China’s version of FAANG, known locally as ATM: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and food delivery super-app Meituan Dianping. There’s nagging unease that ATM’s economic prospects aren’t as sound as those of Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. In the U.S., deeply entrenched user behavior has protected tech companies from stepping on each other’s toes. Americans shop on Amazon, search on Google, and stream on Netflix. In China, however, the competitive landscape is a lot murkier. Alibaba continues to face fierce competition from JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. Meanwhile, Jack Ma’s empire is still fighting with Tencent over mobile payments. As for Meituan Dianping, how many century stocks — companies with a market cap north of $100 billion — have rallied more than 160% so far this year? Meituan is eclipsed only by Tesla Inc. So it’s not unnatural to ask how much further ATM can go. Passive fund flows, unleashed by the super dovish tone of the Federal Reserve, are propelling these three stocks even higher. That makes beating the benchmark MSCI China Index an impossible task. Value investing remains a losing game, because banks, the only segment big enough to tilt the index, are still struggling with bad loan writedowns. To outperform the index and reduce reliance on ATM, then, investors have no choice but to hunt for smaller growth stocks. JD.com and Pinduoduo, for instance, are hedges against the Alibaba behemoth; both saw their market caps more than double this year. Electric vehicle startups XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have launched successful IPOs, as investors increasingly see the industry as recession-proof. Meanwhile, bullish equity analysts are telling tall tales to justify sky-high valuations. In mid-May, Zhongtai Securities Co. published a research report arguing that the baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai Co. is gold-like as an effective hedge against irresponsible central banks printing trillions of dollars of new money. Quantitative easing tends to benefit the rich, and has only created bubbles; as a scarce asset, Moutai is a good buy, the brokerage argued. The liquor maker hit a fresh high Monday, and is now valued at an eye-popping 48 times 2020 earnings. While it’s understandable that the rich may want to celebrate their stock gains this year with a $300 bottle of Moutai, hot-pot chain operator Haidilao International Holding Ltd.’s meteoric rise is more puzzling. The Chinese are still apprehensive about dining out, recent macro retail data show, and Haidilao posted 965 million yuan ($139.5 million) in losses in the first half, versus 911 million yuan net profit in the same period last year. But now Haidilao is seen as a robotics play. It opened its first smart, automated restaurant in Beijing almost two years ago. Once artificial intelligence is involved, profitability no longer matters.There are plenty of other examples. Investors have crowded into expensive after-school education stocks as well as duty-free goods operators, all as attempts to diversify from ATM. When we’re in a bull market, pigs can fly. For months, we’ve been worried that a top-heavy stock market would be vulnerable to a crash. One generous line of thinking has been that value stocks will perk up once economies recover, and indexes will look more balanced. That may well be the case, but until that day comes — and it could take years — the ATMs and FAANGs of the world have already distorted stock investing into an unrecognizable form. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. is offering to sell a roughly $20 billion stake in its retail business to Amazon.com Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Amazon has held discussions about investing in the conglomerate’s Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. unit and has expressed interest in negotiating a potential transaction, the person said. Mumbai-based Reliance Industries is willing to sell as much as a 40% stake in the subsidiary to Amazon, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.A deal, if successful, would not only create a retail behemoth in India but will also turn Jeff Bezos and Asia’s richest man from rivals into allies in one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world. At $20 billion, the deal would be the biggest ever in India as well as for Amazon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Shares of Reliance Industries surged to a record. The stock advanced 7.1% in Mumbai -- the most since April 22 -- pushing the company’s market valuation past $200 billion. It was the day’s top gainer on the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, which rose 1.7% Thursday.In India, where a lot of people still shop in tiny street-corner stores, the deal could be Amazon’s way of acknowledging that it needs a locally-entrenched partner with a strong on-the-ground presence. For Amazon, Reliance would provide a brick-and-mortar component to its ambitions in a country where online purchasing still accounts for a minuscule share of an estimated $1 trillion retail market.Highly Complementary“The deal would be a highly complementary one that builds on the strengths of either side,” said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director at Bexley Advisors in Mumbai. “Amazon comes with the might of its warehousing capabilities and the ability to streamline supply chains and sweat assets for maximum returns.”Amazon hasn’t made any final decision on the size of its potential investment, and talks could still fall apart, the person said. A representative for Amazon declined to comment.“As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumors,” a Reliance spokesman said in an emailed response to Bloomberg News. “Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations.”Any deal between the two would also bolster the partnership that was indirectly forged last month through an unrelated purchase by Ambani’s group when it bought assets of indebted rival Future Group. Amazon had invested in one of Future’s unlisted firms last year and later expanded the alliance.India PlaybookSuch an investment by Amazon also means the titan is altering its playbook after learning from past failures in the region. Earlier, the online juggernaut’s strategy of going it alone in China flopped in the face of competition from domestic giants including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc.For Reliance, the deal will give further credence to Ambani’s ambitions to create an e-commerce giant for India akin to Alibaba Group. Reliance Retail already lured about $1 billion from Silver Lake Partners, in a deal that valued the firm at about $57 billion.The U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co. is in advanced talks to invest at least $1 billion, and L Catterton is also considering investing, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday.The investment in Ambani’s retail ventures comes after he raised $20 billion selling stakes in his technology venture -- Jio Platforms Ltd. -- to investors including Facebook Inc. and Google.Read more: Meet the Man Who Made Facebook-Jio Deal Happen for AmbaniThe 63-year-old-tycoon, who’s added $24 billion to his personal wealth this year, told shareholders in July that the retail unit would be next in line for investors to come on board.Reliance Retail -- a unit of the energy-to-telecommunications conglomerate Reliance Industries -- runs supermarkets, India’s largest consumer electronics chain store, a cash and carry wholesaler, fast-fashion outlets and an online grocery store called JioMart. It reported 1.63 trillion rupees ($22 billion) in revenue in the year through March 2020. The unit operates almost 12,000 stores in nearly 7,000 towns.Pivot AwayFor the Indian business mogul -- who has identified technology and retail as future growth areas -- the investments would further help to pivot the group away from the energy business he inherited from his father, who died in 2002.While Ambani is keen to sell stakes to marquee foreign investors, he’s actively acquiring local retail assets to bolster his leadership position.Besides the Future Group purchase, Reliance is in negotiations to acquire smaller firms such as Urban Ladder, an online furniture seller and Zivame, a lingerie maker, people familiar with the matter said last month.A stake stale to Amazon, however, may need to clear antitrust hurdles. A collaboration between the world’s largest online retailer with a strong presence in India and the country’s top offline retailer could lead to market concentration risks that may invite regulatory scrutiny.Bexley’s Sinha also warned of “potential unintended consequences” if the transaction succeeds. “It is not inconceivable that this stifles any other entity from gaining scale in Indian retail space,” he said.(Updates with Reliance’s closing share in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Ambani’s Reliance to Offer $20 Billion Stake in Retail Arm to Amazon

2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. helped modernize brick-and-mortar retail with consumer data and online services. Now it hopes to do the same for China’s multitrillion-dollar manufacturing arena.China’s largest corporation unveiled Wednesday a factory it’s been operating under wraps for the past three years on the outskirts of its hometown of Hangzhou, churning out apparel for clothing merchants on its Taobao and Tmall marketplaces. Dubbed Xunxi, the so-called smart or connected factory is designed to showcase Alibaba’s newest line of business, offering data analytics and back-end technology to manufacturers so they can customize and fine-tune factories in response to consumer demand.“This allows traditional manufacturers to improve profitability and reduce inventory levels while still being able to meet these personalization needs,” said Alain Wu, chief executive officer of Alibaba-subsidiary Xunxi Digital Technology Co. Xunxi’s factory floor is equipped with cutting and sewing machines and conveyor belts that can be tracked remotely via smartphone, according to the company.Alibaba is betting that its years of observing consumer behavior will be useful to the country’s producers, at a time Beijing is championing what it calls its “Industrial Internet” of smart factories. Xunxi -- which means fast rhino -- is the fruition of what billionaire founder Jack Ma called “new manufacturing” in 2016. It’s closely related to Alibaba’s “new retail” strategy of merging offline and online shopping: newer outfits like the Freshippo grocery chain have grown into a $12 billion business, contributing a fifth of total revenue in the June quarter.While the country houses some of the world’s most advanced plants -- which crank out everything from iPhones to electric vehicles -- smaller manufacturers are struggling to adapt to changing consumer needs in a slowing economy. Alibaba’s starting point is apparel but it eventually aims to help more manufacturers parse data, automate logistics and maintain just-in-time inventory, much as it already does for Chinese convenience chains and big-box retailers.Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang -- who’s pledged to seed future growth beyond e-commerce -- oversees both efforts. Alibaba’s leadership in Chinese e-commerce is being chipped away by multiple competitors. Upstart Pinduoduo Inc. has lured small-town buyers away with cheaper bargains, while JD.com Inc. has ventured beyond its traditional strength in consumer electronics into groceries, after Covid-19 spurred more online shopping. Shares in Alibaba gained roughly 30% so far this year, while both JD’s and Pinduoduo’s more than doubled.Read more: New Alibaba Chief Explains Why He Wants to Kill His Own BusinessFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba’s Newest Business: Modernizing China’s Factories
2020-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese startup Kuaishou, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., is considering a Hong Kong initial public offering which could raise as much as $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The company is working with advisers on the share sale, which could happen as soon as early next year, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information is private. Details of the offering including size and timeline could still change as deliberations are at an early stage, the people said.The Information reported Kuaishou’s IPO plan earlier Thursday in Hong Kong, citing unidentified people. A representative for the Chinese startup declined to comment.Kuaishou, or “fast hand,” is the biggest Chinese rival to Douyin, ByteDance Ltd.’s domestic version of short-video sharing app TikTok. Kuaishou established its popularity among users in the country’s smaller cities and rural areas, with people streaming slices of everyday life from harvesting corn to slurping noodles. It later expanded to include audiences in bigger cities, and content ranging from people playing video games to teenagers lip-syncing songs. It has been overtaken by Douyin in popularity, thanks to ByteDance’s mastery of algorithms that determine what videos to show users next -- and to keep them hooked.Kuaishou generates the bulk of its revenue from taking a cut out of the tips users give to their favorite live-streaming performers. But it’s also increasingly expanding into advertising and e-commerce. The Beijing-based company has a deal with China’s No. 2 online retailer JD.com Inc. to sell products through an in-app store, and said it has amassed more than 100 million daily active buyers.Kuaishou’s business is so far largely focused on China. Downloads of its Zynn short-video app spiked in recent months in the U.S., as lip-syncing teens sought TikTok alternatives in the face of President Donald Trump’s ban. Kuaishou’s overseas version is banned in India alongside more than 100 Chinese-made apps.In July, the company hired former Didi Chuxing executive Tony Qiu to oversee its global expansion, according to the people. Qiu reports directly to the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Su Hua, one of the people said.The startup was considering a U.S. IPO last year to bankroll its expansion and fend off competition, Bloomberg News has reported. Kuaishou was raising more than $1 billion at a $25 billion valuation in a funding round last year, a person familiar with the matter said at that time. Its valuation has recently risen to at least $29 billion in the secondary market, the people said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Rival Kuaishou Mulls $5 Billion Hong Kong IPO

2020-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- As export orders started plummeting in March amid the coronavirus’s global spread, Chinese toothbrush maker Tommy Tu turned to the domestic market. With the help of Alibaba Group’s huge trove of data on what Chinese consumers are searching for, his factory shifted to making products that became local hits, like a battery-operated electric toothbrush for 9.9 yuan ($1.5).The strategy helped Tu recover most of the lost foreign sales and reduce his Jiangsu-based firm’s dependence on exports to 60% of revenue, down from 90% earlier.Spurred by the economic devastation unleashed by the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of Chinese factories like this -- some of which had exported almost everything they made -- are re-focusing on the domestic market of 1.4 billion people. They are turning to e-commerce giants like Alibaba, Pinduoduo Inc. and JD.com Inc. with deep pockets and years of observing consumer behavior, in what could be a long-term pivot.“We have to focus more on domestic sales,” said Tu, who doesn’t anticipate a “return to the old days” of robust overseas demand. “We have to move away from just blindly sticking labels on products to actively researching, designing and building our own brand.”Chinese factories are having trouble in overseas markets not just because of the global economic contraction caused by the pandemic. Political tensions are flaring between China and the U.S., Australia and Canada, while rising labor and material costs are propelling foreign clients to turn to more affordable exporters such as those in Southeast Asia.With China’s status as the factory to the world -- an economic model that powered its growth in the past two decades -- coming under pressure, President Xi Jinping is ambitiously seeking to boost domestic consumption in a revamp of the world’s second-largest economy.Though China’s exports demonstrated strength in feeding global demand recently-- rising 9.5% in dollar terms in August from a year earlier -- exports will be pressured in the long term as other nations increase output, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.“Amid the global weakness, domestic demand is where the market is,” said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist at ANZ Bank. “China has already become more of a domestically driven economy even before Covid-19.”Many exporters had already been seeking to expand domestic sales, and the pandemic accelerated that, said Wang Hai, a vice president at Alibaba overseeing consumer-to-manufacturer e-commerce. In just three months, Alibaba gathered more than 300,000 Chinese export factories to tap local demand directly.Alibaba’s app, Taobao Deals, is a business-to-consumer platform mainly for Chinese manufacturers that went online in March. By June, it had 40 million monthly active users, according to a company earnings call. Besides analyzing demand trends, Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao handles centralized shipping and customer services for the factories.Survival PivotStill, only about 10%-20% of Chinese exporters have taken action to extend their domestic reach, according to Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce’s International Market Research Institute, based on a small survey. Challenges include switching standards, marketing unfamiliar brands amid local competition and the longer periods of credit payment allowed in China.Domestic demand is also not yet big enough to prop up China’s $2.5 trillion export sector which employs close to 200 million people. And without the premium commanded by global brand names attached to their goods, Chinese factories will be forced into a race to the bottom on price.“Most consumers will probably make their choices based on price or how the product functions are demonstrated, if there’s no brand identification,” said Jason Yu, managing director at Kantar Worldpanel Greater China. “So this won’t be a sustainable business model for most of those factories.”Bruce Zhu, manager of a high-end luggage manufacturer in Zhejiang province that focuses on exports, initially tried to crack the domestic market as the outlook for his sector has soured. However, the factory couldn’t withstand slashing its prices to compete with other local makers. “The domestic market is too fierce,” he said.For companies that can endure the price war, consumer data supplied by Alibaba and others help steer an adjustment to Chinese preferences. Informed by search data, a Zhejiang-based cushion maker pivoted to red, embroidered cushions, and started making a product that can be converted into a blanket.The revamp helped his firm’s sale hold steady amid a plunge in overseas orders, said Chief Executive Jin Zehua.Glass BottlesExperts say if China’s exports continue to demonstrate strength as seen in recent months, the inward push could help local makers become more diversified and resilient.“Turning to the domestic market adds one more option for Chinese exporters,” said Bai, the commerce ministry researcher. “In the future, exporters can sell to the market that’s most favorable, which reduces risks.”Some Chinese exporters are learning how to develop both inward and outward channels. In February, Alibaba contacted Guangdong Haoshun Odis Technology Co., an exporter of automobile cleansers and lubricants, to design an alcohol disinfectant after analyzing tens of millions of searches for such a product.Alibaba found that most alcohol disinfectants in China were sold in glass bottles, which were too fragile and dispensed too much liquid at a time. Haoshun Odis hence started making disinfectant spray in metal bottles, said director Qu Weihao.Sales have climbed 66% between January and July, Qu said, both from domestic demand and overseas markets like Japan. “Without big data, this could have been very difficult to achieve,” Qu said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba’s Big Data Is Helping China’s Exporters Pivot to China

2020-09-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. foresees its cloud services arm turning profitable for the first time this year, a milestone for the decade-old business that underscores how Asia’s largest corporation expects a return to pre-pandemic levels as China’s economy rebounds.Alibaba’s shares rose 3.8% on Wednesday in Hong Kong, their biggest gain in over a month. Its internet computing business is growing roughly 60% at an annual revenue run rate of about $7 billion, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told investors at an annual company conference. The unit should turn profitable in the year ending March, she said.Cainiao, the logistics service Alibaba folded fully into its broader empire in 2017, should generate positive cash-flow on an operating basis over the same period, she added.China’s most valuable corporation has invested billions in hosting computing for corporations over the cloud, while building a nationwide logistics network that can handle the billions of parcels its e-commerce business throws out. Achieving profitability will boost Alibaba as it tries to revitalize growth alongside a recovery in the broader Chinese economy. The e-commerce giant is riding a pick-up in consumer spending -- particularly online -- in a country among the first to recover from Covid-19.“We typically spend 8 to 10 years incubating, nurturing and growing a new business,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang told investors. “We still regard ourselves to be in the nascent stage of the global cloud era.”Like Amazon.com Inc.’s, Alibaba’s cloud service emerged from the computational power needed to handle billions of online shopping transactions to become one of its fastest-growing initiatives. The Chinese company today relies on the service, which competes globally with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp. and Google, to underpin both its global expansion and forays into newer arenas such as live-streaming.Read more: Alibaba Touts Post-Virus Rebound While Watching ‘Fluid’ U.S.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s announcement at its 2020 Investor Day that its cloud computing business is targeting positive profits in fiscal 2021 could come as a surprise to the market and lift consensus estimates. Alibaba has intentionally kept its cloud segment operating at a small loss in past years in order to gain market share, so the announcement marks a shift in messaging for the segment.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Alibaba’s cloud business continued to grow during the global Covid-19 shutdowns this year. It held a leading 40.1% share of China’s total cloud infrastructure services spending in the June quarter, more than double its closest competitors, according to industry researcher Canalys. Even as economies start to recover, the company is aiming to take advantage of the shift to upgrade more corporate IT infrastructures to the cloud and boost cloud-based collaboration at work, Zhang told investors Wednesday.Retail sales in the world’s No. 2 economy rose for the first time this year in August, after virus restrictions eased. The comeback in consumer spending has allowed Alibaba to further expand a $700 billion empire that already spans online retail, food delivery and internet computing. It owns a third of Ant Group, the Chinese financial titan pursuing potentially the world’s largest initial public offering, and most recently outlined plans to create a new line of business by modernizing factories.Excluding its stake in Ant, Alibaba’s strategic investments are currently valued at $45 billion, Wu told investors on Wednesday, adding that the company will continue to invest in technology and research. Alibaba last year reported an $83 billion stake in its global portfolio of investments, which included its 33% stake in the fintech behemoth.Zhang -- credited with orchestrating Alibaba’s last big foray into a new arena, with a move into brick-and-mortar retail -- is responding in part to intensifying competition on multiple fronts. Pinduoduo Inc. has lured small-town buyers away with cheaper bargains, while traditional foe JD.com Inc. has ventured beyond its traditional strength in consumer electronics into groceries, a category that leapt to the fore during nationwide lockdowns.Even social media companies like ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are increasingly reaching out to shoppers through live-streaming -- a route Alibaba pioneered with Taobao Live -- after Covid-19 fueled online entertainment. While rival video apps like Tencent-backed Kuaishou and ByteDance’s Douyin typically directed traffic to Alibaba platforms, they’re now seeking to handle the transactions by themselves.Then there’s sustained competition in food delivery. Alibaba’s Ele.me now directs flowers, housekeepers and masseurs to doorsteps in addition to lunchboxes, while Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping tries its hand on beauty products and smartphones.With more than 1 billion annual active consumers, Alibaba generated over $1 trillion in gross merchandise value in the 12 months ended June, Wu said. Spending on its platforms accounted for about 18% of China’s total retail sales, up from about 10% in 2015.“Domestic consumption, cloud computing and data intelligence, and globalization -- these are the three growth engines for Alibaba’s future,” Zhang said. “Digitalization is the biggest opportunity of our time.”Read more: Chinese Consumers Join Industrial Recovery From Covid-19(Updates share price in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Expects First Profit From Its Cloud Arm This Year

Moreover, the price charts of the following three stocks to buy suggest plenty of treats rather than bearish tricks for today’s bullish investors.
Boo! Has the market bottomed? There’s no guarantees of course. News overnight POTUS and others in the White House’s inner circle have tested positive has spooked the market. The market hates uncertainty of course, unless it’s climbing a wall of worry.
So, what are investors supposed to do regarding stocks to buy in October?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
What is known is September’s 13% correction in the leading Nasdaq Composite was a doozy, and much more so in the index’s most influential stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. That’s no surprise of course. As twisted as that may seem, that’s good news which in 2020, has only gotten even better.
What’s not being reported today by a financial media interested in selling chaos and unrest is that historically most market corrections don’t grow larger and eventually into full-blown bear cycles. Additionally, with the VIX, or “fear index” spiking as high as 38% during the period, panic by investors worthy of a bottom looks contextually solid.
There are other reasons to be optimistic too. The Nasdaq Composite scored an early indication last Friday warning of a new market rally. Even burlier price performances off critical bottoming patterns from the index’s notorious top performers confirmed the idea. Importantly, leading stocks such as Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) have also continued to do what they do best, i.e. demonstrate relative and absolute price strength.
According to the fact checkers and analysts responsible for popularizing the critical market-timing tool called the follow-through day, or FTD, the Dow Jones generated a weaker-looking signal in Wednesday’s session. All told, its time investors look past Friday’s headlines and at three other stocks to buy which also disavow fearmongering and endorse reasons to believe more positive truths are here today.


					The 7 Top Robinhood Stocks for October				

JD.com (NASDAQ:JD)
TradeWeb Markets (NASDAQ:TW)
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)

Stocks to Buy: JD.com (JD)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our stocks to buy is JD.com. JD is China’s largest online retailer and shares have been on a tear in 2020. It’s up just over 100% since the start of the year. JD also has a rare bullish distinction as the stock’s year-to-date gains are larger than the low associated with the March Covid-19 market bottom.
Technically, JD’s best days don’t appear to be behind it either.
After breaking out of a massive 2.5-year long corrective base, this stock to buy is now forming a second weekly base. Lower base counts of three or less are typically more productive for breakout opportunities which work consistently. Given the overall bullish market environment, a confirmed candlestick pivot low for JD’s base-in-progress and on-the-cusp stochastics crossover, this stock looks worthy of buying on today’s weakness right here, right now.

Tradeweb Markets (TW)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next of our stocks to buy are shares of Tradeweb Markets. This recent IPO and fintech play operates as an over-the-counter, electronic marketplace for financial contracts of all types. Tradeweb has already caught the eye of notorious businessman, celebrity and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. TW has captured our attention as well, but for other reasons in today’s market.


					7 Internet of Things Stocks for Investing in Innovation				

Technically, Tradeweb shares confirmed a classic corrective hammer candlestick test of its prior highs and 50% retracement level. The price action received validation as the monthly September candle cleared the August pattern high of $58.22. Less than 1% from a picture-perfect confirmation purchase, TW is a stock to buy today with an eye on new highs into 2021.

Twitter (TWTR)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of today’s stocks to buy is Twitter. Twitter is a social media platform for POTUS to blow his horn and fearmonger. You knew that of course. To be fair, there are other reasons to appreciate Twitter. And currently one of them is as an investor capitalizing on a well-positioned stock chart.
The provided monthly chart of TWTR shows the stock just clearing its lifetime 50% retracement level within a very deep, multi-year base. With the price action also moving shares slightly through a smaller bullish mid-pivot inside a ‘W’ double-bottom base, as they say, “It is what it is” and this is a stock to buy.

2020-10-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will invest about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., taking control of China’s largest chain of hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD.com Inc. in e-commerce’s hottest growth arena.Alibaba will raise its direct and indirect stake in the grocery chain to about 72% by acquiring equity from Auchan Retail International SA, then make a general offer to shareholders to buy out the rest of Sun Art. The latter’s Hong Kong-listed stock leapt as much as 30% Monday, its biggest intraday gain since 2011. Alibaba gained as much as 1.8% to touch an intraday record.The deal signals the intention of Asia’s most valuable corporation to accelerate an effort to dominate one of Chinese e-commerce’s largest untapped frontiers. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang has made expansion into physical retail and the grocery business in particular a cornerstone of his growth strategy, an effort that paid off during the coronavirus pandemic. Sun Art already operates hundreds of hypermarkets across China under the Auchan and RT-Mart brands, a massive distribution and storage network that can supplement Alibaba’s own efforts in fresh produce.The Chinese e-commerce giant is now grappling with intensifying competition from the likes of JD, food delivery giant Meituan Dianping and startups such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed Missfresh, all chasing a market for groceries and fresh produce that HSBC expects to grow 2.5 times to 690 billion yuan ($103 billion) by 2022 from 2019. Alibaba was among the pioneers in that arena, announcing in 2017 it would spend about $2.9 billion for a 36% stake of Sun Art.The deal “suggests that the tech giant seeks to further expand its one-hour home grocery delivery services such as Taoxianda, leveraging the grocer’s extensive offline hypermarts across China,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kevin Kim said. “This could capture consumers flocking to online platforms, further induced by Covid-19 early this year, yet may hurt foot-traffic to the grocer’s physical stores.”Read more: Alibaba Touts Post-Virus Rebound While Watching ‘Fluid’ U.S.Read more: New Alibaba Chief Explains Why He Wants to Kill His Own BusinessZhang has been directly involved in the expansion into what the company calls its “new retail” strategy, combining e-commerce with physical stores. He helped launch a startup called Freshippo within Alibaba that aimed to combine a grocery store, a restaurant and a delivery app, a business that’s underpinned an overall new retail division that’s grown into a $12 billion operation, contributing a fifth of total revenue in the June quarter.As Alibaba increases its stake to a majority, Sun Art’s financial statements will be consolidated into the larger company’s. Peter Huang, Sun Art’s CEO, will add the title of chairman for the business.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s $3.6 billion investment to raise its stake in Sun Art to 72% from the 36% acquired in 2017 signals the company’s intention to strategically ramp up its supermarket retail services. The acquisition should boost its Taoxianda and Tmall Supermarket and help compete against JD.com, Meituan and Pinduoduo, which are also aggressively trying to push into fresh produce e-commerce.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.The online groceries segment has leapt to the forefront during Covid-19 when shoppers shunned restaurants and physical stores, though the industry -- which requires more complex logistical structures such as so-called cold chain storage -- has proven difficult to crack in years past.Alibaba’s initial moves into physical retail were closely followed by WeChat-operator Tencent, which has itself invested in brick-and-mortar chains such as Yonghui Superstores Co. JD now also operates its own thriving groceries business, while Meituan and up-and-comer Pinduoduo Inc. in recent years began investing aggressively in the arena.Sun Art is the industry leader in China’s hypermarkets, operating giant Costco- and Walmart-style stores that sell everything from seafood to wine and furniture under one roof. It held 14% of the market share in 2019, according to global intelligence firm Euromonitor International. Alibaba has also invested in many other brick-and-mortar retailers including Shanghai-listed Sanjiang Shopping Club Co., Shenzhen-listed New Huadu Supercenter Co., and Hong Kong-listed Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co.Meanwhile, France’s Auchan has become the latest in a slew of foreign retailers to step back from China after struggling in the market. Last year, Carrefour SA sold an 80% stake in its China unit at a discount while German wholesaler Metro AG sold a majority stake in its operations there.Big box offerings are faring better. Costco Wholesale Corp. opened its first outlet in China last year to frenzied crowds and is planning its third store. Walmart Inc. plans to quadruple the number of its members-only warehouse chain Sam’s Club in China to 100 stores over the next eight years, as growth outpaces the company’s separate network of over 400 Walmart stores selling basic groceries.(Updates with Sun Art’s market share in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Takes Over China’s Top Hypermart Chain for $3.6 Billion

Granted, Nio has had to deal with some major challenges. In 2019, the company had to recall about 5,000 ES8 SUVs because the batteries caught fire. There also were some layoffs.
But Nio CEO William Li has proven to be a very capable leader. Not only was he able to improve the company’s quality control but he also put together an important financing deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Note that he raised about $1 billion from Hefei City Construction and Investing Holding, CMD-SDIC Capital and Anhui Provincial Emerging Industry Investment. This was followed up with the issuance of 72 million shares to the public.

So then, what now? Will Nio stock continue to be a good investment? Well, to see, let’s consider some of the latest developments.
Nio Stock Gets Its Groove Back
The competitive environment in China for EVs is definitely intense, but Nio has done a good job in setting itself apart from its rivals. That is, the company has been focused creating sleek and innovative designs. When it comes to cars – especially those that command premium prices – this strategy can be a winner.
But success has been more than fancy designs.
“Nio has created a car that has a removable battery that cuts down the charging time,” said Victorio Stefanov, who is a Trader & Success Coach at TRADEPRO Academy. “You can drive up to a charging station and simply swap out your Nio battery. The company has also secured over 500 patented technologies into its battery swap solution.”
Taken together, Nio has been able to grow at a rapid clip. In September, there was a 133.2% year-over-year surge to 4,708 vehicles. As for the quarter, there was a 154.3% spike to 12,206. Part of the acceleration is attributable to the launch of Nio’s newest vehicle, the EC6 (the company currently has three cars on the market).
It’s a 5-seater premium smart electric coupe SUV that has a retail price that ranges from roughly $52,441 to $74,957 (this does not include government subsidies). The car includes comes with Mobileye chips for safety and has a system to allow for upgrades over the air.
But of course, regarding the overall delivery growth, there have been other important factors. The Chinese government has continued to be a major proponent of EVs. The goal is to hit a 25% penetration rate within about five years. And given that more than 20 million vehicles are sold each year in China, the market potential for EVs is significant.
In the meantime, the country has been able to effectively manage the Covid-19 pandemic. For the latest quarter, the GDP increased by nearly 5% and retail sales have been robust. There has also been an acceleration of digital adoption, which has boosted the share prices of companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).
In other words, the environment is quite positive for Nio.
Bottom Line on Nio
Nio is often referred to as the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has certainly been a nice catalyst for the stock! Yet there are still clear differences to keep in mind. Tesla’s strategy has been to develop its own manufacturing system, which has helped with profit margins.
The company is also a leader in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. This has been fueled by the huge dataset generated from Tesla’s large number of cars on the road.
True, Nio is starting to invest more in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. But there is a long way to go. The fact is that Nio does not have the kind of deep engineering DNA that Tesla has.
The irony is that Tesla may be the Tesla of China! Consider that the company is the leader in sales of EVs in the country.
So all in all, investors should be wary with Nio stock. The valuation is getting to frothy levels, at least based on the small volumes. Moreover, Wall Street seems to be attributing Tesla-like qualities to the company that are fairly thin.
For now, it’s probably best to be cautious on NIO stock – and perhaps wait for a better price.

2020-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Few initial public offerings have aroused more anticipation than the blockbuster listing of Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co.Demand for the record $34.5 billion IPO has been so strong this week that Ant decided to stop taking orders from big investors a day earlier than planned. In Shanghai, initial bids exceeded supply by more than 280 times. Some mom-and-pop investors in Hong Kong are taking on 20 times leverage to supercharge their bets.Still, a smash-hit IPO doesn’t always translate into a long-term winner for investors. In Ant’s case, what could go wrong?Here are some of the biggest risks:RegulationAnt’s meteoric rise was made possible in part by China’s willingness to let it experiment. Now that the fintech giant is a dominant player in everything from payments to consumer lending, regulators are scrutinizing its every move.They’ve placed caps on the interest rates Ant and other financial institutions can charge for consumer loans, imposed new capital and licensing requirements, and restricted the size of some asset management products, among other measures. Financial regulation in China can be notoriously difficult to navigate, as Ant alluded to in its prospectus: “These laws, rules and regulations are highly complex, continuously evolving and could change or be reinterpreted to be burdensome or difficult to comply with.”The risks aren’t limited to China. Ant’s attempt to buy MoneyGram International Inc. was scuppered in 2018 by a U.S. government panel, while India recently blocked the company’s payments service amid rising border tensions. The Trump administration is mulling restrictions on Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. over concerns their payment platforms threaten U.S. national security, people familiar with the matter said this month, though any curbs would likely be challenged in court. The increasingly unfriendly stance toward Chinese tech firms is one of the biggest overhangs for Ant’s IPO, said Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX.“If investors fear further restrictions from the U.S. administration on Chinese tech companies, that might keep them away,” said Olivier d’Assier, head of applied research for Asia Pacific at risk advisory firm Qontigo, referring to the industry as a whole.CompetitionAnt’s Alipay service revolutionized the way Chinese people pay for things, both online and in physical shops. But it didn’t take long for rivals like Tencent to offer competing offerings. Ant’s market share of the Chinese mobile payments business, once around 75%, has dropped to about 55% as of June. A similar battle is now heating up in Ant’s other big money-maker: credit. Tencent has a growing consumer loan business and other tech giants like JD.com Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. are piling in.Then there’s the question of what Chinese banks will do. They currently pay billions in fees to Ant for originating loans to consumers and small businesses, but there’s no guarantee they’ll outsource that function forever. Ant itself has warned that partners may develop their own platforms to reach borrowers directly.China’s government is also an ever-present threat. The country’s central bank is developing a digital currency, and it’s not yet clear how Ant’s Alipay service will fit into the new system. Any erosion of the company’s role in China’s payments infrastructure could have ripple effects on other Ant businesses including credit, which utilizes Alipay’s huge data trove to assess the financial strength of borrowers who often lack collateral or formal credit histories. “A key fundamental risk would be slower-than-expected growth in digital payments,” said Victor Galliano, an analyst on Smartkarma.TechnologyAnt and its lending partner MYbank have long boasted of a risk-management system that analyzes more than 3,000 variables, allowing customers to apply for loans with a few taps on a smartphone and receive the cash almost instantly if they’re approved. While the companies have been less forthcoming about default rates, they were clocking at just over 1% before the pandemic.That number is impressive, but is it sustainable? Even Ant has cautioned that its lending algorithms have yet to be fully tested in a credit cycle. What’s more, the data underpinning its models could become harder to amass as attitudes toward privacy slowly shift in China.GovernanceMinority shareholders are unlikely to have much say when it comes to the way Ant is run. Ma currently controls the company through several entities that own Ant shares, and he’s likely to maintain significant influence after the IPO. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., meanwhile, owns about a third of Ant and will buy more shares to avoid having its stake diluted.Of course, anyone who backed Ma and his leadership team has thus far enjoyed stunning long-term returns. Alibaba, which the former teacher also co-founded, has surged more than four-fold since its New York IPO six years ago.But investors have reason to be wary. In 2010, Ma hived off Ant’s predecessor from Alibaba over the objections of shareholders including Yahoo! Inc. While he cited potential regulations that would have curbed foreign ownership of financial businesses, there may have been workarounds.ValuationInvestors will have to judge for themselves whether all these risks are reflected in Ant’s stock price. The company will command a valuation of at least $315 billion before it starts trading on Nov. 5, making it bigger than JPMorgan Chase & Co.Ant’s IPO pricing translates into a multiple of about 36 times estimated 2021 earnings, approaching the high end of its peers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan.(Adds story links in competition section.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Pessimist’s Guide to Jack Ma’s Record-Breaking Ant IPO
2020-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- To read more about stocks to watch if President Trump wins, click here.Investors are increasingly anticipating a Democratic sweep in next week’s U.S. elections, with sectors expected to benefit from a Joe Biden presidency advancing.Green-energy and some healthcare and housing stocks have climbed in the past couple of weeks as Biden has maintained his lead in the polls strengthened last month, increasing the likelihood of a flood of government spending if Democrats win across the board.With a Democratic sweep, investors may first zoom in on “prospects for stimulus in the first half of 2021 rather than the threat of tax increases that will surely follow,” Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky said by email. “I don’t think anyone wants to fight uphill against potentially trillions of dollars being injected into the economy, but the market will have to reckon with tax and regulatory changes.”At the moment, Biden leads Trump by about 8 percentage points in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Analysts though are sounding caution notes about the assumption of a guaranteed Biden victory, and the track record of Wall Street firms’ markets predictions has been sketchy at best.Still, even a win for Biden with a divided Congress could also spur optimism, analysts said. A GOP-led Senate would probably stymie many key Democratic ideas, such as potential tax hikes -- which are particularly worrying for stock investors.“Spending may be less, but tax rates won’t increase either” if Congress remains split, Integrity Asset Management portfolio manager Joe Gilbert said via email. A blue wave would mean “higher taxes will probably be a 2022 story” he said.Stimulus efforts and infrastructure spending may move forward if Republicans hold the Senate, albeit at potentially lower levels than if Democrats take over. Signs of pending expenditures would probably lift stocks across the board, particular banks and construction-material makers. To be sure, Trump’s 2016 talk of huge infrastructure spending didn’t yet materialize.For BI analysis of the upcoming election click here.Here’s what strategists are watching ahead of the vote (all percentages mentioned are year-to-date performances):China TradeWhile Biden would seek to ease relations and strained trade ties with allies, he’s likely to keep pushing on China. Domestic manufacturers stand to benefit from a made-in-America approach, while tech companies that have had their supply chains and sales prospects disrupted would continue to be challenged.Biden may move to oust Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges if they don’t submit to proper audit procedures, as would a Trump administration, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note. Biden, however, may tie worker and human rights issues to listing requirements, complicating a resolution, he said.With a Republican Senate, Biden could still proceed with executive actions, as Trump has with the House under Democratic control. Priorities might include bank and environmental regulations, with the oil industry coming under scrutiny.Key stocks: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (-29%), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (-15%), Exxon Mobil Corp. (-53%), Chevron Corp. (-42%), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (+50%), JD.com Inc. (+136%)Green Tech StocksSolar panel makers, electric vehicle makers and other clean-energy companies have gained on polling data and prospects for a win by Biden, who has a $2 trillion plan to achieve a carbon-free power sector by 2035. The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund, up 67% this year, has added 20% in little over a month.JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a “Biden basket” of stocks, including alternative energy and “green tech” companies such as First Solar Inc. and Tesla Inc., along with others that would benefit from infrastructure spending, minimum-wage and health-care reform. It has outperformed a corresponding Trump basket by 63% this year as of Oct. 23, according to strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.Key stocks: Tesla (+408%), First Solar (+47%), Vulcan Materials (-1.3%), Anthem (-1%), Amazon (+78%), Walmart (+20%)CannabisCannabis stocks may also see a bounce under Biden. Marijuana is probably headed toward federal decriminalization under either candidate, “but I think it happens much faster under Biden,” Stefanie Miller, managing director at FiscalNote Markets, said in an email.Key stocks: Curaleaf Holdings Inc. (+45%), Green Thumb Industries Inc. (+62%), Cresco Labs Inc. (+6.5%)HousingA Democratic sweep would be “favorable for housing,” Ivy Zelman, chief executive officer of real estate research firm Zelman & Associates said in September, partly because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac probably wouldn’t exit conservatorship. Those companies going private would probably result in higher mortgage costs with Republicans in power, she said.A fresh slate of housing officials could also move to reduce the higher finance costs Black households pay compared with others.Key stocks: D.R. Horton Inc. (+31%), Lennar Corp. (+30%) PulteGroup Inc. (+6.5%)Financials, CryptoAuto lenders would probably face “increased scrutiny and more regulation,” under Biden, according to Cowen’s Seiberg, while big banks’ ability to acquire other firms may be restricted. Big bank capital requirements may also tighten, while limits on dividends and a ban on buybacks may be extended, he said.A Biden team would be “more dubious” toward cryptocurrencies and may make fresh demands for consumer protection and anti-money laundering compliance, Seiberg said. That could boost the chances for a Federal Reserve digital dollar, and may be negative for Bitcoin and Facebook Inc.’s Libra.Key stocks: Ally Financial Inc.

2020-10-29,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. has taken the wraps off its first consumer gadget -- a $100 lamp with built-in displays for kids -- as TikTok’s Chinese owner deepens its foray into online education.The company touted its smart lamp with a touch screen, camera and built-in voice assistant that can tutor schoolchildren on their homework. Parents can check in remotely via a mobile app connected to the lamp’s camera. ByteDance’s range of educational products, including the lamp, will be offered under a new brand called Dali -- which means “big force.”“I’m worried that recent fundraising mostly flowed to after-school tutoring,” said ByteDance senior vice president Chen Lin during a livestreamed event in Beijing. “We’ll focus on all scenarios, offering our children a better learning system.”The company will adopt a “Big Education” approach, targeting not only students but also teachers and institutions, Chen added.Known as an “app factory,” ByteDance has regularly churned out mobile offerings from newsreader Toutiao to TikTok’s Chinese cousin Douyin. But the world’s largest startup -- valued at $140 billion by CBInsights -- is struggling to find its next breakout hit amid a U.S. campaign against its biggest international success so far, TikTok. Billionaire founder Zhang Yiming has entrusted his chief lieutenant Chen, who previously headed Toutiao, to make bets in the heated arena of online learning.Chen has previously said ByteDance’s education arm will invest without considering profitability in the next three years. The unit already has more than 10,000 employees, including tutors. The company runs a stable of learning apps for everything from one-on-one English tutoring to classroom-style maths cramming. It’s seeking to tap demand for after-school tutoring from affluent households, competing against incumbents like TAL Education Group, as well as deep-pocketed upstarts like Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed VIPKid.Hardware could complement ByteDance’s push into online education, creating an Apple Inc.-style ecosystem that locks in users with gadgets as well as content. The Dali smart lamp went on sale on Chinese e-commerce sites in July, but ByteDance has only now revealed that it’s behind the product, which has so far garnered nearly 3,000 buyer comments on JD.com.Louis Yang, a co-founder of Musical.ly -- the app acquired by ByteDance that morphed into TikTok -- is the lamp’s product head.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s Owner Sells Its First Consumer Gadget.

Not six months ago, Pinterest was courting $15. Now it’s a stone’s throw from $70. In the short run, overbought conditions are cropping up. Indeed, profit-taking caused the stock to close $6 off the highs. Regardless, the strength of its overall uptrend demands any dips be bought.
I suggest watching for a pause or pullback to form over the coming days. Either development will create a compelling opportunity to deploy bullish trades.
Consider selling put spreads to capitalize, such as the December $53/$48 bull put for around 70 cents.

August’s earnings report lit a fire under JD stock and it’s been burning bright ever since. Sure, the Chinese tech company saw a mild swoon in September, but it never breached any key support zones and ultimately was a pause that refreshed higher. Over the past month, a high base pattern has formed, creating a handle to the previous two-month cup.
On Thursday, an accumulation day ushered prices to the doorstep of a breakout. The long upper shadow revealed late-day selling that reinforces the significance of the $85 resistance level. Ultimately, that’s the zone that needs to be pierced to complete and confirm the cup-and-handle pattern.
Given the powerful trend propelling JD stock this year, it’s only a matter of time before the next up-leg kicks off.

2020 is turning into the ultimate turnaround story for Nio. This week’s surge demands I include it among top stocks to buy. The red-hot electric vehicle company has now traveled from $2 to over $30 in a little over six months.
What’s perhaps most impressive about the run is the consistency. You’ll often see a rocket ship stock like this experience sharp corrections along the way to scare the children and shake the weak hands out.
But NIO has done nothing of the sort. Each retreat has stopped dead at the rising 20-day moving average. We haven’t even touched the 50-day since April. And just as every dip has been bought, every breakout has delivered swift, easy profits.
Thursday was no different. NIO launched 16% in short order on explosive volume. It couldn’t be any more apparent that the stock cares not a whit about all of the drama weighing on the broader market.
I find it challenging to chase new entries here, particularly with earnings coming around the corner. I suggest lying in wait to snatch this one up into weakness. Naked puts pay a pretty penny, so that’s my play of choice if you want a higher probability of profit.

2020-11-03,"(Bloomberg) -- For American brands struggling to survive the resurgent coronavirus, China is proving to be one of the few bright spots. As Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. prepares to host its biggest and most global shopping marathon ever, its position as a gateway to the world’s fastest-recovering economy is winning points with an increasingly hostile U.S. administration.Alibaba’s Singles’ Day event culminates annually Nov. 11, an online shopping phenomenon that with $38 billion of sales in 2019 easily dwarfed Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The festivities, which provide a snapshot of Chinese consumption, will feature the largest international presence since the company pioneered the format 11 years ago, including a number of U.S. merchants making their first forays into the Asian market.One such company, Uncle Bud’s, is targeting at least 1 million yuan ($150,000) of sales, all through its online store on Alibaba’s Tmall Global platform. The Los Angeles-based personal care goods maker has roped in former NBA superstar Magic Johnson to hawk its hemp and cannabis-based products like body gels and lotions to Chinese shoppers in a livestream ahead of Single’s Day.“Tmall really embraces finding brands that are emerging and bringing them to Chinese consumers,” Uncle Bud’s co-founder Bruno Schiavi said in an interview. “We wanted to have a big powerful company behind us. As an emerging brand from the U.S. to the China market, there are always many steps. But having Tmall behind you, to us that’s fantastic.”China’s largest annual online shopping fiesta is only the flashiest example of how American consumer brands have increasingly come to rely on the world’s No. 2 economy for growth. For them, Alibaba affords one of the biggest windows into China’s rising middle class -- American merchants commanded the second-highest sales after Japanese among importers in 2019’s edition. That’s especially true this year, with companies like Estée Lauder Cos. and Nike Inc. banking on the Chinese consumer to help recoup some of the sales lost in the pandemic-induced global economic slowdown.That fact is likely not lost on Washington. The online retail giant’s domestic focus -- international commerce accounts for just 7% of total sales -- means the company has limited access to potentially sensitive personal data, unlike fellow Chinese internet giants ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.Donald Trump has attempted to ban ByteDance’s TikTok and the WeChat super-app, owned by Tencent, in the runup to the presidential elections and he may be emboldened by a second term to continue decoupling Washington from Beijing. Even if Trump loses in Tuesday’s election, a Biden presidency will likely not lead to a strategy overhaul, with the Democratic candidate shifting toward a more confrontational tone toward China over the past few years.Read more: This Is What Biden Has Said on Major U.S. Flashpoints With ChinaMany Americans will not have heard of Singles’ Day, a uniquely Chinese antidote to the sentimentality surrounding Valentine’s Day. Originating in college campuses across the country, it takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached.This year, the promotional blitz has been expanded, with pre-sales starting on Oct. 21. U.S. merchants such as Nike, Apple Inc. and Estée Lauder were among 100 brands that achieved revenue of at least 100 million yuan in the first 111 minutes after sales promos commenced Nov. 1, Alibaba said.More than 2,600 new foreign brands will be featured on Tmall Global for the first time ever in 2020. Earlier this year, the company held its inaugural Go Global 11.11 Pitch Fest offering American merchants that have no physical operations in China a chance to be spotlighted during the event. Uncle Bud’s emerged as one of the winners, alongside eight other companies that will bring a range of products from vegan face creams to purple hairdye and drinking vinegars to the Chinese market for the first time.Alibaba is hoping its growing role as middleman to global merchants can help revive flagging growth. Its revenue is expected on average to increase 31% in the September quarter, the slowest pace on record for the period. The company is set to report results on Thursday.Read more: Trump Adds to Earnings Threat as Alibaba Challenged in China“For certain categories, like cosmetics, apparel and electronics, if you want to win in China, you have to win e-commerce,” said Jonathan Cheng, partner and head of China retail at Bain & Co. “And if you want to win e-commerce, you have to work with the leaders.”Nearly 800 million annual active shoppers frequent Alibaba’s wide array of platforms, ranging from the Ebay-style Taobao site to Amazon-like Tmall and grocery service Freshippo. That’s helped the company turn itself into Asia’s largest -- one that’s on its way to joining the trillion-dollar club after gaining almost $370 billion of market value since its Covid-19 trough in March. That’s roughly one Walmart Inc. or Tesla Inc.But its pole position is being challenged on multiple fronts. Upstart Pinduoduo Inc. is offering cheaper bargains, JD.com Inc. has expanded beyond its traditional strength in consumer electronics, while Tencent-backed Meituan is engaged in a fierce battle with Alibaba’s Ele.me food delivery app.While its core commerce business -- which accounted for 87% of revenue in the June quarter -- has been relatively unscathed by U.S.-China tensions, it is in cloud computing where Alibaba faces the most direct threat from the White house. As part of Trump’s broader campaign to prevent Chinese companies from accessing the private data of Americans, the so-called Clean Network Initiative unveiled by U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sought to stop U.S. firms from using cloud computing services offered by Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Inc.More recently, people within the Trump administration are said to be exploring potential restrictions on Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, though that hasn’t dented enthusiasm for the fintech giant’s blockbuster IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai.Still, Alibaba executives have repeatedly touted their role in connecting American merchants like Uncle Bud’s with Chinese buyers. “As the world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba’s primary commercial focus in the U.S. is to support our American brands, retailers, small businesses and the farmers to sell to consumers and the trade partners in China,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in August.Read more: Alibaba Appeals to Trump, Says it Supports U.S. BusinessesIt’s this function that may give the next U.S. administration pause when it comes to Alibaba, said Paul Triolo, a former U.S. government official who specializes in global technology policy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.“There is no indication that the U.S. government wants to go after Alibaba’s Taobao platform in the U.S., which targets small and medium sized US companies to allow them to access the China market,” Triolo said. Some politicians on Capitol Hill are “concerned about the market impact of any attempt to go after a large consumer-facing Chinese platform,” he added.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s long-term growth could be propelled by the company’s multi-pronged strategy to broaden its global presence beyond near-term geopolitical pressures. It’s capitalizing on worldwide consumption through export platform AliExpress, China import demand via Tmall Global, and pushing directly into local markets through subsidiaries such as Lazada.\-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research(Updates with Alibaba’s market cap gains in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Magic Johnson Selling Gels Shows Why Alibaba Escaped Trump

2020-11-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s U.S.-traded shares tumbled as much as 9.7% Tuesday after Ant Group Co., the finance affiliate also founded by Jack Ma, said its listings in both Shanghai and Hong Kong have been suspended.Ant’s listing in Shanghai was halted amid changes in the regulatory environment, according to a statement, which didn’t provide further details. With the initial public offering in Hong Kong also on hold, Ant’s $35 billion share sale is in limbo.Alibaba owns about a third of the payments company, which was expected to begin trading on both exchanges on Thursday. Its American depository receipts slumped the most intraday since March 16.The surprise move in China is stirring questions from investors about whether a broader regulatory shift could be underway. Other Chinese companies that trade in the U.S. also fell Tuesday. JD.com Inc. dropped 1.4%, while Lufax Holding Ltd. slipped 8%.

2020-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue grew at its slowest pace on record for a September quarter, underscoring how the e-commerce giant’s post-pandemic rebound is starting to plateau.Asia’s largest corporation reported a 30% rise in sales in the September quarter, in line with expectations but down a tad from the previous three months. That did little to reassure investors worried about the tightening regulatory scrutiny that forced Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. to call off its $35 billion IPO. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang would only say it’s evaluating the impact on its business from more stringent rules governing its 32%-owned sister company.Alibaba’s shares sank as much as 4.3% in early Hong Kong trading, extending a volatile streak that began with a selloff of more than $60 billion earlier this week. The company enjoys a close relationship with Ant, whose Alipay mobile wallet anchors the majority of Alibaba’s e-commerce transactions and whose microlending services drive consumption. In response to a question about the extent to which Ant loans lead to online shopping, executives said the company doesn’t quantify that traffic.“As Ant Group’s major shareholder, Alibaba is actively evaluating the impact on our business in response to the recently proposed changes in the fintech regulatory environment, and will take appropriate measures accordingly,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call.Read more: Inside the Chaotic Unraveling of Jack Ma’s $35 Billion IPOAlibaba booked almost 4.7 billion yuan of profit from Ant in the September quarter, a big chunk of its overall bottom line. The e-commerce giant reported revenue for the three months ended September of 155.1 billion yuan ($23.4 billion), meeting the 154.8 billion yuan average of estimates. Profit fell 60% to 28.8 billion yuan from a year earlier, when it booked a one-time gain from the acquisition of its stake in Ant.Alibaba had benefited from stronger sales in its home market, which had led the global recovery from Covid-19. Gross domestic product grew 4.9% last quarter, making China the world’s only major growth engine. The e-commerce titan is banking on more than a quarter of a million brands, increased discounting and technologies like livestreamed selling to draw consumers to its annual blockbuster Single’s Day shopping festival, which culminates next week.“The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch. “E-commerce is the only sector that will actually benefit from coronavirus, simply due to the fact that a lot of normal consumption is shifted from offline to online.”Click here for a live blog on the numbers.Read more: Magic Johnson Selling Gels Shows Why Alibaba Escaped TrumpAlibaba’s shares have gained more than 60% from their Covid-19-era lows in March and touched a record high in October when Ant priced its IPO. Retail and institutional investors had flocked to the record $35 billion-plus IPO, betting that Ant will overcome high valuations, regulatory headwinds and rising competition to reshape the future of global finance.Excluding the Covid-hit March quarter, the 29% increase in Alibaba’s core commerce business was the slowest in more than five years as consumers put off purchases ahead of Single’s Day. The closely watched customer management revenue for China commerce rose 20% in the quarter. Core commerce should expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2021 to 2023, CGS-CIMB analysts including Lei Yang wrote.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba may continue to benefit from accelerated user and merchant adoption of online grocery shopping, cloud computing and remote-work applications, driven by China’s Covid-19 outbreak. Its domestic retail marketplaces have fully recovered from the pandemic. Longer-term sales and profit growth could be driven by global expansion and the monetization of newer business segments such as logistics, media and entertainment.\-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Revenue for Alibaba’s cloud division jumped 60% in the quarter, driven by demand from customers in the internet, finance and retail industries. The unit is forecast to turn profitable for the first time ever in the year ending March, a target that was reiterated by Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu on Thursday. That will be a milestone for the decade-old business, which competes with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp. and Google globally and is fending off upstarts like Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home.Alibaba is keeping up a steady pace of acquisitions to drive growth. The company teamed up with Richemont to jointly invest $1.1 billion in luxury e-commerce retailer Farfetch Ltd. to tap on the burgeoning demand for highend foreign goods among China’s middle class, according to a statement Thursday. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday the country may import more than $22 trillion worth of products over the next decade.In October, Alibaba also agreed to take a stake in Swiss duty-free giant Dufry AG, a move that Zhang said would be a “very important step” in helping the company grow its retail travel business as China develops domestic free trade ports. And to capitalize on the boom in online groceries, it last month paid about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., taking control of one of China’s largest hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD.com Inc., upstart Pinduoduo Inc. and Tencent-backed Meituan.Read more: Magic Johnson Selling Gels Shows U.S. Brands Flocking to Alibaba(Updates with investments in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba’s Slowing Sales Spook Investors On Edge Over Ant

Call me crazy, but it’s what I was born to do. I can’t get enough of it.
Here’s something you may not know about me: I am also an entrepreneur.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I love starting and growing a business. My first was my money management firm, Penn Financial Group, which is still going strong after 16 years.
I also own a small exercise studio in Baltimore that is doing well (and is a great place to work out and burn off stress!).
But there’s one other business I want to tell you about today. I don’t own it anymore, so I’m not trying to promote it.
I want you to know about it because of what it can do for you and your financial dreams …
I have a soft spot for very small companies with innovative ideas giving everything they have to get off the ground and be successful.
And I love investing and making money — obviously.
In 2016, I combined those two loves by starting a company I called Crowdvest. That name is a combination of “crowd” and “invest,” and it was one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms.
I discovered early on the massive potential of investing in the private equity markets. As we’ve talked about recently, the whole game changed when the government passed the last part of the JOBS Act that made it possible for everybody to participate in a market that was previously closed to 99% of us.
As a pioneer in the new industry, I was able to see the huge potential early on and how big it would be in the coming years. I started Crowdvest because I wanted to help average investors gain exposure to private deals.
I hunted down and vetted the most promising private businesses on the market. I helped a couple companies raise money and eventually go public. I loved it.
Earlier this year, I sold the Crowdvest business as well as the related broker-dealer Crowdvest Securities to concentrate on my other ventures. That being said, I just could not ignore the massive potential in private investing for individual investors.
These opportunities have too much potential to create life-changing wealth.
That’s why I hope you’ll join me for my upcoming special event next Tuesday, November 10 at 7 p.m. ET. We’re going to talk all about this formerly “secret” market that was reserved for only the wealthiest of people. It’s free to attend. You can simply click here now and you’ll be all set.
Here’s the kind of potential I’m talking about:
Let’s start with the fact that the richest 1% of Americans own nearly 40% of our country’s wealth. The common cliché is true … the rich grow richer while most everyone else struggles to get ahead.
But my advice is this: Don’t get mad about not being in the 1%. Instead, if you can’t beat them, join them! Because now you can.
You can now use the same strategy that has helped America’s wealthiest families grow richer … year after year.
By investing in private business deals.
The numbers you see from private companies are simply not common with stocks.
Here’s the proof …
The first investors of Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) stock are now up 5X. But this isn’t even close to how private Facebook shares performed … they saw a 1,200X gain!
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), the Chinese tech company, has grown 3X since it went public in 2014. But you would’ve seen a 240X return if you bought JD’s private shares instead.
And get this … Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock has LOST 96% since it went public. But investors who bought Groupon private shares saw a 520-fold winner. That’s a huge difference!
Here’s one more example. WhatsApp is a free messaging application for smartphones. A $25,000 investment in its private seed round would’ve turned into $68 million … a 2,750-fold return.
How would $68 million change your life?
The list of private businesses that generated millions and even billions of dollars for early investors is a long one.
And that brings me to the bottom line. Backing private businesses is often the highest upside investment you can possibly make. 
We talked in Thursday’s article about how more and more money is flowing into private deals. This news just got better this past week when it became official that the Regulation CF (one of the recent legal changes) will increase nearly 5X from $1.07 million to $5 million.
This will open up the floodgates for new opportunities. More entrepreneurs will have the ability to raise money via the crowd. And we, the crowd, will have more opportunities to find the life-changing investment opportunities.
Just like Silicon Valley has been for years. And just like the wealthiest people in America have for years.
I no longer run an early stage equity funding firm, but thanks to recent government decisions, I am able to help anyone learn how to take part in private investing.
That’s why I hope to see you Tuesday night for this free special event that explains the private investing opportunity in front of you and how it all works.

2020-11-10,Beijing is seeking public opinion on a regulation that analysts think could lead to antitrust measures focused on internet marketplace companies.,Chinese Internet Stocks Tumble Because Regulatory Risk Is Back
2020-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping’s Communist Party stepped up efforts to rein in some of China’s most powerful companies, jolting investors and dealing a blow to the country’s richest entrepreneurs.Beijing on Tuesday unveiled regulations to root out monopolistic practices in the internet industry, seeking to curtail the growing influence of corporations like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The rules, which sent both stocks tumbling over two frenetic days and sparked a wider selloff in Chinese equities, landed about a week after new restrictions on the finance sector triggered the shock suspension of Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion initial public offering.While Xi’s government has been steadily tightening its grip on the world’s second-largest economy, it has until recently taken a relatively hands off approach toward businesses that dominate China’s burgeoning internet, e-commerce and digital finance industries. Authorities are concerned the companies have become too powerful, according to Ma Chen, a Beijing-based partner at Han Kun Law Offices.“This is a watershed moment,” said Ma, who specializes in antitrust.Alibaba, Ant and Tencent alone commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion before last week, easily surpassing state-owned behemoths like Bank of China Ltd. as the country’s most valuable companies. Wednesday’s selloff sent Alibaba shares down another 7% to its lowest since August in Hong Kong, while analysts have estimated that Ant’s $280 billion valuation could be cut in half due to stricter regulations. That’s after Alibaba’s 5% decline Tuesday. Both companies were co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, China’s most celebrated businessman.Tencent, the gaming to payments giant whose rise turned co-founder Pony Ma into China’s richest man, fell as much as 6% Wednesday in Hong Kong after sinking 4.4% the previous day. Meituan, the food-delivery startup that has since expanded into hotel bookings and movie tickets, dived a further 6% before paring losses. It had tumbled 10.5% Tuesday. The company declined to comment while representatives from Alibaba and Tencent didn’t immediately respond to queries.China’s antitrust watchdog is seeking feedback on a raft of regulations that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior such as colluding on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors. They may also require companies that operate a so-called Variable Interest Entity -- a vehicle through which virtually every major Chinese internet company attracts foreign investment and lists overseas -- to apply for specific operating approval.More on the Variable Interest Entity, how China IPOs tap investorsThe latest proposal follows heightened scrutiny of technology companies worldwide, as regulators investigate the extent to which internet giants from Facebook Inc. to Alphabet Inc.’s Google can leverage their dominance. Consumers in China -- home to some of the world’s largest corporations from e-commerce giant Alibaba to WeChat-operator Tencent -- have in recent years protested against the gradual erosion of their privacy via technology from facial recognition to big data analysis.Read more: China Targets Internet Giants in Antitrust Law OverhaulBeijing is increasingly seeking to diminish the influence that a handful of its tech corporations wield over vast swathes of the economy. It investigated Tencent’s music arm’s exclusive agreements with publishers last year and, most recently, modified regulations to rein in risk at fast-growing micro-lending entities such as Ant Group. The latter step derailed Ant’s planned IPO last week, before it was to complete what would have been the world’s largest such offering on record.“There seems to be a broader China government sentiment that internet platforms are becoming too powerful,” said Hoi Tak Leung, a Hong Kong-based lawyer specializing in Chinese internet companies at Ashurst LLP. “This would be consistent with worldwide developments as well.”The new rules were proposed in accordance with and build on China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, which in January included broad language governing internet companies for the first time. They restrict targeting specific customers through their online behavior, a common practice adopted by players both at home and abroad. Under the regulations unveiled by the State Administration of Market Regulation, violators may be forced to divest assets, intellectual property or technologies, open up their infrastructure and adjust their algorithms. The watchdog will seek public feedback on the regulations till Nov. 30.Representatives from Alibaba, Tencent, TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. and 24 other tech giants attended a meeting with regulators from the antitrust and cyberspace authorities earlier this month to discuss issues ranging from unfair competition to counterfeiting. “Internet platforms are not outside the reach of antitrust laws, nor are they the breeding ground for unfair competition,” the regulators said in a subsequent statement.Further measures to tighten oversight of the tech companies may be in the offing. Regulators plan to release new rules governing internet transactions by June 2021, according to a State Council statement released Tuesday.The government is now trying to update its laws for the internet era, to adapt to an industry where market dominance isn’t always easily quantifiable. In the past, China used revenue or market share to determine whether a company held a monopoly. But those precepts may not apply to internet firms, which sometimes control valuable information that haven’t yet been monetized.JD.com, for instance, has accused bigger rival Alibaba of unfairly locking in exclusive agreements with merchants, which Alibaba has denied. Regulators have investigated the legality of Cheng Wei’s Didi Chuxing acquiring Uber Technologies Inc.’s Chinese business. And Tencent’s WeChat dominates many aspects of daily Chinese life from payments to gaming, though ByteDance, co-founded by Zhang Yiming, has in recent years begun to eat into its advertising business through video service Douyin and news platform Toutiao.Alibaba and Tencent now dominate e-commerce and gaming, but are also key backers of leaders in adjacent businesses such as Wang Xing’s Meituan and car-hailing leader Didi. They’ve together invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world’s largest smartphone and internet arena by users. Companies like ByteDance and Tencent-rival NetEase Corp., controlled by William Ding, that have risen to prominence without backing from either of the pair are viewed as rare exceptions. In other areas, Robin Li’s Baidu Inc. dominates online search.Hong Kong Tech Stock Gauge Slides on China Antitrust Rules“The Party is faced with the conflicting desires to empower domestic tech companies to be internationally competitive, while keeping their market activities firmly under control at home,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at the Trivium China consultancy in Beijing. “The horizontal spread of Chinese big tech makes anti-monopoly regulation that much more urgent for Chinese regulators.”Han Kun Law’s Ma said the specific regulation pertaining to VIEs requiring approval should be of concern to much of the industry as well. The model has never been formally endorsed by Beijing but has been used by tech titans such as Alibaba to list their shares overseas. Under the structure, Chinese corporations transfer profits to an offshore entity with shares that foreign investors can then own. Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the VIE framework rests on shaky legal ground and foreign investors have been nervous about their bets unwinding overnight.“It will not only have a huge impact on Alibaba but also all the companies that use a platform business model and a VIE structure,” Ma said.(Updates with Wednesday’s selloff from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on Notice
2020-11-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese technology giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd shed almost $290 billion of market value over two days of frantic selling, as investors scrambled to assess the fallout from Beijing’s broadest attempt to rein in its most powerful private-sector firms.Technology shares tumbled for a second day after Beijing issued regulations designed to curb the growing influence of internet-sector leaders including JD.com Inc., Meituan and Xiaomi Corp. The Hang Seng Tech Index slumped more than 6% on Wednesday in Hong Kong, taking its two-day loss to 11%. Shares in the quintet of firms have sunk at least 11% over two sessions.Beijing on Tuesday unveiled regulations to root out monopolistic practices in the internet industry, pivoting away from a mostly hands-off approach while dealing a blow to businesses at the heart of the world’s No. 2 economy. The vaguely worded edict landed a week after new restrictions on finance triggered the shock suspension of Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion initial public offering, scuppering founder Jack Ma’s ambitions to dominate online finance in the process. They also emerged on the eve of Singles’ Day, the event Ma invented a decade ago that’s evolved into the nation’s largest annual shopping spree.”China’s Big Tech will have to rethink their business models,” said Zhan Hao, a managing partner with Beijing-based Anjie Law Firm. “The philosophy of internet companies is winner-takes-all, and especially for platform operators, they garner user traffic and build up ecosystems that are similar to each other.”Read more: China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on NoticeXi Jinping’s government is increasingly curtailing the influence of the private corporations that’ve become the country’s main driver of growth. Despite sporadic crackdowns on narrow spheres from mobile gaming to online counterfeits, the likes of Alibaba and Tencent have mostly been free to acquire and invest in new businesses, becoming key backers of prominent startups while building sprawling empires that now span e-commerce, digital finance, social media and entertainment.“I literally gasped when I first read these guidelines,” said John Dong, securities attorney at Joint-Win Partners in Shanghai. “The timing -- on the eve of Singles’ Day -- the forcefulness and the resolve to remake the tech giants is startling.”China’s antitrust watchdog is seeking feedback on rules that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior such as colluding on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors. They may also require companies that operate a so-called Variable Interest Entity -- a vehicle through which virtually every major Chinese internet company attracts foreign investment and lists overseas -- to apply for specific operating approval.“Internet giants have expanded their reach into various sectors like finance and health care that are vital to the economy and that really concerns regulators,” said Shen Meng, director of Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “The move could discourage firms in the tech sector to list in the near term as those impacted will need time to adjust their businesses accordingly.”China Clampdown on Big Tech Puts More Billionaires on NoticeOn Nov. 3, policy makers shocked the investment world by suspending an initial public offering by Ant Group, a fintech company controlled by billionaire Ma. The decision came just two days before its shares were set to trade in a listing that attracted at least $3 trillion of orders from individual investors. China’s top banking watchdog then doubled down on the push to rein in financial technology companies, promising Wednesday to eliminate monopolistic practices and strengthen risk controls.That came on top of a series of regulatory pronouncements this week targeted at the tech industry. The new regulations for the internet sector signal a “further tightening” of the online economy, although the real impact will depend on how the rules are enforced, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Alex Yao wrote in a note.The proposed regulations come at a bad time for tech shares, which are already under pressure from a global rotation that has sent the Nasdaq Composite Index almost 3% lower this week.“Beijing’s tightening regulations, including the antitrust laws, is a heavy blow to the technology giants,” said Daniel So, Hong Kong-based strategist at CMB International Securities Ltd. “It’s an additional blow to the shares, when investors are rotating out of the sector into old-economy shares because of the vaccine boost,” he said, adding that firms such as Tencent and Alibaba will continue to face downside pressure.(Updates with latest share action from the first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Leads Chinese Internet Selloff Nearing $290 Billion

2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Pinduoduo Inc.’s revenue rose a better-than-expected 89% as the shift toward online shopping continued in post-Covid China, benefiting the e-commerce upstart. The shares surged roughly 16% in pre-market trading in New York.The Shanghai-based company logged sales of 14.2 billion yuan ($2.14 billion) in the September quarter, surpassing the 12.2 billion yuan average of estimates. Its net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders narrowed to 784.7 million yuan from 2.3 billion yuan a year earlier, though it remained in the red largely due to the hefty subsidies Pinduoduo spent to acquire new shoppers as well as keep existing ones. Gross merchandise value rose 73%, the slowest pace since the company went public in 2018.The strong results helped to reassure investors after Beijing this week unveiled new antitrust guidelines governing the internet sector, sparking a $290 billion selloff. Shares of Pinduduo -- China’s third-largest ecommerce platform after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. -- dropped in tandem with its Chinese peers, though they have since recouped all the losses. China’s antitrust watchdog on Tuesday released a set of detailed guidelines to curb unfair competition such as sharing of sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to edge out competitors.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysPinduoduo’s operating losses may widen sequentially as it steps up marketing and promotion activities to acquire more customers, and to drive more purchases from their existing base. Sales growth may stay very strong as the company continues to increase the monetization of its new users.\-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchCo-founded by former Google employee Colin Huang in 2015, the Groupon-like shopping app has quickly built a large user base, especially in smaller towns and rural China, thanks in part to generous discounts. In an attempt to shake off its reputation as a purveyor of low-end products, the company in April sold new iPhone SE handsets for less than the official price. It also clashed with Tesla Inc. in August, when it offered Model 3 Sedans at a discount.Under the new antitrust rules, platform operators will no longer be allowed to lure in users with price wars, a move that may force Pinduoduo to stop offering huge subsidies to gain market share.”We are aware of the regulation and we are looking into it,” said David Liu, vice president of Pinduoduo, in an interview on Thursday. “We have always operated in compliance with regulations,” he added.Still, some analysts expect Pinduoduo to benefit from the policy change in the long run. “After the antitrust rules, Alibaba’s capability to offer exclusive merchants on its platforms would be diminished,” Morningstar Inc. said in a research note before the results. “Smaller platforms could take advantage,” the note said, without naming specific companies.Gross merchandise value rose to 1.46 trillion yuan in the three months ended September from a year earlier. Average monthly active users rose to 643.4 million, up from 568.8 million in the previous quarter.PDD has stepped up its attempt to gain a larger slice of multi-billion-dollar online grocery market, the next frontier of China’s e-commerce war. While efforts to sell more fruits, vegetables and other fresh produces will likely boost sales in the long run, the company may struggle to turn a profit in the near term, due to increased expenditure on logistics and supply chain.“The company might stay loss-making this year as user growth, boosting purchase frequency, and expanding agricultural products remain top priorities,” CLSA said in a Nov. 1 research report.(Updates with share price in first paragraph, executive’s comments in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Pinduoduo Shares Jump as Post-Covid Spending Lift Sales by 89%

2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. just turned in an impressive quarter, reporting record net income that beat estimates by the most in two years. But the timing is a bit unfortunate.Having ridden through the Covid-19 storm relatively unscathed, the Chinese games and social media giant must now navigate the country’s antitrust regulators. So perhaps this isn’t the best moment to show how savvy and powerful it is.Shares of Tencent and its peers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Meituan and JD.com Inc. took a battering this week after Beijing released a much-anticipated draft of new anti-monopoly laws. Leveraging user data or subsidizing services at below cost are among the practices under scrutiny in the proposed regulations.So far it’s generally believed that Alibaba, its fintech affiliate Ant Group Ltd., and Meituan are among the most likely to hurt from those rules, as they’re currently proposed. But Tencent is definitely on the radar. Its ownership of WeChat makes it the nation’s most dominant instant-messaging service, and it shares a virtual duopoly with Ant in the mobile-payments business. Traditionally an online and mobile games provider, the company has been tweaking its business model to leverage two decades of accumulated knowledge and consumer data to push into new areas such as advertising, content, and commercial services. It celebrated that move at the top of its earnings press release Thursday. This quarter marked the second anniversary of our strategic organisation upgrade, which was intended to enhance our strength in Consumer Internet and extend our presence to Industrial Internet.To investors, “enhance our strength” is exactly the kind of phrase you want to hear from management. But such terms may also catch the eye of regulators who are intent on hunting down and reining in monopolistic businesses.It’s hard to argue that the company has used its unrivaled power in social media — particularly via the WeChat and QQ messengers — to deliver highly-targeted ads to consumers. This close connection with customers has in turn helped drive payment volumes at its fintech business by 30% and boost the number of wealth management clients by 50%. Leveraging these cross-platform synergies is what it ought to do, and it’s precisely why investors have rewarded the stock with a 75% rise over the past 12 months. But Beijing, already unhappy with rival Ant’s fintech business model, may not be happy that Tencent is publicizing such impressive feats.Management could well make the case that its widening profits in services, fintech, and advertising are purely organic, not the product of any monopolistic muscle-flexing. It may also help that most of its revenue comes from the more pedestrian business of online games, where solid titles and distribution matter more than consumer data or pricing power. But that may not matter. As Beijing starts hunting antitrust violators, Chinese internet companies would be wise to not crow too loudly.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- With 22 pages of vaguely worded edicts, China has cast doubt on the future of its biggest internet companies and ignited a $290 billion equity selloff.Investors are now gaming out how bad it might get for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other Chinese internet giants as Xi Jinping’s government prepares to roll out a raft of new anti-monopoly regulations.As is almost always the case, the country’s leaders have said little about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they decided to act now. But the draft rules released Tuesday give the government wide latitude to rein in tech entrepreneurs like Jack Ma who until recently enjoyed an unusual amount of freedom to expand their empires across nearly every aspect of Chinese life.The country’s internet ecosystem -- which has long been protected from competition by the likes of Google and Facebook -- is dominated by two companies, Alibaba and Tencent, through a labyrinthine network of investment that encompasses the vast majority of the country’s startups in arenas from AI (SenseTime, Megvii) to fresh veggies (Meicai) and digital finance (Ant Group). Their patronage has also groomed a new generation of titans including food and travel giant Meituan and Didi Chuxing -- China’s Uber. Those that prosper outside their aura, the largest being TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd., are rare.The anti-monopoly rules now threaten to upset that status quo with a range of potential outcomes, from a benign scenario of fines to a break-up of industry leaders. While few China watchers claim to know where in that spectrum authorities will land, most view this week as a turning point.“The Wild West era of policy arbitrage -- taking advantage of weak regulations over the sector -- has come to an end,” said John Dong, a securities attorney at Joint-Win Partners in Shanghai.Here are some of the scenarios analysts and investors are considering:MildOptimists say regulators are merely re-asserting their right to oversee internet companies, without trying to initiate drastic change.Even if authorities do take action, China has a tradition of cracking down in fits and starts, or making examples out of high-profile companies. Tencent, for instance, became a prominent target of a campaign to combat gaming addiction among children in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they eventually recovered to all-time highs. Alibaba has done the same after running afoul of authorities on everything from unfairly squeezing merchants to turning a blind eye to fakes. Both companies were worth around $800 billion before shares began tanking this month.“Each internet leader may face some impact and have to adjust their practices, but the regulations will unlikely affect their leadership,” said Elinor Leung, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Internet platforms, by nature, are scale businesses.”Read more: What Five Alibaba Investors Are Doing With Their Plunging SharesLiu Bo, Alibaba’s general manager of Tmall marketing and operations, said on the sidelines of the company’s Singles’ Day celebration on Wednesday that he wasn’t surprised by the new rules and that the government was “improving” oversight across various industries.Chinese internet stocks led by Meituan and Tencent gained at least 3% Thursday, recouping some of their two-day loss.BadSome analysts predict there’s a crackdown coming, but a targeted one. They point to language in the regulations that suggests a heavy focus on online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. The regulations specifically warn against selling at below-cost to weed out rivals.Those kinds of strategies helped drive eBay Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. out of China and have led companies including Alibaba, JD.com Inc., and upstart Pinduoduo Inc. to accuse each other of using underhanded tactics.Read more: Alibaba Singles’ Day Ends Strongly as Beijing Storm ApproachesAlso embedded within the rules is a reference to the need for official approval on all mergers and acquisitions involving Variable Interest Entities. The VIE model has never been formally endorsed by Beijing but has been used by tech titans such as Alibaba to list shares overseas. Under the structure, Chinese corporations transfer profits to an offshore entity with shares that foreign investors can then own. Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the VIE framework rests on shaky legal ground and foreign investors have been perennially nervous about their bets unwinding overnight.“The VIE structure has been operating in a gray area in China, and till this date, there’s no law saying if it’s illegal or not,” said Zhan Hao, managing partner of Beijing-based Anjie Law Firm, who specializes in antitrust.One worry is that uncertainty surrounding the new rules will chill investment, acquisitions and venture capital funding until officials shed more light on what they’re prepared to do.NightmareMost worst-case scenarios revolve around the idea that China’s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by breaking up their companies -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets.China’s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the Communist Party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation’s future. Many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks Jack Ma made at a conference in October, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded.Read more: Inside the Chaotic Unraveling of Jack Ma’s $35 Billion IPO Buried within the anti-monopoly rules is a paragraph brandishing vague but seemingly dire threats: Companies that violate anti-monopoly regulations may be barred from acquisitions. And if they’re to be allowed to proceed, they may be forced to divest assets, share intellectual property or technologies, or open up infrastructure to competitors and adjust their algorithms.“It’s highly likely that the guidelines will bring about the eventual splitting off of subsidiaries, and could result in the elimination of a lot of non-compliant smaller firms,” said Dong at Joint-Win Partners. “No country in the world would allow all these to exist in one huge entity.”Alibaba, Ant and Tencent alone commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion before last week, easily surpassing state-owned behemoths like Bank of China Ltd. as the country’s most valuable companies.Alibaba and Tencent are also key backers of leaders in adjacent industries, such as Wang Xing’s food delivery giant Meituan and car-hailing leader Didi. They’ve invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world’s largest smartphone and internet market by users.“There shouldn’t be a shred of a doubt by now for internet companies -- never question the drive or the determination of the regulators,” Dong said. “There’s no such thing as too big to fail, not in China.”(Updates with share action from the 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Down $290 Billion, China Tech Investors Wargame Worst-Case Scenarios"

2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. rose more than 2% after reassuring investors about an antitrust crackdown by Chinese regulators, in the most extensive public remarks by any of the country’s major technology companies since proposed regulations hammered their stocks this week.President Martin Lau provided the company’s best assessment of a regulatory paper released just two days earlier, after Tencent reported 29% revenue growth in the third quarter from a Covid-era boom in gaming demand. He explained the WeChat-operator supports the government’s goals of fair competition and its social media and entertainment empire operates within competitive fields. He also made clear the company will comply with regulators’ policies.Beijing on Tuesday proposed new rules intended to curb monopolistic practices across its internet landscape, spooking investors and wiping $290 billion off the value of market leaders from Tencent to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. over two days. That followed new regulations governing the fintech sector that torpedoed the highly anticipated IPO of Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., which would have been the largest market debut in history. Despite Friday’s rally, Tencent’s stock remains down more than 5% since the tech selloff started this week.Lau said the company needed time to reach out to antitrust watchdogs and determine their goals. Tencent does think its relatively conservative approach to expanding beyond its core gaming and messaging services will be viewed favorably by the country’s powerful officials.Read more: Down $290 Billion, China Tech Investors Mull Nightmare Scenarios“Such regulation is not new, and it’s also not unique to China,” Lau said, rapidly expounding on five points he said he wanted to emphasize. “As technology companies become bigger and more important to the economy, I would say more regulations do reflect the new realities needed. It’s not just the case for China, it’s also the case globally.”The government remained supportive of the internet and innovation, Lau stressed. Tencent embraces the philosophy of competition to the point, he added, that multiple internal teams compete against each other in new fields -- what’s been dubbed its “shark womb” philosophy.The regulations threaten to up-end a Chinese ecosystem long protected from competition by the likes of Google and Facebook Inc. It’s now dominated by Alibaba and Tencent through a labyrinthine network of investment that encompasses the majority of the country’s startups in arenas from AI (SenseTime, Megvii) to fresh veggies (Meicai) and digital finance (Ant Group). Their patronage has also groomed a new generation of titans including food and travel giant Meituan and Didi Chuxing -- China’s Uber. Those that prosper outside their aura, the largest being TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd., are rare.The envisioned antitrust rules tend to focus more on transaction-based platforms than on Tencent’s entertainment businesses, Lau said on the call. The draft’s language suggests a heavy focus on online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. The regulations specifically warn against selling at below-cost to weed out rivals.“For them to say that must mean they’ve had some assurances,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “The other point that is very true is that online games and digital entertainment should be much less impacted.”Tencent reported sales rose to 125.45 billion yuan ($18.9 billion) in the three months ended September, beating forecasts. The world’s largest gaming company reported net income of 38.5 billion yuan, surpassing projections of 30.3 billion yuan after it recorded a gain of 11.6 billion yuan from rising valuations for its tech holdings.Revenue from Tencent’s core business surpassed expectations, suggesting the internet resurgence during Covid-19 still has legs. The Value-Added Services Business -- which includes gaming -- posted a better-than-anticipated 38% surge in revenue to 69.8 billion yuan. Online game revenues grew 45%, the fastest pace since 2017, while social network revenues increased 29% after the consolidation of game-streaming giant Huya Inc.“Games were way ahead of expectations. This is important as it is the most profitable part of the business within Tencent,” Daiwa Capital Markets analyst John Choi said.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTencent’s 61% increase in 3Q mobile-game sales bodes well for the segment’s continued growth, especially considering its robust pipeline of new titles. The company’s pandemic-battered media ad segment may turn around soon, with 3Q’s 1% contraction narrower than the double-digit declines of the previous four quarters.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Click here for a liveblog on Tencent’s earnings.Tencent’s fintech business -- valued at anywhere from $200 billion to $300 billion before Ant’s IPO derailment -- has become one of its fastest-growing divisions. Together with cloud computing, the fintech and business services segment generated almost $15 billion or a quarter of total revenue in 2019. The bulk of that is from commercial payments facilitated by the WeChat super-app, where a billion Chinese schmooze, shop, and share cabs.“We have a lot of respect for risk management and we have prudently managed risk,” Lau said. “And that includes deliberately controlling the scale of some of our financial products, including loans, wealth management products and insurance, so that we optimize for quality rather than just going for scale.”Tencent is fending off stiffening competition from the likes of ByteDance and grappling with global macroeconomic uncertainty that continues to depress advertising. Ad sales however grew faster during the September quarter, thanks to big web-series releases and WeChat’s new ad slots. In-game spending globally is also showing signs of peaking.Excluding the one-time gain, net income would have fallen in line with or below estimates. Tencent was a major beneficiary of the tech rally during the September quarter, given its ownership of some of the world’s largest tech players from JD.com Inc. and Meituan to electric vehicle maker NIO Inc. and online real estate platform KE Holdings Inc.Tencent is known as a fierce competitor that can spook any upstart. But its leaders struck a markedly different tone in this unusual week. Executives, unusually, even name-checked ByteDance and applauded up-and-coming competitors like the creator of the wildly popular Genshin Impact.“Our aspiration is not domination,” Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell said at one point during the discussion, in a segment about the success of different game developers. “While the number of studios represented in the top 10 has diversified you can see that from our results we have been able to maintain a very healthy revenue and earnings trend in our games business. The diversification is good because it shows the market is becoming more dynamic.”Read more: Tencent Ready to Make Case It Can Ride Out China StormFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Climbs After Reassurances on China’s Internet Clampdown

2020-11-13,"It was a quiet day in the stock market, despite the S&P 500 rallying more than 1%. Investors are still waiting for tech to regain its footing and find some momentum. Let’s look at a few top stock trades ahead of next week. 
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nio (NIO)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) has been one of the market’s best performers. Shares have scorched higher over the past year, with a 52-week range spanning from $1.66 to $54.20. The latter was hit in Friday’s session.
However, a negative piece from Citron Research hit Nio hard after its latest run, with shares down 12% on the day. We now have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart. That’s where the range of the current candle literally engulfs the prior day’s range. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In any regard, let’s see if the $37.50 area hold as support.

Below that puts uptrend support and the 20-day moving average in play. If that fails, the $30 level could be on the table, along with the 50-day moving average. 
On the upside, I want to see shares reclaim $45, opening the door to $50-plus. 

Walmart (WMT)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) trades in such an interesting way. It’s obvious that the stock is in demand but the rallies can be slow and monotonous. 
With Friday’s move, shares are pushing through channel resistance, putting the September all-time high in play near $151.33. Above that and the 161.8% extension could be in play just below $160. 
On the downside, I want to continue seeing the 50-day moving average and channel support buoy Walmart.
If the stock breaks these levels, the September low is potentially in play near $135, followed by a possible test of the 200-day moving average. 
With everything that Walmart is doing and ahead of the holidays, this one may remain in bulls’ control. Watch $151.33. 

Disney (DIS)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Disney (NYSE:DIS) is rallying on earnings, but not necessarily in convincing fashion. Still, the stock is holding most of this week’s gains, which were fueled by hopes over a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. 
As long as shares can hold up over the Q3 highs near $135 to $136 and the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line), it’s hard to hate the House of Mouse. 
Below opens up the stock to a gap-fill near $127.50 and/or a test of the 50-day moving average, whichever comes first. 
On the upside, look for a rotation over the November high, at $147.68. Above puts the December 2019 high in play at $152.50. That’s also Disney’s all-time high. 

JD.com (JD)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is another really interesting stock. On the one hand, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) continues to get pummeled. On the other hand, JD.com continues to trade quite well. 
With earnings on Monday, we’ll get a better taste of what this stock can do. 
If shares pull back, it would be preferable if they could stay above $85. If not, holding $80 becomes key. The 50-day moving average has been support for months now and losing this level would disrupt the trend in the short to intermediate term. 
It would immediately put the double-bottom November low in play near $77.50. If that fails, the September low near $72.50 and 100-day moving average are possible downside targets.
On the upside, let’s see if shares can take out the high near $92.50 and make their way toward $100.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 7.36%.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

About JD.com.JD.com is a leading technology driven e-commerce company transforming to become the leading supply chain-based technology and service provider. The company’s cutting-edge retail infrastructure seeks to enable consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it. The company has opened its technology and infrastructure to partners, brands and other sectors, as part of its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation across a range of industries. JD.com is the largest retailer in China, a member of the NASDAQ100 and a Fortune Global 500 company.Non-GAAP MeasuresIn evaluating the business, the company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements, gain on sale of development properties and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements and non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain and foreign exchange impact in relation to sale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital expenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the periods, including the dilutive effect of share-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two.The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company’s core operating results and business outlook.The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company’s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.CONTACTS:Investor Relations  Ruiyu Li  Senior Director of Investor Relations  +86 (10) 8912-6804  IR@JD.comMedia  +86 (10) 8911-6155  Press@JD.com     Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc.’s shares dived as much as 9% after concerns about slowing e-commerce growth and pressure on margins outweighed better-than-expected post-Covid revenue growth.Beijing-based JD.com’s sales climbed 29% to 174.21 billion yuan ($26.5 billion) during the July-September quarter, surpassing the 170.5 billion yuan average of analysts’ estimates. Its net income surged to 7.6 billion yuan, helped by one-time gains of more than 3.7 billion yuan from the value of investments and other items.JD joined smaller rival Pinduoduo Inc. in beating Wall Street estimates, after strong Nov. 11 Singles’ Day performances demonstrated how online spending is surging ahead even as overall retail spending shows only modest recovery. Official data showed Chinese retail sales growth in October missed expectations. JD’s general merchandise sales -- a measure of all transactions across its platforms -- decelerated and came in about 5% lower than Citigroup’s forecast, analyst Alicia Yap said in a report. And the company is expected to spend on new initiatives in online commerce to keep pace with rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. JD’s stock slid to a low of HK$335.6 on Tuesday in Hong Kong.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysOperating margin could decline sequentially in 4Q, in-line with the seasonality observed a year earlier. JD.com plans to increase infrastructure investment to support its supermarket business, which the company has identified as a strategic priority, as the pandemic shifts consumers’ purchase of groceries and fresh produce to online channels.\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.JD’s results coincide with growing regulatory pressure on tech giants. Beijing last week released a set of detailed guidelines to curb monopolistic practices, raising questions about the future of companies from JD and Alibaba to JD’s backer Tencent Holdings Ltd. Separate rules governing micro-lending have already torpedoed Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion initial public offering, prompting speculation over whether JD.com’s own fast-growing fintech arm will face a longer journey in going public.Language in the regulations suggests a heavy focus on anti-competitive practices in online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo have accused each other of using underhanded tactics in the past. On Monday, JD executives said on an earnings call they fully supported the new antitrust regulations because they allowed room for innovation.Read more: Down $290 Billion, China Tech Investors Mull Nightmare ScenariosAnnual active customer accounts increased by 32% to 441.6 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, with roughly 80% of the new users coming from less-developed cities -- the battleground between JD and rivals like Pinduoduo.Shares of JD.com in Hong Kong sold off alongside other Chinese technology leaders following the antitrust regulations last week, but have since recouped some of their losses on expectations its arch-rival Alibaba will absorb the brunt of any Beijing action. JD’s stock is still up strongly this year in the wake of a post-pandemic surge in internet activity.Pinduoduo last week posted a stronger-than-expected 89% surge in third-quarter sales, though Alibaba’s revenue grew at the slowest pace ever for a July-September quarter.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","JD Plunges After Growth, Margin Concerns Outweigh Sales Beat"

2020-11-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s vision of the future of finance in China is being upended by regulators, along with the ambitions of conglomerates that followed his lead.Ma’s Ant Group Co. is in talks with regulators about injecting capital into its micro-lending units just weeks after its $35 billion initial public offering was halted in a sector-wide crackdown. The listing plans of e-commerce billionaire Richard Liu’s JD Digits Technology Holding Co. have also been thrown into limbo. Lufax Holding Ltd. had to renegotiate terms with some shareholders after its recent IPO valued China’s largest listed online lender at less than a previous funding round.The details come from people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified speaking on private matters.It’s all part of the rapidly shifting landscape for China’s fintech leaders, which till recently offered the most compelling evidence of technology giants using their might -- and a light regulatory touch -- to rewire traditional financial services. They are now rushing to shore up capital, mulling business overhauls and bracing for more turbulence as industry watchdogs set their sights on areas spanning lending, banking partnerships and data privacy.“Financial stability is political in China,” said Sean Ding, a Washington DC-based analyst at Plenum, a research firm specializing in Chinese politics and economy. “The whole point of sending such a strong message is for future fintech companies to be more careful, understand that their products can bring about financial risk.”The call for tightened oversight comes from the very top. President Xi Jinping urged financial regulators to “dare to” master their supervisory role, according to commentary penned by an official at the banking regulator, published in the Party mouthpiece People’s Daily this month.And it’s the $1.2 trillion online lending industry that’s been first in line for a shake-up, with many companies already trying to meet stringent rules that are yet to be finalized.Ant, the biggest player in online lending, has been the most visible casualty given the abrupt halt to its record-setting IPO this month. Apart from discussions about replenishing capital, Ant is also slowing the pace at which it packages existing loans into asset-backed securities to sell to investors, a person familiar with the matter said.The company currently keeps about 2% of loans on its own balance sheet, with the rest funded by third parties or packaged as securities and sold on.“When Ant does return to the market, investor sentiment is expected to be more restrained,” Bernstein Singapore-based analyst Kevin Kwek wrote in a recent report, adding that its valuation could be cut up to 28%.Francis Chan, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates that Ant may need to inject as much as 80 billion yuan into its two consumer lending units to comply with the new regulations on funding and leverage. Ant declined to comment.The turn toward caution is hindering JD Digits, the finance affiliate of e-commerce giant JD.com Inc., which filed for an IPO with the Shanghai Star Market in September. JD Digits is weighing changes to its listing plans and discussing options with existing shareholders, people familiar said. Its previous target of debuting in the first half of 2021 now looks difficult, according to one of the people.JD Digits said in a text message that it is working with regulators, declining to comment further.Newly listed Lufax is an example of the dangers of going public when the scope of increased regulation isn’t clear.The fintech unit of Ping An Insurance Group Co., China’s biggest insurer by market value, warned investors before it listed that it planned to increase the proportion of loan risk it bears with lending partners to 20% from 2% because of regulatory trends, people familiar said.Lufax was valued at less when it listed than in a previous funding round and allowed existing shareholders to swap their stock into convertible bonds to make up for potential losses, according to people familiar. The lender has seen its stock swing violently since it recent debut as it’s become a target for short-sellers.Lufax declined to comment via email.Chinese regulators are becoming vocal about reining in the booming digital finance sector, signaling the clampdown has further to run.Liang Tao, a vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said this month that fintech companies don’t change the nature of the financial industry and firms should be subject to the same supervision and risk management as banks. In areas where a market monopoly can be spotted, Liang said, the regulator will step up probes to ensure fair competition and order.A Ping An unit, together with a few banks, was reprimanded by the banking watchdog this month for bundling its own insurance products when making micro loans. Ping An Puhui Financing Guarantee Co. -- part of Lufax’s loan platform -- also charged high service fees, pushing up costs, according to a statement.Lufax has already started offering credit guarantee options from multiple insurance partners so customers have more choice, a person familiar said. It also significantly lowered fees in September, reducing clients’ costs, the person said, declining to be named as the measures were not publicly announced.“In the short term, investors are likely to grow unsure about the transparency of financial regulation in China,” said Ken Peng, head of Asia investment strategy at Citigroup Inc.’s private-banking arm. “Policy makers are cautious about fintech, which is a new industry and takes time for regulation to adapt.”(Adds comment from analyst in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","China’s Fintech Giants Scramble to Rethink IPOs, Raise Cash"

2020-12-03,The bill could set the stage for delisting Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges if they don’t comply with audit rules.,"House Passes China Delisting Bill, Sending to Trump for Approval. What That Means for Investors."
2020-12-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Three cheers for the U.S. House of Representatives for passing a bill that could kick out Chinese companies listed on American exchanges. The tens of thousands of financial worker bees who have built their careers trading and servicing behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc. can finally get some sleep at night.Nearly a decade ago, I started my journalism career with Barron’s, the financial investment magazine. Based in Hong Kong, I would work well into the night calling emerging markets fund managers in New York, asking them for their views on China and their stock picks. Often, I went to bed at 2 AM. I was no exception. Ringing the Nasdaq bell used to be every Chinese tech company’s Holy Grail and hundreds have managed to snag a prestigious listing in one U.S. exchange or another. But that meant that Asia-based investors had to be vigilant at night in their quest to buy into the “China dream” being traded in the U.S. daytime. The time zones are halfway around the world from each other. Few went to sleep before New York trading began, and some habitually woke up in the middle of the night checking markets on their phones. Now, the dynamic could change. If U.S.-listed Chinese companies have no choice but to “return home,” they can’t, of course, be bought or sold in New York or other U.S. exchanges. But many of the Chinese blue-chips have secondary listings in Hong Kong so stockholders should hold on to their shares because that’s how they can continue to chase the China dream. Hong Kong will be where the trading will flow.And the activity is bound to grow, despite being exiled from the U.S. That’s because mainland investors will be allowed to buy into the secondary listings via the Hong Kong Stock Connect, which links the city’s exchanges to those in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Right now, Hong Kong already hosts 29% of Alibaba’s outstanding shares, versus 22% a year ago, exchange data show. Why would Chinese companies want to be listed in the U.S., anyway? Prestige is intangible and fleeting. Five years ago, the more solid arguments were that the mainland exchanges lacked depth, or that Hong Kong was too obsessed with profitability, a requirement that discriminated against tech firms that had little yet to show but lots of potential. Those factors have changed dramatically because of listing rule changes in Hong Kong.  A lot of trading in Chinese companies has already shifted from New York to Asia.The ostensible reason for the U.S. ban — which passed the Senate months ago and will become law if and when Donald Trump signs the legislation — are the accounting scandals that have plagued Chinese companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission blames them on Beijing’s refusal to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board — an auditor of auditors set up after the Enron scandal — to inspect the work papers of its U.S.-listed Chinese companies.While shifty accounting is certainly part of the problem, many fund managers based in New York never really looked deeply into where they were sinking their money. Distance is a factor. How would someone sitting in Park Avenue have any sense of what’s happening on the ground in China? Consider Luckin Coffee Inc., the disgraced Chinese coffee chain. Mainland investors never bought into the Luckin story; many said it was not B2B, or B2C, but business to “dumb-ass American money.” But Luckin figured out how to latch onto an emerging markets investment theme favored by American investors and raised over $1.6 billion in the U.S. Imagine: a morning cup much cheaper than Starbucks Corp, served to millions of Chinese who are switching from tea to coffee!There are plenty of other examples of U.S.-based investors getting burned because they weren’t paying attention to facts on the ground in China. Qudian Inc., a fintech based in Xiamen, had a $1 billion IPO on the NYSE in October 2017, but tumbled shortly after because Beijing decided to cap the interest rate lenders could charge to consumers. Chinese education stocks were all the rage in the U.S. until August 2018, when China decided to amend rules governing the country’s lucrative private education sector.The point is, China is an emerging market with fast and furious credit cycles and new regulations springing up alongside nascent industries. While Asia-based investors don’t know what’s on President Xi Jinping’s mind either, they at least have a better sense, having breathed the air and tried out all the new apps and concepts. Plus, new regulations in China never just come out of nowhere: They are often responses to social outcry over local problems. Investors in Asia can sense this in the atmosphere and thus have better risk control. To be sure, with the incoming Joe Biden administration, there might be compromises and conciliations in the implementation of the new bill. But Wall Street shouldn’t feel optimistic about business remaining as usual. China’s new securities law, which came into effect in March, states explicitly that overseas regulators can’t directly inspect or collect evidence on Chinese soil. Beijing considers this a sovereign issue. Chinese companies are coming home, whether you like it or not. In journalism, it’s valuable being on the ground. Shouldn’t that be the case with finance as well? If only to avoid pitfalls, it shouldn’t be this easy for Americans to purchase Chinese stocks. Visit the country and see what’s happening. To buy China, you need to work in its time zone.(Corrects spelling in the name of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in paragraph 7)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg) -- JD Health International Inc. surged in the largest stock market debut by a health-care firm in Asia as investors look past increasing regulatory scrutiny to bet that demand for online medical services will continue to grow in post-Covid China.The stock jumped 56% to HK$110 at the close of trading in Hong Kong Tuesday after pricing at the high end of the marketed range in its $3.5 billion IPO. The first-day gains lifted Beijing-based JD Health to a market value of roughly $44 billion, surpassing that of rival Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. The offering is the largest of this year’s first-time share sales in Hong Kong -- only a second listing by JD Health’s parent company in June was bigger.Read more: JD Health’s Debut is The Best by a Mega Hong Kong IPO: ECM WatchThe health-care affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. projects it will reach 100 million users by end-2021, Chief Executive Officer Xin Lijun said in a Bloomberg TV interview, after reaching 56.1 million annual active users at its online retail pharmacy business last year. Revenue rose 76% to 8.8 billion yuan ($1.35 billion) in the first half of 2020, making it the largest internet health-care platform and online pharmacy by revenue in China, according to its prospectus.“From the long-term perspective, the pandemic has greatly pushed forward the health-care industry,” Xin said. “A lot more Chinese people are now participating in online medical services.”The fragmented nature of the online healthcare sector, combined with tight state control over medical services, means that no single company has a monopoly, Xin said, which may help shield the industry from pending antitrust rules aimed at increasing regulatory oversight of China’s tech firms. In November, Beijing unveiled a draft guidance to root out monopolistic practices, triggering a $290 billion sell-off in two days that saw e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., entertainment heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd and food delivery leader Meituan among the hardest hit.“Each industry has different criteria,” Xin said. “China’s health-care market is over ten thousand billion yuan, but JD Health, even as the No. 1 player, is only ten billion in size, thus it is very hard to monopolize the market.”Instead of curbing their influence, Xin said Chinese regulators are “encouraging” the development of online health-care providers in a bid to cope with rising demand from a rapidly aging society. The number of people aged 60 or more will approach 487 million by 2050, compared with 254 million last year, according to Beijing’s estimates.Shares of online healthcare rivals have rallied this year amid the pandemic. Alibaba Health has more than doubled this year in Hong Kong trading, while Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co. has gained roughly 61%.To grab a greater slice of this multibillion-dollar market, Xin said JD Health is seeking acquisitions and investment opportunities in areas such as artificial intelligence companies and wholesale pharmacies.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:While JD Health’s valuation metrics such as price-to-sales comparison remain lower than e-pharmacy peer Alibaba Health, its market cap has surpassed its rival on its Dec. 8 IPO debut.

2020-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- On the first anniversary of its official launch in China, Nintendo Co.’s Switch can already count itself the sales champion in a gaming arena that’s historically shunned consoles from powerhouses like Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.The Switch, distributed in the country by entertainment titan Tencent Holdings Ltd., has sold more than 1.3 million units this year through both legal and gray market channels, according to market tracker Niko Partners. That’s almost double the combined sales of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the period, pushing up the Switch’s lifetime China sales to nearly 4 million.A combination of Tencent’s promotional reach, pandemic escapism and a series of strong game releases has given Nintendo its first hardware hit in China just as its marquee console faces up to stern competition from Sony’s new PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s competing Xbox Series X on the global stage. Those rival machines have been in hot demand this winter and promise much better graphics and capabilities.For over a decade, China had banned foreign companies from selling video game consoles for fear of youth addiction, which allowed room for smartphone-centric gaming to flourish, led by the likes of Tencent and NetEase Inc. An opaque regulatory regime remains and the Chinese version of the Switch comes with just a handful of Nintendo games -- even blockbusters like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing: New Horizons haven’t won government approval yet.But the lack of an official release hasn’t halted the popularity of Animal Crossing from spilling into China, with an entire cottage industry sprouting up around the creation and trading of in-game goods. Niko analysts including Daniel Ahmad estimate the legal and gray console games market in China is set to grow to $2.15 billion by 2024, doubling its size from last year. Tapping that demand could prove critical to Nintendo’s efforts to extend the Switch’s longevity and the company plans an upgraded model of its signature device for 2021.Read more: Nintendo Plans Upgraded Switch Console and Major Games for 2021A Nintendo spokesman declined to comment on how many units it has sold in China through Tencent. The company’s earnings reports show it has sold more than 2.5 million units in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan this year.“When compared to Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo has the best chance to seize the China market because its game characters and franchises are already well-known among Chinese consumers,” Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda said.Read more: Nintendo’s Animal Crossing Is Spawning Real-Life CommerceTencent has used its own development studio Next to populate the Switch’s China digital store with games and, most recently, adapted its video streaming service for the console. Its WeChat super-app provides payment and social functionality for the Switch, extending a familiar experience that Tencent offers across its mobile games empire. WeChat friends are able to connect and play with each other on Switch, and parents can regulate their children’s play time through a mini app inside the social platform.“It has been a really rewarding partnership for us,” a Tencent spokesperson said. “We have gained a deeper understanding of Nintendo’s advanced concepts in the video game business.”One of the biggest boosts to Switch sales in China has been the release of Ring Fit Adventure, an exercise simulator that uses a ring peripheral to entice players into getting active in front of their TVs at home. The family-friendly nature of the game made it an easy pass for Chinese regulators and when it became available via online retailers like JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Tmall, Chinese gamers rushed to place tens of thousands of pre-orders, forcing the two sites to temporarily suspend sales.“I bought the console for Ring Fit Adventure and now I want to keep buying other games,” one Switch player who bought the gadget wrote in a recent review on JD.com. “Although it’s the Chinese version, I can handle the wait and play what I have.”During the past Nov. 11 Singles’ Day shopping bonanza, Tencent offered a 10% discount for the machine and a special package bundled with Super Mario amiibo figures to boost sales via online channels. The company also distributes the Switch console and its gaming software through physical stores like Walmart Inc.’s Sam’s Club.Apart from selling the hardware, Tencent is co-creating with Nintendo-backed Pokémon Co. a new game for both smartphones and the Switch that lets players battle as Pikachu or Charizard in five-versus-five clashes similar to League of Legends.“Nintendo would benefit more from the partnership if they are willing to share more game titles with Tencent to be developed on the mobile platform,” said IDC analyst Yexi Liao. “Gamers in China would definitely welcome the availability of these titles on mobile where there are a lot fewer limitations from regulations.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","China Is Nintendo’s Secret Weapon in War With PlayStation, Xbox"

2020-12-14,"Online shoppers got their first opportunity to test out China's new digital currency this weekend during an e-commerce festival organised by JD.com, the country's second-largest online retailer.JD kicked off the Double Twelve festival on Friday evening with nearly 20,000 orders using the digital yuan, known officially as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), the company said in a WeChat post. The trial, the first for an online shopping platform in China, was conducted as a partnership between JD Digits, the platform's financial arm, the People's Bank of China and the local government of Suzhou.""JD has over 441 million annual active users and nationwide logistics services as well as omnichannel operations, and these advantages will help promote the building of the DCEP ecosystem,"" Peng Fei, head of the DCEP programme at JD Digits said in a statement. The test is also meant to stimulate consumption and the real economy, Peng added.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.To lure in digital currency users, Suzhou gave away 20 million yuan (US$3 million) to residents via a lottery on Friday at the kick-off of the Double Twelve shopping festival. A total of 100,000 digital red packets were distributed, each containing 200 yuan.Red packets are a popular way to gift money in China, and their digital version was first popularised by mobile payment platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay. Suzhou residents that received the digital currency red packets were invited to download the official Digital Renminbi app, allowing them to use the digital currency on JD.com after linking it to the JD app. What is China's sovereign digital currency?Suzhou may be the first city in China to test digital currency for online shopping, but this was just one of the several digital yuan trials China's central bank has conducted in the past year in a bid to move the country towards a cashless society.Unlike bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the DCEP is issued and backed by the country's central bank and designed as a digital version of the yuan. Other countries have been drawing up plans for digital currencies, including most of the Group of 20 (G20) members.The 20 million yuan distributed in Suzhou was more than double the amount given away during the first large-scale public trial of the beta version of the digital yuan, which took place in Shenzhen in October. For that trial, Shenzhen gave away 8.8 million yuan in red packets that could be spent in participating physical stores in the city.Other pilots involving the DCEP are being held in Xiongan, Chengdu and venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, but the central bank has yet to provide an official timetable for the full launch of the digital yuan.Instructions showing how to link the Digital Renminbi App storing the digital yuan with JD.com's online shopping platform.

Statistics also showed that digital currency use was slightly skewed towards men, who accounted for 57.6 per cent of the purchases. The largest single online payment amount exceeded 10,000 yuan.The Suzhou trial was the first time selected digital currency users were invited to try out what the central bank called ""dual offline wallets"", which allowed them to pay for goods in local shops without having to be connected to the internet.Aside from JD's e-commerce platform, residents are also allowed to use the digital yuan at JD's offline stores as well as stores outside JD's ecosystem.

2020-12-20,"(Bloomberg) -- If you worry about all the waste generated by the annual rush of holiday shopping and gift giving, it’s nothing compared to the mountains of discarded packaging that comes from a single event in China.On Nov. 11 each year, the world’s biggest consumer market goes into overdrive as e-commerce giants like Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and JD.com Inc. lure shoppers with huge bargains during the Singles’ Day bonanza. Alibaba reported almost 500 billion yuan ($76 billion) of sales this year, nearly four times U.S. Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending combined. On its Tmall platform, transactions reached a peak when 583,000 orders were made in a single second.All those purchases meant 675 million packages had to be delivered, a 26% increase from 2019. Online shopping in China generated 9.4 million tons of packaging in 2018, according to Greenpeace, which projects that the amount could rise to 41 million tons by 2025, about the same as all the waste produced by Japan in a year. Greenpeace estimates that Singles’ Day generated 52,400 metric tons of CO2 from manufacturing, packaging and shipping in 2017. The national railway has to employ hundreds of high-speed trains to help with deliveries every year.As President Xi Jinping pushes for stronger environmental protection and consumers grow more eco-conscious, the nation’s e-commerce giants are under pressure to find greener ways to handle the annual extravaganza, starting with plastic. China’s soaring use of the material has become one of the world’s most pressing environmental issues, but switching to other materials is costly for smaller businesses and the government has struggled to implement a plan to phase out single-use plastics. Zipper BoxesE-commerce companies are trying to stem the tide. For Singles’ Day this year, Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao designed recyclable corrugated cardboard boxes that don’t have to be sealed with plastic tape. The company offered the packaging to more than 500 sellers on Tmall, including brands like Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co. The so-called zipper boxes cost twice as much as their usual packaging, but sellers that opt to use them get extra promotion on the website. Cainiao says it used 190,000 plastic-free boxes and 3 million biodegradable bags to package Singles’ Day orders this year. While that’s a step forward, it’s just a fraction of the total increase in packaging this year.At one of Cainiao’s warehouses in Langfang city southeast of Beijing, the zipper boxes appeared frequently on the assembly line as employees worked in shifts around the clock to meet demand during the busiest week in November. Cainiao emblazons the boxes with dolphin images to “raise awareness of how plastic pollutes the oceans,” said Tang Linrong, a member of the company’s packaging solutions team. Tang said his team plans to promote the zipper boxes at other shopping events throughout the year. The nation is making other efforts to cut shipping waste. China’s State Post Bureau says 96% of the country’s delivery services have adopted digital waybills and switched to thinner packaging tape to reduce plastic use. Suning.com, an appliance seller, last year launched shared delivery box programs in 13 cities.  But it’s the millions of smaller retailers which are the backbone of China’s consumer goods industry that are the sticking point.Unlike Tmall, which mostly caters to established brands and international companies, Alibaba’s Taobao platform allows these vendors to sell directly to customers. Prices are so competitive that reducing packaging and shipping costs are crucial for sellers to make a profit. Angela Cai, Cainiao’s head of international communications, said Taobao will give retailers who join their green initiatives special perks to help them attract customers.Red TapeStill, without government regulation, companies are left to decide if they want to use more sustainable packaging. Online shopping has become such a key driver of China’s domestic economy, especially during the pandemic, that authorities have been reluctant to institute rules that could hurt the industry. The environment ministry, which drives climate policies, doesn’t have the power to mandate greener packaging.“There is a mismatch between which department has the power to manage, what can they manage and what needs to be managed,” said Tang Damin, Plastics Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. “The regulator in charge of packaging in the delivery sector can do nothing more than give suggestions to the e-commerce business.” China officially banned free plastic bags at markets in 2008 and has said that non-degradable plastic straws should be eliminated by 2020, but those declarations have largely been ignored by the public. Plastic bags are freely available at most markets. Days before the deadline for eliminating straws, drink shops in Beijing’s most upscale neighborhoods still provided them. An ambitious mandatory recycling pilot program that was rolled out in cities including Shanghai and Beijing has struggled to take off. Experts caution that the degradable plastics many Chinese companies are switching to aren’t necessarily more environmentally friendly. The majority of degradable plastic, for example, breaks down within six months only in facilities with temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius and certain humidity conditions. These plastics often end up in landfills, where they can remain intact for much longer.Switching to cardboard also has its environmental issues. Cardboard production is water intensive, generates emissions and runs the risk of encouraging deforestation if not sourced sustainably. It’s also hard to recycle if contaminated with food or other waste. Ultimately, the most effective way to curb the surge in packaging may be to encourage people to consume less. Days after this year’s Singles’ Day, staff at a recycling station on Beijing’s Beixinqiao street were still working overtime to sort through the tons of plastic, cardboard and polystyrene foam that had poured in.“The government put out slogans on garbage sorting everywhere, but I see more and more unsorted trash,” said a worker surnamed Zhao. “I guess it’s easy to talk about the environment but it’s hard to resist the temptation to buy.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Online Shopping Addiction Is Killing Its Green Packaging Drive

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a second day of frenetic selling among China’s largest tech firms, driven by fears that antitrust scrutiny will spread beyond Jack Ma’s internet empire and engulf the country’s most powerful corporations.Alibaba and its three largest rivals -- Tencent Holdings Ltd., food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com Inc. -- have shed nearly $200 billion in Hong Kong over the two sessions since Thursday when regulators revealed an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices at Ma’s signature company. That marked the formal start of the Communist Party’s crackdown on not just Alibaba but also, potentially, the wider and increasingly influential tech sphere.“It is very hard to predict the outcome of the Chinese government’s ongoing investigation into Alibaba and other large consumer internet platforms,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note. He cut his price target on Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares to $285 from $325, citing “uncertainty around government oversight and potential for direct regulatory action in the coming year.”The company’s American depositary receipts fluctuated before closing Monday largely unchanged, after a historic 13% slide the previous session. Volume surged to several times the 12-month daily average, reflecting doubt over what’s going to happen next. JD.com fell 3.4% and Tencent declined 3.5%. The day’s Hong Kong trading was also fierce: Alibaba fell 8% Monday, shedding $270 billion of value since its October peak, while Tencent and Meituan both tumbled more than 6%.KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote that this “significant” pullback had created an attractive buying opportunity, adding that it doesn’t anticipate a meaningfully different competitive landscape for the company.On Sunday, China’s central bank ordered Ma’s other online titan -- Ant Group Co. -- to return to its roots as a payments service and overhaul adjacent businesses from insurance to money management, spurring talk of an eventual breakup.Once hailed as the standard-bearers of China’s economic and technological ascendancy, Alibaba and its compatriots now face increasing pressure from regulators worried about the speed with which they’re amassing clout in sensitive arenas such as media and education and gaining influence over the daily lives of hundreds of millions. That concern crystallized in November, when regulators torpedoed Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering before unveiling draft rules enshrining sweeping powers to clamp down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from e-commerce to social media.“The Chinese government is putting more pressure or wants to have more control on the tech firms,” Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd., said by phone. “There is still very big selling pressure on firms like Alibaba, Tencent or Meituan. These companies have been growing at a pace deemed by Beijing as too fast and have scales that are too big.”It’s unclear what concessions regulators may try to wring from Alibaba. Under the existing Antitrust Law -- now undergoing revisions to include the internet industry for the first time -- Beijing can fine violators up to 10% of their revenue. In Alibaba’s case, that could mean a levy of as much as $7.8 billion.China’s e-commerce leader on Monday raised a proposed stock repurchase program by $4 billion to $10 billion, effective for two years through the end of 2022. But the buyback program was overwhelmed by fears that the steps taken against Ant are just the tip of the iceberg. While the central bank stopped short of calling for a breakup, the financial services giant now needs to present specific measures and a timetable for overhauling its business.Read more: Ant Turning From Windfall to Nightmare for Global InvestorsThe State Administration for Market Regulation dispatched officials to Alibaba’s Hangzhou headquarters last Thursday and the on-site investigation was completed on the day, according to local news reports. The People’s Daily -- the Communist Party mouthpiece -- ran a commentary over the weekend warning Alibaba’s peers to take the antitrust investigation into Alibaba as a chance to lift their own awareness of fair competition.Ma, the flamboyant co-founder of Alibaba and Ant, has all but vanished from public view since Ant’s IPO got derailed last month. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said.Ma isn’t on the verge of a personal downfall, those familiar with the situation have said. His very public rebuke is instead a warning Beijing has lost patience with the outsize power of its technology moguls, increasingly perceived as a threat to the political and financial stability President Xi Jinping prizes most.Investors remain divided over the extent to which Beijing will go after Alibaba and its compatriots as Beijing prepares to roll out the new anti-monopoly regulations. The country’s leaders have said little about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they decided to act now.Some analysts predict there’s a crackdown coming, but a targeted one. They point to language in the regulations that suggests a heavy focus on online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. The regulations specifically warn against predatory pricing -- selling below cost -- to weed out rivals.“As this latest investigation occurs at a time when China is ready to take action against monopolistic practices, we think SAMR might want to use BABA’s case as a precedent to send a message to the rest of the industry that the authority is determined this time to address the” pricing issue, Nomura analysts wrote in a note Monday.(Updates to close Alibaba’s shares in the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Probe Stirs Worry About What’s Next for Chinese Tech

2021-01-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese authorities began a probe into working conditions at Pinduoduo Inc. following the death of an employee in her early 20s that renewed criticism of the long hours commonly practiced at China’s tech companies.The e-commerce company confirmed that a female employee collapsed while walking home with colleagues at 1:30 a.m. last Tuesday. The employee, who was born in 1998 and joined Pinduoduo in July 2019, could not be resuscitated and died after nearly six hours of first aid, according to a statement. Her death sparked a social media backlash against Pinduoduo and the relentless working schedules expected of its workers, prompting district officials at the Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau to commence an investigation.The so-called 996 office schedule -- 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, plus overtime -- has spurred criticism in previous years following complaints from tech workers and earlier deaths. Still, tech billionaires from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma to JD.com Inc. chief Richard Liu have endorsed the practice as necessary for survival in an intensely competitive industry and the key to accumulating personal wealth.Read more: China Loses a Tech Generation as the Big Payoff Promise Fades“Chinese internet companies should think beyond reaching unicorn status and IPOs and a steady, healthy corporate culture is a must for long-term growth,” said Marlon Mai, Shanghai-based managing director with recruitment consultancy Morgan McKinley. “Employee health is an issue that can’t be ignored.”The online criticism adds to the challenges for China’s largest tech companies, which spent the past year fending off efforts by the Trump administration to curb their growth while navigating heightened regulatory scrutiny at home. Beijing in November unveiled regulations designed to root out monopolistic practices in the internet industry, sparking a sell-off in the previously high-flying tech sector.Despite the year-end slump in Alibaba and its peers, Pinduoduo had been relatively unscathed with its stock rising to a record on Dec. 30. Shares of the firm, which spans a $205 billion e-commerce empire and is aggressively seeking to further bolster growth by expanding into the red-hot sector of online groceries, ended the year up nearly 370%. That helped elevate founder Colin Huang to the position of China’s second-richest man, overtaking fellow internet entrepreneurs like Alibaba’s Ma and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Chairman Pony Ma, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Pinduoduo sank 6.1% in New York Monday.A hashtag about the employee’s death has drawn more than 260 million views on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo service as of Tuesday. Criticism of the online retailer intensified after Pinduoduo confirmed that a post on the Quora-like Zhihu service -- which said that all people from the bottom rungs of society exchange their lives for money -- had originated from its official account. After initially claiming that the post was fake, Pinduoduo later apologized and said a contractor had uploaded it without authorization, adding that the company strongly opposed the views expressed.The state-run CCTV on Tuesday published a commentary that warned against trading human life for profit. Without naming specific corporations, CCTV called for authorities to step up regulatory oversight to protect the rights of workers.In response to the uproar, the Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will dispatch an investigative team to Pinduoduo and collect relevant information from the company, a Changning District branch official who only wanted to be known as Wang told Bloomberg News by phone.(Updates with details on government investigation starting from first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Pinduoduo Worker’s Death Spurs Investigation, Online Furore"

2021-01-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is looking to raise as much as $8 billion selling dollar bonds as early as next week, giving global investors a chance to bet on the Chinese e-commerce giant’s long-term prospects at a time when the company and its co-founder face intense government pressure back home.The company aims to raise at least $5 billion but could wind up with more depending on the reception, according to people familiar with the matter who aren’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. The deal will be a multi-tranche offering, with specific tenors yet to be determined, they said. Alibaba declined to comment. Reuters earlier reported the planned sale.Pulling off the sale as Jack Ma’s internet empire faces a regulatory crackdown and antitrust probe would be a sign of global investor confidence in the company. In recent months, officials blocked Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion IPO, proposed new rules to curb the dominance of internet giants and fined Alibaba over acquisitions from years before. Closer scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions could add uncertainty over the growth of large internet firms.“We view the issuance as somewhat exploratory given the broader uncertainty around Ant/Jack Ma,” said Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics in Singapore. “It may well reveal how seriously global investors perceive the rapidly evolving regulatory environment in China and the potential impact on Alibaba.”Alibaba raised about $11 billion from its Hong Kong stock sale in late 2019, and had a cash hoard of almost $90 billion at the end of September.The sale comes as companies flock to global bond markets, where investors are seeking higher-yielding assets amid ultra-low interest rates and almost $18 trillion of negative-yielding debt. Borrowers have sold more than $65 billion of dollar bonds globally so far this year, following a record of over $3.6 trillion in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Alibaba tapped the global debt market in 2014 for the first time to raise $8 billion shortly after its landmark New York stock debut. It last came to the offshore market with a bumper $7 billion bond deal in 2017 and needs to repay or refinance some $1.5 billion of dollar debt which comes due this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show.The company’s dollar bond due 2027 is trading at about 111 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg-compiled prices show.Alibaba has in recent years spent billions acquiring stakes in promising startups, expanding its logistics network and cloud-hosting services, and building up an international business via Singapore-based online mall Lazada. It is now engaged in a bruising battle with Meituan in food delivery, while fending off rivals like JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in businesses from groceries to retail.(Updates sixth paragraph to include details on the global hunt for yield)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Plans to Sell Up to $8 Billion Bonds in Show of Strength

2021-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. tumbled in Hong Kong after reports that the Trump administration may bar investments in China’s two most valuable companies.Alibaba fell 3.9% and Tencent dropped 2.7% in Hong Kong premarket trading on Thursday, tracking losses in their New York-listed securities. The State Department, Department of Defense and Treasury Department are among authorities involved in the deliberations, according to people with knowledge of the talks. The discussions focus in part on how such a move might affect capital markets, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Wednesday.Imposing a ban on the two companies would mark the most dramatic escalation yet by the Trump administration, given the sheer size of the two firms and the difficulty unwinding positions. At $1.4 trillion, the combined market value of their primary listings is twice the size of Spain’s stock market, while the firms together account for about 11% of MSCI Inc.’s emerging markets benchmark.“If the bans are implemented then it’d be a huge thing for the market,” said Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “It’s still too early to say. After the Biden administration starts, the policy could change again.”Representatives for the companies had no immediate comment when contacted.The closely-watched iShares China Large-Cap ETF fell 1.2% in the U.S. while the NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks other large Chinese technology stocks, dropped 2.1% for its worst day since November. JD.com slipped 7.7%.U.S. authorities have been ramping up efforts to deprive Chinese companies of U.S. capital in the final months of President Donald Trump’s administration, adding to economic tensions as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take over this month.Citing national security, Trump previously signed an executive order in November requiring investors to pull out of Chinese companies linked to that nation’s military. On Tuesday, Trump signed an order banning U.S. transactions with eight Chinese apps including Ant Group Co.’s Alipay and Tencent’s digital wallets. It will be up to Biden to decide whether to enforce that policy once it takes effect.Hasty measures have at times sown confusion in markets and prompted price swings, such as when the New York Stock Exchange reversed course twice this week on a decision to delist three Chinese telecommunications companies. The NYSE is now proceeding with its original delisting plan after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disagreed with its decision to give the companies a reprieve.The order bans trading in the affected securities starting Jan. 11. If Biden leaves Trump’s executive order in place, U.S. investment firms and pension funds would be required to sell their holdings in companies linked to the Chinese military by Nov. 11. And if the U.S. determines additional companies have military ties in the future, American investors will be given 60 days from that determination to divest.The potential U.S. ban comes as pressures mount within China on Jack Ma’s Alibaba and Tencent. In recent months, officials blocked Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion IPO, proposed new rules to curb the dominance of internet giants and fined Alibaba and Tencent over acquisitions from years before. Closer scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions could add uncertainty over the growth of large internet firms within China.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Alibaba, Tencent Drop in Hong Kong as U.S. Weighs Investment Ban"
2021-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc. has selected CLSA Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for its planned second listing in Hong Kong, which could raise at least $3.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Nasdaq-listed Baidu plans to sell shares in the Asian financial hub as soon as the first half of this year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The company could sell about 5% to 9% of its share capital, meaning the offering could raise at least $3.5 billion based on its latest market value of almost $70 billion.More banks could be added and details of the offering including timing and size are subject to change, the people said. Representatives for CLSA and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while a representative for Baidu had no immediate comment.Baidu joins a wave of U.S.-listed Chinese firms in seeking a trading foothold in Hong Kong amid simmering tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Companies from JD.com Inc. to NetEase Inc. raised about $17 billion through share sales in the city last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The past week has been a whirlwind for Chinese companies trading on American exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange reversed course twice on a decision to delist three Chinese telecommunications companies, while the Trump administration is now considering barring investments in the Asian nation’s two most valuable companies: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.While questions remain on how the incoming Biden administration will deal with China, a second listing in Hong Kong allows Chinese firms to expand their investor base and acts as a hedge against potential delisting. President Donald Trump has already signed legislation that could kick firms off U.S. exchanges unless American regulators can review their financial audits, an issue that has remained unresolved between China and the U.S. for over a decade.Baidu has been seeking to catch up in the heated area of online entertainment, with its core search app morphing into a platform hosting a wide array of content from articles to videos.

2021-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. has increased its stake in Xingsheng Youxuan, investing $100 million in the Chinese online grocery startup at a valuation of about $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Xingsheng Youxuan is also in talks with other investors including Beijing Kuaishou Technology Co. to potentially raise more funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.Tencent’s investment comes as community buying platforms are seeing a surge of fundraising, and arrives less than a month after e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. bought into the produce delivery app with a $700 million capital injection, according to an exchange filing.Investors including Tencent and private equity firm Primavera Capital joined a funding round in Xingsheng Youxuan at a $3 billion value, Bloomberg News reported in June.The current funding round could precede an initial public offering, though details such as timing and listing venue are still not finalized, the people said.Representatives from Tencent, Xingsheng Youxuan declined to comment.

2021-01-15,"When you start hearing about day trading at volume, you know the markets have gotten frothy and buying and holding long-term stocks isn’t a top priority for investors. But times like these are precisely when it should be. Trying to time trades is tricky business, even for Wall Street bigshots who have been trading for decades with state of the art equipment and a lifetime of institutional knowledge – and occasionally an advanced degree in mathematics. Trying to outsmart these people or play their game over the long term might be entertaining, but if your goal is to make money, I wouldn’t bother. Finding companies with solid fundamentals in key industries and buying for the long-term might be boring, but it makes money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Here are 7 long-term stocks to buy you’ll want to hang onto: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Clorox (NYSE:CLX) JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) Sony (NYSE:SNE) These companies deserve your attention for the future because of how well they’ve handled the past. Long-term Stocks To Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey. Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running. When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you. Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question. Clorox (CLX) Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it. Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock. During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead. JD.com (JD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge. Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head. But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors. Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This is the company that launched Elon Musk before he became the maverick CEO we all know today. Even back then Musk was a handful, getting deposed as CEO after a couple years but still holding more stock than anyone else when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PYPL in 2002. That became the seed capital for Musk’s later ventures. But beyond the personality, PYPL is a pioneer in electronic payments and now in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments with its Venmo app. Time and again Wall Street has dismissed PYPL as not having the kind of financial reputation or muscle to take on the big financial institutions in the digital space. And time and again, PYPL has proven them wrong. The past year has been a boon for PYPL’s model and has showed that big banks weren’t altogether ready for the quick and massive shift to digital. And PYPL now has credit services as well as other payment platforms. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up over 113% in the past 12 months and it’s now here to stay. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com We’re well ensconced in the Mobility Age at this point. By that I mean what started as the digital revolution has now moved to the point where wireless networks keep us connected nearly all the time, much to some people’s chagrin. But the fact is, despite the downsides, there are plenty of upsides too. And now that 5G telecom tech is upon us, data will be flowing even faster than before. One the beneficiaries and leaders in pushing digital mobility further is QCOM, one of the world’s leading telecom companies. Its business model is unique because it develops chips and telecom equipment but makes money licensing the technology for others to manufacture and also taking a cut of sales. Both U.S. and Chinese (and others) phone makers rely on state of the art QCOM chips, especially for 5G. QCOM just signed a new deal to rekindle relations with Chinese phone makers earlier this week. As long as mobility is a thing, this is a long-term stock to own. The stock is up 75% in the past 12 months, yet the stock is trading at a P/E of 35. Shopify (SHOP) Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com With unemployment nearing 6.7% and many states admitting that the pandemic has hampered their ability to accurately count the unemployed, there are a lot of Americans trying to figure out how to bring in a paycheck. Many have turned to driving Uber or Lyft, although passenger numbers are down significantly now as well. And taxis are even worse. That has led many to try their hands at turning their hobbies into businesses. And that’s where SHOP comes in. It’s a cloud-based platform that helps small and mid-sized business build out professional websites. The stock is up nearly 1000% over the past three years, and much of that has come in the past two years, as the economy has slowed. Vaccines may be on the way, and the government is working through another stimulus package, but the damage done to the economy has yet to be seen clearly given all the other issues facing the nation. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon This stock is up 167% in the past year and has plenty of potential growth ahead. Sony (SNE) Source: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com Launched in 1946 in Japan, SNE has been known to every generation since for various electronics. For decades, SNE made the best televisions in the world after launching the first all-transistor television in 1959 and taking the global television market by storm. Then came the video generation. Then the Walkman generation, when SNE defined personal, portable music. And now, it’s the PlayStation videogame system. Along the way, it has moved into the entertainment industry, on both the content and equipment sides. Its contributions to our electronic era are practically too numerous to list and Sony continues to be a formidable player. The thing is, it generally cuts a low profile. SNE stock is currently up more than 43% in the past 12 months, yet trades at a P/E below 15.

2021-01-22,"Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is an e-commerce juggernaut. Some would even call it the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China, and that’s not inaccurate. These days, however, BABA stock is disconnected from sound fundamentals, introducing significant risk for investors. Source: Colin Hui / Shutterstock.com BABA stock reflects that risk, residing almost 24% below its 52-week high. The saga started last year when Alibaba founder Jack Ma sought to bring the fintech arm of his empire, Ant Group, public. The goal was to raise at least $30 billion, which would have shattered initial public offering (IPO) records, but Ma used some unusual tactics, drawing the ire of Beijing in the process. Today, Ant remains a private company, Alibaba is flailing and perhaps most concerning to investors is that Ma hadn’t been seen in public in months until just this week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There has been speculation that Ma was simply trying to keep a low profile in the wake of the Ant imbroglio and that very could well be the case. Still, someone can keep a low profile and still allow a photo of himself to be snapped. Missing copy for url #1. Please edit. Url #1 is an external link. Please edit. The uncertainty around surrounding Ma certainly isn’t a near-term positive for Alibaba investors. BABA Stock: Fears of Nationalization Compounding investors’ woes is the fact that Alibaba is now in Beijing’s regulatory crosshairs in an antitrust kind of way. “Based on tip-offs received by the State Administration for Market Regulation in recent days, the administration will be investigating Alibaba … for suspected monopolistic activities,” according to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). CCP claims Alibaba took steps to prevent sellers from listing items they featured on Alibaba on the platforms of rivals JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD). The CCP heat is leading to speculation Beijing could nationalize Alibaba. In the pantheon of emerging markets state-controlled companies, rare are the examples of those firms being e-commerce companies. Historical data confirm emerging markets investors are left yearning for more with state-run companies. Over the past three years, the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Ex-State Owned Enterprises ETF (NYSEARCA:XSOE) beat the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by almost 1,300 basis points. There are no guarantees Alibaba will be nationalized, but if it is, there’s a credible chance the underlying investment thesis takes a major hit. Alibaba Needs Change of Narrative In more sanguine times, the Alibaba conversation would revolve around the massive opportunity that is China’s online retail market, looming growth at the hands of a rising middle class and increasing internet penetration and a burgeoning cloud computing business. That isn’t the case today, meaning Alibaba needs to shift the narrative. Doing so under intensifying pressure from Beijing is a difficult task. That’s the vexing thing about BABA stock right now. It’s an excellent fundamental story being torn apart by an inhospitable government. Until that situation cools off, investors should exercise extreme caution with the once revered Alibaba.

2021-01-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. fell Tuesday, after a world-beating surge in the stock pushed its market value to the cusp of $1 trillion for the first time.The Chinese Internet behemoth lost as much as 5.1% in Hong Kong, its biggest decline in a month, putting its market capitalization at $900 billion. Its shares surged 11% Monday, Tencent’s best gain since 2011. There were few obvious catalysts for a rally of that size, although traders cited an ambitious listing plan from video startup Kuaishou Technology, in which Tencent holds a stake, as well as a bullish note from Citigroup Inc. analysts. The options market went wild, with one contract expiring Thursday soaring 118,300%.Tencent was the most recent mega-cap company to benefit from investor enthusiasm for the tech sector, with its looming milestone a marker for the euphoria sweeping the stocks globally. Before Tuesday, the stock had added $251 billion in January alone -- by far the biggest creation of shareholder wealth worldwide. Warnings are rising that easy monetary policy is fueling bubbles in global equities, especially in the U.S., where gains have been led by the Nasdaq.As investors seek cheaper alternatives, they’ve piled into Hong Kong equities. That’s helped make the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index the best performing among the world’s major benchmarks in the past month. Adding fuel to the rally has been record inflows by mainland Chinese investors into the city’s equities. Tencent, whose WeChat social-media platform boasts more than a billion users, is the prime target, accounting for about a quarter of total cash coming in through the stock links.“Stocks are overshooting,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “Obviously this has been driven by liquidity. Beijing wants to drive money into Hong Kong, and it’s encouraging lots of new ETFs and mutual funds to buy the city’s stocks.”On Tuesday, 10-year government bonds slumped to fall by the most in four months after China’s central bank drained funds from the system, raising concerns about how much further Hong Kong’s stocks could rally given tightening liquidity.While Tencent has long been an investor favorite in Asia, returning more than 100,000% since its 2004 initial public offering, the stock is not without risk.In 2018, a government crackdown on China’s online gaming industry squeezed Tencent’s most profitable business, which at the time accounted for about 40% of its revenue. Coupled with a slowing Chinese economy and a weakening yuan, Beijing’s nine-month halt on approvals for new games contributed to a 22% slump in the shares.A campaign against monopolistic practices since late last year has targeted many of the industries in which Tencent and rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. operate, including the online payments industry. But while increasing regulatory risk has left Alibaba’s shares about 16% lower than their October peak, Tencent has closed at seven fresh records in the past eight sessions. One factor contributing to the divergence: Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock is not included in trading links with mainland exchanges.Tencent would be the second Chinese firm to join the trillion-dollar club after PetroChina Co., which was briefly worth more than that in late 2007 before collapsing in value. U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.Tencent reported net income of 38.5 billion yuan ($5.9 billion) in the three months ended September, boosted by a gain of 11.6 billion yuan from rising valuations for its investments in other companies. The rally in tech shares is likely to lift its earnings further, given its ownership of some of the industry’s largest players from JD.com Inc. and Meituan to electric vehicle maker NIO Inc.Still, Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts. The stock’s closing level of HK$766.50 on Monday was almost 10% higher than the consensus 12-month price target compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 2014.(Updates market price in paragraph 2)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Shares Drop After Approaching $1 Trillion Valuation

2021-01-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s minute-long video appearance last week gave Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. a much-needed reprieve after months of speculation over the extent to which Beijing will go after China’s largest online retailer. But that tonic didn’t last long as investors returned to grappling with the same questions that wiped $150 billion off its market value.Alibaba’s projected to unveil its slowest pace of third-quarter sales growth in five years on Feb. 2 while it confronts potentially the biggest crisis of its two-decade existence. Uncertainty began in November when regulators first torpedoed Ant Group Co.’s record initial public offering, then launched a probe into the e-commerce firm. Alibaba shares have dropped 16% since Ant’s aborted debut, the worst performance on Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. That’s in stark contrast to arch foe Tencent Holdings Ltd., which had briefly neared a $1 trillion valuation after its stock reached new highs this week.Ma’s company, once the standard-bearer for China’s fast-rising private firms and booming internet sphere, now faces penalties of as much as 10% of its revenue or some $7.8 billion if it’s found to have abused its market dominance. Executives may also face questions about how a possible crackdown on sister company Ant may hurt its outlook, given the latter firm provides consumer loans to half a billion of Alibaba’s shoppers. Meanwhile, consumption has lagged industrial activity in the broader Chinese economic recovery because of the lingering coronavirus.“The extent of regulatory enforcement is still quite unclear. Practices like merchant exclusivity will no longer be possible. And Ant Group’s valuation will be much lower after the restructuring,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “From an operational and fundamental point of view, I don’t recall anything more serious than the events now.”Revenue likely climbed 33% to a record 215.4 billion yuan ($33 billion) in the three months ended December, according to the average of analyst forecasts, driven in part by extended Singles’ Day promotions in late October and early November. That’s the slowest expansion for a December quarter since 2015.Read more: Alibaba Singles’ Day Ends Strongly as Beijing Crackdown LoomsRegulations focusing on online commerce -- from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to predatory pricing and algorithms favoring new users -- may hamper Alibaba’s ability to stem the slowdown. It’s also got to fend off rivals from JD.com Inc., which has previously accused Alibaba of unfairly pressuring merchants to shun competitors, to Pinduoduo Inc., whose 730 million annual consumers are closing in on Alibaba’s 757 million-strong user base.Any regulations requiring Alibaba to implement a full halt to forced-exclusivity policies may hit Tmall’s sales by close to a tenth in 2021, before sales return to 18-20% annual growth in 2022 and beyond, according to San Francisco-based Octahedron Capital Management LP. As of now, less than 10% of the top-selling brands are exclusive, they estimated.Meanwhile, short-video platforms like ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent-backed Kuaishou Technology are also tapping livestreaming as a sales outlet to wrest a larger e-commerce share. Beijing-based ByteDance revealed its Singles’ Day takings for the first time in 2020, with Douyin, the Chinese version of global sensation TikTok, booking 18.7 billion yuan in gross merchandise value.“Douyin and Kuaishou’s e-commerce businesses remain small today, but both will continue to grow, and may become greater threats in lucrative categories like apparel and personal care,” Bernstein analysts led by Robin Zhu said in a Jan. 25 report. “The pair have dominated the short video format to date, and it’s clear that both companies have designs on e-commerce as a way to monetize their share of user time spent.”Changes to lending rules governing Ant may also pose challenges for its sister company’s commerce operations. While Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang has said the company doesn’t quantify how much of its sales are funded by Ant’s loans, the fintech giant provides small unsecured credit to about 500 million people through its Huabei (Just Spend) and Jiebei (Just Lend) platforms. These are used in part to pay for purchases of clothing and makeup from the Taobao marketplace or trips booked on Fliggy, the group’s online travel site.“The reduced consumer credit of Huabei will have a chilling effect on Alibaba’s e-commerce business, especially for the purchase of big-ticket items,” said Ella Ji, an analyst with China Renaissance. Even so, the overall impact remains marginal as customers can use credit cards and other payment means while shopping on its platforms, she added.As part of the crackdown, Ant has been told to “rectify” its lending, insurance and wealth management services. The company’s planning to restructure its main consumer credit operations into a new consumer finance unit that has the right to operate nationwide, people with knowledge of the matter have said. And stricter capital requirements may kneecap its ability to issue loans as freely. Already, the firm has voluntarily lowered the credit limit for some young users on Huabei in a bid to encourage more rational spending.Ant -- one-third owned by Alibaba -- contributed about $689 million to the e-commerce company’s profits in the September quarter.“Ant is making adjustments to their business models to deal with what the regulators are likely going to ask them to do and that has negatively impacted Alibaba to a certain extent,” Franklin Templeton portfolio manager Jonathan Curtis said in a Bloomberg Television interview.Read more: Ant Plans Credit Unit Overhaul to Avoid Sharp Drop in LoansTighter regulatory scrutiny over mergers may also impede the tech giant from snapping up promising startups in emerging industries or taking outsized stakes in other businesses to ward off competition. Alibaba -- which had in recent years spent billions on stakes in hypermart operator Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. and NetEase Inc.’s Kaola e-commerce platform -- was fined 500,000 yuan in December for not seeking approval before boosting its holdings in department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. in 2017.With its core commerce operations under fire, the company may find a rare silver lining in its cloud division. Alibaba held a leading 40.9% share of China’s total cloud infrastructure services spending in the September quarter, more than double its closest competitor, according to industry researcher Canalys, and expects to expand the business further amid the country’s accelerated shift to digital operations. It has predicted that its cloud business will turn profitable in the fiscal year ending in March for the first time, after posting the narrowest losses in more than three years in the September quarter.“We have a bullish view on cloud adoption in China and expect industry leader Alibaba to be among the prime beneficiaries of this growth,” the Bernstein analysts wrote.

2021-02-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. offered investors few clues into how the regulatory crackdown on Jack Ma’s tech empire will impact its future growth after reporting a stronger-than-expected 37% increase in quarterly sales.The e-commerce giant has established a special taskforce to conduct internal reviews and is actively communicating with antitrust regulators on complying with their requirements as investigations continue, Alibaba said Tuesday. It’s also unable to make a complete assessment of how the ongoing “rectification” of affiliate Ant Group Co. will affect its business, according to the statement.The stronger-than-expected earnings may be overshadowed by an ongoing antitrust probe that has already wiped more than $130 billion off the e-commerce giant’s value since its October record. Uncertainty began in November when regulators first torpedoed Ant Group’s record initial public offering, then launched their investigation into the online retailer. Alibaba’s stock has dropped 13% since Ant’s aborted debut, the worst performance on Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. The shares in New York fell 3.9%.“Ant Group’s business prospects and IPO plans are subject to substantial uncertainties,” Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on a conference call Tuesday. “We will further update the market when the investigation is concluded.”Separately, Alibaba said it will kick off what could be a $5 billion dollar bond sale this week, picking up a plan that went quiet when its founder had been out of sight.Read more: Jack Ma Emerges for First Time Since Ant, Alibaba CrackdownAlibaba’s shares recouped some of their losses after Ma resurfaced in public during a live-streamed video conference last month, in an apparent signal that worst-case scenarios -- such as a government-led takeover or break-up of his companies –- are probably now off the table. Few expect Beijing to entirely back off its campaign to more tightly regulate Ant, Alibaba and the rest of China’s high-tech giants. But the stock’s partial recovery suggests investors are beginning to price out the risk of a crackdown that would put the country’s richest entrepreneurs and most innovative companies in serious jeopardy.Zhang spent a substantial portion of Alibaba’s earnings call talking about the company’s “social responsibility” in elevating small merchants and driving rural consumption, two of Xi Jinping’s priorities as Beijing tries to lift the countryside from poverty.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe full impact of the anti-monopoly investigation into Alibaba by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), as well as the new fintech regulations on Ant Group, may remain uncertain for some time. Alibaba disclosed with its 3Q results that it’s fully cooperating with SAMR but the investigation is yet to conclude. The company is also unable to provide a complete and fair assesssment of what effect changes to Ant Group will have on its business.-- Vey-sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here to read the researchSales climbed to 221.1 billion ($34.2 billion) during the December quarter, topping the 215.3 billion yuan average of analyst forecasts, while net income climbed 52%.Two of Alibaba’s largest and fastest-growing divisions made it into the black during the holiday quarter -- an important milestone for the company. Its cloud business reported its first ever positive adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization, while revenue for the segment rose 50%, driven by customers in the internet, retail and public sectors. Cainiao, its logistics unit, was also operating cash flow positive, the company said.Annual active consumers grew to 779 million in the December quarter, driving a 38% increase in its core commerce business. Alibaba booked $75 billion of sales over its annual Singles’ Day promotions last November, easily beating its 2019 haul after the company began promotions early and added additional services to the count for the first time. The increased spending came even as overall retail sales fell 3.9% last year, with consumption lagging industrial activity in the broader economic recovery.But investors are questioning whether Alibaba can sustain that growth as Beijing steps up oversight of Chinese tech giants, particularly in online commerce. Ma’s firm, once the standard-bearer for China’s fast-rising private firms and booming internet sphere, now faces penalties of as much as 10% of its revenue or some $7.8 billion if it’s found to have violated rules against practices like forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two,” predatory pricing or algorithms favoring new users.Any regulations requiring Alibaba to implement a full halt to forced-exclusivity policies may hit Tmall’s sales by close to a tenth in 2021, before sales return to 18-20% annual growth in 2022 and beyond, according to San Francisco-based Octahedron Capital Management LP. As of now, less than 10% of the top-selling brands are exclusive, they estimated. While Alibaba has exclusive flagship stores with some merchants, in most cases they can sell the same goods on other platforms, Zhang said.The regulations may also hamper its ability to fend off rivals from JD.com Inc. to Pinduoduo Inc., whose 730 million annual consumers are closing in on Alibaba’s user base. Meanwhile, short-video platforms like ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent-backed Kuaishou Technology are also tapping livestreaming as a sales outlet to wrest a larger e-commerce share. Beijing-based ByteDance revealed its Singles’ Day takings for the first time in 2020, with Douyin, the Chinese version of global sensation TikTok, booking 18.7 billion yuan in gross merchandise value.Ant contributed 4.8 billion yuan to Alibaba’s profit in the quarter, indicating that the company earned 14.5 billion yuan in the three months ended September -- before its $35 billion IPO was scuttled -- as its earnings lag one quarter behind Alibaba. As part of the crackdown, Ant has been told to “rectify” its lending, insurance and wealth management services.Read more: Jack Ma’s Ant Posted $2.3 Billion Profit Before Halt of IPO Stricter capital requirements may kneecap Ant’s ability to issue loans as freely, adding to challenges for its sister company’s commerce operations. The fintech giant provides small unsecured credit to about 500 million people through its Huabei (Just Spend) and Jiebei (Just Lend) platforms. These are used in part to pay for purchases of clothing and makeup from the Taobao marketplace or trips booked on Fliggy, the group’s online travel site.Payments using Huabei on Alibaba’s China marketplaces represent only a very small percentage of total credit granted under the platform, Zhang told analysts Tuesday. The “vast majority” of its customers have linked their payment accounts to multiple funding sources, he added.Tighter regulatory scrutiny over mergers may impede the tech giant from snapping up promising startups in emerging industries or taking outsized stakes in other businesses to ward off competition. Alibaba -- which had in recent years spent billions on stakes in hypermart operator Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. and NetEase Inc.’s Kaola e-commerce platform -- was fined 500,000 yuan in December for not seeking approval before boosting its holdings in department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. in 2017.“The business performance is strong and many feel the shares are undervalued compared to the roadmap and trajectory of some of their businesses,” Andy Halliwell, an analyst at technology consultancy Publicis Sapient, said in a research note after the earnings result. “However, if the Chinese government is looking to crack down on outspoken entrepreneurs and take a more conservative line with their larger tech businesses, then this will dent investors’ confidence in the brand and may create an opening for others to exploit.”Click here for a live blog on the numbers.(Updates with bond issuance in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Offers Few Answers as Crackdown Uncertainty Persists
2021-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Kuaishou Technology surged in Hong Kong’s gray market trading, in a sign that one of the city’s biggest initial public offerings in years is off to a good start.The short-video startup, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., advanced by as much as 181% to HK$322.80 on Thursday on an over-the-counter retail platform operated by Phillip Securities Group. If the stock rises by as much during its debut on Friday, it would become the second-best debut for an IPO over $1 billion in Hong Kong on record, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.Meanwhile, shares jumped as much as 200% on the Bright Smart Securities International (H.K.) Ltd. platform and up to 266% on the Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) Ltd. platform.Kuaishou’s shares were more than 1,200 times covered in the retail segment, making it the most popular IPO over $1 billion in the city in history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The technology company received about 1.4 million applications from local investors, meaning that one of every five people in the city subscribed to buy shares.Interest in the popular video service operator underscores the enormous appetite investors still have for IPOs in the city. Last year, Hong Kong saw a flood of largely successful listings, with hot debuts like JD.com and NetEase Inc. helping push total new share issuance by value to record levels. New stocks in 2020 have risen by an average of about 70% since their debuts. The momentum extended into this year with Yidu Tech Inc. jumping 148% on its debut while Strawbear Entertainment Group shares soared 84%.Kuaishou raised HK$42 billion ($5.4 billion) after pricing its sale of 365 million shares at HK$115 apiece, which was the top end of a marketed range, according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg News. The IPO pricing values the firm at $60.9 billion.The company sold just 6% of its offering to retail investors, while the rest were for institutions. Some trades were executed for HK$250 apiece in gray market trading by institutional investors earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter, more than double the listing price. That’s also a bigger premium than the 50% jump on Ant Group Co.’s planned offering before it was scrapped.In a so-called gray market, investors can bid for new shares before they officially start trading on an exchange. The over-the-counter mechanism is often seen as an early indicator of investor demand for the new listing.(Updates prices in second paragraph, adds prices in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Kuaishou Surges 181% in Hong Kong Gray Market Trading

With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently above from its 52 week high by 1.35%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. JD.com Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 79.22 of the Internet & Direct Marketing Retail industry.

2021-02-17,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. plans to list its shipping business in Hong Kong, raising potentially billions of dollars to capitalize on China’s post-Covid e-commerce boom.JD Logistics Inc.’s initial public offering could raise roughly $5 billion and value the unit at about $40 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. Details of the proposed spinoff haven’t been finalized, the company said in an IPO prospectus filed to the stock exchange.JD.com’s shares gained more than 6% to a record in Hong Kong Wednesday. The Chinese e-commerce operator joins an IPO rush fueled by flush liquidity in markets worldwide, with Hong Kong in particular emerging as a hot venue for tech coming-out parties. Kuaishou Technology in January completed the biggest internet debut since Uber Technologies Inc.’s, marking the best start to a year for Asian stock listings on record. New Horizon Health Ltd. this week became the second-most popular Hong Kong IPO among retail investors in the city’s history.JD Logistics should similarly draw interest. Shopping sites from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Pinduoduo Inc. have benefited as Covid-19 lockdowns drove consumers online and galvanized demand for the services that deliver parcels to doorsteps. Chinese e-commerce revenue should surpass 50% of the country’s total retail sales this year -- a first anywhere in the world, according to researcher EMarketer.

2021-02-22,"(Bloomberg) -- The battle to supply 1.4 billion people with fresh fruit and vegetables is taking China’s e-commerce companies into the country’s hinterlands, where they are attempting to revolutionize centuries-old agricultural practices to secure future supply for their burgeoning online grocery businesses.Xi Jinping’s government has long made self-sufficiency in food a “top state issue” as it seeks to avert a looming food crisis. The need to modernize China’s 200 million largely small-scale farms took on added urgency during the pandemic, when output and logistics disruptions coincided with homebound shoppers turning to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other internet retailers for their produce.Now, some of the country’s largest private companies have joined in with state efforts to help growers boost production, improve food quality and lower prices. For the e-commerce giants, it’s one way of strengthening their foothold in an online grocery market that’s expected to be worth more than $120 billion by 2023, without running afoul of Beijing’s recent crackdown on monopolistic practices like predatory pricing and forced exclusivity arrangements.In Fujian along the eastern coast, Alibaba has provided chicken farmers with smart bracelets that track the health of their poultry, while under JD.com Inc.’s guidance, rice growers in China’s arid north have installed smart sensors to gain real-time insights for irrigation. Out west, scientists in Yunnan are teaming up with Pinduoduo Inc. to use artificial intelligence to automate strawberry planting.“Agriculture is a critical area supported by the Chinese government,” said Liu Yue, an analyst with market research firm EqualOcean. With rural youths flocking to cities for better jobs and food safety increasingly threatened by pesticides and outdated farming methods, the country’s tech champions are eager to lend Beijing a hand, she said.The driving force behind the e-commerce platforms’ push into smart agriculture is the boom in online groceries, which is expected to double to about 820 billion yuan ($127 billion) by 2023 from last year, according to iResearch. The category overtook consumer electronics as the biggest contributor at JD.com in the first half last year, while Alibaba is making a bigger push into the business by taking a larger stake in hypermart Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.Meanwhile, a clutch of smaller rivals ranging from Xingsheng Youxuan and MissFresh-- both backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- to Dingdong Maicai are in the process of raising billions of dollars to grab larger shares of the online fresh foods distribution market. That prompted state media to warn in December against overcrowding in the sector, saying instead that internet giants with immense data and advance algorithms should do more in technology innovation.“Covid-19 has helped accelerate the conversion of such purchases to online channels,” said Vey-Sern Ling, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a large untapped market, and the companies have to participate or be left behind.”At a time when Chinese leaders are clamping down on monopolies in areas from fintech to e-commerce, smart agriculture is one sphere where the tech giants’ commercial interests are aligned with the national agenda.In guidelines issued on Sunday, the State Council called for increased private investment to develop modern farming techniques and empower villages using advanced technologies. Breeding and cultivation sciences were also listed as one of Beijing’s top tech priorities for the next five years, alongside AI, quantum computing and computer chips. JD has said its smart farm projects are at least 50% funded by government subsidies.Despite the efforts, the growing appetite for fresh fruits and vegetables has left most of China’s traditionally labor-intensive farms -- roughly 98% of the 200 million operators are families or small businesses -- struggling to keep up. The country’s restrictions on land ownership and diverse terrain spanning the steppes of Inner Mongolia to the tropical shores of Hainan island in the south make it difficult to implement the industrial-scale farming that’s commonly seen in the U.S. and Europe. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also show that about a third of farm workers are aged 55 or older, and the birthrate is at record lows, driving labor costs higher.Lei Jinrong is one farmer who’s benefited from partnering with the online retailers. The owner of Fuxin Farm in Fujian province has equipped 1,000 of his chickens with Apple Watch-style bracelets supplied by Alibaba. The devices digitally track the number of steps the birds take each day and anything below 20,000 would be an early sign of illness, he said, adding that he no longer needs to patrol his fields in search of sick poultry.The grower has also deployed street lamp-like devices that monitor air temperature, humidity and the level of toxic ammonia gas generated from bird waste, all displayed in real-time on a computer screen at his office. That has enabled Lei to expand production without hiring more workers -- good news as average salaries in his village have almost quadrupled over the past decade.In the eastern province of Shandong, peach farmers increased revenue by 50% last year after using JD’s blockchain technology to encrypt each step of the planting process and increase trust and transparency, attracting consumers long weary of food scandals from tainted milk powder to imitation eggs.“The improved efficiency and the economies of scale will drive down costs while higher-quality produce will yield better prices,” said Charlie Chen, head of consumer research at China Renaissance in Hong Kong. This will benefit both farmers and the e-commerce operators, he said.Pinduoduo, which raised $6.1 billion in November in part to finance its agricultural innovations, is counting on these efforts to help it quadruple sales of farm products to 1 trillion yuan by 2025. The company expects the initiatives to help it diversify beyond online retail, as it aims to license cutting-edge farming technology down the road, according to David Liu, vice president of strategy.Many of these initiatives are still in their infancy and scaling up will take time, as farmers have only recently started to collect data -- the foundation of running AI and other next-generation technologies -- and test new methods of growing. But the twin drivers of surging demand for online produce and Beijing’s push for self-sufficiency in food supplies means the tech behemoths’ forays into modernizing China’s farms have only just begun.“Smart agriculture is really the way to move forward,” said Lei, the chicken farmer. “We all have to innovate.”(Updates with more details from farmer in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Alibaba, Pinduoduo Fight Against China’s Looming Food Crisis"

2021-03-08,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Inc.’s initial public offering is on track to be the largest listing by a Korean company in a decade. And, like most of the major tech offerings these days, it’s happening in New York.There are three big reasons that explain why the U.S. is a better pick for the e-tailer backed by SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son. Perhaps most significantly, New York offers a considerable valuation premium. It also has a deeper, more liquid market, and allows uneven voting rights that would benefit Coupang’s founder, Harvard Business School drop-out Bom Kim.The U.S. has been the destination of choice for mega tech IPOs, with 2020’s biggest debuts Airbnb Inc. and DoorDash Inc. both listed in New York. Chinese e-commerce giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. also went public there. Coupang is seeking to raise up to $3.6 billion in its IPO and could garner a value of more than $50 billion. That would make it the largest float by a Korean company since Samsung Group took its insurance unit public at home in 2010.Had the loss-making e-commerce firm listed in Korea -- which from this month will allow unprofitable companies to go public -- Coupang could have fetched a maximum valuation of just $10 billion, according to Suh YongGu, a marketing professor at Sookmyung University.“The history of capitalism in South Korea is short, so Koreans don’t ascribe high valuations to loss-making companies,” said Suh.South Korea’s stock market is less than 70 years old, and is dominated by chaebols, or family-controlled industrial groups. In fact, SK Bioscience Co., a unit of SK Group, one of the county’s largest chaebols, will be the latest to have a stock market presence when it goes public this month. The maker of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine for Korea, is seeking to raise $1.3 billion ahead of its March 18 listing, according to Korean-language Seoul Economic Daily Monday.Korean investors’ appetite for their homegrown entrepreneur-led startups, however, will be tested in coming months with IPOs by Krafton Inc., the creator of hit game PUBG, and the country’s biggest mobile-only bank Kakao Bank. Unlike Coupang, those firms are profitable.Coupang has lost money in the last three years, recording an accumulated deficit of $4.12 billion as of December, according to its filing. Thanks to the surge in online shopping during the pandemic, however, it managed to nearly double its revenue to $12 billion last year.A $51 billion valuation would put Coupang among the five most valuable companies in Korea, of which Samsung Electronics Co. is the biggest. Korea’s other big startups with growing clout in e-commerce -- the $58 billion Internet conglomerate Naver Corp., and the $39 billion messaging app Kakao Corp. -- are both listed in Seoul, but were both profitable when they went public. The two are backed by entrepreneurs and not linked to the chaebols like Samsung Group.In fact, Coupang’s listing in the U.S. will allow it to exceed the combined market value of the six chaebol-owned retailers trying to expand their presence in e-commerce -- E-Mart Inc., Lotte Shopping Co., GS Retail Co., Shinsegae Inc., BGF Retail Co., and Hyundai Department Store Co..Liquidity is another allure of the U.S. market, allowing companies to raise funds frequently through secondary share sales. Korea’s stock market, at a total value of $2.12 trillion, is a fraction of the $44.2 trillion of the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.“It’s easier for investors to exit” their stakes in the U.S., said Seo Sang-Young, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities in Seoul. “And the trading volume is much larger.”And finally, a U.S. listing gives founders more power.Korea doesn’t allow uneven voting rights, favored by tech firms like Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc., who see it as a way for founders to focus on the long-term. But the U.S. does, even if the ownership structure is itself not without controversy, as it lacks shareholder protections. Kim, Coupang’s 42-year-old founder, will end up with 76.7% of the company’s voting rights with just 10.2% of its outstanding shares.“We would have liked Coupang to list in Korea,” said Kim Sung-gon, a spokesperson at Korea Stock Exchange. “But we respect the company’s choice.”Korea IPO Boom Year Kicks Off With Coupang FloatStill, missing out on the chance to buy into one of the country’s hottest companies in the biggest Asian company IPO since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion New York listing in 2014 is rankling the retail investors who have come to dominate Korea’s stock market since the pandemic spread.“There is certainly regret among retail investors that they cannot buy into the IPO,” said Kim DongJoo, the CEO of Iruda Discretionary Investment, a Seoul-based investment firm catering to retail investors seeking to buy foreign stocks.Largest IPOs by Korean Companies:Coupang prides itself on its same-day or at least pre-dawn deliveries. It is also giving its warehouse staff and 15,000 full-time delivery workers a total of $90 million in pre-IPO stock, a unique largess that comes at a time when the deaths of a string of couriers from overwork as online orders soared is causing a national uproar.“We believe we are the first company in Korea to make our front-line employees stockholders,” Kim said in a letter to shareholders in Coupang’s IPO filing.Five Coupang warehouse workers have died in the past year, according to the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a major labor organization. On Saturday, a Coupang delivery driver was found dead in an incident which Yonhap News said showed symptoms his colleagues attributed to overwork.Coupang said in a statement on Monday that the deceased worker had “worked around four days a week on average and worked about 40 hours for the past 12 weeks.” It added, however, that it would “make efforts to thoroughly protect the health and safety of workers.”(Updates with Coupang’s statement on a worker’s recent death in the last two paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Coupang’s $3.6 Billion IPO Shows U.S. Is King for Tech IPOs
2021-03-08,"Chinese e-commerce major JD.Com Inc’s (NASDAQ: JD) fintech unit, JD Technology, will likely withdraw its IPO application on Shanghai’s technology-heavy Star Market amidst China’s widespread crackdown on the extensive online finance industry, Bloomberg reports based on the South China Morning. What Happened: JD Technology, previously known as JD Digits, was renamed after absorbing JD’s AI and cloud businesses earlier this year. The withdrawal was influenced by China’s regulatory policy update, which blocked Jack Ma’s ambitious Ant Group Co IPO in November. China Communist Party recently prioritized data disclosure norms regarding search, e-commerce, and social media by the tech companies for the next five years to promote the healthy development of the sharing and online economies. Beijing was also reportedly launching a platform for sharing public and government data. JD Technology was planning to rake around $3 billion (20 billion yuan) and might reapply going forward. JD.com stock shed 5% in Hong Kong on Monday. Why It Matters: China’s fintech industry was rendered vulnerable since the introduction of new regulations on consumer lending in November, leading to the abrupt suspension of Jack Ma’s Ant’s planned $35 billion debuts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Beijing initiated a crackdown on alleged monopolistic practices by its giant internet industry last November over their growing influence from voluminous data collection. The regulatory crackdown compelled the fintech companies to reconsider their IPOs and raise cash to adhere to the rules requiring online lending companies to provide 30% funding for loans. Previously, companies like Ant and Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE: LU), the fintech arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. Of China Ltd (OTC: PNGAY) (OTC: PIAIF) kept about 2% of their loans on their books. JD Technology promoted its Chief Compliance Officer to the CEO last December to manage the growing regulatory crackdown. Lufax, which went public in New York in October, had cautioned investors regarding its plan to raise the proportion of loan risk with lending partners to 20% from 2% due to regulatory trends. The stock declined close to 13% since Feb. 16. However, it is presently trading at 12.7% above its IPO price. Price action: JD shares are trading lower by 3.92 at $87.16 in the pre-market session on the last check Monday.

2021-03-11,"Shares of JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) were higher Thursday after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported its fourth-quarter results. What Happened: JD.com reported fourth-quarter revenue of $34.4 billion, up 31.4% year-over-year, and its non-GAAP earnings per share jumped over 175% to 23 cents. Analysts, on average, estimated EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $33.78 billion. The core retail business fetched revenue of $31.97 million, roughly a 28% increase. Revenue from new businesses — including logistics services provided to third parties, overseas business, technology initiatives, as well as asset management services — more than doubled to $2.3 billion. Operating cash flow for the full year was at $6.5 billion, and free cash flow was at $5.4 billion. JD.com said its annual active customer accounts increased 30.3% to 471.9 million.

Why It's Important: JD.com, though operating in a market with huge addressable opportunity, is up against domestic rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NASDAQ: BABA). The company could also face some difficult comparisons following the COVID-19-driven strength in e-commerce in 2020. The fourth-quarter numbers are a testament to JD.com's resilience and strong operational performance even as it evolves as a supply chain-based technology and service company, with increasingly diversified revenue sources.

2021-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Search engine giant Baidu Inc. is seeking to raise as much as HK$28 billion ($3.6 billion) in a second listing in Hong Kong, kicking off the second such share sale by a U.S.-traded Chinese firm in the city this year.Nasdaq-listed Baidu is selling 95 million shares in the offering and has set a maximum price of HK$295 for the portion of the sale reserved for Hong Kong retail investors, it said in a regulatory filing Thursday. That price represents a 19% premium to Baidu’s Wednesday closing price in New York. Baidu rose 6.8% on Thursday.Baidu aims to set the final price before the U.S. market open on March 17 and start trading in Hong Kong on March 23. At $3.6 billion, it would be the biggest so-called homecoming listing of a U.S.-traded Chinese company in Hong Kong since JD.com Inc.’s June 2020 offering, which raised $4.5 billion.Baidu follows online car-sales website Autohome Inc. in seeking a trading foothold in the Asian financial hub this year, after a wave of such share sales in 2020 which saw some $17 billion raised. Other companies looking at selling shares in the city include Tencent Music Entertainment Group and video company Bilibili Inc.Autohome raised $688 million after pricing its Hong Kong share sale at about a 5.5% discount to its last closing price in New York on Monday.A growing cohort of U.S.-traded Chinese firms have been listing in Hong Kong amid deteriorating relations between the world’s two biggest economies. The second listings enable the companies to expand their investor bases closer to their home markets.The trend has boosted the listing volumes of Hong Kong’s bourse, which now has a growing contingent of tech companies listed there. The city has had a bumper start to the year for initial public offerings, such as video startup Kuaishou Technology’s $6.2 billion debut in February. The Chinese company’s shares are trading 168% above their offering price.Once one of China’s tech leaders, Baidu is now playing catch-up as the country’s internet users increasingly shift from desktop to mobile.

2021-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. slid Friday after the Chinese online retail giant flagged to investors it may sustain spending on logistics and new initiatives to continue riding the country’s online commerce boom.The company reported a higher-than-expected 31% jump in December quarter revenue. The strong results means JD has a “strong foundation for investments in a range of growth opportunity,” Chief Financial Officer Sandy Ran Xu told analysts on Thursday. She declined to forecast margins in short term.Investors have been concerned that JD’s margins will come under pressure as the Chinese company spends to maintain and expand its delivery network. Net margin in the first quarter will drop 1 percentage point, Bocom analysts Brandy Sun and Connie Gu said in a research note, in part because of investments in infrastructure.JD’s inhouse logistics network has been instrumental to buoying the company’s operations during the pandemic, when lockdowns drove a record number of consumers online. That fueled a surge in e-commerce for players from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Pinduoduo Inc. in 2020, straining delivery networks, and questions remain about whether they can sustain growth this year.The retailer reported sales of 224.3 billion yuan ($35 billion) in the December quarter, outpacing the 219.52 billion yuan average of analysts’ estimates. Net income was 24.3 billion yuan. JD’s market value has more than doubled since the start of 2020 despite a broader tech selloff that began last month. The shares fell as much as 5.8% in Hong Kong trading. On Thursday, the company announced its infrastructure management affiliate was raising $700 million in a preferred share issuance co-led by Hillhouse Capital and Warburg Pincus.Chinese e-commerce revenue should surpass 50% of the country’s total retail sales this year -- a first anywhere in the world, according to researcher EMarketer. JD is now preparing to spin off its logistics unit in an initial public offering that could raise roughly $5 billion, the second debut of a subsidiary since JD Health Inc.’s 2020 coming-out party.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysJD.com’s profitability could keep improving as it benefits from economies of scale and operating efficiencies. The company’s increasing penetration of users from lower-tier cities may help to fund continued market-share gains vs. offline retailers, even amid intense e-commerce competition. The company operates its own fulfillment network and logistics infrastructure, and owns the inventory for a sizable portion of its sales. These strategies attract merchants and consumers who demand high-quality goods.- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.JD Logistics’s imminent IPO would be a milestone for its parent, which spent billions of dollars building one of China’s largest courier services and hundreds of warehouses nationwide to ensure on-time delivery and retain control over its shipping network.Its debut however will be overshadowed by the likely withdrawal of another financial services affiliate from capital markets.

2021-03-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Pony Ma’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. has been put on notice.Asia’s largest conglomerate was censured by China’s antitrust watchdog on Friday as Beijing expands a crackdown that began with Jack Ma’s online empire.The token fine is just the beginning. China’s top financial regulators see Tencent as the next target for increased supervision after the clamp down on Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., according to people with knowledge of their thinking. Like Ant, Tencent will probably be required to establish a financial holding company to include its banking, insurance and payments services, said one of the people, seeking anonymity as the discussions are private.The two firms will set a precedent for other fintech players on complying with tougher regulations, the people added.Such a move would mark a significant escalation in China’s campaign to curb the influence of its technology moguls, days after Premier Li Keqiang pledged at the National People’s Congress to expand oversight of financial technology, stamp out monopolies, and prevent the “unregulated” expansion of capital.“We will continue to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment, which we view as beneficial to the industry, and will seek to ensure full compliance,” Tencent said in an emailed statement following the fine by the antitrust watchdog. The company declined to comment on financial regulatory matters.The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment.A progression of rules unveiled in the past six months has taken aim at the dominions built by China’s most successful online entrepreneurs. The first blows fell on Jack Ma when Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering was torpedoed at the last minute, followed by an antitrust probe into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.While Pony Ma doesn’t have the kind of high-profile globally that Jack Ma does, he is considered one of China’s most accomplished entrepreneurs within the country. The 49-year-old year has built Tencent into the most valuable company in Asia on the strength of its social medis and games businesses. Ma is the wealthiest person in China.Tencent has already seen collateral damage from the new regulations, though investors had shrugged this off, pumping up the stock even as Alibaba was punished. Its 26% advance over six months contrasts with a 15% slump for Jack Ma’s e-commerce behemoth, which owns a third of Ant. Shares of Tencent climbed to a record on Jan. 25, valuing it at roughly $950 billion.The stock fell 4.4% in Hong Kong Friday. Shares of Tencent investor Naspers and its unit Prosus also declined. Spreads on Tencent’s 2.39% dollar bond due 2030 widened 9 basis points, while notes issued by fellow Chinese tech giants including Meituan and JD.com Inc. also weakened, according to traders.Along with Ant, proposed rules to break up market concentration in digital payments and rein in consumer lending online will damage prospects for Tencent’s WeChat Pay and its wider fintech business.A diktat to fold those operations into a holding company that could be regulated more like a bank would potentially further curb its ability to lend more and expand as rapidly as it has done in recent years.Tencent’s fintech business had revenue of about 84 billion yuan ($13 billion) in 2019, accounting for 22% of the total and making it the largest earnings driver after online entertainment. That’s about 70% of Ant’s revenue for the year.Valuation HitAfter Ant’s IPO suspension, the central bank directed the Hangzhou-based firm to turn itself into a financial holding company, subjecting it to capital restrictions, the need for fresh licenses and ownership scrutiny. The overhaul could slash the financial juggernaut’s valuation by about 60% from the $280 billion it was pegged at last year, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan has estimated.Tencent meets the parameters for such treatment, including the threshold for assets and having businesses that straddle at least two financial sectors.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysFintech is neither Tencent’s fastest-growing nor its most profitable business, minimizing the immediate financial impact, yet the turn of events may signal an era of more rigorous regulatory oversight, with strong echoes of Alibaba’s shifting fortunes.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchOutside of financial services, Tencent and its peers are exposed to further action on the antitrust front.On Friday, the regulator fined Tencent, search leader Baidu Inc., ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and a clutch of others 500,000 yuan each -- the maximum under current rules -- for past acquisitions and investments, stepping up its crackdown.Alibaba is also being probed and the watchdog is considering a record fine exceeding the $975 million that Qualcomm Inc. paid in 2015, Dow Jones has reported.Premier Li balanced his strictures last week with an assurance that Beijing supports the “innovation and development of platform companies,” as long as they fall in line with the country’s laws.Recent measures to rein in fintech firms weren’t aimed at a specific company, a senior regulatory official has said, and instead focus on creating a stable environment for private enterprise to grow.Yet, Beijing has a penchant for making examples of its biggest companies to force others to fall in line with changing priorities. All three of the nation’s financial watchdogs have made it their primary goal this year to curb the “reckless” push of technology firms into finance. And there’s little doubt of the sway Pony Ma’s conglomerate has built in finance.Its WeChat super-app boasts more than a billion consumers that use it for everything from chatting with friends to booking taxis and buying groceries. WeChat Pay accounts for almost 40% of the country’s mobile payments market, second only to Alipay, according to iResearch.Tencent with three other major tech companies -- Alibaba, JD.com and Baidu -- together control over 40 financial licenses through acquisitions or investments, according to Xinhua News Agency, which cited 01caijing.(Updates with background on Pony Ma in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Tencent Faces Broad China Clampdown on Fintech, Deals"
2021-03-12,"Looking into the current session, JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is trading at $84.70, after a 5.90% decrease. Over the past month, the stock decreased by 14.71%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 140.47%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 21.78%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Below could put $50,000 back in play. Below that puts the 50-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Alibaba (BABA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) continues to swoon as the headlines remain unfavorable. The Chinese government is cracking down, and that’s not doing any favors for Alibaba. The chart shows just as much. Perhaps investors will want to pass on Alibaba for stocks that are more in favor. However, Alibaba is likely getting attractive for value buyers, down almost 30% from the highs. Shares are bouncing off the $230 area after filling the recent gap. Incidentally, this area is also the 2020 pre-coronavirus high. If shares can take out this week’s high near $242, then a push up toward the 50-day moving average and $250 is in the cards. If we break this week’s low, Alibaba may need to retest the 100-week moving average. Below that, and the December low is in play. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: JD.com (JD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) reported pretty good earnings earlier this week, but quickly faded from those gains and is falling lower on Friday. The stock is now stumbling into the weekend at its weekly low, after breaking $85.22. From here, bulls would love a flush down toward $80. That would likely be (but not guarantee) a great dip-buying opportunity. Not only is there support between $78 to $80, but the 200-day moving average is also in play there. 7 Media Stocks to Binge on in a Post-WandaVision World On the upside, though, we need to see JD stock fill Friday’s gap and reclaim the 10-day and 100-day moving averages. If these measures are resistance, shares could retest whatever low ends up being put in on the current decline. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Facebook (FB) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider FAANG has been sleeping for months, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is no exception. The stock has been consolidating for months now, as it continues to put in a series of lower highs. It looked like it was trying to clear downtrend resistance on Thursday, but shares gapped down on Friday and sent it back below resistance. Unfortunately, shares are below the 100-day moving average. However, its holding a number of key moving averages at Friday’s low — as well as the stock’s VWAP measure. Next week, support needs to continue holding for the bulls. However, a rotation over $277.90 — this week’s high — would be bullish and put the 61.8% retracement in play near $281.50. Above that, and perhaps we can get a push up toward $290. However, on the downside, a break of those key moving averages would be discouraging. But a close below $254 would be really disheartening.

2021-03-15,"JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), a leading Chinese e-commerce company, reported a 31% jump in fourth-quarter revenue totaling $34.4 billion, and total revenue of $114.3 billion for 2020. The company's core retail business saw the largest jump in revenue at $31.9 billion. Year-over-year, the company reported a 30% increase in active users to 471.9 million, it said on a Thursday earnings call. Earnings per share increased 187.5% year-over-year to 23 cents, beating the 19-cent estimate. The company is currently not issuing any earnings guidance JD.com said it would continue to acquire new users and diversify its business for long-term growth. Last year, the company filed listings in Chinese markets for spinoffs including JD Health (HKG: 6618), JD Digits and JD Logistics. JD Health raised $4 billion in its initial public offering in December, while plans for JD Digits and JD Logistics seem to have been put on hold due to Chinese regulation uncertainty. In November, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA), JD.com's e-commerce competitor, planned on listing its spinoff Ant Group Co., with plans to raise $35 billion on the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets, but was suspended by Chinese regulators for alleged monopolistic practices. JD Digits has a similar fintech structure to Alibaba's Ant Group. Chinese regulators have created a new system of regulations due to large tech firms spinning off into financial institutions. China is concerned these companies disguise themselves as fintech companies, avoiding the regulating and licensing requested from other leaders in the financial sector. After halting Ant Group in November, the central bank directed the company to create a financial holding company, diminishing the company's valuation by 60%. Investments continue for JD Logistics JD Logistics is the spinoff that sets itself apart from its rivals. While Alibaba outsources its logistical needs, JD Logistics has invested heavily in creating a supply-chain powerhouse. The company can deliver over 90% of its orders same or next day and has access to 99% of the population. It has been using autonomous vehicles and robots to access residential deliveries. In 2018, it unveiled a warehouse that could handle 200,000 orders a day with only four employees. In total, the company has 730 warehouses covering 17 million square feet. In the earnings call, JD.com reported that its asset management spinoff, JD Property, is expected to raise $700 million in a Series A funding round led by Hillhouse Capital and Warburg Pincus. In Q4, the logistics property fund launched with $462.4 million of assets under management, led by Singapore's GIC and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co., as reported by Tech in Asia. In January, the JD.com spinoff's 5G logistics park won awards at China's 2020 Science and Technology Awards for the Postal Industry. The park production control system enables the intelligent management of vehicles and workers and can automatically recognize the volume of goods and match it to the best available capacity. JD stated in a release that it reduces turnover days by 10% and improves forecasting efficiency by 500%. ""With our core retail supply chain and logistics capabilities, JD is well established with a convincing value proposition to benefit from the secular trends and drive the long-term sustainable growth of our business in 2021 and beyond,"" said Sandy Xu, chief financial officer of JD.com, in its Q4 earnings call.

2021-03-16,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s top leader warned that Beijing will go after so-called “platform” companies that have amassed data and market power, a sign that the months-long crackdown on the country’s internet sector is only just beginning.President Xi Jinping on Monday chaired a meeting of the communist party’s top financial advisory and coordination committee, ordering regulators to step up oversight of internet companies, crack down on monopolies, promote fair competition and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Internet companies need to enhance data security and financial activities need to come under regulatory supervision, CCTV also reported.The unusually strongly worded comments from Xi and his lieutenants suggest Beijing is preparing to amplify a campaign to curb the influence of its largest and most powerful private corporations, which has so far centered mainly on Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its affiliate Ant Group Co. The term platform economies could apply to a plethora of mobile and internet giants that offer services to hundreds of millions, from ride-hailing behemoth Didi Chuxing to food delivery giant Meituan and e-commerce leaders like JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc.“Some platform companies are developing in non-standardized ways and that presents risks,” CCTV said, citing minutes of the meeting. “It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of laws governing platform economies in order to fill in gaps and loopholes in a timely fashion.”Read more: China Presses Alibaba to Sell Media Assets, Including SCMP The report came days after Bloomberg News reported that governments watchdogs were now setting their sights on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s $100 billion-plus finance empire after ordering an overhaul of Ant. Top financial regulators see Tencent as the next target for increased supervision, according to people with knowledge of their thinking. Like Ant, Tencent will probably be required to establish a financial holding company to include its banking, insurance and payments services, said one of the people, seeking anonymity as the discussions are private.The two firms will set a precedent for other fintech players on complying with tougher regulations, the people added. Such a move would mark a significant escalation in China’s campaign to curb the influence of its technology moguls, which began last year with the scuttling of Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering and the publication of new antitrust regulations governing technology firms.Read more: China’s Politburo Vows to Strengthen Anti-Monopoly EffortsTencent lost more than $65 billion of value in the two days following the report, and its shares were little changed Tuesday. The company’s WeChat super-app is the giant that looms across the industry, offering everything from chatting to booking rides and paying for purchases.Other companies have long accused the service of unfair competition, with chief rival ByteDance Ltd. suing the Shenzhen-based giant earlier this year for blocking access to content from its Douyin platform, TikTok’s Chinese twin. Tencent has called the accusations baseless and malicious.In e-commerce, the triumvirate of Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo account for an increasing share of consumer spending in China. Researcher eMarketer estimates that online purchases should surpass 50% of the country’s total retail sales this year, a first anywhere in the world. That influence has already drawn scrutiny from the antitrust watchdog and its new anti-monopolistic regulations had specifically called out practices like forced exclusivity arrangements, predatory pricing and algorithms favoring new customers over older ones.A slew of other services have risen in prominence in recent years and may come under the scrutiny of regulators, including ByteDance’s Toutiao news aggregator and Douyin. Food delivery is dominated by Meituan, with Alibaba’s Ele.me service playing catch-up. Didi Chuxing is the dominant force in ride-hailing after taking over Uber’s business in China, a deal that one local taxi industry group has called on the antitrust watchdog to investigate. Even smaller operators have been caught up in the crosshairs, with community group-purchase startups like Nice Tuan being handed fines for improper subsidies.Read more: What Is Behind China’s Crackdown on Its Tech Giants: QuickTake“It’s not a good thing if you rule the market right now, especially when it comes to fintech and areas essential to daily lives, like e-commerce and community group buying,” said Ke Yan, Singapore-based analyst with DZT Research. “Dominance in the market now has a downside whereas it was appealing to the investors in the past.”The development of China’s platform economy is currently at a crucial stage, Xi said at Monday’s meeting. It is necessary to focus on the long term, strengthen weaknesses and create an innovative environment to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the platform economy, he added. Monday’s speech was the first time Xi had specifically addressed platform economies, though he had previously stressed the importance of preventing monopolies.The semi-regular meeting of the Party’s top financial supervisory group typically helps to set the tone and direction of national policy. During their last gathering in September, Xi focused on the so-called “dual circulation” approach of relying on both international and domestic consumption and production to lift the economy.China’s efforts to regulate its internet giants coincide with growing global scrutiny over the industry, as governments from the U.S. to the European Union and Australia have clashed with companies like Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. That’s a testament to how important the industry has become to basic infrastructure and national security and a coordinated global response is needed to address its healthy development, said Chen Xi, an adjunct professor at Xi’an Jiaotong UniversityThe vertically integrated business models for platform companies can “restrict innovation and the development of job creation and their disorderly expansion will inevitably create obstacles to the recovery of the global economy,” Chen said. “This is a global challenge.”(Updates with background, analyst comments starting in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Xi Warns Against Tech Excess in Sign Crackdown Will Widen
2021-03-17,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s largest e-commerce operator Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is planning to offer its fast-growing bargains service on rival Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat messaging platform in a major concession to regulators seeking to crackdown on monopolies in the internet sphere, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Alibaba and Tencent have long excluded each other’s services from their platforms, creating so-called walled gardens within their ecosystems. Now, Alibaba is planning to set up a Taobao Deals lite app on Tencent’s WeChat and has already invited some merchants to participate, according to the people. Selling through the WeChat super-app means the merchants will now be able to accept payments made through WeChat Pay, a service that had been barred on Alibaba’s marketplaces, the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren’t authorized to discuss the information.Tencent will have to approve the listing of any in-app platforms -- commonly known as mini programs -- and it’s not clear if the company will do so with Taobao Deals lite app. More than one billion people use WeChat, which has evolved beyond chatting to offer ride-hailing, online shopping and payments on its platform. Representatives from Alibaba and Tencent didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The move is one of the clearest indications that Beijing’s crackdown on monopolies is taking effect. China’s antitrust watchdog has made regulating internet companies one of its top priorities, cracking down on monopolistic behaviors from alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals to forced exclusive arrangements and predatory pricing. President Xi Jinping on Monday called for greater oversight of the “platform” economy, signaling that Beijing is preparing to amplify its campaign against its tech giants.Read more: Xi Warns Against Tech Excess in Sign Crackdown Will Widen While Alibaba’s roots are primarily in online shopping and Tencent’s main businesses are in social media and gaming, the companies have, over the years, encroached on each other’s territories. WeChat ventured into e-commerce in 2017 by allowing brands such as Starbucks Corp. and WalMart Inc. to sell through their mini apps, a business that last year took in $240 billion. Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group Co.’s Alipay also competes head-to-head with WeChat Pay, and the two services together account for more than 90% of China’s online payments market.The companies’ influence stretches beyond their core businesses. The two behemoths have created separate fiefdoms within China’s tech industry through their patronages, buying up promising startups and investing in others to expand their reach. Only a few companies -- TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. is a notable exception -- have thrived without forming an alliance with either giant.Tencent has invested in JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc., whose e-commerce marketplaces compete with Alibaba, and it’s also a backer of Meituan, which competes with Alibaba’s Ele.me service in food delivery. Meituan was sued last year by a user, who accused the platform of preventing customers from using Alipay. The lawsuit is still ongoing, said Chen Pengfei, a lawyer at Beijing Shijing Law Firm who represents the plaintiff.Outside its flagship Taobao and Tmall shopping platforms, Alibaba’s deals app caters to the growing consumption needs of China’s smaller cities and towns and is aimed at fending off hard-charging rival Pinduoduo. The mobile monthly average users of Taobao Deals surpassed 100 million in 2020, Alibaba said in its earnings. In February, local media 36Kr reported that a Taobao Deals mini program had been added to WeChat for a brief time before being removed.The twin giants were founded by very different billionaire entrepreneurs: Jack Ma at Alibaba and Tencent’s Pony Ma. Alibaba’s Ma had been the most visible target of the antitrust campaign after the flamboyant businessman criticized regulators ahead of Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering. The listing was pulled just days before its debut and antitrust investigators last year began a probe into Ma’s flagship e-commerce corporation.Unlike Jack Ma, his fellow billionaire has tended to avoid the media and skipped several major technology events due to health reasons. Still, he hasn’t escaped the scrutiny of regulators -- Tencent has been fined for not seeking approval on past deals and people with knowledge of the matter have said the firm’s fintech businesses may be the next target for increased supervision by financial regulators.Read more: Tencent Said to Face Broad China Clampdown on Fintech, Deals Tencent has previously been accused of barring services by rival tech companies on its platforms.

2021-03-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Pinduoduo Inc.’s billionaire chairman has stepped down from the board, relinquishing control of China’s fastest-growing e-commerce company the same day it announced its user base had surpassed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s.Founder Colin Huang will be replaced by Lei Chen, who keeps his chief executive officer title, the company said in a statement Wednesday. The move cements Huang’s retreat from the corporation that has helped him become China’s third-richest man, after he handed over the role of CEO last year.Huang is saddling his co-founder Chen with the task with sustaining an extraordinary pace of growth. Sales in the December quarter climbed 146% to 26.5 billion yuan ($4.1 billion), beating the average 19.3 billion yuan forecast. That’s several-fold the pace of e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com Inc., fueled by surging demand for groceries and as more shoppers in less-developed cities venture online.“The departure had an air of inevitability about it in light of Huang’s resignation as CEO last July,” Robin Zhu, a Bernstein analyst, wrote in a research note. “But the timing came as a surprise, and skeptics will note that the China internet sector is 0-for-1 when iconic founders leave the building.”The stock slid more than 7% in New York, giving up a fraction of its 370% gain over the past year, after Citigroup analysts pointed out growth in e-commerce volumes lagged expectations. Gross Merchandise Value climbed 66% in 2020, suggesting quarterly growth of 57%, Citi’s Alicia Yap wrote.Read more: His Wealth Surged by $25 Billion. Then Jack Ma’s Rival QuitPinduoduo is aiming to become the world’s largest grocer, Chen said. To achieve that target, the company intends to invest in an agriculture-focused logistics infrastructure platform over the next few years.After stepping down from the role of chairman, Huang will give up the 1:10 super voting rights attached to his shares in Pinduoduo. He’s also pledged to extend the lock-up period for his shares by another three years, according to a statement by the company.His departure caps a rise meteoric even by Chinese internet industry standards, creating a $57 billion personal fortune and a $180 billion U.S.-listed company in a span of about six years with the help of heavy advertising. Pinduoduo’s stock rose more than fourfold last year and reached a record on Feb. 17, though the shares have since retraced after a wider technology selloff and China’s scrutiny of its internet companies.Huang, a former Google engineer, will focus more on longer-term initiatives, including research in food and life sciences, the company said. In 2017, the billionaire said he was unlikely to spend the rest of his life at PDD, saying in a letter to employees he wanted to delegate more responsibility to younger colleagues to keep its entrepreneurial spirit alive.“I hope that my stepping down as the Chairman of the Board will aid this young person into independent adulthood,” Huang said in a letter to shareholders, referring to PDD. “Though I can no longer become a true scientist myself, I would feel very lucky and blessed if I have the chance to become a research assistant to a future, possibly great, scientist.”Pinduduo’s annual active consumers climbed to 788 million in December, surpassing the 779 million users at Alibaba’s online marketplaces. During the recent Spring Festival holiday, daily users at Pinduoduo briefly surpassed those on the Taobao mobile app, according to researcher QuestMobile, underlining how the company has narrowed the gap with its larger rival.Net loss attributable to shareholders in the December quarter narrowed to 1.38 billion yuan from 1.75 billion a year earlier, Pinduoduo said in a statement on Wednesday before the U.S. market open. Gross merchandise value in the 12 months ended December rose 66% to 1.67 trillion yuan.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysPinduoduo’s sales growth may stay robust as it ramps up monetization of its sizable customer and merchant base. Rapidly expanding sales could help narrow operating losses in the medium term. The company’s expanding shopping ecosystem may become increasingly appealing for merchants looking to advertise. Despite heavy marketing expenses, Pinduoduo’s marketplace model can sustain high gross margin, and could deliver a profit as revenue achieves greater scale.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the reportThat growth has come with a price, however. The company faced an online backlash earlier this year after an employee in her early 20s died after walking home at 1:30 a.m. and another committed suicide. The deaths renewed criticism of the long hours commonly worked at China’s tech giants -- a 996 office schedule of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, plus overtime -- and prompted authorities to open an investigation into working conditions at Pinduoduo.Read more: Pinduoduo Worker’s Death Spurs Investigation, Online FuroreIts online groceries business has also come under scrutiny from antitrust regulators. Earlier this month, Pinduoduo’s community group-purchase business was fined alongside four other operators for excessive subsidies in the second half of 2020, a move that had disrupted market order, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Third Richest Person Cedes Control of E-Commerce Phenom

2021-03-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc.’s stock offering in Hong Kong Tuesday marks an unlikely resurgence for founder Robin Li, who has fought his way back to relevance in China’s technology industry after squandering a near-monopoly in search.The internet giant raised $3.1 billion in the biggest homecoming by a U.S.-traded Chinese firm in the city since JD.com Inc. last June. Li’s firm has more than tripled its valuation from the trough last March, with about half the gains coming in the past three months as Baidu’s bets in AI finally start to pay off in areas like cloud and electric vehicles. It’s a rare stretch during which the company has outperformed larger rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., whose shares have struggled in the wake of China’s campaign to crack down on its freewheeling tech industry.In an exclusive interview, the 52-year-old founder sketched out how Baidu is transforming into an AI company and why he supports Beijing’s antitrust push. The firm will continue to team with automakers like Geely to stake out a position in the world’s biggest vehicle market, sustain a record pace of R&D investment despite compressing margins, and seek to acquire talent and technologies to drive AI development, Li said. Eventually, the bulk of Baidu’s revenue will come from businesses beyond search and advertising, he added.“We’ve been investing in AI for more than 10 years and we probably lost a lot of money by doing this,” Li said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Eventually we’ll be rewarded.”Baidu closed out its first day of trading in Hong Kong unchanged after rising nearly 2% earlier in the session. Its muted debut compares with first-day gains of 3.5% at JD.com and 5.7% for Netease Inc., two other U.S.-listed Chinese firms that turned to the city for secondary listings.Once part of China’s internet triumvirate alongside Alibaba and Tencent, Baidu has fallen behind in the mobile era, where the effectiveness of its search service has been crippled by super-apps like WeChat creating siloed ecosystems. To compete, Baidu’s core search product is morphing into an all-purpose platform hosting an array of content from news articles to live-streams and short videos, essentially emulating those apps.Meanwhile, Baidu has sunk billions of dollars over the past decade into areas from natural language processing to voice interaction, an endeavor that ran into initial trouble with departures of key executives like its well-regarded chief scientist Andrew Ng. Until recently, investors had called into question the firm’s R&D spending, which amounted to roughly a fifth of its 2020 revenue. But Li has kept faith in his original vision and is pledging to keep up the pace of investment for the next decade or two.“For the most part of the past 10 years, I think that investors did not appreciate that,” Li said. “So we were kind of feeling lonely. But it is really in line with our mission.”Now, commercialization is finally coming to the fore. In January, Baidu unveiled a new venture with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group that will produce smart EVs, prompting analysts to revalue the tech giant’s eight-year-old Apollo unit, whose self-driving software had drawn tepid interest from automakers in the past. The venture with Geely will accelerate that integration, Li said, with the goal to deliver its own EVs to the market within three years.Semiconductors are another use case. Like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc., Baidu started to custom design chips for its own server farms, performing tasks like search rankings. But what started as a cost-saving exercise has morphed into a new business, with nearly half of its Kunlun chips used by third parties last year. The new 7-nanometer iteration of the AI silicon has started production at fabs despite the global chip shortage, Li said. The unit -- which recently raised $230 million from investors like IDG Capital -- will target more external clients in areas from finance to education and energy, he added.By pushing into chips and AI, Li is delving into businesses that have become a top priority for China’s Communist Party as the world’s largest economies vie for global influence. U.S.-China tensions spanning trade to cybersecurity and investments have already engulfed a number of Baidu’s peers. Scores of Chinese companies that once saw an American listing as conferring the ultimate cachet have delisted or added secondary listings elsewhere.Baidu’s Hong Kong debut is a hedge against the potential risks of trading in the U.S., Li admitted, but more importantly, it “lets the Chinese investors really share in Baidu’s growth story.”Domestically, Beijing has signaled its intent to end a decade of unfettered expansion by its tech giants, combating behaviors like market abuse and data monopoly since late last year. While Jack Ma’s Alibaba and Ant Group Co. have been the most visible of regulators’ targets, the country’s antitrust watchdog this month also penalized firms including Baidu and Tencent for not seeking its approval for years-old acquisitions and investments. Li pledged to ensure the company doesn’t make the same mistake in future deals, which could be funded by proceeds from the Hong Kong listing.In many ways, Baidu is better shielded from China’s crackdown than its fellow tech pioneers. Efforts to encourage private-sector businesses to share the data they’ve amassed will likely benefit Baidu’s core search service by dismantling the walls around the country’s most popular mobile apps. Its open platforms for self-driving and deep-learning technologies dovetail with Beijing’s drive to open up data amassed by private-sector companies, Li said.His firm also doesn’t wield the same kingmaker status as Alibaba and Tencent, both of which back a plethora of up-and-comers. Some of their portfolio companies, such as food-delivery giant Meituan and ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing, were created through billion-dollar mergers. In 2017, Baidu sold its takeout business to rival startup Ele.me, which was later acquired by Alibaba, after losing a costly subsidy war in China’s gig economy.“You just cannot imagine the No. 1 and No. 2 guy all of a sudden merging and gaining more than 90% of market share in the U.S.,” said Li, a graduate of the University at Buffalo in New York. “But that happened quite a few times in China before. That’s not good for innovation. So I think that the antitrust push is justified.”Read more: What Is Behind China’s Crackdown on Its Tech Giants: QuickTakeThanks to its relative immunity to the antitrust push, Baidu’s market capitalization has climbed $66 billion over the past year, ahead of its Hong Kong listing where retail demand was 112 times the available stock. Institutions subscribed for 10 times the shares allocated to them.While the share sale has provided Baidu with a temporary boost, investors are likely to focus more on the firm’s search and content as its biggest earnings driver over the medium term. That’s where upstarts like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. have been luring away eyeballs and marketing dollars alike. Baidu’s Netflix-style service iQiyi Inc. saw revenue fall in the past two quarters as newer platforms like Bilibili Inc. and Kuaishou Technology gained traction.In November, Baidu agreed to buy Joyy Inc.’s YY streaming service for $3.6 billion in a deal intended to enrich its content offerings. Revenue for the first quarter is forecast to grow at least 15% from last year, when Covid-19 plunged its advertising business into a contraction.“Baidu’s attempts to commercialize its artificial intelligence initiatives are positive. Investors now have better visibility of returns, after years of heavy investment,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling. “However incremental revenue generated from these endeavors may have to be reinvested to drive growth, and the profitability of these businesses could stay low until sufficient scale is achieved. Hence Baidu is likely to continue relying on its core search business in the near-term.”With Baidu still in the midst of transformation, Li is in no rush to relinquish control after 21 years at the helm, unlike other Chinese tech moguls including Alibaba founder Ma and Pinduoduo Inc.’s Colin Huang.“I always wanted to find someone who can replace me as CEO,” he said. “But in the meantime, I do enjoy my current work. I like technology. I like to see all the changes happen.”(Updates with share performance in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Baidu CEO Engineers $66 Billion Comeback After Missteps
2021-03-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Video streaming platform Bilibili Inc. has raised HK$20.2 billion ($2.6 billion) from a second listing in Hong Kong, the third U.S.-listed Chinese company to sell shares in the financial hub this year.Bilibili priced the Hong Kong offering at HK$808 per share, according to a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday. The price represents a discount of 2.7% to Bilibili’s Monday closing price of $106.88 on the Nasdaq. The firm sold 25 million shares in the Hong Kong offering.A rapidly-expanding group of overseas-traded Chinese firms is selling shares in Hong Kong, attracted by hot demand for new listings in the Asian financial center. The wave of equity offerings comes as tensions rise between Beijing and the U.S., where fastest-growing technology firms from around the world have long sought to raise capital.The trend gathered pace last year, with some $17 billion raised from second listings by the likes of JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. The latest to complete an offering, search engine giant Baidu Inc., ended its first day of trading flat on Tuesday after raising $3.1 billion.The deals add to what’s already shaping up as a busy year for equity offerings by internet companies, even as investors rotate out of so-called pandemic winners. Asian technology, media and telecommunications firms have been involved in $21.5 billion of share sales this year, a record for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Bilibili, whose backers include Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Sony Corp., started in 2009 as a website serving up Japanese animation to eager young viewers in China. It broadened its offering to incorporate other shows as well as comics and mobile video games, generating revenue from advertising, live-streaming and premium memberships.Like many other tech companies, it has been a beneficiary of the stay-at-home trend caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with average monthly active users increasing 55% in the fourth quarter of 2020.Bilibili’s shares are due to start trading in Hong Kong on March 29.

2021-03-23,"JD.com Inc (NASDAQ: JD), a Chinese e-commerce giant, delivered another solid quarterly report last week. The company has been one of many e-commerce winners during the pandemic with its stock price more than doubling as its leadership in online grocery and pharmacy has strengthened, while expanding into logistics and telehealth. Q4 Key Figures Revenue rose 31.4% to $34.4 billion, exceeding estimate of $33.8 billion. More impressively, adjusted operating income rose 72% to $186 million. Adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled to $0.23, also exceeding expectations of $0.19. A Record Quarter For Service Revenues The majority of the company's revenue comes from its e-commerce business but service revenue, which includes its marketplace, advertising, logistics, and other services like healthcare, have been steadily outgrowing its core segment. In the fourth quarter, services revenue grew by 53% to $4.9 billion, which is its fastest growth rate in 11 quarters. Although the segment still only generates about 15% of overall revenue, it will turn into high-margin businesses once scale is reached. In many ways, the company seems to be following the same playbook that worked so well for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) that went from breakeven in 2014 to generate $21 billion in profits last year by layering service businesses over its e-commerce business. Revenue at JD's new businesses, which include logistics, overseas businesses, and tech initiatives, already doubled to $2.4 billion so its margins should continue improving as these businesses gain strength. Chinese New Year Boost Singles Day, Chinese New Year, and the 6/18 holiday are major sales drivers for all Chinese e-commerce companies like JD.com, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) and Pinduoduo Inc (NASDAQ: PDD). But this was a holiday season like no other as the government ordered people not to travel. Remote orders doubled during the Chinese New Year as consumers bought gifts for friends and family in other cities. Moreover, sales have normalized from a year ago when COVID-19 overtook China, and consumers started buying beauty products again rather than cleaning supplies and masks. Spinoffs On December 8th, JD.com successfully completed the Hong Kong listing of its pharmacy e-commerce and telehealth business, JD Health. It raised $4 billion as a result. It's now valued at roughly $50 billion, and accounts for more than a third of the company's total market cap as the pandemic elevated demand for medicine and telehealth ‘visits'. In December, it had 72.5 million annual active users, and its entire platform has served over 150 million users. According to Frost & Sullivan, it controls nearly 30% of China's online pharmacy market. JD Health's top competitors include Alibaba's Ali Health, Tencent Holdings' (OTC: TCEHY) affiliate WeDoctor, and Ping An's (OTC:PANH.F) Good Doctor, all of which benefited from the pandemic. But JD.com is not showing any signs of stopping as it filed last month to list JD Logistics on the Hong Kong stock exchange. JD Logistics has been operating as a stand-alone business since 2017, serving as a logistics and fulfillment center not just to the company but also to third-party customers. The unit is the largest of JD.com's new businesses. It doubled in sales in the last quarter, and the company has been quickly expanding its infrastructure by adding 200 warehouses and more than 40 million square feet of space to its 800 warehouses, fulfillment centers in eight cities, and front distribution centers in 31 cities, covering almost all districts across China. Its warehouses are being increasingly automated with robots, driverless vehicles and delivery drones. The stock offering is expected to raise $5 billion, bringing its valuation to $40 billion. Shanghai IPO of its fintech subsidiary, JD Digits is also on the horizon. JD owns 37% of the fintech affiliate that provides consumer loans and supply chain financing for companies. The company aims to raise $2.9 billion with an initial valuation of approximately $29 billion. Outlook The goals of all three spin-offs are the same: to streamline JD's core business, raise cash, and reduce the company's overall dependence on U.S. exchanges. Along with the growth of JD Property, its real estate arm, JD.com has a bright future as more than just an e-commerce company.

2021-03-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Tech giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. dived after U.S. regulators revived threats to toss China’s largest corporations off U.S. bourses, compounding concerns of a widening domestic antitrust crackdown.Alibaba slid almost 4% in Hong Kong Thursday, joining a U.S. selloff that wiped at least 20% off Chinese tech names including Tencent Music Entertainment and iQiyi Inc., Baidu Inc.’s Netflix-like streaming subsidiary. The Hang Seng Technology Index slid to its lowest since November before ending down just 1.2%.Tencent, which on Wednesday sought to allay investor concerns about the fallout to its fintech division from growing regulatory pressure, slid 2.8% and has now shed more than $200 billion of market value since a January peak. Following Tencent’s fourth-quarter results, brokerages including Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and HSBC cut their price targets on Asia’s largest company for the first time in at least a year.Read more: Tencent Dives Despite Assurances on China Antitrust FalloutBaidu, the search giant that debuted in the city only on Monday, finished 9.7% lower while Alibaba-rival JD.com Inc. lost 3.6%. Food delivery giant Meituan, which reports 2020 results Friday, shed 1.6%. The losses followed a warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it’s taking steps to force accounting firms to let U.S. regulators review the financial audits of overseas companies -- the penalty for non-compliance being ejection from exchanges.That threat worsened sentiment in China’s giant tech sector just as Beijing is widening a crackdown on the country’s largest corporations, fearful of their growing clout after years of relatively unfettered expansion.“Sentiment got hurt after Chinese technology stocks slumped overnight on Nasdaq,” while local reasons accelerated the selloffs, including a lack of upside surprises in Tencent earnings and worries about government regulation on the sector, said Daniel So, a CMB International analyst.On Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported China’s government has proposed establishing a joint venture with local technology giants that would oversee the lucrative data they collect from hundreds of millions of consumers. The preliminary plan, which is being led by the People’s Bank of China, would mark a significant escalation in regulators’ attempts to tighten their grip over the country’s internet sector. Tencent executives sought to tamp down the impact of Beijing’s heightened scrutiny after reporting revenue growth that barely met expectations.“The major reason is still valuation,” said Linus Yip, First Shanghai Securities analyst. “Even after such a big drop, the sector is still not cheap. I don’t think the tech stocks will resume upward trend any time soon. Any bad news will trigger further selloffs, be it Nasdaq plunge or news about China’s regulation.”Read more: Tencent Dives Despite Assurances About China Antitrust FalloutFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China Tech Giants Dive as Delisting Threat Joins Crackdown Fears
2021-03-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Meituan warned it will remain in the red for several more quarters despite record revenues, underscoring the cost of competing against the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in newer arenas from online groceries to community e-commerce.Revenue climbed in 2020’s final quarter at its fastest pace in a year, to a better-than-expected 37.92 billion yuan ($5.8 billion). But the company swung to a net loss of 2.2 billion yuan during those three months after spending on burgeoning initiatives like community buying, a sort of micro-Groupon concept that’s taken off across China.China’s economic recovery has helped the world’s largest meal delivery service increase orders, while its hotels and travel business benefited from a rebound in domestic travel when the country reined in the pandemic. That’s allowed Meituan to shift its focus to developing fast-growing new businesses while navigating heightened regulatory scrutiny.Read more: Alibaba, Meituan Chase $14 Billion Group-Buyers ArenaWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysMeituan may spend the next few quarters mired in operating losses as it ramps up investment in its community e-commerce business, capping a stretch of relative profitability that began early in 2019. The push to build its supply chain and delivery capabilities in rural areas for agricultural produce and grocery retail could be protracted, as deep-pocketed competitors such as Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and JD.com lick their chops while eyeing the same market.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchChief Executive Officer Wang Xing has identified Meituan Select -- its community e-commerce -- as a “top priority” for the firm, which sees groceries as a key pillar of its “Food + Platform” strategy to build a super-app. But the business faces intense competition from well-capitalized internet giants including Pinduoduo Inc. and Didi Chuxing as well as a crop of plucky upstarts with names like Xingsheng Youxuan and Nice Tuan, all seeking to lure new customers in less-developed towns and cities across the country.Investments in the business mean operating losses for its new initiatives division -- which includes Meituan Select and other grocery services -- may reach 25 billion yuan this year and total another 23 billion yuan in 2022, Citigroup analysts including Alicia Yap estimated in a research report last month.“Increasing investments in new initiatives may continue to cause significant negative impacts on our overall financial results,” the company said in a statement. It “may continue to record operating losses in the next few quarters as we ramp up our community e-commerce business.”Read more: Tencent Is Said to Boost Stake in Grocery App Xingsheng YouxuanThe aggressive competition has drawn the scrutiny of regulators. Meituan’s unit was among five community group purchasing services fined for improper subsidies that disrupted market order, the antitrust watchdog said earlier this month. State media has also criticized technology companies for focusing on online groceries instead of innovation.For now, Meituan appears to have escaped the worst of China’s campaign against the excesses of its tech giants, which started with the scrapping of Ant Group Co.’s initial public offering last year and rapidly engulfed Jack Ma’s other flagship company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Still, President Xi Jinping’s warning that Beijing will go after so-called platform economies that have amassed data and market power signals the crackdown will widen.In food delivery, Meituan’s biggest revenue contributor, regulators have begun paying more attention to commissions charged to merchants. The company also axed a healthcare mutual aid service, which had allowed participants to share in the costs for medical treatment, because of increased government oversight, local media reported earlier this year.Meituan’s shares rose 5.1% on Friday before the release of the earnings report.

2021-03-29,"(Bloomberg) -- The massive selloff in U.S.-listed shares of Chinese technology companies isn’t linked to their fundamentals and makes for a bigger buying opportunity, according to Citigroup Inc.The brokerage reiterated buy ratings on Baidu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. following what it called an “unfortunate dislocation” of their share prices. Gary Dugan, chief executive officer at the Global CIO Office in Singapore, along with a few other fund managers echoed Citi’s views.“While we are not sure whether the huge volatility of share price movement of many technology stocks during the last few days could trigger more forced selling pressure or de-risk selling sentiment from other funds in the next few days, we do believe and are reassured that none of the sell-down is fundamental related,” Citi analysts including Alicia Yap wrote in a note.The comments come after Friday’s unprecedented selling in some U.S. stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to American media conglomerates by the family office of former Tiger Management trader Bill Hwang. The firm, Archegos Capital Management, was forced by its banks to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares after some positions moved against Hwang, according to two people directly familiar with the transactions. The block trades come as Chinese tech shares were already reeling from higher U.S. Treasury yields and mounting regulatory pressure.READ: Tiger Cub Hwang’s Family Office Behind Friday Trade Frenzy Technical, Exaggerated“We would look at the selloff as technical and exaggerated and hence a long-term buying opportunity,” said Dugan of Global CIO Office.Tencent Music, whose ADRs slumped 37% in the last three sessions, announced a $1 billion share buyback on Monday. Baidu has approximately $2.78 billion outstanding share repurchase programs that it could use for buying back the shares, Citi analysts wrote in a note.“Baidu’s growth outlook remains promising,” they wrote. Citi’s price target of $364 on Baidu’s ADRs implies a potential upside of about 75% from Friday’s close.Baidu’s stock, which made its debut in Hong Kong last week, slid 5% on Monday, adding to its 5.6% loss from Friday. A measure of tech shares, which includes many Chinese giants, dropped 1.8% even as the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended little changed.READ: Credit Suisse, Nomura Face Losses as Banks Tally Archegos Damage“We bought some Baidu shares in Hong Kong last Friday,” said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd. “The valuation has turned very attractive.

2021-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- A pair of Cathie Wood exchange-traded funds added around $1 billion in a single day this week in an emphatic display of investor loyalty toward the famed Ark Investment Management founder.The flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) took in a record $717 million on Tuesday, while the Ark Space Exploration and Innovation fund (ARKX) absorbed $281 million on its debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Alongside bumper trading volumes on the day, it all adds up to one of the best-ever ETF launches for the fund, which tracks U.S. and global companies engaged in space exploration and innovation.The launch was seen as a key test of Wood’s appeal after a volatile few months of flows and performance. After one of the strongest performances of 2020, ARKK has dropped 3.7% this year amid a rough patch for tech shares. Before a flood of cash this week, Ark’s main fund had posted five consecutive days of outflows, its longest streak on record.“This is investors taking advantage to jump in after the drop from the top,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You can see some investors were shaken out because there were some days of outflows during this period but for the most part people held strong so the demand is still there.”ARKK was up 3.1% as of 9:41 a.m. in New York on Thursday, while the space fund rose 1.3%.Ark’s investing strategy and success in luring new cash has spurred big bets on small companies, raising concern the firm exerts an outsize influence over the shares its holds. Wood handed fresh ammunition to her critics last week in a filing that removed prospectus clauses limiting exposure and concentration risks in its ETFs.Bearish bets have been building in ARKK, with short interest climbing to 4.9% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd, nearing the record 5.3% hit in early March.Still, none of that has taken any shine off the space fund, with Wood’s first new ETF in two years seeing $294 million worth of shares change hands on its first day.The product’s top two holdings are Trimble Inc. and another Ark vehicle, the 3D Printing ETF (PRNT).

2021-04-07,"(Bloomberg) -- JD Digits Technology Holding Co. is planning to set up a financial holding company to comply with regulatory rules in China’s fintech sector, according to people familiar with the matter.The holding unit, which will be regulated more like a bank, is expected to be separate from JD Digit’s other technology business, the people said requesting not to be named because the matter is private. As part of the restructuring, JD Digits, an affiliate of e-commerce giant JD.com Inc., has let go of some staff and is weighing divesting some of its stakes from past investments, the people said.The plans coincide with the lapse of its initial public offering last week, with the company shifting its focus to technology by adding artificial intelligence and cloud computing services. China’s fintech companies are navigating a rapidly changing regulatory landscape that has already required them to shore up capital and comply with tougher restrictions. The rules forced industry behemoth Ant Group Co. to pull its $35 billion IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong days before its debut.JD.com didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.In February, the banking regulator imposed new caps on banks and financial institutes working with online microlenders, dealing a further new blow to companies.The securities regulator is now considering tighter rules for first-time share sales on the STAR board, requiring firms to prove their technology credentials, people familiar with the matter have said. The tighter rules would make it harder for fintech companies such as Ant and JD Digits to list on the venue, according to the people.JD Digits promoted compliance chief Li Yayun to be its new chief executive officer in December and said that it is working with regulators.Read more: JD’s Fintech Arm Names CEO To Handle Heightened Chinese ScrutinyThe firm had initially targeted a debut in the first half of 2021, Bloomberg News reported last year.

2021-04-08,"(Bloomberg) -- At the height of the global pandemic in October, more than 6,000 people packed into a new 25-acre stadium in Shanghai to watch one of the world’s biggest sporting contests. Another 45 million tuned in online, about as many as watched the six games of the 2020 NBA Finals on TV. The matchup was the League of Legends world championship -- a watershed moment for competitive gaming and its overseer Tencent Holdings Ltd.Asia’s most valuable company has set its sights on a billion-dollar esports arena that already boasts more regular viewers than the National Basketball Association or the National Football League. Tencent has placed pro gaming at the heart of its ambition to dominate online entertainment, from mobile games and video streaming to social media. It’s betting that esports will entice and retain the internet audiences it needs and eventually grow to something approaching the $10-billion-plus NBA.Key to realizing that vision is Tencent’s blockbuster League of Legends battle arena title and TJ Sports, the outfit it set up in 2019 to organize and promote the game’s competitive play in China. While total revenue in TJ’s first two years just surpassed 1 billion yuan ($152 million), the fledgling company intends to create original content such as reality shows and livestream channels around its star players and teams, and peddle merchandise.“Esports is like the Super Bowl, which isn’t just a sport event but also a vehicle of art and entertainment,” said TJ co-Chief Executive Officer Leo Lin. “We are going for the direction of connecting esports with our games and wider entertainment business.”Esports show how Tencent thinks about its long-term future. The world’s largest games publisher has invested billions of dollars in talent agencies, streaming sites and tournament organizers to create the infrastructure necessary to turn pro gaming from a niche into an instrumental part of its growth strategy. TJ expects to double overseas viewership as soon as this year and aims to do the same with media rights revenue from outside China.“Tencent’s investing in esports for the long haul, because it breaks the boundaries between different businesses from licensing to sponsorships and ticket sales,” said Chundi Zhang, a gaming analyst with Ampere Analysis. “Especially with competition for attention intensifying and user acquisition costs growing in the gaming market itself, esports still has huge untapped potential.”Shenzhen-based Tencent, which operates some of China’s largest Netflix-style and e-book services as well as producing tentpole films and games, already knows how to monetize popular content.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysNot only do Tencent’s investments have considerable value -- $185 billion as of Dec. 31, up from $131 billion at Sept. 30 -- but many provide strategic relationships that help drive revenue. Partnering with content providers across video (NBA, NFL, HBO), video games (FIFA, PUBG, Fortnite) and music (Universal, Warner, Sony) enhances service offerings and expands Tencent’s target audiences.-- Robert Schiffman and Suborna Panja, analystsClick here for the full researchCompetitive play in Tencent-published games like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile enhances the longevity of the firm’s biggest cash cows and feeds its content divisions. That in turn helps portfolio companies like Huya Inc. and Bilibili Inc. Apart from reality shows and music festivals, Tencent last year debuted a drama series called CrossFire, which tells the story of a wheelchair-bound teenager trying to make it as a pro gamer in the online shoot-em-up by that name.But esports is also a key gateway to tapping foreign audiences for Tencent, which hasn’t struck gold on any app quite like ByteDance Ltd.’s video sensation TikTok. The company reaches most people outside China through games like PUBG Mobile -- among the most popular mobile esports titles in Southeast Asia -- and League of Legends, which is regularly played by tens of millions worldwide.Under TJ’s helm, the League of Legends Pro League (LPL) in China has become the world’s largest esports league by its sheer size: 17 teams compete in hundreds of face-offs every year, with the 2020 season garnering 100 billion views through live broadcasts and social content. The headline sponsor for the new season is Mercedes-Benz.Each person attending the Shanghai spectacle was the winner of a 1-in-500 lottery. Producing the gathering took months of planning and TJ provided players with 100-page handbooks on virus prevention. When the clanging of digital swords wasn’t filling the air, Chinese rapper Lexie Liu and the League of Legends virtual K-Pop band rocked the stage in front of socially-distanced attendees. A 26-foot-tall dragon sculpture was lit up under the landmark Oriental Pearl TV Tower.Read more: Shopping Is Moving Online. Esports Are Going The Other WayBroadcast rights for events like the one in Shanghai now bring in about 60% of TJ’s revenue, with the rest largely coming from sponsorship deals, said Lin, who also heads the China wing of Tencent-owned League of Legends maker Riot Games Inc. Much like Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch, live streams of pro matches offer a revenue opportunity through virtual gift sales, and the goal is to also expand income from licensed merchandise, he added. Thinking along similar lines are e-commerce giants JD.com Inc. and Suning.com Co., both of which run teams competing in the LPL.“We want to get closer to young people,” said JD Gaming manager Kong Lin. “JD has its roots in consumer electronics, so there’s a good synergy for us to do esports.”Beijing has thus far shown a favorable attitude toward pro gaming, provided the games themselves have been approved and related content is free of excessive violence or political messaging. That’s allowed Tencent and its peers to explore multiple business avenues -- including abroad.In 2020, simultaneous viewership of the LPL outside China peaked at 310,000 on sites including YouTube and Twitch, which TJ intends to double before 2022’s end. Aiding that goal are the multi-language web shows it produces to capture the game’s memes and highlights, along with Tencent’s in-house streaming unit Trovo Live for the U.S. market. Much like real-world sports, all the action is visual and Tencent needs to only swap the commentary to localize League of Legends content.Looking further ahead, TJ plans to organize the China league for other games in the same fantasy universe, Lin said. In February, the franchise’s mobile edition Wild Rift got the license for a commercial launch in China and the highly anticipated title recently became available for U.S. players to test. With most gaming now happening on mobile, that could prove to be the next big step in catalyzing interest and engagement.“As a gamer myself, I’m always inspired when I see someone grow from a nobody to a big star,” Lin said. “I believe many fans love esports as a sport for that same reason.”(Updates with JD executive comment in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Bets Billions on Gamers With More Fans Than NBA Stars
2021-04-12,"(Bloomberg) -- After China imposed a record antitrust fine on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the e-commerce giant did an unusual thing: It thanked regulators.“Alibaba would not have achieved our growth without sound government regulation and service, and the critical oversight, tolerance and support from all of our constituencies have been crucial to our development,” the company said in an open letter. “For this, we are full of gratitude and respect.”It’s a sign of how odd China’s crackdown on the power of big tech has been compared with the rest of the world. Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook would likely not express such public gratitude if the U.S. government were to hit Facebook Inc. or Apple Inc. with record antitrust fines.Almost everything about China’s regulatory push is out of the ordinary. Beijing regulators wrapped up their landmark probe in just four months, compared with the years that such investigations take in the U.S. or Europe. They sent a clear message to the country’s largest corporations and their leaders that anti-competitive behavior will have consequences.For Alibaba, the $2.8 billion fine was less severe than many feared and helps lift a cloud of uncertainty hanging over founder Jack Ma’s internet empire. The 18.2 billion yuan penalty was based on just 4% of the internet giant’s 2019 domestic revenue, regulators said. While that’s triple the previous high of almost $1 billion that U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. handed over in 2015, it’s far less than the maximum 10% allowed under Chinese law. Alibaba’s shares rose more than 8% Monday in Hong Kong.“We’re happy to get the matter behind us,” Joseph Tsai, co-founder and vice chairman, said on an investor call on Monday. “These regulatory actions are undertaken to ensure fair competition.”The fine came with a plethora of “rectifications” that Alibaba will have to put in place -- such as curtailing the practice of forcing merchants to choose between Alibaba or a competing platform -- many of which the company had already pledged to establish. But Tsai said regulators won’t impose radical changes to its e-commerce strategy. Instead, he and other executives pledged to open up Alibaba’s marketplaces more, lower costs for merchants while spending “billions of yuan” to help its clients handle e-commerce.Tsai said the company is unaware of any other antitrust investigations into the company, except for a previously discussed probe into acquisitions and investments by Alibaba and other tech giants.“The required corrective measures will likely limit Alibaba’s revenue growth as a further expansion in market share will be constrained,” Lina Choi, a senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a note. “Investments to retain merchants and upgrade products and services will also reduce its profit margins.”Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang on Saturday declared his company now ready to move on from its ordeal, while China’s Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily issued assurances that Beijing wasn’t trying to stifle the sector.The Hangzhou-based firm “has escaped possible outcomes such as a forced breakup or divestment of assets. The penalty will not shake up its business model, either,” said Jet Deng, an antitrust lawyer at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons.Beijing remains intent on reining in its internet and fintech giants, a broad campaign that’s wiped more than $250 billion off Alibaba’s valuation since October. The e-commerce giant’s speedy capitulation underscores its vulnerability to further regulatory action -- a far cry from just six years ago, when Alibaba openly contested one agency’s censure over counterfeit goods on Taobao and eventually forced the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to backtrack on its allegations.On Monday, shares in Alibaba’s fellow internet giants from social media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. to food delivery leader Meituan and JD.com Inc. fell on fears they could draw similar scrutiny. “It’s exactly what the market is thinking right now: Tencent and Meituan are next in line if the same standards are to be applied, but even the worst won’t be so bad,” said Zhuang Jiapeng, a fund manager at Shenzhen JM Capital Co.Beyond antitrust, government agencies are said to be scrutinizing other parts of Ma’s empire, including Ant Group Co.’s consumer-lending businesses and Alibaba’s extensive media holdings. And the shock of the crackdown will continue to resonate with peers from Tencent and Baidu Inc. to Meituan, forcing them to tread far more carefully on business expansions and acquisitions for some time to come.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysChina’s record fine on Alibaba may lift the regulatory overhang that has weighed on the company since the start of an anti-monopoly probe in late December. The 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) fine, to penalize the anti-competitive practice of merchant exclusivity, is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales. Still, the company may have to be conservative with acquisitions and its broader business practices.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the full research.The investigation into Alibaba was one of the opening salvos in a campaign seemingly designed to curb the power of China’s internet leaders, which kicked off after Ma infamously rebuked “pawn shop” Chinese lenders, regulators who don’t get the internet, and the “old men” of the global banking community. Those comments set in motion an unprecedented regulatory offensive, including scuttling Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering.It remains unclear whether the watchdog or other agencies might demand further action. Regulators are said, for instance, to be concerned about Alibaba’s ability to sway public discourse and want the company to sell some of its media assets, including the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong’s leading English-language newspaper.Read more: China Presses Alibaba to Sell Media Assets, Including SCMPChina’s top financial regulators now see Tencent as the next target for increased supervision, Bloomberg News has reported. And the central bank is said to be leading discussions around establishing a joint venture with local technology giants to oversee the lucrative data they collect from hundreds of millions of consumers, which would be a significant escalation in regulators’ attempts to tighten their grip over the country’s internet sector.“The high fine puts the regulator in the media spotlight and sends a strong signal to the tech sector that such types of exclusionary conduct will no longer be tolerated,” said Angela Zhang, author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism” and director of the Centre for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong. “It’s a stone that kills two birds.”For now, it appears investors are just glad it wasn’t worse. In its statement, the State Administration for Market Regulation concluded Alibaba had used data and algorithms “to maintain and strengthen its own market power and obtain improper competitive advantage.” Its practice of imposing a “pick one from two” choice on merchants “shuts out and restricts competition” in the domestic online retail market, according to the statement.The firm will be required to implement “comprehensive rectifications,” including strengthening internal controls, upholding fair competition and protecting businesses on its platform and consumers’ rights, the regulator said. It will need to submit reports on self-regulation to the authority for three consecutive years.The company will have to make adjustments but can now “start over,” Zhang wrote in a memo to Alibaba’s employees Saturday.“We believe market concerns over the anti-monopoly investigation on BABA are addressed by SAMR’s recent decision and penalties,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note entitled “A New Starting Point.”Indeed, The People’s Daily said in its commentary Saturday that the punishment was intended merely to “prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.”“It doesn’t mean denying the significant role of platform economy in overall economic and social development, and doesn’t signal a shift of attitude in terms of the country’s support to the platform economy,” the newspaper said. “Regulations are for better development, and ‘reining in’ is also a kind of love.”(Updates with shares and commentary from the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Record Alibaba Fine Shows China’s Big Tech Can’t Fight Back

2021-04-13,"(Bloomberg) -- China ordered 34 internet corporations Tuesday to rectify their anti-competitive practices within the next month, signaling that Beijing’s scrutiny of its most powerful firms hasn’t ended with the conclusion of a probe into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Shares in Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Meituan extended losses after the State Administration for Market Regulation issued a stern statement emphasizing it will continue to eradicate abuses of information and market dominance among other violations. Also summoned to an ad-hoc meeting with the watchdog on Tuesday were industry leaders including TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., search giant Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc.Regulators warned internet companies to “heed Alibaba’s example,” reaffirming their intent to abolish forced exclusivity among other practices. The meeting -- organized jointly with the cyberspace and tax regulators -- came days after Beijing wrapped up a four-month probe into Alibaba by slapping a record $2.8 billion fine on the e-commerce giant for abuse of market dominance.The penalty was less severe than many feared and lifted a cloud of uncertainty hanging over founder Jack Ma’s internet empire. It also came after the Chinese central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech titan.Alibaba’s shares have gained 7% since the start of the week, but its fellow Chinese internet giants have gyrated while investors digest the rapid-fire announcements and concerns grow that Beijing’s scrutiny will extend beyond Alibaba. On Tuesday, Tencent gave up early gains to finish down slightly while Meituan, video service Kuaishou Technology and JD all slid more than 3% in Hong Kong.“The base line of policies cannot be crossed, the red line of laws cannot be touched,” the market watchdog said in the statement on Tuesday.The investigation into Alibaba was one of the opening salvos in a campaign seemingly designed to curb the power of China’s internet leaders, which kicked off after Ma infamously rebuked “pawn shop” lenders, regulators who don’t get the internet, and the “old men” of the global banking community. Those comments set in motion an unprecedented regulatory offensive, including scuttling Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering.The 34 firms summoned Tuesday must now undergo complete rectification after conducting internal checks and inspections over the next month, and make a pledge to society to obey rules and laws, the antitrust watchdog said in its statement. Regulators will organize follow-up inspections and companies that continue to engage in abuses like forced exclusivity -- a practice that “flagrantly trampled and destroyed” market order -- will be dealt with severely.The regulator also highlighted abuses like acquisitions that squeeze out smaller rivals and burning through cash to grab market share in community group buying, currently the hottest e-commerce arena in China. Firms also need to address issues like counterfeiting, data leaks and tax evasion, according to the statement.“This is positive because the SAMR is giving the platforms one month to review their practices, rather than dish out fines and penalties without warning,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “They are using Alibaba as an example to deter misbehavior from the rest of the industry players. If these companies toe the line, industry competition can become healthier. ”(Updates with share action from the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China Warns 34 Tech Firms to Curb Excess in Antitrust Review
2021-04-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Meituan, ByteDance Ltd. and JD.com Inc. were among 12 Chinese tech giants that issued pledges to obey antitrust laws, a day after Beijing gave the companies a month to conduct internal reviews and comply with government guidelines.Pinduoduo Inc., Baidu Inc. and Sina Weibo were also among firms that published their commitments in a statement on the website of State Administration For Market Regulation. The antitrust watchdog had summoned 34 companies to a meeting on Tuesday, ordering them to rectify their excesses and issue pledges to operate legally.Other firms will also issue statements over the next three days, SAMR said, calling on the public to help monitor the corporations and hold them to their word. The regulator had exhorted the tech giants to heed the example of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which was fined a record $2.8 billion following a four-month probe into the e-commerce titan for abuses like forced exclusivity.Meituan said in its pledge it will “consciously maintain market order” and “won’t force merchants to ‘pick one of two’ through unreasonable means.” The food delivery leader offered to actively work with regulators and said it accepted social supervision.Other e-commerce operators including JD.com, Suning.com Co. and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. also committed to not engage in forced exclusivity, a practice that the SAMR had criticized for “flagrantly” trampling and destroying market order. Pinduoduo and Dingdong Maicai -- major players in the red-hot community e-commerce sector -- also pledged to stay away from improper pricing.ByteDance, owner of hit apps like TikTok and Douyin, issued a 13-point pledge that included promises to strengthen its compliance management and avoid violations such as abuses of market power and unlawful mergers and acquisitions.Meituan gained nearly 4% and JD.com rose more than 2% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, recovering some of their losses from earlier this week. China’s wide-ranging campaign against its tech leaders has erased billions in value from the sector since November, when new laws on fintech and antitrust were introduced and regulators launched an offensive against Jack Ma’s empire, including the scuttling of Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion initial public offering.The 34 firms must undergo complete rectification after conducting internal checks and inspections over the next month, and make a pledge to society to obey rules and laws, the antitrust watchdog said in its statement Tuesday.

Business Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Autonomous Trial Flights in Korea of EH216 with Special Certificate of Airworthiness In November 2020, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (“MOLIT”) of Korea issued a Special Certificate of Airworthiness (“SAC”) for the EH216, the first SAC for passenger-grade AAVs in Korea. With the SAC, the EH216 completed autonomous trial flights in three Korean locations: Seoul, Daegu and Jeju Island. The flights demonstrated a variety of Urban Air Mobility (“UAM”) application scenarios including urban transportation, emergency medical services and aerial sightseeing. Long-term Trial Flight Permit for EH216 Across Austrian National Airspace In December 2020, the Civil Aviation Authority of Austria issued a trial flight permit for the EH216 that allows trial operation of unmanned flights in Austrian national airspace. This permit was obtained through the joint efforts of the Civil Aviation Authority of Austria, the EHang European team, and local partners. Thereafter, test flights of the EH216 were conducted in St. Martin im Innkreis, Austria after completing a Specific Operational Risk Assessment (“SORA”) procedure under the supervision of the Civil Aviation Authority of Austria. Strategic Partnership with Greenland Hong Kong for Aerial Tourism Programs In December 2020, EHang entered a strategic partnership with a PRC subsidiary of Greenland Hong Kong Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00337) (“Greenland”), an HKEX-listed real estate company, to roll out air mobility services, such as aerial sightseeing and aerial media show services, in Greenland’s tourism real estate projects in China. The collaboration began with trial aerial sightseeing flights in Greenland’s Forest Lake project in Zhaoqing city, Guangdong. Participation in Formulating China’s First National Standard for Express Delivery Services via Unmanned Aircraft EHang collaborated with industry-leading players, such as JD.com (Nasdaq: JD) and ZTO Express (NYSE: ZTO), to participate in the formulation of the Specification for Express Delivery Service by Unmanned Aircraft, which was issued by the State Post Bureau of PRC and became effective in China on January 1, 2021. EH216 Trial Flights and Locations Across the Globe As a pioneer in the global Urban Air Mobility (“UAM”) industry, by year-end 2020 EHang 216 had safely carried out approximately 10,000 autonomous trial flights (including passenger-carrying flights). The flights showcased a variety of UAM application scenarios in 40 cities of 8 countries across Asia, Europe and North America. Recent Developments US$40 Million Investment from Carmignac In January 2021, Carmignac, a leading European asset management firm, invested US$40 million on behalf of its funds in EHang through a private placement of newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the Company. Trial Flights to Initiate a UAM Plan in the Hengqin New Area in Southeast China In January 2021, EHang announced strategic partnerships with local partners to jointly initiate trial air mobility operations in the Hengqin New Area (“Hengqin”), the largest of the islands surrounding Zhuhai city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. A total of 36 passengers experienced trial autonomous flights conducted by our local partners for aerial sightseeing in Hengqin on the announcement date. In February 2021, our local partner further carried out the first autonomous trial flights of the EH216 over the sea of southern China from Hengqin to Dong’ao Island, a tourist destination island, showcasing its potential application in air mobility use cases such as aerial sightseeing. Participation in a Series of UAM Projects Initiated by the European Union In January and February 2021, as a pioneer of cutting-edge AAV products and technological solutions, EHang was selected to participate in a series of UAM projects initiated and supported by the European Union to demonstrate ways to achieve safe, sustainable, socially acceptable, and effective UAM. These projects include: 1) the Air Mobility Urban - Large Experimental Demonstration (AMU-LED) project in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands; 2) the Re-Invent Air Mobility initiative in France; 3) the Safe and Flexible Integration of Advanced U-Space Services for Medical Air Mobility (SAFIR-Med) project in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Czech Republic; and 4) the GOF 2.0 Integrated Urban Airspace VLD very large demonstration project. Partnership with Giancarlo Zema Design Group to Build an Eco-sustainable Vertiport in Italy In March 2021, EHang entered a partnership with Giancarlo Zema Design Group (“GZDG”), a leading Italian architecture firm. GZDG has designed and intends to build an eco-sustainable vertiport in Italy using EHang’s passenger-grade AAV technologies and air mobility solutions. The vertiport will use green design and construction materials and can generate energy to recharge the EH216 passenger-grade AAVs. Partnership with Dongfeng USharing to Co-develop a Solution for Seamlessly-Connected Mobility Services Leveraging AAV Technologies In March 2021, EHang entered a partnership with Dongfeng USharing Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Corporation, a Fortune Global 500 company and one of the largest auto makers in China, to co-develop a solution for Seamlessly Connected Mobility Services for logistics using EHang’s AAV technologies. CEO Remarks Mr. Huazhi Hu, EHang’s Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “In the unusual year of 2020, we achieved revenue growth of nearly 50% despite the challenges and uncertainties caused by COVID-19 globally. Our gross margin increased again in 2020 and specifically, the adjusted gross margin reached a new high of 63.8% in the fourth quarter and 60.3% for the year, reflecting our competitive strengths. Our record of more than 10,000 safe trial flights of the EH216, including passenger-carrying flights, in 40 cities of 8 countries across Asia, Europe and North America to date and in various extreme environments demonstrates the robustness of our integrated technologies for autonomous flying, full redundancy and cluster management. Our technologies laid a solid foundation for obtaining a series of approvals or permits for trial flights issued by regulators in China, the U.S., Canada, Austria, Norway and Korea in 2020.” Mr. Hu continued, “Leveraging our world-leading integrated technology platform, we have been developing and diversifying our product portfolio under our long-term development roadmap to meet a wider range of market needs. In addition to our current flagship EH216 AAV series, we plan to roll out another series of eVTOL (e-Vertical-Take-Off-and-Landing) models, namely the VT series, which includes the major large-sized passenger-grade VT30 as well as smaller-sized non-passenger-grade ones. This vehicle series adopts a new hybrid configuration that integrates multi-rotor and fixed-wing configurations and enables both vertical take-off/landing capability and long-range horizontal flights. Combining the EH216 series with this new VT series, we will be able to offer a more well-rounded suite of AAV solutions to better satisfy more UAM application needs, covering both short-haul intra-city and long-range inter-city uses.” “Looking ahead, we intend to launch a ‘100 Air Mobility Routes Initiative’ in China as part of our UAM platform operator strategy. This initiative will be underpinned by our reliable integrated technologies, comprehensive product offerings, intelligent systems, growing customer base, infrastructure designs and expanding production facilities. The initiative is expected to be implemented in next 24 months with an initial focus on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. To support this important strategic initiative and also fulfill customer orders in 2021, we are aiming to produce approximately 250 units of the EH216 in the year which will be a new record of the Company once achieved,” Mr. Hu concluded. Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues were RMB54.6 million (US$8.4 million), on par with RMB54.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Revenues from air mobility solutions were RMB33.4 million (US$5.1 million), down 10.1% year over year. The decrease was mainly due to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China in the fourth quarter and its impact on our customers in the tourism industry.

Given our ultimate strategic goal is to build a UAM platform operator company, we view now is the right time to accelerate this process for better commercialization. Specifically, we are planning to launch a “100 Air Mobility Route Initiative” in China from 2021 and onward. We believe the time is opportune as we are getting into the final stages of airworthiness certification of our EH216 AAVs. As result, we expect the annual revenues in 2021 to range between RMB130 million and RMB180 million. The above outlook is based on information available as of the date of this press release and reflects the Company’s current and preliminary expectations regarding its business situation and market conditions. The outlook is subject to change, especially considering uncertainties and situations related to how the COVID-19 pandemic further develops.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “aims,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “likely to” and similar statements. Management has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While they believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond management's control. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause EHang's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating profit/(loss), adjusted net income/(loss), adjusted operating expenses, adjusted basic and diluted loss per ordinary share and adjusted basic and diluted loss per ADSs (the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. There was no income tax impact on the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments because the non-GAAP adjustments are usually recorded in entities located in tax-free jurisdictions, such as the Cayman Islands. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effects of items such as share-based compensation expenses that are included in their comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management members in their financial and operational decision-making. Each of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to its comparable GAAP measure, operating profit margin and net margin or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s most directly comparable GAAP measures in conjunction with the Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

2021-04-19,"(Bloomberg) -- China sought to allay fears it wants to topple the dollar as the world’s main reserve currency as Beijing makes bigger strides in creating its own digital yuan.People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Li Bo said the goal for internationalizing its currency is not to replace the dollar, and the efforts to create a digital yuan are aimed at domestic use.“For the internationalization of the renminbi, we have said many times that it’s a natural process, and our goal is not to replace the U.S. dollar or other international currencies,” Li said on a panel at the Boao forum Sunday. “I think our goal is to allow the market to choose, to facilitate international trade and investment.”China’s central bank is currently testing the use of a “digital yuan” in various pilot programs across the country. A report earlier this week showed the Biden administration is increasing its scrutiny of China’s progress toward the digital yuan amid concern it could kick off a long-term bid to displace the dollar.The PBOC has been working on a digital currency since 2014 and its moves have heightened interest among central banks and policy makers, while the spread of cryptocurrencies has added to a sense that competitors to regular cash could change how the financial sector operates. The PBOC has moved closer to becoming the first major central bank to launch a virtual currency, rolling out a trial for consumers and businesses in 11 cities across the country.“The motivation for the e-yuan, for now at least, is focusing primarily on domestic use,” Li said. International “interoperability is a very complex issue and we are not in a hurry to reach any particular solution yet,” although there could be cross-border use “in the long term,” Li said.China’s Digital Yuan Won’t Topple Dollar, BOJ Official SaysThe central bank is planning to test the cross-border use of the digital yuan at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, where it could be used by both domestic users as well as athletes and visitors from overseas, Li said.Agustin Carstens, general manager of Bank for International Settlements, said on the same panel there was huge potential in the cross-border use of digital currencies as they could make foreign exchange transaction and payment settlement extremely efficient. He said countries can explore various ways to achieve international interoperability, including making different systems compatible and creating connectivity links among the systems.Bahamas Tops China in Ranking of Central Bank Digital CurrenciesWhile the digitization of the yuan could benefit its use in cross-border transactions, the key factor in determining the currency’s global role is whether China will relax its capital controls, said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD.com Inc. “If you want to have a global reserve currency, you need to allow foreigners to hold it, to use it.”China will also need to allow its citizens to buy more foreign assets, further develop its financial markets and allow greater exchange rate flexibility in order to push for the internationalization of yuan, Shen said in an interview at the forum.China has seen a flood of capital flows into its financial markets since last year, boosting the amount of yuan traded globally. Yet, in the context of its vast markets, foreign ownership of local stocks and bonds remains relatively low at around 5% and 3% respectively. The yuan’s share of global payments and central bank reserves is still only about 2%.“The digital yuan is a means to help monetary policy efficiency and cross-border usage with partners that tend to trade with China in goods and services, less so the major economies like the U.S.,” said Stephen Chiu, Asia FX and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Digital or not, it’s not so easy to move the dollar’s dominance, be it as a trade settlement or reserve currency.”How China Is Closing In on Its Own Digital Currency: QuickTakeThe initial plans for a digital currency weren’t motivated by considerations of cross-border use, according to former People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who noted that there are many issues with using a digital currency across national borders. International use could affect monetary policy independence, and it’s important it isn’t used for crime, he said on the same panel in Boao.(Updates with comments from BIS, details on yuan trade.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China Says It Has No Desire to Replace Dollar With Digital Yuan
2021-04-21,"(Bloomberg) -- The competition between Wang Xing’s Meituan and fellow tech billionaire Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is turning into one of the great rivalries in Chinese business.While Alibaba is the dominant force in e-commerce with a global reputation, Wang, a generation younger, has built Meituan into a fearsome rival, the world’s largest delivery empire with ambitions to encroach on Alibaba’s home turf. There’s also years of bad blood between the two companies after an early alliance broke down.Now Wang, 42, has raised a record $10 billion to develop promising technologies like autonomous delivery vehicles and drone delivery to reduce labor costs and expand the footprint of Meituan’s food and e-commerce network. These investments, analysts say, will be key to supporting what Wang has previously called its “top priority”: community e-commerce, an arena where tech giants from the likes of Alibaba to JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. are all seeking a foothold.“Wang Xing is a driven entrepreneur and calculated strategist,” said Michael Norris, a senior analyst with Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. “Community group buying is a ‘must play, must win’ segment for Meituan.”Wang and other tech tycoons will need to tread carefully. Over the past six months, China’s antitrust watchdog has rolled out new laws giving them greater oversight of the internet sphere, and launched investigations into abuses like forced exclusive arrangements and offering preferential pricing to new customers. After Alibaba was slapped with a record $2.8 billion fine this month, investors now expect Meituan and its backer Tencent Holdings Ltd. to be next in the line of fire, given their dominance in meal delivery and other spheres of internet life as well as past brushes with the law.What Is Behind China’s Crackdown on Its Tech Giants: QuickTakeMeituan’s community e-commerce arm was among a handful of operators penalized in March for excessive subsidies, alongside units of Pinduoduo Inc. and Didi Chuxing. State media have called out the industry’s preoccupation with growing grocery deliveries instead of driving innovation, while the deaths of delivery riders in the past have also led to scrutiny of Meituan’s business practices. In January, it also shut down its crowd-sourced health insurance service after regulators tightened scrutiny over online insurance.The record fundraising -- the largest-ever new stock issuance by a Hong Kong-listed company -- appears to defy expectations that the days of unfettered expansion for Chinese internet entrepreneurs are over. The $10 billion raised will more than double Meituan’s cash, giving it the biggest war chest after Alibaba’s, to invest in new technologies like autonomous delivery and build infrastructure for online groceries. While the company didn’t single out the red-hot community commerce space in its deal term sheet Monday, investors expect Meituan to funnel capital into that sector to secure a slice of the pie.Wang’s firm, which has been cultivating autonomous delivery for years, will face stiff competition in this area from rivals including Didi and JD.com, which have also been exploring the technology. Alibaba, for its part, made its first trial drone delivery in 2015. Meituan’s efforts have accelerated since the Covid-19 outbreak last year and it’s so far deployed self-driving vehicles to deliver 35,000 grocery orders in Beijing. In Shenzhen, its drones have also delivered more than 1,000 orders as of mid-April since a pilot program kicked off in January.Wang, a coding guru whose methodical obsession with data and algorithms proved instrumental in humbling Alibaba’s rival meal service Ele.me, has openly telegraphed his ambitions. In a 2017 interview with local media, he said Meituan could join Alibaba and Tencent as the third member of a Chinese internet triumvirate in five to 10 years, due to the value it creates in food, travel and other services.“I don’t believe in setting limits for myself,” Wang said in the interview. “As long as we’re clear on our core purpose -- Who are we serving? What services do we offer? -- we will just keep trying different types of businesses.”But his past gambles have been somewhat hit or miss. An early foray into ride-hailing petered out when Chinese regulators cracked down on Didi. He bought Mobike in a deal valuing the startup at $3.4 billion in 2018, the height of China’s bike-sharing bubble, and has since had to scale back the business’s overseas operations. The travel division got sideswiped by Covid and lacks a roadmap to profitability against Trip.com Group Ltd. In all, Meituan has launched as many as 200 services over the years.“Wang is certainly a very ambitious tech executive,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong. “For successful Chinese entrepreneurs, however, ambition can sometimes correlate to a lack of focus.”Now the serial entrepreneur, worth roughly $21.3 billion, is tooling up for his biggest battle yet, taking on Pinduoduo, JD.com and a host of nimbler startups in the field of groceries. As Meituan deepens its presence in e-commerce, the biggest rival standing in his way is Ma’s Alibaba.The animosity between Wang and Ma dates back more than half a decade. Alibaba -- an early investor in Meituan -- refused to put more money into the startup in mid-2015 because it wouldn’t fully integrate its app with the larger firm’s. In response, Wang turned to Alibaba’s arch-rival Tencent, which pledged $1 billion of funding, merged its delivery services with Meituan and allowed the combined company to operate independently, sidelining his one-time partner.Read more: The Greatest Delivery Empire on Earth Has Alibaba’s AttentionIn an interview with Bloomberg News published in 2019, Wang said he thought Ma had “an integrity problem,” citing the way he spun off digital payments subsidiary Alipay without the approval of Alibaba’s board. Instead, Wang called Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos a role model, pointing to his willingness to defer profits and reinvest in new business.Meituan is now adopting that same philosophy, saying in March it expects to stay in the red for the coming quarters as it ventures into online groceries. In particular, it’s expanding aggressively into community e-commerce, where buyers in the same neighborhood enjoy bulk discounts on fresh produce. The market is estimated to reach nearly 121 billion yuan ($19 billion) this year, drawing heavy investments from other tech giants.“The cash burn in grocery will be quite brutal, just like with the ride-hailing wars,” said He Qi, a fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund management. “Cash is a necessity in winning this one, and whoever is victorious will be reap great rewards because grocery shopping is a higher frequency transaction.”(Updates with share action chart in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Meituan CEO Who Beat Jack Ma Gets $10 Billion for Next Fight
2021-04-21,"Like a puppy chasing its tail, some new investors often chase 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story...",Should You Be Adding JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) To Your Watchlist Today?
2021-04-23,"(Bloomberg) -- As President Xi Jinping targets China’s massive tech giants, the big question now is how he’ll get them to share key data as part of a sweeping plan to transform the world’s second-biggest economy.Until recently, China’s megafirms like Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have operated in a similar way to U.S. counterparts Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc., harnessing user data to refine an expanding array of digital services. Since more data leads to better products, the tech platforms often become natural monopolies -- giving them enormous wealth and power that also opens the door for abuses.More U.S. lawmakers have started calling for legislation to break up the American firms, but so far those efforts have failed to gain much traction. Europe has focused mainly on giving users more control over data and levying hefty antitrust fines against companies like Google.China, by contrast, is going further than any other country to rein its tech behemoths. Xi last month declared his intention to go after “platform” companies that amass data to create monopolies and gobble up smaller competitors. China’s regulators followed up by slapping a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba for abuse of market dominance, and gave dozens of other top internet companies a month to rectify anti-competitive practices.While part of the motivation is political, a potentially more important aspect is China’s attempt to create a market for data that unleashes its value and propels growth. Beijing is pouring money into digital infrastructure, drafting new laws on data usage and building new data centers around the country with the goal of positioning China as a leader in transforming the world economy over the next few decades.“This is not a short-term initiative -- it is a complete national refocusing on data as an economic driver,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at Trivium China, a consultancy in Beijing. “With such significant upsides, you are also potentially looking at a scenario where companies are more willing to adapt to Chinese net controls to gain access to the market.”China’s digital economy grew much faster than national gross domestic product in 2019, underscoring its significance to future growth, according to the Chinese Academy of Information and Communications Technology. Market research firm IDC projected that China would hold around a third of the world’s data by 2025, or roughly 48.6 zettabytes -- about 60% more than the U.S., or equivalent to more than 10 trillion DVDs.One big challenge will be how to get some of the country’s biggest holders of data on board. The bluntest way would be to seize their data outright, which some hardliners have suggested.Zhao Yanqing, a Xiamen University professor, made the case for nationalizing the data of big tech giants at a Chinese economic forum. Since China blocked foreign firms like Google and Facebook, he said, companies like Alibaba and Tencent received a benefit that should now be shared with society.“Only by establishing public ownership for platforms can we ‘tame’ capital,” Zhao said, according to a transcript published by the nationalistic news site Guancha.Still, most analysts view that as unlikely. While Xi has a long history of knocking back billionaires who could pose a threat to the Communist Party, he also wants to find a way to ensure growth is more evenly distributed among China’s 1.4 billion people. Although China is a one-party state, the party has staked its legitimacy in part on hitting targets for improved living standards -- and a booming digital economy is key to success.Nationalizing data could quickly backfire, stifling innovation at a time Xi needs technological breakthroughs as the U.S. works with allies to prevent China from obtaining advanced computer chips.“You need companies that are very competitive,” said Lizhi Liu, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about data politics in China. “Nationalization of data would hurt the tech companies. If you take away the data, the companies will lose their incentive and their ability to innovate.”So Chinese officials are focused on crafting legislation on data ownership that addresses concerns from a range of competing interests. Local officials in tech hub Shenzhen might differ with antitrust bureaucrats on how much proprietary data companies must share, while security departments could clash with economic ministries on issues like data security.‘Expensive to Exploit’Much of the other work involves setting standards for datasets that are not uniform between different entities and provinces. This would allow them to be more easily used on new data exchanges such as the one recently launched in Beijing that aims to allow companies to trade anonymous proprietary data -- effectively a pilot for a national data trading system.So far similar projects set up in past years in cities like Shanghai and Guiyang in southern Guizhou province have only received tepid reception, partly because they are disconnected from each other and only hold small pools of data. While it’s crucial for big tech platforms and other private companies to buy in to the exchanges, the still-evolving regulatory framework is putting many players off.“Data in China is very fragmented and lacks common standards, which makes it difficult and expensive to exploit,” said Camille Boullenois, a consultant with Europe-based Sinolytics. “Drafting standards and encouraging cross-provincial databases will help incentivize data trade.”Until recently, Chinese lawmakers focused mostly on security. A 2017 law gave authorities the right to access almost all private data when necessary and demanded foreign firms store data from Chinese customers locally, forcing Apple Inc. to open a data center with local officials.China’s leaders are now focused on using big data to help governments provide better services. Firefighters can use it to respond to calls quicker, while data from hospitals can help track citizens and stem the spread of Covid-19. It would form the foundation of everything from smart cities to financial regulation to surveillance operations against political dissidents.China’s government is developing a digital yuan that will compete with Ant Group Co.’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay, which together account for nearly all of the mobile-payments market, allowing the People’s Bank of China to gather enormous amounts of data on transactions. Authorities have also made significant advances with a system for measuring the social credit of companies on everything from tax payments to environmental protection to product quality.‘Still Exploring’For now, Chinese authorities have stressed they won’t force companies to hand over data. On a trip this month to the Guiyang data center, a local Communist Party official told Bloomberg News that companies are mostly concerned they will lose their competitive edge if they part ways with an essential resource.“With regard to the use, development and trade of data, we’re still exploring the mechanisms,” said Hu Jianhua, deputy director-general of Guizhou Provincial Big Data Development Administration. “For enterprises, they have the ownership of the data. We encourage them to make their data open but not force them to do so.”One possible solution is for the government to become co-investors with the companies. Bloomberg reported last month that China proposed establishing a joint venture led by the People’s Bank of China with local technology giants that would oversee the data they collect from hundreds of millions of consumers. The Financial Times reported Friday that Ant Group Co. is resisting such a proposal, which risks facing the same obstacles as when Tencent and Alibaba reportedly refused to share data with China’s central bank several years ago after it set up credit scoring company Baihang.Data privacy is the “biggest obstacle” the government faces in dealing with the tech giants, said Angela Zhang, author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism” and director of the Centre for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong. “There is an inherent tension between protecting consumer privacy and promoting competition among different platforms.”Big Tech SpookedExecutives at China’s biggest companies have sought to blunt the damage from Xi’s crackdown.After the Alibaba probe wrapped up, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang told investors last week that the company will continue to work with regulators on data privacy. Earlier this month, companies including JD.com Inc. and Meituan pledged to play fair in data usage after Guangzhou antitrust regulators summoned them into a meeting. Robin Li, the head of top search company Baidu Inc., in March proposed to top Chinese lawmakers a pilot program to break up barriers in data flows among internet companies.The company reactions show they are spooked after years of limited measures to align with government policies, according to Dev Lewis, a research fellow at Digital Asia Hub in Shanghai.“Now that mirage has been lifted,” he said. “The onus is now firmly on the platform if they want to reinstate that. They need to take the initiative on the data front.”(Updates with report on central bank in 23rd paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Xi’s Next Target in Tech Crackdown Is China’s Vast Reams of Data
2021-04-27,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s government has expanded its antitrust crackdown beyond Jack Ma’s technology empire, launching an investigation into suspected monopolistic practices by food-delivery behemoth Meituan.The State Administration for Market Regulation is looking into alleged abuses including forced exclusivity arrangements known as “pick one of two,” employing the same language in a probe into Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that ended with a $2.8 billion fine. China’s third largest internet company recouped early losses to rise as much as 3.1% Tuesday after Nomura analysts estimated Meituan may have to fork over just 4.6 billion yuan ($709 million) based on Alibaba’s punishment.The investigation into Meituan extends Beijing’s crackdown beyond Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Ant Group Co., and threatens to chill the ambitions of founder Wang Xing, one of China’s most aggressive entrepreneurs. The government has become increasingly concerned over the growing influence of titans like Alibaba, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Meituan over every aspect of Chinese life as well as the vast amounts of data they’ve amassed through providing services like online shopping, chatting and ride-hailing.The antitrust campaign has gathered pace in recent weeks, as regulators slapped a record fine on Alibaba, instructed affiliate Ant to overhaul its business and ordered 34 of its largest tech companies -- including Meituan -- to rectify any anti-competitive business practices within one month. Following the meeting with SAMR, the Beijing-based firm issued a pledge to abide by antitrust laws, saying it will maintain market order and won’t force merchants to “pick one of two” -- forcing them to select betweens Meituan or a rival -- through unreasonable methods.Meituan said in a Monday statement it will actively cooperate with the probe and step up efforts to comply with regulations.The pick one of two practice “helped play a big role in the early days of food delivery competition as it helped differentiate one’s restaurant supplies from those of competitors,” Nomura analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen wrote in a research note. “Meituan’s strong market position and customers’ loyalty has enabled it to outgrow this.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Meituan is unlikely to face penalties any harsher than Alibaba’s recent $2.8 billion fine after being slapped with a monopoly probe, a sign that the regulatory dragnet is widening on the country’s tech behemoths. The interim period could be unnerving for its investors, but we think any penalty Meituan may pay will be commensurate with its smaller operational scale.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchIt remains uncertain whether regulators will target other aspects of the Chinese company.The firm, founded by 42-year old billionaire Wang, has long been criticized by rivals and merchants for alleged excesses like forced exclusive arrangements. The firm -- which competes against Alibaba’s Ele.me in food delivery -- had previously been found guilty of unfair competition in at least two legal cases this year and ordered to pay compensation, local media has reported. The corporation had also rejected allegations that it charged onerous commissions to restaurants during the Covid-19 outbreak last year.Alongside Ele.me, Meituan also faced an online backlash after several delivery riders were killed or injured while trying to meet strict deadlines. It was among a handful of operators fined by the antitrust watchdog in March for giving improper subsidies to expand in the red-hot arena of community e-commerce.“This latest news indicates that the enforcement of this antitrust regulation is much stricter and harsher than our original thought,” the Nomura analysts wrote.Ahead of the probe, Meituan said it will raise $10 billion in a record new share sale by a Hong Kong-listed firm as well as through an offering of convertible bonds. The firm had said it will use the funds to boost investments in new technologies like autonomous delivery as well as for general corporate purposes.Read more: Meituan CEO Who Beat Jack Ma Gets $10 Billion for Next Fight Under antitrust laws, Meituan could face a penalty of as much as 10% of its revenue if it’s found to have violated regulations. Its 2020 revenue was about 114.8 billion yuan ($17.7 billion). In contrast, rival Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion, or about 4% of its 2019 domestic revenues.Wang, a coding guru whose methodical obsession with data and algorithms proved instrumental in humbling Alibaba’s rival meal service Ele.me, has openly telegraphed his ambitions. In a 2017 interview with local media, he said Meituan could join Alibaba and Tencent as the third member of a Chinese internet triumvirate in five to 10 years, due to the value it creates in food, travel and other services.The billionaire last week described in a lengthy online post how he’ll funnel capital raised toward research into autonomous drones and delivery systems -- which analysts expect to fuel Meituan’s foray into the red-hot community commerce arena, where buyers in a local neighborhood enjoy bulk discounts. Meituan had been expected to wage a pitched battle of subsidies and sweeteners with Alibaba, JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. for food and produce supply.Meituan shares nearly tripled in 2020, making it one of the best-performing Chinese technology stocks. It’s dropped roughly 31% from a February record, partly as China’s antitrust campaign accelerated and after the company flagged that it will incur more losses from its investments in newer businesses like online groceries. Its dollar bond spreads widened Monday after the watchdog’s announcement.(Updates with share action and analyst’s comment from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China Widens Internet Crackdown With Meituan Monopoly Probe

2021-04-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese regulators imposed wide-ranging restrictions on the fast-growing financial divisions of 13 companies including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd., leveling many of the same curbs employed against Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. in a crackdown on the tech sector.Units of JD.com Inc., Meituan and Didi Chuxing were also among firms summoned to a meeting with several watchdogs including the central bank, which spelled out a raft of requirements including stricter compliance when listing abroad and curbs on information monopolies and the gathering of personal data. Companies must restructure their financial wings into holding companies as part of a broad effort to subject themselves to more rigorous supervision, and sever “improper links” between their existing payments services and financial products, according to a joint statement Thursday from the central bank, banking and insurance regulator, securities watchdog and the forex overseer.Shares in Tencent, Meituan and JD fell between 1% and 3% early Friday in Hong Kong. Representatives for Tencent, ByteDance, JD, Meituan and Didi didn’t respond to requests for comment.China has waged a campaign to rein in its internet titans as the government grew increasingly concerned over their growing influence over every aspect of Chinese life as well as the vast amounts of data they’ve amassed through providing services like online shopping, chatting and ride-hailing. The crackdown has already forced Ma’s Ant to scrap its initial public offering while regulators have levied a record fine against affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.What Is Behind China’s Crackdown on Its Tech Giants: QuickTake“Nobody can escape the tough regulatory crackdown on fintech,” said Zhang Xiaoxi, a Beijing-based analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “While the requirements are broadly in line with those imposed on Ant, those who are considering listing need to wait till they rectify all the problems.”Analysts Cautious After Beijing Summons Tech Titans: Street WrapIt’s unclear how long the companies have to enact changes, or how it would affect their core operations. Companies like Meituan, JD and Tencent rely on their payments operations to drive their core operations in e-commerce, gaming and social media. Some, like ByteDance and Didi, are said to be exploring overseas initial public offerings and the new regulations may impose a stricter oversight of the process.The firms were also ordered to break up their information monopoly and to conduct personal credit reporting services through licensed agencies. They should strengthen their capital structure and compliance, strictly implement regulatory requirements and step up consumer protection mechanisms, according to the statement. Baidu Inc., Trip.com Group Ltd. and Lufax Holding Ltd. were among others summoned to the meeting.Read more: Jack Ma’s Double-Whammy Marks End of China Tech’s Golden Age“Good days have gone,” wrote Shujin Chen, an analyst with Jefferies. “We reiterate that China has shifted from encouraging personal consumption lending to curbing rapid increases in residential leverage.”The changes will likely hit profits and growth on several fronts, the analyst wrote. They’ll have to set up holding companies, which will require more capital; their payment and shopping apps will have to cut links with other financial products; and fintech firms will find it more difficult to get listed, including overseas and secondary listings.“Regulators will keep close communication with platforms and check on their rectification progress at an appropriate time,” the watchdog agencies said in their statement. “Those failing to rectify as requested or defying rules will face severe punishment.”Regulators have pledged to curb the “reckless push” of technology firms into finance and this month outlined an overhaul of Ant, which will drastically revamp its business and be supervised more like a bank. The overhaul meant Ant will have to cut off any improper linking of payments with other financial products including its Jiebei and Huabei lending services.Ant said it will fold those units into its consumer finance arm, apply for a license for personal credit reporting, and improve consumer data protection.Read more: Ant to Be Financial Holding Firm in Overhaul Forced by ChinaEarlier this year, China proposed measures to curb market concentration in online payments, which Ant and Tencent have transformed with their ubiquitous mobile apps that are used by a combined 1 billion people.

2021-04-30,"The logistics unit of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com received the green light on Thursday to proceed with an initial public offering (IPO) that could raise between US$3 billion and US$4 billion on the Hong Kong stock exchange, according to people familiar with the matter. The IPO would mark the latest JD arm to tap the Hong Kong markets in the past year. JD Health raised US$3.5 billion in an IPO in December and its Beijing-based parent JD.com raised US$4.5 billion in a secondary listing in Hong Kong in June 2020, the biggest fundraising in the city last year. The JD Logistics spin-off is one of several highly anticipated offerings by China's technology companies this year.

The potential listing, however, comes at a time when some investors have been questioning the sky-high valuations of technology companies. Video-streaming and mobile gaming site Bilibili raised US$2.6 billion in a secondary listing in Hong Kong in March, slightly below the US$2.8 billion it had targeted. Baidu, the Chinese search engine and artificial intelligence giant, flopped on its first day of trading after raising US$3.1 billion in a secondary listing in the city last month. It also comes as Chinese regulators are clamping down on the country's big technology firms and their ubiquitous role in the lives of mainlanders, extending from shopping to payments to financial services. Alibaba Group Holding, the world's largest e-commerce company and a JD.com rival, was fined 18.2 billion yuan (US$2.8 billion) this month following a months-long antimonopoly investigation.

On Thursday, China's top financial regulators summoned 13 technology leaders that run online financial businesses, including Tencent Holdings, JD.com and Tik Tok-owner ByteDance, to a meeting and told them to undertake efforts to end anticompetitive behaviour and halt ""the disorderly expansion of capital"". Earlier this month, JD Technology, the fintech unit of JD.com, withdrew its application for an IPO on China's Nasdaq-style Star Market amid the sweeping regulatory changes. The company was previously known as JD Digits and JD Finance. Some retail brokers in Hong Kong said they have received a lukewarm response so far, as they try to judge customers' appetite for a JD Logistics IPO. ""As the third JD.com company to list, JD Logistics will easily get attention due to the well-known brand name,"" said Kenny Ng Lai-yin, a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai. ""However, the IPO may come at a time when the stock market is volatile and recent big IPOs did not have a substantial increase [on their first day of trading]."" The logistics sector has been in focus in the past year as consumers, inside and outside China, have shifted more of their purchases to e-commerce sites against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. E-commerce sales are expected to account for more than half of retail sales in China this year, the first time a majority of retail sales in any country were bought online, according to research firm eMarketer. The company forecast in February that e-commerce sales would top US$2.8 trillion in China in 2021. JD Logistics was created in April 2017 as a separate business unit under JD.com, using the company's widespread fulfilment network to provide integrated supply chain and logistics services to third-party companies, including warehousing, transport, delivery and after sales services. It also provides logistics technology such as cloud-based services and data analytics to third-party clients. Ahead of the listing, JD.com owned 79.12 per cent of the logistics business and would continue to indirectly hold more than 50 per cent of its shares following the IPO, according to a February 16 statement. JD Logistics raised US$2.5 billion in February 2018, issuing a 19 per cent stake to third-party investors at the time, and raised an additional US$64 million in August 2020, issuing additional shares. Some retail brokers in Hong Kong said they have received a lukewarm response so far for a JD Logistics IPO.

JD.com's revenue from logistics and other services reached 40.5 billion yuan last year. JD Logistics operated more than 900 warehouses in China, with an aggregate gross floor area of about 21 million square metres (226 million square feet) as of December 31. In August, the logistics business said it would roll out 100 unstaffed vehicles in Changshu city in Jiangsu province and have up to 100,000 ""autonomous robots"", which look like minivans, on the nation's streets within five years.

Any deal could raise billions of dollars, the people said.The once high-flying conglomerate plowed more than $40 billion into a raft of trophy assets around the world before being reined in by the government, which started taking control just over a year ago as the pandemic hit HNA’s remaining businesses.The company still owns airlines, airports and retail assets in China. Some bidders could team up for an investment, and the structure of any potential transaction hasn’t been finalized, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty the potential investors will proceed with concrete offers, the people said. Representatives for Air China, HNA, Juneyao and Ping An Insurance declined to comment, while representatives for Fosun and JD didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Billionaire Guo Guangchang’s Fosun Group, founded in 1992, is a Chinese conglomerate with businesses spanning from pharmaceuticals and travel to retail and insurance.

Separately, Caixin reported that HNA Group’s airlines assets are the target, citing an unidentified person.Poster ChildAny disposal would come after HNA’s creditors earlier this year applied for the group to be reorganized.Founded as an airline in the 1990s by entrepreneur Chen Feng with seed money from George Soros, the company emerged from near obscurity to mount a buying binge that saw it become the top shareholder of Deutsche Bank AG and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. It was once the poster child for a cabal of Chinese empire builders that borrowed rapidly to snap up trophy assets around the globe.The spree eventually took HNA’s debt load to about $86 billion by the end of 2017. It began shedding assets in early 2018 amid pressure from the government, which had started to crack down on the activities of its biggest offshore acquirers to rein in financial risk and damage to China’s reputation. In December, HNA agreed to sell Ingram Micro Inc. for about $7.2 billion, its largest asset sale so far.The Chinese government wants to return HNA to its roots as an airline and hence plans to dispose of HNA’s non-aviation assets through a trust, Bloomberg News reported in January. The conglomerate started looking for strategic investors for Shenzhen-listed CCOOP Group Co., which operates convenience stores, department stores, logistics parks and online financial services, according to a March announcement on HNA’s website.

2021-05-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Zhang Yiming built ByteDance Ltd. into the world’s most valuable private company via a string of blockbuster apps like TikTok that challenged Facebook and other incumbents on their own turf. His latest target: Alibaba.The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams. That endeavor will test not just Zhang’s magic touch with app creation and ByteDance’s AI wizardry, but also investor reception ahead of one of the tech world’s most hotly anticipated IPOs.His startup is already starting to make waves in an industry long controlled by Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. It sold about $26 billion worth of make-up, clothing and other merchandise in 2020, achieving in its maiden year what Alibaba’s Taobao took six years to accomplish. It’s shooting for more than $185 billion by 2022. Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese twin, is expected to contribute more than half of the firm’s $40 billion domestic ad sales this year, driven in part by e-commerce.“Short video platforms have so much traffic that they can basically do any business,” said Shawn Yang, managing director of Blue Lotus Capital Advisors. “Douyin is not only in ads, but also live-streaming, e-commerce, local life services and search. This has a lot of room for imagination.”A burgeoning e-commerce business could help the firm surpass its $250 billion valuation when it goes public, countering concerns around Beijing’s crackdown on the country’s internet behemoths. Preparations are said to be underway for a listing that would be one of the world’s most anticipated debuts. The startup is working with advisers on the offering and is choosing between Hong Kong and U.S. as the listing venue, people familiar with the matter have said. While ByteDance won’t handle sales or merchandise itself, it hopes to sell more ads to merchants, boost traffic and take a cut of business.Read more: ByteDance Is Said to Kick Off IPO Preparations for China AssetsThe internet giant is a late entrant to China’s social commerce scene, where influencers tout products to fans like a Gen-Z version of the Home Shopping Network. The format, pioneered by Alibaba as a marketing tool in 2016, developed a life of its own last year when Covid-19 spurred demand for at-home entertainment. Last year, Alibaba’s Taobao Live generated over 400 billion yuan ($62 billion) of gross merchandise value and Kuaishou Technology’s social platforms hosted 381 billion yuan of transactions, more than double Douyin’s.ByteDance is counting on its artificial intelligence-driven, interest-based recommendations to help its e-commerce business catch up. In a splashy coming-out party for the one-year-old business last month, executives explained that the company intends to replicate its success with using AI algorithms to feed users content in online shopping. By scrolling an endless stream of social content, now connected with physical goods more than ever, Douyin users won’t be able to resist their impulse to buy, they said.It’s “sort of similar to shopping on the street,” Bob Kang, Douyin’s 35-year-old e-commerce chief, told an audience of hundreds at the Guangzhou event. “As people get richer, they don’t go to shopping malls or boutique stores with specific things in mind, they just buy if they see something they like.”Kang, a former Baidu Inc. engineer who was poached by ByteDance in 2017, is one of a slew of fast-rising young lieutenants tasked by Zhang to break new ground for the company. He was previously the tech lead for ByteDance’s Helo app, one of India’s most-used social platforms for sharing content like videos -- until the South Asian nation shut it down along with dozens of Chinese apps last June on national security grounds.Since Kang took over as e-commerce head, Douyin has banned live-streamers from selling items listed on third-party sites and invited them to open their own in-app stores, preventing rivals like Alibaba and JD.com Inc. from profiting off its traffic. He grew a team of customer support staff from just one hundred to about 1,900 to fight counterfeits and is hiring for more than 900 other positions to support the business. ByteDance also has an online matchmaking system that helps connect merchants with influencers and their agencies, and it’s set up physical bases to house live streamers and merchandise, similar to what Alibaba does.The initiative gained traction from celebrity endorsers like Lei, the Xiaomi founder who has hosted livestreams promoting his Mi TVs and smartphones. Luo Yonghao, a once high-flying entrepreneur who had sought to challenge Apple Inc. with his smartphone business, is another top influencer, shifting more than $17 million of merchandise in his first-ever livestream on the platform.Smaller merchants are following their lead, like Zhou Huang, who set up a Douyin storefront for her jewelry business in October, bypassing conventional platforms like Alibaba’s Taobao. Instead of stumping up hefty fees to platform operators for traffic, she’s managed to amass a fan base of about 20,000 by creating videos that offer practical tips like how to choose the right size when buying a bracelet online.“It’s challenging for brand new merchants like me to attract customers on Taobao,” says Huang, whose Douyin store broke even after just three months. “Sometimes, people come to our store not for shopping, but for entertainment. But once we have enough visitors, we can make a sale.”ByteDance is lending a hand. In Foshan, Huang and 200 other jewelry sellers are coached on everything from registering a store and marketing to shooting quality videos. Around-the-clock technical assistance is available: Huang says that whenever her livestream channel goes down, ByteDance technicians immediately come to the rescue.Huang is one of about 1 million creators who have generated e-commerce sales on Douyin as of January, drawn to the platform’s 600 million-plus daily users. The platform -- which brings in commission fees from merchants as a new revenue stream -- aims to have more than a thousand brands this year join the likes of Suning.com Co. in setting up stores on Douyin, and that number could increase fivefold by 2022, the company predicted in an internal memo. GMV may grow to as much as 600 billion yuan this year before doubling to 1.2 trillion yuan in 2022.Read more: Leaked ByteDance Memo Shows Blockbuster Revenue Projections ByteDance’s ambitions aren’t limited to Alibaba. The firm has also started to let users book hotels and restaurants through Douyin, offering lifestyle services similar to super-apps like Meituan and Tencent’s WeChat.Douyin’s e-commerce foray in China may offer a roadmap for TikTok, which has begun testing the waters in online shopping through tie-ups with WalMart Inc. and Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify Inc. Back in December, Zhang told global employees that e-commerce, when combined with live-streaming and short videos, offers an even bigger opportunity outside China, according to attendees who asked not to be identified. The company has also been quietly building a team of engineers in Singapore to grow TikTok’s nascent e-commerce operations.ByteDance’s push into online shopping comes as its other businesses face headwinds. To grow video gaming, ByteDance has been buying development studios but churning out blockbuster hits like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Honor of Kings could take years and China has previously cracked down on the industry in fits and starts. In online tutoring, regulators have sought to rein in excess marketing and competition is fierce against a slew of deep-pocketed startups like Alibaba-backed Zuoyebang.In April, Zhang’s firm was one of 34 corporations ordered by the antitrust watchdog to conduct internal investigations and rectify excesses. And though its payment service has only just gotten off the ground, ByteDance and its peers were slapped with wide-ranging restrictions on their fast-growing financial operations following a meeting with regulators including the central bank last month.But the same scrutiny could help the TikTok owner make inroads into China e-commerce, the largest online marketplace in the world. Alibaba has held off rivals JD.com and Pinduoduo Inc. over the past decade allegedly through practices like forcing merchants into exclusive arrangements. Regulators have since levied a record $2.8 billion fine on Jack Ma’s flagship firm and made eradicating “pick one from two” one of the main goals of its antitrust campaign, creating room for up-and-comers like ByteDance.For now, the biggest and most immediate boost from ByteDance’s expansion into e-commerce is in advertising revenue, which still accounts for the bulk of its earnings. As the number of merchants on Douyin increases, so has their marketing spending within the platform. The firm projects that e-commerce may surpass gaming to become the biggest contributor to ad sales. At rival Kuaishou, merchants contributed about 20%, the company said in March.“It’s more about getting greater share of advertising spending from brands that would otherwise be spending money on platforms like Alibaba,” said Michael Norris, a senior analyst with Shanghai-based market research firm AgencyChina. “This is where the threat to Alibaba comes from.(Adds details on potential listing venue in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Eyes a New $185 Billion Business Ahead of Mega IPO
2021-05-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Meituan’s stock plunged to a seven-month low after the Chinese e-commerce company’s billionaire chief executive officer shared and then deleted a poem on social media that some interpreted as a veiled criticism of Beijing.The food delivery giant fell almost 10% in Hong Kong before closing 7.1% lower to wipe out about $16 billion. Wang Xing posted a classical poem about book burning by the emperor during the Qin dynasty on social media platform Fanfou.com, according to the Hong Kong Economic Times. He deleted it on Sunday and issued a clarification that he used the poem in reference to the company’s competitors. A Meituan spokesperson confirmed both posts and declined to comment further.Investors are jittery after business figures who appeared to criticize the government have faced consequences. Wang’s rival Jack Ma angered Beijing in October last year by blasting regulators publicly over what he considered to be an antiquated approach to oversight. That speech was followed swiftly by tightened rules over consumer lending, the scuppering of Ant Group Co.’s record $35 billion initial public offering as well as an antitrust probe into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.“To a certain extent, one can interpret the poem posted by Wang Xing as similar to Jack Ma’s criticism of the banking regulators,” said Kerry Goh, chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte. “This is not a good time to be too vocal!”China’s technology sector has come under intense regulatory scrutiny in recent months amid concern the largest firms have grown too powerful. That’s weighed on the shares, with the Hang Seng Tech Index tumbling almost 30% from its February high. The antitrust watchdog has launched an investigation into suspected monopolistic practices by Meituan, including forced exclusivity arrangements.The Shanghai Consumer Council criticized Meituan on Monday for practices that hurt consumers’ rights, including refund problems and misleading content on its mobile app. The company has vowed to submit a rectification report in the near term.Meituan reported a net loss for the final quarter of 2020, which prompted the three global credit-rating agencies to downgrade their outlooks. The firm raised $10 billion selling shares and convertible bonds in Hong Kong last month, after burning through cash trying to expand its business.The shares, which have more than 50 buy ratings and no sell recommendations, have fallen for a record nine days. They’re down 42% from their February high in one of the worst performances on the Hang Seng Index.The poem Wang shared is by Tang dynasty poet Zhang Jie about the book burning that took place under emperor Qin Shi Huang.“What the CEO posted is a very famous anti-establishment poem, which shows that he might be under a lot of pressure from the ongoing investigations,” said Hao Hong, head of research at Bocom International in Hong Kong.The following is Wang’s clarification:“A poem from the Tang dynasty inspired me a lot lately: the Qin dynasty was afraid of scholars but Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, whose uprising overthrew the Qin regime, didn’t have much education. This has reminded me that the most dangerous competitors are often not those expected. Alibaba has been focusing on JD.com these years, only to see Pinduoduo exceed it in user numbers. Similarly, Ele.me looks to be the biggest rival of Meituan’s delivery business, but what could really cause a shock to the industry may be some companies and business models that haven’t come under our radar.”(Updates with Shanghai Consumers Council comment in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Meituan Sinks as CEO Deletes Post Seen Critical of Beijing
2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Gigabyte Technology Co. has become the latest international business to face a boycott in China after its comments about shoddy Chinese-made goods prompted an online furor and its removal from e-commerce sites.Shares of Gigabyte, which makes motherboards and graphics cards alongside gaming laptops, sank by the daily limit for a second day, diving 10% in Taipei on Wednesday. Gigabyte has lost roughly $550 million in market value after the firm published a post on its website that claimed it differed from other unnamed brands that chose to outsource to Chinese contract manufacturers in a “low-cost, low quality way.”The remarks sparked an outcry on Chinese social media and prompted e-commerce operators like JD.com Inc. and Suning.com Co. to remove product listings of the firm. Searches for “Gigabyte” or “Jijia”, its Chinese brand name, on the platforms returned no results as of Wednesday morning. Gigabyte has since removed the original post and published an apology on Tuesday, saying that the earlier statement was “seriously inconsistent with the facts” and that it’s proud of the quality of “Made in China” products.Gigabyte is only the latest business to run afoul of a more assertive China and its 1.4 billion consumers. Hennes & Mauritz AB, Nike Inc. and Adidas AG were among brands that were boycotted for their stance on the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, while Lotte Group and other South Korean corporations took a sales hit after China objected to its neighbor’s 2016 decision to deploy a U.S. missile defense system.JD.com didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Chinese internet and artificial intelligence giant Baidu raised about US$3.1 billion via a secondary listing in the city in March. The IPO could value JD Logistics at about US$35 billion, said the person, who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. At US$35 billion, JD Logistics' market capitalisation would exceed some of its peers. ZTO Express, which counts Alibaba Group Holding as one of its shareholders, completed its Hong Kong secondary listing last September which valued it with a market capitalisation of HK$180.7 billion (US$23.3 billion). The Shanghai-based firm is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post. The JD Logistics' IPO follows a blistering four months to begin the year, with investors betting serious money on IPOs. As of May 4, 35 IPOs raised about US$20.3 billion on the Hong Kong bourse, the equivalent of two-fifths of last year's total amount raised and a record high. The company plans to use the proceeds to expand its warehouse, logistics and delivery networks; and to upgrade its technologies, such as its data analytics and algorithm capabilities.

It uses the company's widespread fulfilment network to provide integrated supply chain and logistics services to third-party companies, including warehousing, transport, delivery and after sales services. It operates over 900 warehouses, covering a combined gross floor area of about 226 million square feet (21 million square metres). It employs a team of more than 190,000 delivery personnel. Still, the Beijing- based firm expects to report a bigger net loss for this year, after racking up losses of 2.8 billion yuan in 2018, 2.2 billion yuan in 2019 and 4 billion yuan in 2020. ""As we currently prioritise growth of our business and expansion of our market share over profitability, there can be significant fluctuations in our profitability profile in the near-to-medium term,"" the logistics firm said in its draft prospectus. The spin-off of JD Logistics is the fourth listing by a company under the umbrella of JD Group in less than a year. JD.com completed a US$3.8 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong in June 2020, followed by JD Health's US$3.5 billion listing in the city in December. Dada Nexus, JD Group's 46.5 per cent-owned delivery platform, listed on Nasdaq in June of last year. Combined, these companies raised US$10.9 billion from investors, data from Refintiv shows.

2021-05-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Ant Group Co.’s profit rose to $3.4 billion in the December quarter after Chinese regulators thwarted its record initial public offering and told it to scale back its sprawling business.Billionaire Jack Ma’s fintech giant contributed nearly 7.2 billion yuan to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s earnings, a company filing showed Thursday. Based on Alibaba’s one-third stake in Ant, that translates to 21.8 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) in profit, up 50% from 14.5 billion yuan in the previous three months. Ant’s earnings lag one quarter behind Alibaba’s. Ant declined to comment.The tally underscores the earnings powers Ant boasted before authorities demanded China’s largest fintech company fold its financial business into a holding company, curtailing its growth prospects. Regulators have issued a battery of proposals that threaten to curb Ant’s dominance in online payments and scale back its expansion into consumer lending and wealth management.While Chairman Eric Jing has promised staff that the company will eventually go public, it’s likely to be worth much less than before the crackdown that saw the IPO halted in November. Fidelity Investments halved its valuation estimate for Ant to about $144 billion in February, compared with $295 billion assigned in August.Ant isn’t alone in facing the clampdown.

2021-05-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. forecast better-than-expected revenue and pledged to invest in new growth arenas, signaling its intention to move past a Chinese antitrust probe that triggered its first loss in nine years.Jack Ma’s flagship e-commerce firm swung to a 5.5 billion yuan ($852 million) net loss -- its first since 2012 -- after the company swallowed a $2.8 billion fine for monopolistic behavior imposed by Beijing. It now intends to refocus on its business, plowing “all incremental profit” back into technology and hotly contested areas like community commerce, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang pledged on Thursday. Its shares fell more than 6% in Hong Kong after Citigroup and CICC slashed their price targets on fears that prioritizing growth will hammer profits.Alibaba executives have sought to put behind them a crackdown on Ma’s internet empire that’s shaved $260 billion off the Chinese internet behemoth’s market value. The penalty imposed in April marked the conclusion of a four-month probe, but uncertainty persists as Beijing continues to rein in Alibaba and increasingly powerful rivals from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Meituan. No analyst asked directly about what’s to come in the broader clampdown Thursday, though Zhang stressed the company accepted the fine and will move forward.“We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination,” the CEO said. “During the past fiscal year, we have gone through all kinds of challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, fierce competition as well as an anti-monopoly investigation and penalty decision by Chinese regulators. We believe the best way to overcome these challenges is to look forward and invest for the long term.”Alibaba’s shares are down about 35% from its October peak, just before Ma’s now-infamous rant against outmoded regulations triggered a chain of events that torpedoed a $35 billion initial public offering by his Ant Group Co. and started a probe into the e-commerce giant.“The lack of tangible evidence of material share gains on the ground, for example in community group buying, or food delivery, remains a material concern of ours for Alibaba,” Bernstein analysts led by Robin Zhu said. “We fear that until such data points materialize, Alibaba’s investments will be likened to selling the family silver.”“There is still significant uncertainty in Alibaba,” said Andy Halliwell, an analyst at consultancy Publicis Sapient. “There is no doubt though that Alibaba have capitalized on their digital and tech strategy in light of the global pandemic, and the rebounding Chinese economy. But it remains to be seen how Jack Ma’s behavior last year will have a lasting impact on brand and investor confidence.”Click here for a live blog of the earnings call.Alibaba is keen to convey the impression that it’s back to business as normal. Ma was spotted this week at an annual staff and family celebration at its sprawling Hangzhou campus, where kids played in ball pits while company mascots posed for photos with employees in cosplay.On Thursday, the company forecast revenue for the year ending March 2022 will rise at least 30% to more than 930 billion yuan, beating the 923.5 billion average projection. That’s a deceleration from the previous year’s 41%, and comes after sales for the three moths ended March came in at a better-than-expected 187.4 billion yuan.The anticipatedrevenue growth however disappointed some analysts given the pledge to hike spending. It’s also unclear how much the increased investment, which also encompasses areas from local internet services and merchant solutions, may hurt margins. And reliable growth engines are slowing: cloud revenue grew just 37% in the March quarter after a major, unidentified customer pulled out, the slowest pace since 2014.Zhang singled out community commerce -- an area now fought over between a number of deep-pocketed rivals like JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. -- as a key avenue to reach lower-tier and rural customers. Executives said Alibaba will be disciplined in spending, without elaborating.“Despite heady predictions, it’s likely that we’ll see an erosion of margins in part due to the investment the business is making in new business ventures,” Halliwell said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Alibaba’s profitability may take a back seat as it steps up investments in the coming fiscal year in a bid for market expansion and greater user gains and engagement. Alibaba is also likely to monetize its merchants less aggressively. The company promises to establish strict metrics to assess these initiatives, yet some of the spending may be unavoidable as competition mounts from Pinduoduo, JD.com, Meituan and short-video platforms like Kuaishou and Douyin. Margin at Alibaba’s core commerce business will also be dragged down by the growing shift to self-operated retail and direct-sales businesses, especially with the consolidation of Sun Art this quarter.- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.There remain several other questions Alibaba may have to grapple with in the year ahead. The company joined 33 other tech firms in pledging to abide by monopoly laws and eradicate abuses like forced exclusivity agreements -- actions with as-yet unknown ramifications for growth. More broadly, the Chinese government is debating how to exert greater control over the invaluable online data amassed by its internet giants that have enabled their meteoric expansion over the past decade.The government is said to be considering whether to compel Alibaba to shed media assets that have supported its brand. Antitrust watchdogs are screening its previous investments and could force a divestment if deemed in violation of regulations.Then there’s Alibaba’s finance affiliate -- Ant, a major provider of financing for Alibaba’s consumers -- which is still wrangling with regulators over a forced restructuring that could curb its lending. Its profit in the December quarter rose 50% to 21.8 billion yuan, though the bottom line will remain under pressure because of a requirement to cut back on loans.Alibaba is trying to resume business as normal just as competition ramps up in China’s e-commerce market.Pinduoduo reported 788 million annual active buyers in the December quarter, dethroning Alibaba as China’s biggest e-commerce operator by consumers for the first time ever. On Thursday, Alibaba reported its users had climbed to 811 million in China in the three months ended March.Scrappy upstarts like ByteDance Ltd. and Kuaishou Technology are making inroads into social shopping, chipping away at the growth of its Taobao Live service.

This is because competition is particularly keen in the express delivery sector, with reports of some newer players offering services at below cost to grab business. Over the past three years, the average revenue per parcel for express delivery companies declined by 50 per cent to 60 per cent owing to intensive market competition, according to Charlie Chen, an analyst at China Renaissance. SF Express, China's top delivery service provider, shocked the market this month after it forecast a first-quarter loss of 1.1 billion yuan, triggering a sell-off of its stock. As of Friday's close, its share price in Shanghai was almost halved from its mid-February peak. Five players - ZTO, YTO Express, STO Express, SF Express and Yunda Holding - account for nearly 80 per cent of China's express delivery service market. China is the biggest logistics market in the world in terms of spending, with total logistics spending reaching 14.9 trillion yuan in 2020. That is expected to increase to 19.3 trillion yuan by 2025, according to data from research firm China Insights Consultancy cited in JD Logistics' prospectus.

It offers to sell 609.2 million shares for HK$39.36 and HK$43.36 per share, Bloomberg reports. JD Logistics is set to be priced on May 21 and begin trading on May 28. The IPO could value JD Logistics at up to $34 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. JD.com relies on JD Logistics to store and deliver groceries, clothes, home appliances, and electronic gadgets across China. JD.com used speedy delivery via JD Logistics to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA). JD Logistics reported FY20 revenue growth of 47% year-on-year to $11.4 billion (73.4 billion yuan). The net loss rose 86% Y/Y to 4.1 billion yuan. JD Logistics will utilize the offering proceeds to upgrade and expand its logistics networks, develop advanced technologies and expand its customer base. Seven cornerstone investors, including SoftBank Group Corp (OTC: SFTBF) (OTC: SFTBY), SoftBank Vision Fund, Temasek Holdings Pte, Blackstone Group Inc (NYSE: BX), Tiger Global, China Chengtong Holdings Group Ltd, Matthews Asia, and Oaktree Capital will subscribe for about $1.53 billion of stock. JD.com owns around 79% of JD Logistics. JD.com raised around $4.5 billion from a secondary listing in Hong Kong last June and also saw its health arm, JD Health International’s Dec. IPO, valued at around $4 billion. Price action: JD shares traded higher by 0.15% at $68.25 in the premarket session on the last check Monday.

2021-05-19,"Stocks opened notably lower on the day as we saw a collapse in the price of cryptocurrencies. However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let’s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Ethereum (ETH-USD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it’s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday. At the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it’s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to “just” 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Now back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550. If ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can’t rule out a return to this week’s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000. 7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now On the upside, however, let’s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support. On the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88. On a break below last week’s low at $72.50, it’s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Target (TGT) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider While other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well. Shares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I’d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever On the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: TJX Companies (TJX) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Unlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that’s not the end of the world, either. Shares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week. If it fails to do so, it’s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s. Back above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: JD.com (JD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February. After cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name. Then it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern? Now trying to hold last week’s low near $66.50, let’s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages. A close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.

The company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements and non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain and foreign exchange impact in relation to sale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital expenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the periods, including the dilutive effect of share-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company’s core operating results and business outlook. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company’s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

2021-05-20,"JD.com, Inc. (JD), a Chinese technology-driven e-commerce company, which is transforming into a supply chain-based technology and service provider, posted better-than-expected Q1 results driven by strong revenues. Shares increased 1.2% to close at $70.58 on May 19. JD.com’s Q1 earnings came in at $0.38 (RMB2.47) per ADS, versus the consensus estimate of $0.35 per ADS. The company reported earnings per ADS of RMB1.98 in the same quarter last year. Net revenues of $31 billion (RMB203.2 billion) increased 39% from the year-ago period and outpaced analysts’ expectations of $29.8 billion. Results were supported by outstanding performance in both services and product sectors. (See JD.com stock analysis on TipRanks) JD’s Retail segment reported revenues of $28.4 billion (RMB185.8 billion) in the quarter, up 35.2% year-over-year. Additionally, revenues at JD Logistics grew 63.5% to $3.4 billion (RMB22.4 billion). JD.com CEO Richard Liu said, “Since our establishment, JD’s focus on customers has set us apart and today we are proud that 500 million active users rely on JD’s broad selection of quality products and best-in-class customer services to support every aspect of their lives. JD is also increasingly the partner of choice for millions of businesses who benefit from our advanced supply-chain infrastructure to reduce costs and boost operating efficiency.” Following the Q1 results, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt assigned a Buy rating and a price target of $95 (34.6% upside potential) to the stock. Devitt expects “stable margins in 2Q for JD Retail on a y/y basis as the company compares against one-time benefits in 2Q:20 stemming from government incentives related to the pandemic.” Furthermore, the analyst continues to anticipate “measured investments in the company’s key strategic areas, including supply chain and logistics, omnichannel, and social commerce,” to limit margin expansion in 2021. “We are modestly raising our FY revenue estimates, reflecting ongoing strength in customer acquisition, though leaving our margin forecast unchanged,” he added. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 15 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $105.44 and implies upside potential of 49.4% to current levels. Shares have gained almost 30% over the past year. JD.com scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

According to a World Economic Forum report from earlier this year that cited data from Statista and eMarketer, Chinese e-commerce made up more than half of global Internet retail sales. According to eMarketer, e-commerce in China is expanding at a faster pace than anywhere else in the world. From 2016 to 2020, China’s share of e-commerce as a part of total retail sales in the country more than doubled from 20% to 44%. In contrast, the share of e-commerce as a part of total retail sales in countries like U.K. and the United States was 27.7% and 14.5%, respectively, over the same period. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two Chinese e-commerce companies, Alibaba, and JD.com, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks. Alibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is a Chinese e-commerce giant, founded by Jack Ma, that operates various online marketplaces that cater to different market segments. The company’s TaoBao is a marketplace that is specifically tailored towards individuals and small businesses while TMall is an online marketplace for premium products. Ali Express targets global customers and enables them to buy directly from manufacturers and distributors located not only in China but also internationally. Freshippo is the company’s grocery retail chain while Lazada is an online retailing platform that specifically caters to customers in South East Asia in countries like Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The company has also started a local services and on-demand food delivery platform in China after it acquired Ele.me in 2018. In FY21, Ele.me’s active customer base on an annual basis was up 20% year-over-year due to improvements in users' experiences. BABA intends to continue investing in the platform as it perceives a cross-selling opportunity between the food delivery service and its other on-demand services. Alibaba also provides cloud services and operates a logistics network, Cainiao Network, which Ali Express leverages for its services. Alibaba intends to continue investing in cross-border logistic hubs in Europe, strengthen infrastructure support to international and local e-commerce businesses, and develop its logistics network in key markets. Last week, BABA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results and posted revenues of 187.4 billion yuan, a jump of 64% year-over-year, beating the consensus estimate of 179.9 billion yuan. However, the company reported an operating loss of 7.7 billion yuan, its first quarterly loss as a public company since its IPO in 2014. A major reason for this loss was an antitrust fine of 18.2 billion yuan that Chinese regulators slapped on the company in April. Excluding the fine, it would have reported an operating profit of 10.6 billion yuan. The company plans to ramp up investing in core strategic areas in FY2022 which include helping merchants reduce their operating costs, acquisition of new users, technology innovation, strengthening supply chain capabilities, developing infrastructure, and increasing geographic coverage in China. It anticipates revenues in FY22 of 930 billion yuan, indicating nearly 30% growth year-over-year. Alibaba had annual active consumers of around 891 million in China by the end of March. The company is targeting growing its Chinese customers to over 1 billion in FY22. BABA is also looking at strengthening its investment in Taobao Deals, which offers value-for-money products for price-conscious consumers. The company is looking at reaching out to consumers in rural and under-developed areas in China with Taobao Deals. The Taobao Deals app had 130 million active users in March, 27 million more than it had in December last year. The popularity of the app has also resulted in average spending increasing more on Taobao Deals than the increase in average spending of consumers on Chinese retail marketplaces. The company provides cloud services to different industries under the brand, Alibaba Cloud, which was one of the company’s fastest-growing businesses in FY21 and a key revenue growth driver. This business has turned profitable over the last two quarters. Alibaba intends to invest more in this business by investing in core products such as big data platforms, database and storage, and other Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products. Alibaba believes that Taobao Deals, Taobao Grocery, Freshippo, and new features added to its core platform will continue to be long-term growth catalysts for the company. As a result, BABA continues to remain focused on strengthening these businesses. (See Alibaba stock analysis on TipRanks) Last week, Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian lowered the price target from $285 to $270 and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Sebastian commented on the company’s fiscal Q4 results in a research note to investors, “Sentiment remains decidedly mixed, but we continue to like BABA for patient, longer-term investors.” “However, we expect that ""core marketplace"" margins should remain relatively steady, even as Alibaba spends aggressively to grow New Retail initiatives (including community/group sales), expand logistics and local services, and drive further momentum for Taobao Deals. Also notable, Alibaba Cloud revenues missed expectations due to the loss of one large customer,” Sebastian added. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 25 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $304.55 implies 41.3% upside potential to current levels. JD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce platform that reports primarily under three business segments; retail, logistics, and new businesses. The company’s retail arm provides around 500 million active customers direct access to a wide array of products including electronics, apparel, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), and fresh food. The company also has an international platform, JD Worldwide, which enables international brands to sell directly to customers in China, even if they don’t have a brick-and-mortar presence in China. JD’s logistics business provides supply chain and logistics solutions to businesses while the new business segment includes the company’s international business, its cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) business, JD Property, and Jingxi. Jingxi operates in retail and focuses on lower-tier markets in China. The company posted better-than-expected Q1 results on May 19. JD.com’s Q1 earnings came in at $0.38 (RMB2.47) per ADS, versus RMB1.98 in the same quarter last year. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.35 per ADS. JD reported net revenues of $31 billion (RMB203.2 billion) up 39% year-on-year surpassing analysts’ expectations of $29.8 billion. Results were supported by outstanding performance in both the services and product sectors. While the company did not provide any formal fiscal guidance, JD remained optimistic about its retail business over the long term. The company has already brought brands like Starbucks, Decathlon, and Guozijian to its platform. JD will celebrate its 18th anniversary at its upcoming grand promotion on June 18. One of the company's goals is to help more than 230 brands achieve sales of RMB100 million. JD stated at its earnings call that its retail business model has evolved beyond an online business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce model and that the company was looking at ways to become an omnichannel retailer by strengthening its supply chain management and logistics and leveraging its integrated marketing capabilities, to be able to serve its consumers, anywhere and anytime. The company stated at its earnings call, “JD Retail, as the core business of JD.com, will continue to strive for high-end healthy growth in 2021 and serve as the cornerstone for JD.com's overall development.” (See JD.com stock analysis on TipRanks) On May 19, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt reiterated a Buy and a price target of $95 on the stock. Devitt said in a note to investors, “As a base case, we expect stable margins in 2Q for JD Retail on a y/y basis as the company compares against one-time benefits in 2Q:20 stemming from government incentives related to the pandemic.” “We continue to expect measured investments in the company's key strategic areas, including supply chain and logistics, omnichannel, and social commerce will limit margin expansion in 2021. We are modestly raising our FY revenue estimates, reflecting ongoing strength in customer acquisition, though leaving our margin forecast unchanged,” Devitt added. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 15 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $102.24 implies 39.9% upside potential to current levels. Bottom Line While analysts are strongly bullish about both Alibaba and JD.com, based on the upside potential over the next twelve months, Alibaba seems a more compelling buy.",Alibaba vs. JD: Which Chinese E-Commerce Stock Is A More Compelling Buy?

2021-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- JD Logistics Inc., the delivery arm of e-commerce giant JD.com Inc., has raised about HK$24.6 billion ($3.2 billion) after pricing its Hong Kong initial public offering near the bottom of a marketed range, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The warehousing and shipping company has priced 609.2 million shares at HK$40.36 each, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. It had marketed the shares at HK$39.36 to HK$43.36 apiece. An external representative for the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The JD.com unit’s debut next week will be closely watched as a gauge of investor demand in Hong Kong’s IPO market, which has cooled because of concerns over rising inflation and weakness in global stocks. It is the second-largest listing in the city this year, after short video company Kuaishou Technology’s $6.2 billion float in February.The pricing close to the bottom already suggests investors were cautious about the price tag, even if JD Logistics stopped taking orders a day earlier than planned on strong demand. At the low end of the range, the company would have been valued at $31 billion, well below the $40 billion valuation it had been targeting at the start of the IPO process.While first-time share sales in the Asian financial hub have had their best start to the year on record, with $20.5 billion raised so far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, investor appetite for new stock offerings has petered out recently, with the massive first-day pops seen at the beginning of the year all but gone. For example, SF Real Estate Investment Trust fell 16.5% in its debut on the Hong Kong bourse Monday.Other companies waiting in the wings include online health-care giant WeDoctor, which could raise about $2 billion, and rural e-commerce platform Huitongda Network Co., which is eyeing a $1 billion IPO as soon as the end of this year, Bloomberg News has reported. China Resources Holdings Co. is also weighing a Hong Kong IPO of its supermarket business that could raise as much as $2 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.JD Logistics attracted seven cornerstone investors to its offering, who agreed to subscribe for about $1.53 billion of stock, including SoftBank Vision Fund, Temasek Holdings Pte, Blackstone Group Inc. and Tiger Global.Created in 2007 and set up as a standalone unit under JD.com a decade later, JD Logistics’ networks include both so-called last mile and longer distance lines, as well as cold chain and bulky item networks, according to its prospectus. It operated more than 900 warehouses across China as of the end of 2020. It is still loss-making, reporting a net loss of 4.1 billion yuan ($637 million) last year.JD Logistics’ shares are due to start trading in Hong Kong on May 28.

2021-05-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese food-delivery giant Meituan is working to address regulators’ concerns about its business, changing practices that sparked an antitrust probe while promising better treatment for its millions of drivers and restaurants.The Beijing-based company has set up a dedicated team to work with officials conducting the investigation and vowed strict compliance with new guidelines. It’s also providing insurance for its delivery force -- a victory for an army of mostly part-time personnel -- and cutting fees for partner restaurants. Chief Executive Officer Wang Xing said he anticipates “no significant impact” from the government scrutiny.Meituan’s billionaire founder is trying to quell investor unease about the fallout from Beijing’s crackdown on powerful internet firms. The months-long campaign has helped wipe $130 billion from Meituan’s market value since its February peak, forced the overhaul of budding fintech businesses and spurred giants like Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to adjust internal policies to address accusations of monopolistic behavior. Meituan pledged to avoid forcing exclusive arrangements with its merchants, the alleged practice that landed Alibaba a record $2.8 billion fine.Meituan’s selloff accelerated in May after Wang posted a classical poem about book burning during the Qin dynasty that some interpreted as a veiled criticism of Beijing. The entrepreneur deleted it days later and issued a clarification that he used the poem in reference to the company’s competitors. On Friday, Wang borrowed several of Beijing’s oft-cited catchphrases including Xi Jinping’s “dual circulation” approach to boosting domestic consumption.“In terms of our day to day operation, we haven’t been significantly impacted,” the 42-year-old billionaire assured investors during the earnings call. “This event will not jeopardize the competitive advantage of our food delivery business.”Read more: A 1,100-Year-Old Poem Cost Meituan’s Outspoken CEO BillionsBeijing announced an investigation into the tech giant in April over alleged antitrust violations. Financial regulators then imposed wide-ranging restrictions on its fintech operations, alongside those of peers like Didi. Renewed scrutiny over the treatment of its delivery riders have fueled concern that labor expenses are poised to soar, which would further compound losses stemming from increased spending.For now, Wang’s company is riding a strong post-Covid recovery. Meituan reported better-than-expected revenue of 37 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) in the March quarter, more than doubling from the pandemic-hit year-earlier period. It posted a record 4.8 billion yuan net loss after stepping up investments in newer arenas like online groceries and community commerce.“Investors don’t care about their first-quarter performance, which is pretty much in line with expectations,” said Shawn Yang, managing director of Blue Lotus Capital. “What we want to know is whether Meituan can maintain its growth momentum moving forward. It remains unclear how the company will withstand competition in community e-commerce as well as regulatory pressure.”The antitrust investigation into Meituan signaled Beijing was extending its crackdown beyond fellow billionaire Jack Ma’s tech empire, as it sought to curtail the growing influence of technology giants over every aspect of Chinese life as well as the vast amounts of data they’ve amassed through providing services like online shopping, chatting and ride-hailing. Nomura analysts estimate that Meituan could face a fine of just over $700 million as a result of the probe, based on the $2.8 billion penalty imposed upon Alibaba.Meituan has long been criticized by rivals and merchants for alleged excesses like forced exclusive arrangements. The firm -- which competes against Alibaba’s Ele.me in food delivery -- had previously been found guilty of unfair competition in at least two legal cases this year and ordered to pay compensation, local media has reported. The corporation had also rejected allegations that it charged onerous commissions to restaurants during the Covid-19 outbreak last year.Alongside Ele.me, Meituan also faced an online backlash after several delivery riders were killed or injured while trying to meet strict deadlines, with a recent documentary on Beijing TV -- in which a social security official moon-lit as a driver -- reigniting a debate about the treatment of gig-economy workers. It was among a handful of operators fined by the antitrust watchdog in March for giving improper subsidies to expand in the red-hot arena of community e-commerce. The Shanghai Consumer Council criticized the company in May for practices that hurt consumers’ rights, including problems with refunds and misleading content on its mobile app.Wang on Friday highlighted efforts to improve the welfare of its delivery riders and help merchants, including providing support for digitization to improve efficiencies.Meituan’s antitrust woes have coincided with growing competition, with competitors like Alibaba telegraphing their intention to hike spending. China’s largest e-commerce firm said in May it will invest “all incremental profit” into technology and community commerce, while Pinduoduo Inc. executives on Wednesday reiterated plans to invest “heavily” in areas like logistics infrastructure and technology.Operating losses in its new initiatives business swelled to 8 billion yuan on revenues of 9.9 billion yuan in the March quarter, after it ramped up investments in retail. Wang on Friday reaffirmed his commitment to spending on growing the division, saying that Meituan Select, its community group buying business, has “tremendous” growth potential and could bring in 300 to 400 million users over the next few years. The company’s total transacting users for the 12 months ended March climbed to 569.3 million from 448.6 million a year ago.Its food delivery division swung to an operating profit of 1.1 billion yuan, following losses during the Covid lockdowns across China last year. Its in-store, hotel and travel business grew profits fourfold as Chinese citizens returned to traveling domestically.“Even though Meituan’s widening loss is expected, its record high level signals the company’s determination to invest for the long haul, and has negative implications for industry margins,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “Companies like Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com and Pinduoduo have already indicated their willingness to step up spending, but the magnitude and duration of such investment is uncertain and remains highly dependent on competitive dynamics.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Meituan’s CEO Unveils Changes to Tackle China Antitrust Concerns

""A strong debut could mark a shift in sentiment for existing new-economy stocks."" Since Kuaishou Technology rallied 161 per cent on February 5, other big initial public offerings in Hong Kong of more than US$2 billion in size have fumbled, giving retail investors a chill. Baidu handed buyers zero gain on its March 23 bow, while China's YouTube equivalent Bilibili slipped 1 per cent on March 29. As a result, the pace of new listings has cooled. The local bourse hosted only two stock offerings this month versus three in April and 11 in March, according to exchange data. Still, companies have raised HK$182.7 billion of proceeds in January to May, versus HK$25.2 billion a year earlier. There are downsides investors should note, according to Stanley Chan, director of research at Emperor Securities. Without the bullish sentiment that powered Kuaishou's debut, JD Logistics could come under pressure after its first-day pop. The firm sold new shares at the lower end of a price range of HK$39.36 to HK$43.36. The industry is also fraught with fierce competition, as Chinese peer S.F. Holdings' first-quarter losses showed. Even Kuaishou is getting battered, sliding 14.6 per cent this week, as losses widened. ""JD Logistics will not be as hot as Kuaishou or other IPOs that surged earlier this year,"" said Chan, who expects the upside to topped 30 per cent.

Earnings volatility can be expected while the company prioritizes business and market-share growth over profitability in the near to medium terms.-- James Teo and Chris Muckensturm, analystsClick here for the researchWith just a 2.7% share of the logistics industry, JD Logistics is seeking to expand its footprint outside China, including into Europe, where rivals like Alibaba’s Cainiao have also been growing. The company will probably set up logistics centers on the continent within a year, Yu said in the interview. The intense competition in the business of providing logistics to other enterprises means JD Logistics will be relatively insulated from Chinese scrutiny as it ventures overseas, he added.“JD Logistics is doing better than any other companies in B2B sector in terms of ensuring the benefits of our front-line workers and regulatory compliance,” said Yu, a JD Group veteran of 13 years. “From our point of view, we don’t see much potential risks in regulation.”JD Logistics’ debut is far more muted compared with the 161% first-day surge for short-video platform Kuaishou. It is the second unit to be spun off from JD.com in the past six months, following the December listing of JD Health International Inc. The e-commerce operator had also sought to list its fintech division last year before a crackdown on the sector forced it to shelve its plans.Decoupling from its parent will allow JD Logistics to tap new customers, including short video platforms like ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin and Kuaishou that are increasingly expanding into online shopping, according to Jacob Cooke, chief executive officer at e-commerce and technology consultancy WPIC. That will allow the firm to expand its market share and bring about economies of scale that will help it achieve profitability, he added.“JD Logistics fits in very well with the regulatory plans of the Chinese government in breaking up these monopolies and really allowing them to go get a new customer base operating independently, like they are now,” Cooke said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Now that they’re independent -- and there’s so much that goes on with data sharing in China too -- but that’s really going to make other platforms and other brands feel more comfortable using JD Logistic’s products to help with their fulfillment.”(Updates shares, adds analyst comment.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",JD Logistics Gains on Debut After $3.2 Billion Hong Kong IPO
