## Chart indicators

Even though utilities outperformed broader markets in 2018, the recent weakness is a concern. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of top utilities in the country, fell almost 10% in the second half of December. Let’s see where top utility stocks might go in the short term.

NextEra Energy (NEE) is trading at $169.8—almost 4% below its 50-day simple moving average and marginally above its 200-day moving average level. The 200-day level close to $168.9 will likely be crucial support for NextEra Energy stock going forward. NextEra Energy’s RSI (relative strength index) is 33.

## Southern Company stock is oversold

Southern Company (SO) stock is trading in the “oversold” zone with its RSI below 30. RSI levels at extremes indicate an impending reversal in the stock’s direction. Southern Company is trading 5% and 4% below its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. The fair discount to both of these levels indicates weakness in the stock.

Recently, Duke Energy (DUK) and Dominion Energy (D) shares fell below the 50-day moving average, which suggests weakness in the stock. Duke Energy and Dominion Energy have an RSI close to 34, which indicates that they aren’t in the oversold or the overbought zone. Their respective 200-day moving average level might act as a support in the short term.

## Analysts’ target prices

Analysts expect an upside potential of almost 10% from NextEra Energy (NEE) stock based on the median target price of $186.1 and its current price of $169.8.

Duke Energy (DUK), the second-largest utility by market cap, has a median target price of $87.7, which reflects a potential upside of almost 4% from its current price of $84.7 over the next 12 months.

The above chart shows Wall Street analysts’ views on the top utility stocks as of January 2.

Southern Company (SO) stock offers a potential upside of more than 7% over the next 12 months. Analysts gave the company a median target price of $46.9—compared to its current price of $43.7.

Dominion Energy (D) has a median target price of $76.6—compared to its current price of $71.2, which implies a potential upside of 7.6% over the next 12 months.

Utilities’ outperformance last year was mainly driven by market uncertainties. The recent weakness in utilities could be an opportunity given the fair valuation of many big names. Considering the estimated gain based on analysts’ target prices and the current dividend yield, top utility stocks present an attractive total return for 2019.

## A shaky start to 2019

Utilities, the defensives, underperformed broader markets last week. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of the top utility stocks in the country, closed marginally down. The S&P 500 gained almost 2% in the week ending January 4. The broader markets were still volatile. The better-than-expected jobs report for December and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on being patient about raising rates helped the sentiment late last week.

## Movers and shakers

NextEra Energy (NEE) fell marginally, while Duke Energy (DUK), the second-biggest utility by market cap, fell 0.8% last week. Duke Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9275 per share last week, which indicates a dividend yield of 4.4%. The ex-dividend date for the dividend is February 14. The dividend will be paid on March 18. Duke Energy has a long dividend payment history. Duke Energy has paid a cash dividend for 93 consecutive years.

According to Reuters, wildfire-stricken PG&E (PCG) is considering filing for bankruptcy. The company is facing a multi-billion dollar liability associated with wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Bankruptcy isn’t certain yet. However, the company reported in November that its existing insurance wouldn’t be enough. The wildfire-related liabilities could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition. PG&E fell 30% in after-hours trading on January 4 following the news, according to Reuters.

Top regulated utility stock Southern Company (SO) rose 1.7%, while Dominion Energy (D) fell 1.4% last week. Dominion Energy completed its much-awaited SCANA (SCG) acquisition last week.

## Will the defensives repeat 2018?

Utilities continued to underperform broader markets last week. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) rose almost 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 2.5% in the week ending January 11. Utilities beat the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2018 particularly when markets started falling in the fourth quarter.

The benchmark ten-year Treasury yield was largely flat last week—it closed at 2.70%. Utility stocks and Treasury yields usually trade inversely to each other. Higher interest rates could make utilities less appealing compared to bonds. The Fed delivered four quarter-point rate hikes last year—the most hikes since it started rate normalization in 2015.

## Movers and shakers

NextEra Energy (NEE), the biggest utility by market cap, stock rose ~2%, while Duke Energy (DUK) fell almost 1% last week. Regulated utility giant Southern Company (SO) grew more than 4%, while Dominion Energy (D) fell more than 3%.

2019-01-16,"Wildfires caused by PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) appear to now consume PCG stock. This utility finds itself in trouble as its negligence led to numerous wildfires across northern California. As a result, PCG stock is now in freefall.

In its descent, PCG has exhibited the one trait one never wants to see in a utility stock -- instability.

### RIP PCG Stock

I usually think &quot;opportunity&quot; when I hear about instability in most stocks. I often see a scandal or a setback in an equity and think &quot;buying opportunity.&quot; Events such as a big earnings miss, an unexpected CEO departure, a sex scandal, or the like often hit companies. Stockholders often react overreact to such occurrences, selling off a stock much more than the ensuing event justifies.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The lows of the financial crisis serve as a great example. Investors who bought into the S&P 500 near its March 2009 low of 611 benefited from huge profits once the negative feelings abated.

Not this time.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens 



PCG stock lost more than 40% of its value on Monday. After Monday, the freefall continued. Since early October, Pacific Gas & Electric stock has lost more than 85% of its value.

Negligence by PG&E over poorly maintained power lines sparked wildfires causing billions in property damage. Sadly, many also perished in these fires. This will not go away with a few million in payoffs or a better earnings report in the next quarter. Given the magnitude of the financial damages PCG stock faces, bankruptcy remains its only viable option.

As of this writing, PCG trades in the single digits and continues to fall. Another shoe dropped as the S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Teleflex (NYSE:TFX) would replace PCG stock in the S&P 500 on Jan. 18.

### Utility Stocks Require a Different Investor Mindset

The issues go well beyond mere company negligence. The company also violated a rarely discussed assumption. PCG stock represents a utility. Nobody invests $5,000 in a utility in hopes of finding the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and getting rich. Investors buy a utility stock to benefit from a stable, slow-growth equity that yields dividend income.

More than that, investors expect these companies to define stability. These firms rarely face competition when they own the infrastructure. Their profit growth tends to mirror household formation increases and inflation. These firms often generate healthy dividends, but little else in the way of news. Peers such as NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Southern Company (NYSE:SO) quietly keep the power on, collect profits and pay dividends.

If anything displaces a utility, one expects it would entail a technological shift such as the solar roof from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Few expect widespread negligence to take such a company down. However, PCG has become the exception. Looking back, the 2000 film Erin Brockovich should have served as a clue of the chronic issues that persist with PG&E. The negligence that caused the lawsuit discussed in that movie did nothing to change the company. As a result, PG&E faces another bankruptcy. Now, investors have to rethink whether the Warren Buffett mantra of &quot;buy when there's blood in the streets&quot; (or in California's case, when there's fire) should apply to utilities.

  * Top 10 Global Stock Ideas for 2019 From RBC Capital 



### Final Thoughts on PCG Stock

Due to its negligence, Pacific Gas & Electric reminded us that the instability we might tolerate from most equities has no place in a utility stock like PCG. More often than not, mistakes or unexpected setbacks create buying opportunities in stocks. However, with the essential role utilities play, instability can easily destroy such a company. This has become the case with PCG stock. Now, bankruptcy has become the company's only option.

Bottom line, utilities should draw little attention. PCG stock broke that cardinal rule in the most outrageous manner imaginable. Now, bankruptcy courts will decide the fate of PG&E. It goes without saying that those who own this equity should get out before its lights out. More importantly, it reminds us that utility stocks should generate dividends, not attention.

2019-01-25,"PG&E (NYSE:PCG) exploded late in Thursday trading. Traders found relief as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection absolved the utility of any fault related to the Tubbs Fire. PCG stock surged by almost 75% to $13.95 per share following the release of this news late in the Thursday trading session. So far in Friday's trading, the rally has settled a bit, and PCG stock price hovers around 12.40.

However, they still face tens of billions in liability related to 17 other fires, which killed at least 13 people. They also face some likelihood that investigators will find them at fault in the Camp Fire -- the deadliest fire in California history. Hence, a huge chance of bankruptcy remains. For this reason, investors should probably avoid PCG stock despite the move higher.

### PCG Stock Spiked on Tubbs Fire News

According to state fire officials, a private electrical system caused the Tubbs Fire. They said PG&E beared no responsibility for the fire, which burned almost 37,000 acres in Napa and Sonoma counties and killed 22 people.

  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now 



The news heartened owners of PCG stock as the price of the equity spiked higher. However, the firm still bears responsibility for 18 wildfires that occurred in 2017. Fire officials have also not exonerated the company in the Camp Fire. That blaze killed 86 people, and PG&E admitted that a high-voltage line failed in this area before the fire started.

### PG&E Not Out of the Woods

Investors should also note that even without liability from the Tubbs Fire, the costs related to other fires could still push the company into bankruptcy. Analysts had estimated the total damages at about $30 billion. Although that figure includes the Tubbs Fire, the company still faces billions in fire-related liability. Moody's cut PG&E credit rating to junk status. They said that the decision regarding the Tubbs Fire would not change that rating.

Not all agree that this will lead to bankruptcy for PCG stock. To be sure, the PCG stock price of almost $13 per share implies less of a danger of bankruptcy. Moreover, a bailout from the State of California remains possible. However, Governor Gavin Newsom has shown no interest in such a move.

Hence, investors should approach this stock on the likely assumption of a Chapter 11 filing. At this stage, buying PCG stock amounts to a gamble that the company will avoid liability in the Camp Fire. Given the utility's admittance of a power line failure in the area, that seems like a bet investors are unlikely to win.

### PG&E Not the Usual Utility Stock

Also, as I mentioned in a recent article, utility stock investors do not sign up for this kind of turmoil. Usually, investors buy utility stocks for stability and dividend income. They want firms such as Dominion Resources (NYSE:D), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), or Southern Company (NYSE:SO) that quietly generate power, deliver service, and distribute profits among shareholders.

Prospective buyers should also remember the fact that this company holds a monopoly in providing the energy needed to sustain life. Even with that guaranteed book of business, they still face Chapter 11. One can debate whether the PG&E management team or poor forestry management in the state led to this point. However, no matter where the fault lies, the investment decision remains the same.

Even if the company avoided bankruptcy, liability costs would preclude a return of the dividend for years to come. Hence, all signs point to PCG stock as a high-risk gamble at best.

  * 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



### The Bottom Line on PCG Stock

Despite the surge in PCG stock, risks remain incredibly high, and even risk-tolerant investors would likely see better results looking elsewhere. Although PG&E will not bear any liability from the Tubbs Fire, the utility still faces tens of billions in liability stemming from other blazes. Given that cost and the decreasing likelihood that the firm will receive a bailout, speculative investors should look to other equities.

2019-02-05,"Usually, the new year brings hope for both personal and societal development. However, in President Donald Trump's highly contentious administration, most folks arguably have trepidation. Certainly, the markets are providing no favors, wavering between fear and greed over the past few months. In such circumstances, finding the best stocks to invest in presents extraordinary challenges.

If I didn't have a protocol to abide by, I could write short novels about every fundamental headwind. But to keep it brief, we can summarize the mania on Wall Street with one word: ambiguity. While some factors suggest that the U.S. is on the recovery track -- making American blue chips the best stocks to buy -- other indicators propose caution.

For instance, benchmark indices ticked up recently due to a spate of corporate earnings releases. So far, we've seen several organizations post better-than-expected results. That tempts the case for blue-chip stocks to invest in. But on the other hand, the percentage of earnings-beaters is below the trailing five-year average, according to Factset.

Another pressing issue is the fractious discourse in Washington. Congressional negotiators must reach an agreement about border security quickly. If the controversial issue falls into an impasse, the American people, particularly federal workers and service members, will again suffer an embarrassing and painful government shutdown.

On top of that, we still have trade tensions with China. While U.S. and Chinese officials recently met for talks, government representatives from either side have disclosed nothing substantive. The president remains hopeful that he can hash something out with his counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping. But talking is one thing; doing is quite another.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



In that respect, it's advisable not to go to gung-ho at this juncture. That being said, here are the nine best stocks to invest in for a manic market:

### Duke Energy (DUK)

When you flip the switch, you expect the lights to turn on. Anything else in this digitally integrated society is an unacceptable failure. That's why in uncertain times, the best stocks to invest in are found in the utility sector. And within this category, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) stands out.

While so many other companies failed to generate any momentum last year, DUK stock offered a much-needed respite for investors. After absorbing a sharp dip in January, shares gained almost 18% between February and December. It's still maintaining that momentum this year, while also paying out a generous 4.2% dividend yield.

Admittedly, DUK made unfortunate headlines recently after a regulatory agency fined the utility firm for cybersecurity violations. While the optics look bad, also note that Duke self-reported a majority of the violations. Moreover, I doubt that a fine will ultimately detract from the company's strong fundamental case.

### Verizon Communications (VZ)

Next in line among the best stocks to invest in are telecommunications companies. Like the utilities sector, people today have basic expectations about their smart devices and internet connectivity. Additionally, telecom firms usually pay out a handsome dividend, offering shelter and protection during uncertain times.

This is an accurate descriptor for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). One of the biggest telecoms in the world, VZ currently has a 4.5% dividend yield. Moreover, it has escaped the worst of the volatility last year, even compared against other telecoms. In 2018, VZ gained a respectable 11%.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



Best of all, Verizon is a leader in the emerging 5G network. Last October, VZ became the world's first commercial 5G provider. While much work remains, levering that first-to-market advantage could prove pivotal.

### Campbell Soup (CPB)

Food companies represent some of the best stocks to buy during ambiguous market phases for an obvious reason: people have to eat. Indeed, no other commodity is as intricately linked to survival as food. That said, we also eat for enjoyment, bolstering the case for Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB).

I concede right off the bat that other, potentially superior options exist. After all, CPB stock hemorrhaged over 29% in 2018. The fact that shares are up over 5% year-to-date doesn't justify putting CPB in a list of stocks to invest in. Plus, one of the bearish catalysts is poor soup sales, a killer when your name is Campbell Soup.

That said, I think the volatility is overdone. We're seeing a significant tick up in revenue as Campbell leverages its other food and beverage brands. Plus, that 4% dividend yield looks mighty attractive right now.

### Kirkland Lake Gold (KL)

It's the ultimate defensive investment. Not subject to central-banking authorities, gold remains impervious to devaluation. Instead, if the worst happens, gold could theoretically replace any currency as a universally accepted form of payment and value.

Of course, lugging around gold bars is neither practical nor safe. For those who want to have the convenience of equity ownership and the profitability potential of an exciting market sector, you should consider Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL). KL is one of the best stocks to invest in among gold miners, levering a market capitalization nearing $7 billion.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 



A highlight for KL stock is an explosion in revenue and profitability metrics in recent years. As a result, shares have skyrocketed over 23% YTD. While you're admittedly buying into strength, I believe gold prices are on a resurgence due to the fear trade. If so, put Kirkland in your list of stocks to buy.

### H&R Block (HRB)

Out of the stocks mentioned on this list, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) likely perplexes people the most. With so much talk about changing the tax code last year, this catalyst should boost HRB stock. Plus, with tax season coming up, you'd expect a decent showing.

Unfortunately, that's not what's going on at all. Since the January opener, HRB has dropped nearly 6%. A weak technical response to the volatility suggests more nearer-term pressure. So what's the deal here?

While the president did push for change, it's the type that doesn't favor H&R Block; namely, a simpler tax code. That's a death sentence for a company that thrives on making complex tasks easier for clients.

But not so fast! In the digital age, we're witnessing a growing transition towards contract work in the labor market. Essentially, these folks are in business for themselves, which requires a complicated tax procedure. HRB presents risks and requires patience, but it's something to check out.

### AMC Entertainment (AMC)

In the streaming age, you'd expect cineplex operators like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) to stumble. Indeed, AMC stock in the past caused stakeholders substantial pain. Even recently, shares have disappointed, along with most other retail-related organizations.

However, during a period of ambiguity and trepidation, AMC represents one of the best stocks to invest in. Primarily, people seek escapism during troubled times to cope with everyday realities. Not only does AMC provide that opportunity, it does so cheaply relative to other forms of entertainment. As I mentioned last summer, going to the movies is much cheaper than attending either a football or baseball game.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



Here's the kicker: the film industry still offers financial viability. It's not that people aren't going to the big screen. Rather, they wish to see certain types of films, typically comic-book based or science-fiction blockbusters. Fortunately, companies like Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) are giving movie-goers exactly what they want, thereby lifting AMC.

### Vector Group (VGR)

As we head into the speculative portion of our list of stocks to invest in, I like Vector Group (NYSE:VGR) for anyone who doesn't mind ramping up the risk. VGR stock provides exposure to multiple cigarette brands, as well as the e-cigarette brand, Zoom E-Cigs.

This is an incredibly cynical argument but let's be real: smoking cigarettes represents a quick and easy distraction from stress. I know a few colleagues who have smoked like a chimney over the last two years for understandable reasons. Plus, with the way things are going, we may see a natural rise in interest in vice stocks.

Of course, if you're a conservative investor, you should opt for the traditional names: Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), Altria Group (NYSE:MO) or British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). However, if you want upside potential along with exposure to e-cigarettes, I'd look carefully at VGR.

### Constellation Brands (STZ)

Unlike tobacco, alcohol represents a universal vice. In both personal and professional functions, going out for drinks is commonplace. Invariably, should market conditions become even more fractured, we're likely to see a spike in imbibing. Therefore, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best stocks to invest in at this juncture.

More importantly, STZ stock benefits from demographic trends. Younger people increasingly gravitate towards spirits and wines, areas in which Constellation Brands specializes. This consumer behavior is especially noticeable among women. Additionally, when young drinkers try beer, they prefer higher-quality variations. Again, STZ provides expertise in this department.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Finally, we can't ignore the obvious: Constellation Brands has a significant stake in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). When it comes to easing the edge off a tough day at the markets, cannabis offers the perfect release. Not that I would know or anything…

### Sturm Ruger (RGR)

As a firearms manufacturer, Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) finds itself in multiple controversies. However, as a form of escapism and stress management, RGR is one of the best stocks to buy. Firing off a few rounds with an AR-15 is exhilarating, and makes you appreciate the fragility of life.

But that's not the reason why I like RGR stock. Instead, I believe Ruger offers a profitable way to advantage rancor in Washington. Specifically, I have doubts that Trump and the Republicans can pull off a surprise victory come 2020.

Undoubtedly, many of you are happy to hear that. But a sizable portion of the American electorate loves Trump, and even more so, love their guns. Any threat to the Second Amendment almost guarantees a spike in firearm sales.

That threat has a name: Senator Kamala Harris. To many gun advocates, Harris is as liberal as the day is long. The National Rifle Association rates her very poorly on firearms rights. Obviously, Harris is bad news for Ruger gun owners. However, she's a godsend for Ruger stakeholders!

2019-04-22,"Within economics and the financial markets, you must deal with the trade-off concept. For instance, if you want to strike it rich quickly, you're likely looking at upstart organizations with strong potential. However, you have to give up the proven stability of a blue-chip name. This dynamic also applies to high-yielding dividend stocks to buy.Almost everyone loves the idea of passive income. You take a great company with a generous yield and sit back and collect the dividend. However, the most generous dividend stocks are usually the riskiest. Sure, you can find several companies that pay out double-digit yields. The question is, are these investments sustainable? Usually, the answer is no.Fortunately, the markets aren't always the most efficient platform for assessing value. While I don't want to debate various economic theories, it's fair to say not all high-yielding dividend stocks are speculative. In fact, many of the names you'll see below are worldwide recognizable brands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees For this list, I've picked out 10 publicly traded companies that have a dividend yield of at least 3%. In fact, they average well over 5%. However, these are organizations that, while risky, offer viable products and services.In other words, these are not fly-by-night operations. So without further ado, here are 10 high-yielding dividend stocks to buy that won't wilt! High-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy: Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Over the past few years, several investors -- even those who seek high-yielding dividend stocks -- have avoided Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). At first, such evasion seems strange. After all, an investment in KO is levered toward a global powerhouse brand. Additionally, Coca-Cola has consistently grown its payout across several decades.However, its current 3.4% yield isn't enough for many to overlook the soda industry's declining relevance. Research reports indicate that millennials eschew sugary, carbonated drinks for healthier beverages. As such, sector players have had to adjust to this changing landscape, offering more choices that cater to health-conscious buyers.Here's the thing about KO stock. Despite its volatility, the underlying company has made those changes. Its rebranding efforts, particularly with Diet Coke, resulted in notable successes. Furthermore, I demonstrated that millennials aren't necessarily healthier. Instead, they want to think that they're making healthier choices.My argument is that Coca-Cola has a chance, as long as they keep their marketing on point. Olin Corporation (OLN)Dividend Yield: 3.3%We're seeing tremendous changes in our economy, and they may be just the beginning. It's no longer a matter of science fiction to assume a world of robots and automation. So if you're looking for dividend stocks to buy that can survive this coming age, you should check out Olin Corporation (NYSE:OLN).OLN specializes in industrial chemicals, which doesn't sound like a next-generation sector because it isn't. However, to actualize the benefits of technology, you still require a physical infrastructure. For example, Olin's expertise in developing epoxy products is critical for the energy, transportation and civil engineering industries.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Another driving force that supports Olin's 3.3% dividend yield is its Winchester ammunition brand. As you know, Americans love their guns. In fact, we have more guns in this country than we have people. That equates to a lot of shooting, which equates to OLN being one of the safest high-yielding dividend stocks you can get. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: GothamNurse Via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.3%Invariably, most of the exciting stocks to buy focus on the industries of tomorrow, such as automation and artificial intelligence. But no matter how much we progress as a society, we've got to eat. That simple, unavoidable fact helps drive agricultural company Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM).Of course, the icy U.S.-China relationship has disproportionately impacted domestic agriculture. Therefore, ADM stock slid sharply during the second half of last year. However, the Archer Daniels brand is a powerful one, featuring a strong international presence with the capacity to boot.Currently, ADM pays out a 3.3% dividend yield, and I don't see that being in any trouble. Primarily, the company has a strong history of consistent payouts that extend back for decades. Second, the importance of its core industry suggests that ADM will remain one of the most relevant dividend stocks. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4%Among high-yielding dividend stocks to buy, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has one of the most balanced cases. I said as much when I covered XOM stock around mid-April. The company generates immediate interest for its history of strong payouts and its dominant position in the energy industry. With a 4% yield, this is a tough investment to ignore.At the same time, XOM stock has suffered significant setbacks. Although we're years removed from the energy crisis of 2014 and 2015, the sector is still recovering from it. Big oil firms like Exxon Mobil are no exception. Plus, we're seeing a decided push toward green-energy solutions, which hurts the case for XOM.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm So how should investors approach the oil giant? If you're seeking a nearer-term profit, I don't like some of the immediate headwinds affecting shares, though oil prices are surging on news that the U.S. might be lifting waivers on Iran sanctions. But for the longer run, I believe XOM has critical infrastructures and assets that still represent viable energy sources. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%During a particularly brutal heatwave in the southwestern region of California and Arizona in September 2011, a botched maintenance procedure knocked out critical power channels. San Diego went dark, as did parts of Tijuana, Mexico and western Arizona. I went through the experience and I immediately recognized the fragility of our digitalized economy.Sure, we may be the most advanced nation in the world, but all it takes is one silly mistake to undo everything. In that sense, I think every portfolio should include dividend stocks that have some exposure to the utilities sector. Among them, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has provided its shareholders with a mix of capital gains and strong passive income.While utility firms aren't the sexiest names in the investing world, they are incredibly vital. As we dive further into an automated industry, the one thing we cannot live without is power. For that reason, the 4.2% yield that underlines DUK stock is well justified. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.5%Admittedly, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) isn't the most exciting name among dividend stocks to buy. For most of this decade, IBM shares have gone sideways, ultimately impressing neither the bulls nor the bears. However, a strong performance this year suggests that calls for its death were premature.After all, IBM has a long history of innovation and forwarding pioneering technologies. Although they don't get as much coverage as they used to, &quot;Big Blue&quot; has made exciting progress with AI. Recently, the company revealed that they use AI to accurately forecast which workers will quit their jobs. IBM claims that they saved nearly $300 million in retention costs with their digital program.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Of course, AI has its ups and downs. For instance, IBM had to shut down a segment of its Watson Health division because it didn't generate enough profit. Still, it has demonstrated significant potential. Plus, that 4.5% yield looks awfully attractive right now. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Dividend Yield: 5.1%Back when consumers had fewer options, cineplex operate AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) made plenty of sense. But in the streaming era, AMC simply appears outdated and irrelevant. In this day and age, who would want to go somewhere to watch something? Moreover, when the box office bombed in 2017, AMC shares cratered.Still, I look at this company as one of the more intriguing dividend stocks to buy. Yes, I own some shares, but it's more important to focus on why I do, as opposed to merely the fact that I do. It comes down to this: AMC provides a social experience that you'll never get from streaming services or other &quot;isolated&quot; platforms.Moreover, the movie industry has shifted its priorities to accommodate the new entertainment landscape. Production studios now dedicate most of their resources to proven winners, such as comic-book based movies or established franchises. I'm hardly surprised that Captain Marvel is the biggest movie so far this year. Nerds eat this stuff up.Better yet, box office receipts prove that nerds have taken over Hollywood. That alone provides justification for AMC's 5%-plus dividend yield. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.2%Ordinarily, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has been one of the most consistent performers among dividend stocks to buy. Taking away the events from last year, ABBV stock provided generally steady returns, making its payout worthwhile. Obviously, its exposure to the pivotal healthcare sector makes AbbVie a perpetually relevant name.That said, 2018 was a rough year for the pharmaceutical giant. Moreover, shifting political dynamics bring many questions to the industry. For instance, several prominent Democrats support the &quot;Medicare for All Act.&quot; Such a comprehensive plan will shine a glaring spotlight on pharmaceutical pricing, potentially hurting profitability.  * 7 Stocks That Can Outperform for Years Naturally, if Democrats take over the White House, that's a political headwind for ABBV stock. However, there's also the likelihood that Medicare for All will drive revenues back home. For instance, many Americans go to Mexico to buy prescription drugs. If we can establish fair, sensible pricing, pharmaceutical firms may benefit from an untapped revenue source. AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 6.4%When telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T) first proposed buying out Time Warner, I'm sure more than a few eyes rolled. Before the deal, T stock suffered from a massive debt load. With the deal, that situation obviously did not improve. Therefore, I understand why many folks have run for the hills.Also, the company's tremendously high 6.4% yield appears a little too generous. Yes, AT&T historically has been one of the top names among blue-chip dividend stocks. But with such a huge liability clouding everything, that yield seems like a trap.Unfortunately, in high-barrier industries, you've got to pay to play. While the Time Warner deal hurts the balance sheet, it gives T stock exposure to the lucrative content-streaming market. Plus, they're one of the few alpha dogs that can implement the 5G rollout.Lastly, let's just acknowledge that AT&T is too big to fail. Like it or not, their success is vital to progressing the American economic machinery. That's a very comfortable explanation why T stands out among other dividend stocks. GameStop (GME)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 17.3%GameStop (NYSE:GME) recently proved that the adage that struggling companies have had their bad news priced in is just that: an adage. After failing to find a buyer earlier this year, GME shares tumbled badly. However, a very poor showing in the fourth quarter added even more pain to an already ugly show.Ironically, one of GameStop's most attractive elements -- the crazy-high yield -- is too awe-striking for its own good. After all, how many dividend stocks with a yield of over 17% ended up surviving? When a company is paying you more than twice the average return of the S&P 500, there's a reason for that. Typically, it's not a good one.Although this is an incredibly risky idea, it's worth noting that digital video game downloads may eventually hit a wall. I say this because many popular games have sizes exceeding 100 gigabytes. After downloading a couple titles, gamers will have to buy an external hard drive, which can easily run around $50.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Or, they can just go to GameStop and pick up used games on the cheap.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AMC and AT&T.

2019-04-29,"The utilities sector is one of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500, but it is still beloved by conservative investors seeking higher dividend yields and lower volatility. Fortunately, there are dozens of ETFs dedicated to this sector.For tactical traders and investors looking for entry points into utilities ETFs, this week is an interesting time for the sector. This week, over 43% of the S&P 500 Utilities Index reports first-quarter earnings, meaning this could be an eventful span for an array of utilities ETFs. The earnings spotlight dims somewhat next week for utilities, but more than 18% of the aforementioned utilities gauge reports earnings during the week of May 6.To this point in earnings seasons, &quot;six of the eleven sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Health Care and Utilities sectors,&quot; said FactSet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLU) is the largest utilities ETF and a fine option in its own right, but let's explore some other utilities ETFs here. Fidelity MSCI Utilities ETF (FUTY)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.084% per year, or $8.40 on a $10,000 investment.While the aforementioned XLU is the largest utilities ETF, the Fidelity MSCI Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:FUTY) is the cheapest fund dedicated to this sector. FUTY tracks the MSCI USA IMI Utilities Index and has nearly $635 million in assets under management. FUTY holds 67 stocks, giving it a deeper bench than some rival, large-cap utilities ETFs.This utilities ETF's top 10 holdings combine for nearly 53% of the fund's weight and include Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D). Fidelity clients can realize addition cost benefits with FUTY because this utilities ETF is part of the firm's expansive commission-free lineup.&quot;Utilities are usually considered a safe choice with stable returns, unlike the tech companies that have been driving most of the stock market's growth over the past decade,&quot; reports Evie Liu for Barron's. &quot;But as the market pulled back significantly last year, even steady gains can become top-notch performance.&quot;S&P Capital IQ has a Marketweight rating on the utilities sector while Ned Davis Research has an Overweight rating on the group. Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum ETF (PUI)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.60%Utilities ETFs are usually seen as low beta fare, but there are ways to bring some spice to the group. That includes the Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PUI), which eschews the cap-weighted methodology associated with many traditional utilities ETFs.PUI, which carries a four-star Morningstar rating, follows the Dorsey Wright Utilities Technical Leaders Index. That index &quot;is designed to identify companies that are showing relative strength (momentum), and is composed of at least 30 securities from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. Relative strength is the measurement of a security's performance in a given universe over time as compared to the performance of all other securities in that universe,&quot; according to Invesco.  * 8 Stocks to Buy Whose Products America Loves The average market value of PUI's 30 holdings is $16.88 billion, putting it at the lower end of utilities ETFs by that metric. Nearly 61% of this utilities ETF's holdings are classified as large- and mid-cap value stocks. None of the fund's holdings exceed weights of 3.90%, which is also low compared to traditional utilities ETFs. First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund (FXU)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.63%Somewhat quietly, the First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXU) is home to over $908 million in assets under management, making it the third-largest US-listed utilities ETF. Like the aforementioned PUI, FXU is a smart beta utilities ETF, not a cap-weighted fund. FXU, which soon turns 12 years old, tracks the StrataQuant Utilities Index.Components in FXU's underlying index are measured based &quot;on growth factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets,&quot; according to First Trust.Even with its unique methodology, this utilities ETF has a decent dividend yield of 2.35%. However, historical data indicate FXU has struggled to beat traditional utilities ETFs over long holding periods, indicating its high fee is hard to justify for long-term investors.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-02,"By any conventional measure Southern (NYSE:SO) is a hot utility stock. SO stock is up 20% since the start of the year, against a 16.5% gain for the average stock in the S&P 500. Yet the 60 cent per share dividend, which is covered by earnings, still yields a fat 4.7%.Source: Shutterstock While Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), which tied its future to renewable energy, has gone into bankruptcy, Southern continues to stand tall.What could possibly go wrong? To put it simply, the rise of wind and solar power.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Southern's Nuclear StrategySouthern is one of the largest operators of nuclear power plants in the country, with six in all.  It's building two more, an expansion of its Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Assuming the plants come on stream by 2022, Southern will have an additional 2.4 Million megawatt hours of capacity to sell, over 10% of the region's demand.Of course, that's a big if. A similar nuclear expansion across the river, in South Carolina, cost $9 billion, resulted in 9 rate hikes, and was eventually abandoned. The utility company behind it was sold to Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) for $13.4 billion in cash and assumed debt.For now Vogtle is the only nuclear power going up that qualifies under the Republican plans for &quot;green energy,&quot; and the project is being showered with largesse in the form of federal loan guarantees that now total $12 billion.  The expansion, originally slated to cost $14 billion, now has a budget of $28 billion. Changing WindsAs costs for solar and wind energy continue to fall -- they're now cheaper than maintaining coal-fired power plants -- the long-term fate of nuclear energy is increasingly precarious.Southern directors see which way the wind is blowing. They recently tied CEO Tom Fanning's pay to cuts in SO stock's carbon footprint.  But those plans are highly dependent on finishing Vogtle and getting that energy into the grid. The riskiest operating periods for a nuclear plant are when it's new, as the Vogtle plants will be, or when it's past its useful life.These are the long-term risks SO stock, and the southeastern U.S. economy, are running as construction on the plants continues. SO Stock EarningsSouthern reported earnings May 1. Earnings per share were in line with estimates at 70 cents. Meanwhile, revenue came in a bit low at $5.4 billion instead of the expected $5.8 billion. This isn't great, as revenues generally peak in the first quarter, which covers the winter, and the third quarter, which covers the summer.SO stock fell about 1.7% on the news.Analysts don't seem to know what to think of the risk-reward balance for so, with 13 of 21 just saying hold, against 2 buyers and 5 sellers. We'll see how that changes in light of Q1 earnings, however.The dividend is one of the highest in the utility sector, but most stock buyers today want risk and utilities, by their nature, are not risky investments.The red light flashing on Southern remains the debt, used to finance the nuclear power plants. It totaled $40.5 billion at the end of 2018. That debt load must be matched against the company's equity value, $54.3 billion. Its bonds currently yield about 4.6%, close to the stock's yield. The Bottom LineA recent analyst report on Southern said it offered &quot;short-term gain and long-term pain.&quot; That's about right.Southern stock has been the best-performing among the big southeastern utilities this year, outpacing NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Dominion and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). But the debt load is huge, and Southern has already sold $12 billion in assets to keep the bonds afloat, including its solar energy portfolio and Gulf Power, which serves Florida.For Southern stock and debt to pay off, the nuclear plants not only have to go online, but operate profitably, over decades, in an environment where solar and wind costs are continuing to decline.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away That's not a good bet for a risk-off investment.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-11,"It's a rare bit of good geopolitical news for the embattled Donald Trump administration. After threatening to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico due to the migration crisis, the White House announced a deal. In return for our southern neighbor taking more responsibility in curbing illegal immigration, the U.S. will cease economically punitive threats. Still, I wouldn't stop seeking protective stocks to buy.As The Wall Street Journal stated, Mexico has only temporarily avoided tariffs. Under the terms of the agreement, the U.S. will review Mexico's effectiveness in stemming the flow of Central American migrants. Technically in 90 days, the U.S. reserves the right to slap tariffs on if it feels the performance is inadequate.Plus, we all know how volatile and unpredictable President Trump is. It was just a few months back that political analysts voiced optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal. Now that situation quickly devolved from bad to worse, causing people to scramble for the best stocks to buy against a likely downturn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis segues into the ongoing trade war with the world's second-biggest economy. Trump is scheduled to meet his counterpart in the battle, Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the G-20 summit. Any hopes for a rapprochement was tempered when Trump declared that he would be &quot;perfectly happy&quot; to hit China with fresh tariffs.If these tensions weren't bad enough, our economy has other headwinds to consider. Recently, the dollar has weakened relative to other currencies. The yield curve inverted, which in the past signaled a recession. And of course, we have our own contentious political environment.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy That Yield 4% or More At the very least, we're facing choppy waters. But if the worst-case scenario of a recession occurs, here are the best stocks to buy: Stocks to Buy: Kimberly Clark (KMB)Source: Shutterstock For most Americans, a recession necessitates budgeting down to the essentials. While data suggests that consumers won't abandon all discretionary purchases such as cheap entertainment, the secular segment is where you want to aim. With that context, one of your best stocks to buy for a coming downturn is Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB).You may not immediately recognize the Kimberly Clark name, but you've certainly used their products. We're talking about brands like Kleenex, Huggies, and Cottonelle. No matter how volatile the markets get, or if the trade war takes an unexpectedly negative turn, you're still going to wipe yourself after you use the facilities. At least I hope you do, and that's what drives KMB stock.The other great point about the company is that its fundamentals match our assumptions. In other words, KMB stock levers recession-proof products, and the financials prove it. For instance, net income slipped in 2008, but the metric moved positively the following year.This just shows that when a recession strikes, the best stocks to buy are often the most obvious. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock I've been involved in a few blackout incidents. Certainly, they're not the biggest problems you encounter in life. At the same time, few inconveniences make you feel so useless and inadequate, especially in this digital age. That's why if we suffer a recession, you should peg Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) among your list of stocks to buy.The case for DUK stock is very straightforward: we all need energy to power our digitally connected lives. Even the most rural communities cannot afford to be cut off from vital energy sources. Sure, in a downturn, most folks skimp on purchases. But they absolutely cannot skimp on their utility bills. Doing so would be catastrophic in their journey to get back on their feet.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Similar to Kimberly Clark, DUK stock has the fundamental data to prove it belongs among the best stocks to buy for a coming recession. Back in 2008 through 2010, net income slipped badly against 2007's annual tally. However, in 2011, Duke decisively hit the recovery track, significantly exceeding 2007 figures. RCI Hospitality (RICK)Source: Edkohler via FlickrIf you want to pick out the best stocks to buy against a possible recession, you should keep it simple. That means going with names that have a proven track record, even when times are tough. With that context, I can't think of many better names than RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK).I get it: RICK stock generates controversy for its underlying hospitality business. But the stark reality is that the intimacy industry is at least recession-resilient, if not outright recession-proof. During the 2008 market crisis -- the worst such calamity since the October 1929 crash -- The New York Times reported on the phenomenon of $1,000 lap dances.Another factor that makes RICK stock an interesting idea is that shares haven't done so well this year. In fact, they're down more than 19% since January's opening price. Right now, the volatility is keeping conservative investors away. However, if a recession hits, RCI can easily make a case for its spot among the best stocks to buy. Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD)Source: Paul Sableman via FlickrA common entry among vice stocks to buy, Anheuser Busch (NYSE:BUD) owns several popular beer brands. These include Michelob Ultra, Budweiser and, of course, Bud Light.The latter is highly regarded for its usually hilarious commercials and not much else. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Bud Light is an abomination.But two interesting points make BUD stock an appealing proposition. In a recent beer survey, Bud Light ranked as America's favorite beer. Consumers apparently called it &quot;drinkable and refreshing,&quot; two words I would never use to describe Bud Light. But setting that aside, Anheuser Busch-branded beers represented the majority of America's top 10.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows My second point is that BUD stock could weather a recessionary storm better than most. Some scientific studies suggest that contrary to popular belief, troubled economic times could correlate with heavier drinking. If so, I'd keep a close eye on Anheuser Busch. AMC Entertainment (AMC)I have to admit that when AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) reported its disappointing first-quarter earnings report, it hit me hard. In fact, it was a double-whammy. Not only did I buy into AMC stock, but I suggested that contrarian investors do the same. Boy, do I have egg on my face for this one.And what exactly was my reasoning for getting involved with this loser? I believed that despite streaming services taking over the entertainment landscape, a viable place existed for the box office. Sure, streaming offers conveniences, but the cineplex provides a social experience that's still relevant to all demographics.Unfortunately, the timing just didn't work out for AMC stock.However, I'm not hitting the panic button despite the sharp losses. Here's why: back in the Great Recession, high-profile entertainment options such as professional sports experienced a noticeable decline in attendance. During the same period, consumers flocked to the movie theaters.In a recession, people want cheap entertainment to forget their troubles. That's what AMC provides, which is why I think it's one of the best stocks to buy if troubles hit. Waste Management (WM)Source: Shutterstock Author and financial guru Robert Kiyosaki once said that &quot;cash is trash.&quot; Waste disposal and solutions expert Waste Management (NYSE:WM) may want to adopt a similar statement as their marketing pitch: trash is cash.However, buying WM stock may seem counterintuitive if you're anticipating an economic correction. After all, people tend to buy less stuff during a recession. Moreover, cash-strapped folks tend to fix products that don't work or buy cheap hand-me-downs. Whatever the specifics, the result is fewer opportunities for Waste Management to advantage.But it's also fair to point out that WM stock is a secular investment. Even if the volume of trash decreases in a potential recession, it doesn't disappear altogether. The garbage truck will still come and perform their weekly ritual.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets More importantly, Waste Management recently acquired a rival in the space, Advanced Disposal, for $3 billion. With a major competitor out of the picture, WM utterly dominates the secular trash-disposal industry. This makes the equity a counterintuitive but viable candidate among stocks to buy for an economic slowdown. Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified)While we're on the topic of cash being trash, let's talk about gold. The yellow metal is perhaps the only thing we all agree with President Trump on: gold is good. Having more gold is better. I'll let you complete the logical sequence.The spot price for the monetary commodity spiked in late May, to no real surprise. The only shocking thing is that it took so long. We're mired in a deeply contentious political environment, both here and abroad. Furthermore, the dollar has weakened against a basket of international currencies, setting the stage for a stunning recovery.But if you don't want to own physical bullion, consider Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock.Barrick Gold consistently ranks at the top among commodity producers. Therefore, if you're going to take a shot in this always-risky segment, you should go with the best.Second, because Barrick is the leading producer, the GOLD stock price will likely have a strong correlation with the metal's spot price. In past years, that correlation was a liability. But with conditions ripe for a turnaround, Barrick stands to benefit substantially.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AMC stock and gold bullion.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended the White House take steps to protect the domestic production of uranium after finding the nation’s reliance on imports was a national security risk, said three people briefed on the matter.Among the trade remedies recommended is to require nuclear power plants to purchase a minimum of 5% of the radioactive fuel from U.S. mines, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public deliberations. Two of the people said an option under consideration would see the quota escalate by 5 percentage points a year.A decision to impose the quotas would be a boon to the two small mining companies that petitioned the Commerce Department to take action, Energy Fuels Inc. and Ur-Energy Inc. The move would increase costs for nuclear reactor operators that are already struggling in the face of competition from cheaper sources of power generated by natural gas and renewables. Domestic nuclear providers rose on the news, with Uranium Energy Corp. up as much as 3.9%, Energy Fuels rising as much as 3.5% and Ur-Energy paring earlier losses to rise less than 1%.The Commerce Department concluded in April that the imports harmed national security, delivering a confidential report on the matter to the White House at the time, the people said.The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Commerce Department declined to comment on the contents of the uranium report and said it is at the White House. Confidential MeetingThe recommendations have yet to be presented to President Donald Trump, and a meeting on the matter between him and advisers on the issue that had been scheduled for Thursday was delayed, two people said.The matter is far from final, but one person said it is certain that the White House appears poised to take action. Other options being considered include doing nothing or putting limits on uranium from specific countries, one of the people said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met with Trump on Thursday, was expected to make the case against import quotas on uranium, which his country produces.The Trump administration was asked by the two domestic uranium producers to impose a 25% domestic market quota on the grounds imports of uranium are a threat to national security. Wide Latitude A finding that the imports of uranium are harming U.S. national security gives Trump wide latitude to impose a trade remedy of his choosing -- or do nothing at all -- using the same trade law the administration has successfully used to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.While the domestic uranium producers, both of which are based in Colorado, initially asked the administration for a 25% quota, a lower amount could be a compromise that he utilities and the producers could live with, analysts have said.Nuclear utilities, which have estimated a 25% quota could cost them as much as $800 million annually, remain hopeful Trump will decide against any trade action.“President Trump is a longstanding champion for the U.S. nuclear industry, rightly recognizing the enormous economic and energy benefits that U.S. nuclear power delivers to American consumers,” said the Ad Hoc Utilities Group, which counts Exelon Corp., Duke Energy Corp., and Dominion Energy Inc. as members. “The U.S. nuclear industry supports 100,000 jobs while the two petitioners support a total of 150 jobs.” Australia, RussiaCurrently, the nuclear power industry gets nearly all of its uranium from sources such as Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia.The U.S. uranium industry produced roughly 700,000 pounds in 2018, according to Chris Gadomski, a nuclear industry analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A 5% quota would translate to between 2 million and 2.5 million pounds, he said.The two miners who petitioned for the case have already begun expanding their mines in anticipation of a favorable decision.Executives from both companies said in a statement they were pleased “the administration continues to recognize the unique national, energy and economic security role of domestic uranium production.”“We continue to believe that reserving 25% of domestic demand for U.S. uranium is the most effective tool for sustaining domestic production of this critical mineral,” they said.

2019-07-30,"Editor's Note: This story was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated and republished.No matter where we are in the cycle, it's always good to remind ourselves of what worked and what didn't. In 2017 Wall Street forecasted a rough year but ended with quite the opposite happening. Benchmark indices hit all-time records, while most sectors witnessed tremendous optimism.In 2018, the long-running bull market took a breather as investors switched from risk-on to risk-off. Occasionally, inferior investment strategies are masked by secular bullishness.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year so far has only been a little forgiving and that might not las, which is why I'm recommending investors to get selective. Fortunately, with dividend stocks, you don't have to feel pressured into always picking winners.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels At its core, choosing the right dividend stocks to buy is about options. Although picking high-flying growth companies is a sexier endeavor, it isn't always the smartest. With passive-income yielding firms, you get the potential for making capital gains, and also residual payouts to bolster your position. During a down period, dividends can also help you ride out the storm.But don't mistake these yields as &quot;boring&quot; strategies. Like any investment class, you can dial up the risk for the chance of greater rewards. This is why picking the most appropriate dividends stocks to buy is so important: no one knows your investment style better than you!The following ideas are broken down into three sections: stable, mid-level and high-yield (speculative). Each section has something to offer, depending on how much risk you're willing to take. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Current Dividend Yield: 2.86%If you love stable dividend stocks, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy. It is the powerhouse brand of powerhouse brands. Better yet, JNJ is levered toward the ultimate in secular industries: healthcare. Separated among consumer-level products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, JNJ is one of the most respected companies in the world.Source: Shutterstock Currently, Johnson & Johnson's dividend yield is 2.74%. But what people may not immediately appreciate is that JNJ can also surprise people in the capital markets. For instance, year-to-date, shares are up nearly 5%.Critically for the conservative investor, JNJ rarely loses. Between 1970 to the end of 2018, annual returns average almost 15%. Moreover, JNJ only hit red ink 14 times, meaning that 72% of the time, you can expect shares to win.In our business, that's as close to a sure thing as you're gonna get! Wells Fargo (WFC)Current Dividend Yield: 4.23%I'll admit that I wasn't thrilled about putting Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) into my dividend stocks to buy list. You'll recall that WFC was embroiled in a major controversy that shocked the entire financial and business community. Essentially, the banking giant admitted to creating more than two million fake accounts to meet ambitious sales targets.Source: Shutterstock It made me sick and I'm not the only one. But eventually, people get over this stuff, perhaps resigned to the fact that the major conglomerates always win. I even made the argument that Equifax Inc (NYSE:EFX) -- yes, that Equifax -- would be forgiven.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek As cynical as it may sound, what good will being angry do for any of us? Today Equifax is just around 10 percent of pre-scandal highs and Wells Fargo just about 10% off and climbing back.It stinks that the ultra-rich get away with bloody murder. From a financial perspective, though, WFC is an opportunity. It's slowly making recovery inroads. Most important, WFC spits out the biggest dividend yield among the &quot;big four&quot; at more than 4%. That may be the price of forgiveness! Exxon Mobil (XOM)Current Dividend Yield: 4.62%Again, on the surface level, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is a strange name to put on a &quot;best dividend stocks&quot; list. Energy is hardly the most consistent sector. More to the point, XOM has been on the wrong end of a market shake-up. Since the oil collapse of 2014, XOM has at best been treading water against prior highs.Source: Shutterstock But the flip side to this bearish argument is that in practical ways, energy is the most consistent sector possible. When people hit the switch, they expect the lights to turn on. Similarly, when they go to the gasoline station, they expect to fill their tanks. Without XOM and its ilk, none of these things would occur. A societal breakdown could commence.In all seriousness, investors should be encouraged by Exxon Mobil's response to the oil market downturn. They and the remaining survivors have revamped their operations and rid themselves of unproductive assets. Today, XOM and the oil community are leaner, meaner, and better prepared for whatever lies ahead.In other words, XOM has proven its resilience adding another 6.3% since the beginning of the year. As a conservative investor, you can buy that 4.6% yield with confidence. Duke Energy (DUK)Current Dividend Yield: 4.31%If you're a real numbers guy, you'll want to pay attention to Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Based on a quantitative model that our own Louis Navellier developed, DUK is one of the best dividend stocks to buy right now. Mixing in commonly-used metrics (ie. earnings momentum) as well propriety methods, DUK appears primed for a stellar new year.Source: Shutterstock I prefer to keep it simple if there's no real need to complicate things. Here's what I'm looking at: Since the tech bubble and the 2008 financial crisis, DUK has steadily rewarded investors with few hiccups. This year, DUK is set to return more than 13% should its technical momentum hold.All indications suggest that Duke Energy can keep the good times flowing into next year. As it stands, the company is the seventh-largest electric utility company in the U.S. Furthermore, management has retired many of its coal power plants, focusing instead on natural gas and cleaner energy sources.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Currently, DUK stock yields slightly more than 4%. Although slightly riskier than your conservative dividend play, Duke Energy has the right balance between stability and income. AT&T (T)Current Dividend Yield: 5.94%I have to say that AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) disappointed me this year in the capital markets. Typically, AT&T is like clockwork, more often than not, you know what you're getting. This year was the anomaly.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrT stock dropped like a rock last year but struggled back to recover its losses and then some, adding a little more than 16% so far this year.Keep in mind that between 1984 through 2016, AT&T's annual returns average more than 13%. During this time, T stock has only lost eight times out of 33. AT&T is a winner almost 75% of the time.Like the aforementioned JNJ, at this rate, T stock is practically a sure thing. The only difference is the reward. AT&T offers a whopping 5.94% dividend yield! Welltower Inc (WELL)Current Dividend Yield: 4.16%It's always a little amusing to see a generation come of age. The news flash that everyone else knows instinctively is that time stops for no one; &quot;youth is wasted on the young.&quot;Source:  sima dimitric via FlickrWith that harsh reality in mind, I bring to you Welltower (NYSE:WELL). WELL stock is a real estate investment trust specializing in senior care and facilities. Even if you're one of the young millennials who see no use for Welltower, you still might put your parents into one of their centers.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Joking aside, I can think of no other business where revenues are virtually guaranteed, save for a funeral home. Although Welltower's market performance has been a little choppy, in the long haul, Welltower has been a steady investment.Of course, we can't forget the dividend yields, which for WELL stands at 4.16%. Blackstone Group (BX)Current Dividend Yield: 4.25%Moving on to the speculative side of dividend stocks, we have Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX). If you were to simply assess BX based on this year's performance alone, Blackstone wouldn't seem at all risky. On a YTD basis, BX gained nearly 62%, making it a solid performer.Source: Shutterstock Typically, strong capital returns and high yields don't go together. With a dividend yield of 3.25%, Blackstone's passive income is right around the same as an average mutual fund. So what gives?Let's just say that BX will probably never make the list of best &quot;feel good&quot; stocks. The financial firm has been involved in a number of controversies, ranging from scandalous real-estate practices to shadow banking. It's really one of those profit-at-all-costs kind of companies. But hey, who said Wall Street was a friendly place? Kimco Realty Corp (KIM)Current Dividend Yield: 5.92%I will tell you straight up that anything involving brick-and-mortar retail is a risky game. Earlier this year, I cautioned my readers about investing in retail REITs. With overall declining foot-traffic, the physical retail space doesn't have the appeal it once did. Of course, the most important factor is ecommerce. Why sit in traffic and wait in lines when you can shop conveniently at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)?Source: Shutterstock The flip side to this argument is that there are some retail sectors that Amazon has trouble ousting. For instance, most people find it more convenient to size their clothing at a physical apparel shop than guessing online.In addition, some store brands offer better pricing or a better experience than Amazon. Think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY).  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio A retail REIT that focuses on strong brands just might have a chance, hence Kimco (NYSE:KIM). KIM features multiple properties running highly demanded store brands. Moreover, a good chunk of their properties are located in lucrative markets.Will it be enough to overcome the risk to the entire sector? I'm not so sure, which helps explain Kimco's 6.16% dividend yield. If you're a believer, KIM stock gives you a solid opportunity. Sotherly Hotels Inc (SOHO)Current Dividend Yield: 7.42%Thanks to the abundance of consumer-level technologies, traditional industries face obsolescence. A decade ago, if you needed to go to the airport, you essentially had to call a cab. Now, with ride-sharing apps like Uber or Lyft, you can request a similar service conveniently through your smartphone.Source:  Anders Jilden via UnsplashA similar upheaval may occur in the hotel industry, thanks to apps like Airbnb. To survive in this rough-and-tumble sector, you need a fresh approach. Sotherly Hotels (NASDAQ:SOHO) just might have the magic formula. Centered largely in the southern region of the U.S., SOHO provides an authentic, unique experience for its guests.Apparently, most millennials want brands to be more authentic, and that fits SOHO to a T. Visit any of their locations, and you feel like a welcomed member of a community, not some room number. Plus, former NFL star Herschel Walker sits on the board of directors. That's just downright awesome!But will any of this matter for investors? Again, it's a tough call given so many changes in the hospitality and services sector. Still, with a 7.42% dividend yield, SOHO is worth a second look.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- As tropical storm Barry roared ashore in Louisiana last month, Entergy Corp. monitored the electric grid using airwaves that have long been reserved for utilities and first responders.Those secure, wireless signals helped the company manage outages, even while winds of up to 65 miles (105 kilometers) per hour lashed the region. But as the world becomes increasingly wireless, U.S. regulators plan to open more of those airwaves to tech companies.The move pits two of the most powerful U.S. industries against each other. Tech giants including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. contend the airwaves, in the 6 gigahertz range, should be open for use by the next generation of lightning-fast wireless networks. Utilities say the new networks threaten to create interference that could make it harder to keep the lights on.“Opening the 6 GHz band to unlicensed users could cause interference with our signals and could jeopardize the reliability of our communications network,&quot; said Mike Twomey, a senior vice president for federal policy and government affairs for New Orleans-based Entergy.As wires increasingly go the way of rotary phones, nearly every industry is trying to push into underused spectrum space. The number of Wi-Fi hotspots globally is forecast to grow sixfold by 2021 as fifth-generation, or 5G, cellular networks take shape to underpin everything from autonomous vehicles to industrial robots, according to the Federal Communications Commission. That means opening more space on the radio spectrum.The airwaves in the 6 gigahertz range used by utilities, pipeline operators, police and fire departments and others happen to be ideally positioned on the spectrum to accommodate 5G networks. Tech and telecom companies say technology exists to open them up without interfering with emergency services.“It’s no longer feasible for a band like this with so much potential for sharing to remain with existing incumbents and no additional usage,” said Alice Tornquist, vice president of spectrum strategy and technology policy at Qualcomm Inc., the chip giant.Facebook declined to comment. Apple did not respond.FCC PriorityThe debate comes as the FCC is under orders from Congress to open up more airwaves for broadband service. The move “could be a big boost to our nation’s 5G future,” the agency’s Chairman Ajit Pai said last year as it proposed the change.Aside from their concerns about interference, utilities say the FCC seems to be rushing its proposal through.“Keeping the 6 GHz band is critical to the reliability of the electric grid,” said Joy Ditto, who heads the Washington-based Utilities Technology Council. “There’s no ready replacement.”Neil Grace, an FCC spokesman, said opening those airwaves “will allow a valuable spectrum resource to be more intensively used to benefit consumers.” The move, he said, would not cause interruptions for existing users.A spokeswoman for Duke Energy Corp., however, said the FCC’s proposed approach would not shield utilities from harmful interference. “Any benefit from the expansion of the band would be outweighed by the threat of interference to electric utilities’ communications systems,” Duke’s Catherine Butler said.Congress WatchingThe debate has spilled into Congress. In June, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, expressed concerns about the move in a letter to Pai. “The communication assets installed on the power grid are designed to ensure reliability,” she wrote. “It is important to recognize that electricity service in a region cannot be compromised in an effort to make 6GHz more broadly available.’’The issue has spurred calls for more coordination between the FCC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees utilities. FERC Commissioner Bernard McNamee said it’s crucial that both agencies apply the same standards when it comes to communications used by utilities. “The consequences of confusion could be detrimental to the electric grid and ultimately the American people,” he said in an email.Under a worst-case scenario, utilities may be forced to switch to laying expensive fiber wire to replace wireless communications, according to Entergy, which owns utilities serving Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. That could cost customers tens of millions of dollars, Twomey said.“If the FCC plans to move forward on this, we want it tested and want to be part of the testing to make sure the interference can be mitigated,’’ said Brian O’Hara, senior director of regulatory issues at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.(Adds utility statement from Duke Energy in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Todd Shields and David R.

2019-08-21,"[Editor's note: This story was published in July 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]Utility stocks were supposed to be yesterday's favorite investment. The theory regarding utility stocks was simple: Robust economic growth coupled with a full labor market was supposed to spark rising inflation.The Fed was supposed to fight rising inflation with rate hikes. Fixed income yields were supposed to rise. Utility stocks, which were long viewed as bond substitutes in an era of ultra-low interest rates, were supposed to fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that theory hasn't fully materialized into reality.The result? Utility stocks haven't lost their shine. With inflation relatively contained and investors ducking into safety, stocks in utilities are still attractive assets to own for dividend yield hunters. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund(NYSE: XLU), a utilities ETF, has jumped  13.5% in 2019.The markets' recent volatility has contributed to the XLU's gain, as investors flee toward any safe haven. Not to mention, a number of other catalysts are in play.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Inflation isn't soaring higher because technology giants are suppressing inflationary pressures (just think about the downward pressure Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is putting on all consumer goods prices). This trend won't reverse any time soon, and thus, inflationary pressures should remain subdued for the foreseeable future. With those forces subdued, utility stocks have room to rally.With that said, what are the best utility stocks to buy for your portfolio? Here's a list of five stocks that I think are worth a look: American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Considered one of the industry's heavyweights, American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is a massive electric utility company that delivers electricity to more than five million customers across eleven states.Over the past three months, AEP stock is up 4.8% and it's up a whopping 24% year to date.The business right now is doing pretty well, as robust economic strength in the company's core markets has boosted the business. Overall, sales and earnings are both trending higher at a healthy rate. Sempra Energy (SRE)Source: Shutterstock   Another one of the industry's heavyweights is Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), the multi-faceted energy company that provides energy services to more than 40 million customers globally across Southern California, Texas, Chile and Peru. In 2019, SRE stock is up nearly 31%. Sempra's business is doing well: Both revenues and earnings are trending higher amid a favorable economic backdrop.Plus, the company is continuing its energy diversification efforts by expanding its liquid natural gas (LNG) business, something which the company feels can help fuel sustainable long-term growth.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The dividend yield on SRE stock sits right around 2.8%. That isn't great, but it's right around where the yield has been over the past several years. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock Next up is electric power and gas utility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Much like the other names on this list, Duke's operations are stable and healthy. That said, DUK stock is up more than 7% year-to-date with a dividend yield of 4.15%.Business remains fine, mostly thanks to favorable weather and strengthening economic conditions. And Duke's revenues and earnings have been trending consistently higher at a slow and stable rate.This level of growth should persist for the next several years as economic conditions remain solid. American Water Works Company (AWK)Source: Shutterstock Although electricity and power are very important utilities, another utility of equal importance is water, and that is where American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) comes into the picture.American Water provides waters services to 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. That makes American Water the largest and most diverse publicly traded water company.Moreover, American Water is planning on spending a whole bunch of money over the next several years to modernize water distribution infrastructure, an investment that will likely lead to rate hike approvals and robust long-term earnings growth.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On AWK stock has a dividend yield of 1.62%. That isn't great. But, what the company lacks in dividend yield, it makes up for in earnings growth, which should be able to run around 10%-per-year for the next several years. It's already up nearly 40% this year. That combination of healthy earnings growth and stable yield should make AWK stock a winning investment. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Perhaps the utility stock with the most long-term earnings-growth potential on this list is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). That is because not only does NextEra operate a massive utility business like the other utility players on this list, but the company is also a leading player in renewable energy and battery storage.Over the past decade, this company has grown earnings and dividends at an 8%-per-year clip, and that robust growth should continue so long as the company's renewable business continues to scale.The one thing to be worried about when it comes to NEE stock is that the dividend yield is at 2.4%, which is a five-year low. But earnings growth is robust, and it is large enough to compensate for a historically low dividend yield.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and AWK.

2019-08-30,"Utility stocks and funds are in a fortuitous position right now. Investors tend to seek them out when recession fears creep (like they are right now), and they also tend to perform well when interest rates decline.Several countries have shown signs of economic weakness, sparking worries about a global recession. The U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't helped, blunting the growth of the planet's two largest economies. And Derek Horstmeyer, an assistant finance professor at George Mason University, points out what many experts have said about the yield curve's recent inversion. Namely, he calls it a &quot;strong signal that we are in the late stages of economic expansion and may indeed be headed for a recession within the next 18 months.&quot; That's a boon to safe-haven sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, as what they produce is always in demand, no matter what the economy is doing. Utility stocks, with their high returns on assets and high dividends, should be considered given that they &quot;tend to do well in late-cycle periods,&quot; Horstmeyer says.The utility sector also is attractive as interest rates fall, says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. &quot;The dividend yield on the utility sector is especially attractive in this abnormally low-interest-rate environment as the yields on utility stocks exceed the yields on long-term U.S. government debt by a substantial margin,&quot; he says.Here are 11 utility stocks and fund to buy for safety and income.

2019-09-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Dorian, working its way up the U.S. East Coast, is nearing Georgia and the Carolinas after sweeping past Florida with nowhere near the force it brought to bear killing at least 20 people in the Bahamas.Dorian brought life-threatening storm surges as it reached about 105 miles (170 kilometers) south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said in an 2 a.m. New York time advisory. The storm’s sustained winds strengthened to 115 miles per hour, regaining Category 3 status.The hurricane’s first landfall in the U.S. could come near Wilmington, North Carolina, or further up the coast on the Outer Banks, said Thomas Downs, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics in New York. There’s a chance Dorian could strengthen, he said.“Right now the system is starting to tighten up,” Downs said. The storm was moving northward at about 7 mph, according to the advisory, with the center of Dorian expected to approach the South Carolina coast on Thursday morning.Meanwhile, the Bahamas is starting to assess the damage from the strongest storm to hit the island nation in modern history, with Prime Minister Hubert Minnis confirming in a press conference at least 20 people have died on Abaco Island, with that number expected to increase, according to the Bahamas Press.President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency in North Carolina, clearing the way for U.S. disaster relief. With the storm widening out, “coastal areas of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina will likely receive stronger winds than Florida,” Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at the Weather Co., an IBM business, said in an email.South Carolina, he said, “may receive a foot of rain.”The hurricane couldn’t be arriving at a worse time for farmers in the region raising cotton, tobacco, hemp and corn. Fields were maturing and high winds could deal a potentially devastating blow before farmers have a chance to harvest.In the Bahamas, meanwhile, waters were receding on Thursday from a storm surge that reached 23 feet at times during the two days Dorian sat over the archipelago. Minnis said he expects the death toll to rise, noting in a news conference that parts of Abaco -- the area first hit by the storm -- have been “decimated” with “severe damage to homes, businesses and other buildings and infrastructure.”Minnis said in a tweet that he spoke with Trump and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who both pledged assistance to Grand Bahama and Abaco. The damage wrought upon the islands is likely to run into “hundreds of millions if not billions,” the Nassau Guardian newspaper cited Deputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest as saying. Large tracts of homes are under water, and the government intends to make formal appeals for assistance, he said. Outbreaks of looting are adding to the country’s misery.As Dorian lumbered north, power companies in the Southeast scrambled to prepare.Duke Energy Corp, which owns several utilities in the region, released out-of-state workers it had dispatched to Florida in advance of the storm and instead readied crews in the Carolinas. Santee Cooper, which supplies power to 2 million people in South Carolina, has a crew of more than 800 standing by for recovery efforts. The company estimates as many as 700,000 could lose power from the storm.Cities further up the coast were preparing. Sandbags have been distributed in Charleston and the city encouraged some residents to park their vehicles on higher ground. The city council also approved an emergency order to enact a curfew, should one be necessary, according to a tweet. Local and state governments in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas have ordered coastline residents and businesses to begin evacuations.“Please listen to and follow all evacuation orders,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a statement announcing a mandatory evacuation order for the state’s tourist-friendly coast. “We have seen the life and death effects of this storm in the Bahamas, and we urge everyone on the islands at the coast to leave.”Looking forward, the storm will sweep by Cape Cod in Massachusetts over the weekend, where it could bring tropical storm conditions, the National Weather Service said.To map assets in Hurricane Dorian’s path, click here.(Updates storm’s intensity and location.)&#92;--With assistance from Sharon Cho, David R.

2019-11-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Flooding rains, heavy snows and gusty winds across the U.S. are disrupting travel on one of the busiest days of the year and threatening to keep Thanksgiving Day parade balloons from flying.Two large storms are sweeping the nation, causing widespread travel problems as close to 55 million people are expected to take to the roads and air, according to AAA. Areas around Denver received 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) of snow, causing treacherous road conditions.Both coasts, meanwhile, are facing their own weather issues. In New York City, winds could reach 25 miles per hour on Thursday, threatening to ground the massive balloons at Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade. In Oregon and California, a powerful Pacific Ocean storm is threatening to bring snow by the foot across the Sierra Nevadas and torrential rains to southern California that could touch off mudslides, said Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.“Where it is not snow, it is going to be very windy,” said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. “In a place like Chicago they are already seeing wind gusts of 50 miles per hour. Those winds will spread eastward tonight and tomorrow.”High winds have already knocked out power to more than 204,000 homes and businesses in the Midwest and another 77,000 in Northern California, according to utility websites. Duke Energy Corp.’s Indiana utility was among the hardest hit, with more than 15,000 customers down, according to a spokeswoman.New York is forecast to be warm and rainy Wednesday before the sun and wind arrive Thursday as ground crews use ropes to guide huge balloons through the heart of Manhattan. “The Macy’s balloons will be a concern,” Hurley said.New York has had regulations in place since 1997 that will determine on Thursday whether the balloon, which float as high as 60 feet, are safe to fly. The regulations ban flight in sustained winds of 23 mph, or with gusts of 34 mph, according to the New York Times.More than 100 U.S. flights were canceled Wednesday, according to the website for FlightAware. Treacherous road conditions contributed to at least one fatal accident, when three tractor-trailers and a pickup truck collided on Interstate 70 west of Denver, according to state police.In California, snow could fall at lower elevations, making travel along Interstate 5 -- a north-south artery -- difficult.“There will certainly be impacts in both air and ground travel in a lot of California,” AccuWeather’s Pydynowski said.A complex national weather map:(Adds power outages in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Martin.To contact the reporters on this story: Vincent Del Giudice in Denver at vdelgiudice@bloomberg.net;Brian K.

The best retirement stocks to buy, then - whether you're buying in 2019 or any other year - must be quality dividend payers that can help meet both of those goals in the long-term.Unlike many fixed-income investments, numerous dividend stocks offer relatively high yields, grow their payouts each year and appreciate in price over time as their businesses generate more profits and become more valuable.Not all dividends are safe, however. From General Electric (GE) and Owens & Minor (OMI) to L Brands (LB) and Buckeye Partners LP (BPL), several high-profile dividend-payers slashed their payouts in 2018, sending their stock prices tumbling. So the dividend stocks you depend on must be chosen with care.These are the 19 best retirement stocks to buy for 2019. Research firm Simply Safe Dividends developed a Dividend Safety Score system that has helped investors avoid more than 98% of dividend cuts, including each of those companies listed above. The 19 stocks on this list have solid Dividend Safety Scores and generous yields near 4% or higher, making them appealing retirement stocks for income.

2020-01-02,"Duke Energy Corp.  announced Thursday an agreement with North Carolina state regulators and community groups to permanently close all of electric company's remaining nine coal ash basins in the state. Under the agreed upon plan, Duke said about 80 million tons of ash will be excavated from the sites, and be moved to lined landfills. &quot;The agreement calls for expedited state permit approvals which would keep projects on a rapid timeline with excavation at the six sites completed in 10 to 15 years,&quot; Duke said in a statement. The plan will reduce the estimated cost to close the nine coal ash basins by about $1.5 billion, as compared with the previous order from North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality requiring full excavation. As a result, the cost to permanently close all ash basins in the Carolinas is now estimated at $8 billion to $9 billion, of which about $2.4 billion has been spent through 2019, with the rest expected to be spend over the next 15 to 20 years.

2020-01-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Duke Energy Corp. reached a settlement with North Carolina regulators and environmentalists to close its remaining coal ash ponds in the state, ending a long-running fight over cleaning up waste from power plants.The settlement announced Thursday, which saves the company about $1.5 billion, requires Duke to remove nearly 80 million tons of coal ash. Seven basins will be fully excavated, and the waste will be shipped to lined landfills to prevent groundwater contamination. Two other sites will be partially excavated.The deal ends a legal dispute with the state, which in April ordered the utility to excavate all the ponds. Duke’s savings come from avoiding a full excavation at two sites, where lined landfills were built atop capped ash ponds. Duke estimated in April that excavating all of its ash basins across North and South Carolina would cost about $10.5 billion.“This agreement significantly reduces the cost to close our coal ash basins in the Carolinas for our customers, while delivering the same environmental benefits as full excavation,” Stephen De May, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president, said in a statement.Under the settlement, Duke’s cleanup is expected to take 15 to 20 years and cost $8 billion to $9 billion across North the Carolinas, including $2.4 billion that’s already been spent.Most coal ash left over from burning the fuel is stored at power plants, either in dry landfills or ponds. The sites -- which contain arsenic, boron, lead and other toxins -- are considered hazardous by environmentalists who say they pollute ground water. The settlement announced Thursday was negotiated in part by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has long pushed for cleaning up coal ash ponds in the U.S. Southeast.“This agreement is the culmination of nine years of work by communities across North Carolina and puts in place the most extensive coal ash cleanup in the nation,” Frank Holleman, senior attorney at the center, said in a statement.Duke shares fell as much as 1.3% as the utility sector at large declined. Nonetheless, Guggenheim Securities analysts led by Shahriar Pourreza said the settlement was positive for the company and expressed optimism that regulators would allow Duke to recover the clean-up costs from customers.“Bottom line: this helps to remove the (North Carolina) coal ash overhang that certainly was a headline concern for many investors,” Pourreza said in a research note.To contact the reporters on this story: David R.

The best retirement stocks to buy in 2020 (or any other year), then, assuredly must be dividend-paying ones.Receiving regular dividends reduces an investor's dependence on the market's fickle price swings to make ends meet. Whether or not the market rises or falls in 2020, a portfolio of quality businesses can continue delivering predictable, growing dividend income.Compared to many fixed-income investments, dividend stocks also can generate higher current income in today's low-interest-rate environment, growing their payouts each year to help preserve one's purchasing power. Dividend stocks, like other equities, provide meaningful long-term price appreciation potential as well.Research firm Simply Safe Dividends published an in-depth guide about living on dividends in retirement here. However, a key component to this strategy is finding the best retirement stocks that can deliver safe dividends and grow in value over time.On that note, these are the 20 best retirement stocks to buy in 2020.

2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Bonnie Rippingille looked out at the wisps of steam curling from the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant across Biscayne Bay with a sense of dread. In December federal regulators approved Florida Power & Light Co.’s request to let the facility’s twin nuclear reactors remain in operation for another 20 years beyond the end of their current licenses. By that point they’ll be 80, making them the oldest reactors in operation anywhere in the world.“That’s too old,” said Rippingille, a lawyer and retired Miami-Dade County judge who was wearing a blue print shirt with white sea turtles on it. “They weren’t designed for this purpose.”With backing from the Trump administration, utilities across the nation are preparing to follow suit, seeking permission to extend the life of reactors built in the 1970s to the 2050s as they run up against the end of their 60-year licenses.Read More: Nuclear Reactors Could Run as Long as 80 Years Under Trump Plan“We are talking about running machines that were designed in the 1960s, constructed in the 1970s and have been operating under the most extreme radioactive and thermal conditions imaginable,” said Damon Moglen, an official with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “There is no other country in the world that is thinking about operating reactors in the 60 to 80-year time frame.”Indeed, the move comes as other nations shift away from atomic power over safety concerns, despite its appeal as a carbon-free alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Japan, which used to get more than a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power, shut down all its plants in 2011 after a tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown at three reactors in Fukushima. Only a handful have restarted while others that can’t meet stringent new standards are slated to close permanently. Germany decided that year to shutter its entire fleet by 2022 and is now having trouble meeting its ambitious climate goals. Other nations such as France and Sweden are allowing reactors to retire while they diversify into solar and wind power.By contrast, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is poised to decide this year on requests by subsidiaries of Exelon Corp. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles from Washington, and Dominion Energy Inc. to extend the life of two nuclear reactors at a power plant in Surry, Virginia.Dominion has notified the commission it intends to ask permission to extend the life of two more reactors north of Richmond, Virginia. Duke Energy Corp. has said it plans to seek license extensions for its entire fleet of 11 nuclear reactors, starting with three in Seneca, South Carolina.“There are economic benefits,” said Rounette Nader, Duke’s director of nuclear license renewal. “Continuing to operate our existing nuclear fleet is cheaper than replacing it.”The nuclear industry has been buffeted by a wave of early reactor retirements in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and subsidized renewable power. Constructing a new nuclear plant—the only one being built in the U.S. is years behind schedule and over budget—can cost billions of dollars. Retrofitting an existing one is more likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.Read More: America to Decide Whether a Nuke Can Outlive a Human “It just makes sense,” said Maria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington-based trade group that represents nuclear utilities. “I don’t think you should look at a plant just on calendar years, but rather the way that plant has been maintained, so many components have been replaced over the years. There is nothing magic about 80.”Critics such as Edwin Lyman, a nuclear energy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, argue that older plants contain “structures that can’t be replaced or repaired,” including the garage-sized steel reactor vessels that contain tons of nuclear fuel and can grow brittle after years of being bombarded by radioactive neutrons. “They just get older and older,” he said. If the vessel gets brittle, it becomes vulnerable to cracking or even catastrophic failure. That risk increases if it’s cooled down too rapidly—say in the case of a disaster, when cold water must be injected into the core to prevent a meltdown.Other concerns surround the durability of components such as concrete and electric cables, but an advisory board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent government agency that gave Turkey Point the green light to operate into the 2050s, said those risks could be managed safely “without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.”The commission’s decision doesn’t sit well with Philip Stoddard, a bespectacled biology professor who serves as the mayor of South Miami, a city of 13,000 on about 18 miles away from the Turkey Point plant. He keeps a store of potassium iodide, used to prevent thyroid cancer, large enough to provide for every child in his city should the need arise.“You’ve got hurricanes, you’ve got storm surge, you’ve got increasing risks of hurricanes and storm surge,” said Stoddard, 62, from the corner office in a biology building on Florida International University’s palm-tree lined campus. All of this not only increases the likelihood of a nuclear disaster, it also complicates a potential evacuation, which could put even more lives at risk. “Imagine being in a radiation cloud in your car and you’re sitting there running out of gas because you’re in a parking lot in the freeway,” he said.Gabriel Ignetti, a 72-year-old Miami resident and retired music teacher, views nuclear power as a lesser evil than climate change and welcomes extending the life of the plant. “We have a climate emergency,” he said, “and if you have a climate emergency you can’t say we are not going to use that tool.”That’s a point backers also highlight to make the case for extending the lives of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and about 55% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Climate change is also one of the main cases against extending the life of Turkey Point, said Kelly Cox, the general counsel for Miami Waterkeeper, a six-person environmental group that has joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth to challenge the NRC’s approval in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. New data show sea level rise in the area reach as high as 4.5 feet by 2070, but regulators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission didn’t take those updated figures into account, said Cox.“They are going to be flooded,” Cox said. “If we are relicensing a major utility we need to be preparing for the impacts of sea level rise.”Scott Burnell, a NRC spokesman, said the agency’s review process did take into account the most recent information available on sea level rise, but that “the projected rate of sea level rise and associated revisions in flood hazard are slow enough that the plants will have ample time to appropriately analyze and address possible future effects.”Read More: U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Weren’t Built for Climate ChangeOther concerns exist about the condition of the plant’s unlined earthen cooling canals, a unique system that sprawls over nearly six thousand acres. Salty water from the canals is leaking underground toward the Biscayne aquifer, the source of drinking water for about 3 million Floridians, at a rate of about a foot a day, Cox said.Peter Robbins, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc., said the utility is addressing that problem using a series of pumps to decrease the salinity in the cooling canals. The main power plant and its critical component are elevated 20 feet above sea level and are protected by concrete and reinforced buildings designed to withstand hurricanes and floods.“At the end of the day it’s a very clean, reliable source of electricity,” Robbins said. “More than anything we think this is a win for our customers. It helps keep their reliability high, it helps keep their bills low, and there are no greenhouse gases as part of nuclear.”In the city of Homestead, not far from the Turkey Point plant, Brian Goodwin, a burly 52-year-old farmer, said he didn’t believe in climate change, but supports the reactors’ extension nonetheless. “I hope they build another one,” said Goodwin. “It’s good clean power.”(Updates location of the challenge petition in the 17th paragraph; corrects Edwin Lyman’s name in the 11th paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Ari Natter in Washington at anatter5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanJillian GoodmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The U.S. May Soon Have the World's Oldest Nuclear Power Plants

2020-03-27,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utilities have lined up more than $15 billion in cash and credit as uncertainty over the coronavirus strains the short-term debt market.Electricity giants including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. have sold bonds, entered into new credit facilities or drawn on existing lines to boost liquidity. It follows a surge in costs in the commercial paper market, forcing companies to look for alternatives.“We expect to continue to see utilities drawing on credit lines,” Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in a research note, citing AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement announced Monday. The move is a conservative stance to shore up funds, he said. “We do not see it in any way a sign of overall liquidity risk.”Utilities have also benefited from their defensive nature to issue new debt as the corporate bond market has been open mostly to the highest-quality investment-grade issuers. Banks have enjoyed similar status in comprising much of the recent supply, as well as frequent telecom and media issuers including Verizon Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp.New York utility Consolidated Edison Inc was the latest to tap the credit market with two bond offerings Thursday totaling $1.6 billion. That’s pushed the total amount sold by power and gas suppliers this month to about $9.6 billion, adding to at least $6 billion in new credit lines with banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Xcel Energy Inc. is also seeking to sell $500 million in notes.It has come at a higher cost, as the coronavirus sell-off has sent bond prices down. NextEra Energy Inc.’s $1.1 billion sale of five-year notes Tuesday, through its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, priced at 237.5 basis points over comparable Treasuries. That’s more than twice as much as the company agreed to pay in a similar deal a year ago.NextEra declined to comment.Duke was still able to lock in record-low rates in a sale of $550 million in 30-year notes. Last week the company announced it had a new $1.5 billion term loan and borrowed $500 million from an existing line.“The majority of the funding will be used to reduce our commercial paper balances,” spokesman Neil Nissan said by email. “When the short-term funding markets return to a more stable environment, we may elect to rely on commercial paper like normal.”Other deals include AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement, which the company will use in part to pay down short-term debt. “We took these actions to fortify our liquidity in the challenging markets,” AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry said by email. The company earlier this month also raised almost $1.2 billion through bond offerings.Dominion tapped $1.2 billion in new bank lines while selling $750 million in notes last week, although the bonds were already part of its 2020 financing plans, spokesman Ryan Frazier said.“Yet given market volatility, Dominion Energy has taken prudent steps to increase liquidity via other financing transactions,” he said, noting that Dominion has no plans to drawn on its $6 billion master credit facility.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Utilities Line Up Over $15 Billion as Virus Roils Markets

2020-04-15,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utility customers may catch a break as more than $6 billion in proposed rate hikes are thrown into limbo now that regulators must decide whether to raise bills during a pandemic.The pending increases requested by Duke Energy Corp., Dominion Energy Inc. and others would drive up costs in more than a dozen states. They may be delayed or face higher scrutiny as political pressure mounts to not burden homes and businesses while unemployment is already soaring.“Kicking the can down the road is going to happen broadly,” Ryan Wobbrock, a credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in an interview.While that would be good news in the short-term for customers struggling to pay electric and gas bills, there may a trade off. Delaying or reducing rate increases would crimp utilities’ cash flow and slow their efforts to recoup investments for big capital projects. That could hurt their credit, drive up borrowing costs and ultimately lead to higher customer bills.Already, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has ordered regulators to suspend pending rate hikes. In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey has asked to delay them. “This pandemic has caused financial struggles and record unemployment numbers – Massachusetts families can’t afford any additional costs right now,” Healey said in a statement.Utilities including Eversource Energy, NiSource Inc.’s Columbia Gas and National Grid Plc have opposed Healey’s request. In a filing, they argued it could jeopardize their cash flow just as an increasing number of customers are falling behind on bills, creating a “perfect storm” that would drive up their costs to raise capital and in the end hurt consumers.“Although at first glance the attorney general’s recommendation appears to be in the interest of customers, it is not,” the utilities said in their filing. “The attorney general’s well-intentioned but ill-advised proposal will only create additional financial stress for customers.”In total, U.S. utilities have at least $6.4 billion in pending rate hikes, according to Moody’s. Not all are opposed to delaying them. In fact, several utilities have proactively asked to regulators to postpone rulings in light of the pandemic.In New York, the outbreak’s global epicenter, Avangrid Inc., New York State Electric & Gas Corp. and Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. have asked to suspend their rate cases through mid-September. Dominion requested a delay in South Carolina.Analysts for Moody’s called the moves prudent. “Over the long-term, these actions often enhance financial strategy, risk management and customer relations,” the analysts said in a statement.Shalini Mahajan, a managing director at Fitch Ratings, said delaying rate increases doesn’t necessarily pose a credit issue for utilities. Utilities have demonstrated to have good access to credit markets and other funding sources to make up for lags until their rate cases are settled. “It’s more a timing issue than a credit issue,” she said.Moody’s said it expected any impacts to be temporary.Complex ProcessSetting a utility’s rates is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring public hearings. They’re onerous undertakings during normal times and nearly impossible when entire cities and states are on lockdown.Rate increases have become crucial to the growth of power companies.While electricity demand has been mostly flat in the U.S. over the past decade, utilities have increased earnings by nearly doubling spending on new power plants, pipelines and other capital projects. They’re allowed to recoup costs from those efforts, plus a rate of return set by regulators.If the virus triggers a prolonged downturn, spending to modernize grids and to cut carbon emissions could suffer if regulators ask companies to limit investments and “stick to their needs and try to keep the lights on,” says Karl Rabago, founder of consulting firm Rabago Energy LLC and a former regulator on the Texas Public Utility Commission.Duke ExposedWith about $1.5 billion in pending requests to raise rates, Duke is among utilities most exposed to delays.Duke is considering options to protect its cash flows -- including temporarily increasing rates, then refunding customers later -- in the event of any delays, spokeswoman Meredith Archie said.“Our current focus is on maintaining safe and reliable service to our customers and providing support to our communities in this time of need,” she said. “At the appropriate time, we will have the opportunity to have our cases heard.”Ultimately, the impact on utilities overall will hinge on how much economic pain the virus inflicts.“Depending on how bad is the recession we’re in, there may be an increased amount of pressure from various entities, specially people in politics, asking for lower rates,” said Timothy Winter, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds LLC. “It certainly would diminish earnings growth.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Virus Throws $6 Billion in Higher U.S. Utility Bills Into Limbo

2020-05-12,"Duke Energy Corp.  said Tuesday it had net income of $899 million, or $1.24 a share, in the first quarter, compared with $900 million, or $1.24 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.14, below the $1.19 FactSet consensus. Revenue fell to $5.949 billion from $6.163 billion, and was also below the FactSet consensus of $6.329 billion. The energy holding company said it saw improved results in its gas utilities and infrastructure segment and growth in new projects at its commercial renewables segment. Electric utilities were boosted by rate case increases in South Carolina and Florida and higher rider revenues in the Midwest. ""However, these fundamental improvements in our results were offset by mild winter weather along with severe storms that impacted much of our Carolinas utilities territory as well as unrealized investment losses on non-pension executive benefit trusts and higher financing costs at Other,"" the company said. ""Together these items resulted in lower first quarter 2020 adjusted results."" The company is in the early stages of managing the COVID-19 crisis and is taking steps to mitigate the impact on its business.

Utilities Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com Like just about every company in the United States, Duke Energy is dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. This particular company seems to be taking the situation in stride, however.Consider Duke's first-quarter net income, which came out to $899 million. That's just about exactly in line with the same quarter of the previous year, when Duke's net income was $900 million. Meanwhile, this year's first-quarter revenue totaled $5.95 billion, which is not too far below the $6.16 billion reported in the first quarter of the prior year.So, while there is some pressure being felt during the pandemic, it's not too severe. For the time being, DUK stockholders can ride out the crisis with a decent 4.54% forward annual dividend yield. Southern (SO)Source: Shutterstock ""Critical infrastructure businesses like ours never take a day off,"" observed Thomas A. Fanning, the president and CEO of utilities giant Southern. Fanning's 100% right about that as Southern is an essential utilities provider for around 8 million customers.Southern remains in good fiscal health, as well. For 2020's first quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents. That's an eight-cent year-over-year increase as well as 6 cents greater than the company's estimate.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors SO stock is a safe bet since it has such a massive presence and is crucial to people's standard of living. It's also a dividend achiever with a forward annual yield of 4.78%. All in all, this pick deserves to be on anyone's top utilities stocks list. Dominion Energy (D)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashIf you said that D stock is recession-proof, you'd by exaggerating but only slightly. The shares have held up fairly well during the novel coronavirus crisis. Besides, the 4.77% forward annual dividend yield is a strong incentive to hold the stock.Fiscally, Dominion Energy has held up reasonably well despite the pandemic. For the first quarter of this year, Dominion reported total revenues of $4.5 billion. That's actually a marked improvement over the revenues of $3.9 billion Dominion generated in the year-ago quarter.With over 7 million customers across 20 U.S. states relying on Dominion for their energy needs, this company's a mainstay in the utilities sector and D stock is a highly reliable income generator.

The answer would be yes as the company's adjusted earnings for the first quarter totaled $451 million.

Plus, EXC stock is the only name on this list that's traded on the Nasdaq.So, it could be argued that Excelon is a more ""modern"" utilities company. Its true strength, however, is that it's diversified with fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar segments.With 87 cents per share in operating earnings for 2020's first quarter, Excelon remains on par with its results from the same quarter of last year. Additionally, a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 13.79 and a forward annual dividend yield of 4.17% indicate a compelling value with EXC stock.David Moadel has provided compelling content - and crossed the occasional line - on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett finally made a deal, but those fireworks you heard weren’t for him. As the U.S. closed out the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said that it’s acquiring nearly $10 billion of natural-gas assets and associated debt from Dominion Energy Inc. It may not be the awe-inspiring mega-purchase that his followers have patiently awaited. Still, there’s much that can be gleaned from it about Buffett’s frame of mind as the nation enters month five of a pandemic that’s otherwise kept the famed investor on the sidelines. This is Berkshire’s biggest acquisition since 2015, yet it’s small by Berkshire standards — a relatively low-risk deal in the midst of a recession that’s set to change the outlook for some industries for good. Even though Buffett recently signaled little appetite to make any big bets so long as the end of Covid-19 remains entirely unknown, energy is one area where he’s been poised to make smaller, opportunistic purchases. During Berkshire’s unusually somber shareholder meeting in May, he cited the energy division, along with the BNSF railroad and insurance unit, as parts of his conglomerate that were less affected by the virus. “These businesses will produce cash even though their earnings decline somewhat,” he said. In his annual letter in February, the billionaire wrote of wanting to invest more of the energy unit’s retained earnings to take on large utility projects. The Dominion deal hands Berkshire more than 7,700 miles of gas pipelines and 900 billion cubic feet of gas storage. And it comes as Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. pull out of plans for a controversial pipeline project along the U.S. East Coast; other projects like it have been scrapped as well, and pipeline stocks have taken a beating. That confluence of factors created a rare chance in this environment for Buffett to get a deal at a price he likes in an industry he’s comfortable with — and at a time when he and seemingly everyone else is scared to do much else. It also happens to be an industry that Buffett’s successor-in-waiting, Greg Abel, knows well as the current head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.What stood out as noteworthy in Berkshire’s deal announcement was that the first quote was from Buffett, not Abel. This says that Buffett, even as he is set to turn 90 years old next month, is still calling the shots and wants that known. It’s also a reminder that Berkshire’s history of striking sweetheart deals with favorable terms is very much because of Buffett’s celebrity and acclaim — there’s something to be said for selling your company to the Warren Buffett. That leaves the question: Will Abel be awarded the same preferential M&A treatment when Buffett’s gone? If not, what’s he to do with Berkshire’s more than $100 billion of cash that not even Buffett has been able to spend?With 2020 now marked by economic shutdowns, virus fears and a host of canceled trips, weddings and graduations, it hasn’t been a good year for anyone, not even the world’s sixth-richest man (he was fourth-richest before the crisis). Ideally, Buffett would be making a splash with one more giant deal right about now, and something more fascinating to the average investor than a bunch of underground pipes at that. (Costco Wholesale Corp. is one such example I speculated on recently.)Buffett may not seem much older than he did a year ago — he’s certainly just as sharp — but turning 90 is symbolic as a final chapter for the Oracle. He won’t want the last footnote of his legacy to be an unmemorable purchase of gas assets, even if it is a fine transaction. Then again, Covid-19 isn’t leaving him much choice. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-08-14,"Almost anywhere you look in the market, you can find stocks with price-earnings ratios in the triple digits. But no sector makes this reality more evident than renewables. With that in mind, where should investors be looking for solar stocks to buy?Small firms that have survived the boom-and-bust cycles of recent years are once again in fashion. And low interest rates means financing solar is a more compelling option for homeowners and businesses. Why? Solar creates more energy independence and helps property owners save money over the long term.What's more, if paired with a generator, solar becomes a way to lean less on the increasingly stressed, antiquated and unreliable energy grid.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut small companies are just one way to take advantage. As I mentioned last week, there are some big companies leading an eco-friendly shift in institutional investing.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Most of the best solar stocks to buy today are solid, large-cap stocks that have plenty going for them. And they help investors avoid the big premiums that typical solar plays command. Lastly, these six picks are all strong long-term investments.  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK)  * Xcel Energy (NYSE:XEL)  * Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (NYSE:HASI)  * Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Solar Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Its regulated business may be the leading utility in southern Florida, but its unregulated business is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy.And this is precisely the kind of stock I'm talking about here. It offers a steady, regulated utility business, so there's a solid dividend and nearly guaranteed returns, as well as a business with a massive growth kicker.Florida Power & Light (now FPL) was launched in 1928, and has been powering the second fastest-growing city and region in the United States.In 2009, it became the largest renewable energy producer in the U.S. And it has grown that lead ever since. That size and scale makes it very attractive to businesses and other utilities that want to add renewable energy to their energy mix but can't afford to build at scale.The stock is up 30% in the past 12 months, and still delivers a nearly 2% dividend. But there's plenty of upside left. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With a $66 billion market capitalization, Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. With 7 million customers, its prime service area includes the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area including the Pentagon, as well as Tidewater Virginia, where one of the biggest shipyards and a significant number of armed forces sit.In recent years, Dominion was focused on taking advantage of its natural gas properties in the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere. The industry was converting coal-fired plants to natural gas, and there were enormous export possibilities present.But it ran into significant headwinds building pipelines out of the Marcellus to distribution centers in Virginia and North Carolina. Even as it prevailed in court, it sold most of its gas pipeline and production business to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B).Now, it's plowing that cash into expanding its solar and wind operations. And Wall Street is loving it. It's up about 4% in the last year and has a 4.7% dividend as well. Solar Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com This North Carolina-based utility has been a leader in alternative energy resources for decades.DUK has about 7.8 million customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. In the old days, King Coal powered the plants that generated electricity for these markets, since most of its service area was in or very near coal country.But it started to realize that East Coast coal was a dwindling -- and dirty -- resource and saw the need to pivot to more efficient and cheaper resources. That transition has been underway for decades. And now, DUK is a leader in utility-scale renewable energy distribution and development.DUK stock is off about 8% for the year, but its 4.6% dividend gets you back close to breakeven. It's a great long-term pick for investors looking for stable, investor-friendly growth. Xcel Energy (XEL)Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com Usually, there's not a lot of news about upper-Midwest companies unless they're exploration and production companies, agriculture firms or mining companies.XEL is a Minnesota-based utility with 3.7 million electric and 2.1 million natural gas customers in its home state, as well as the Dakotas, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and New Mexico.In a region where there's plenty of coal and natural gas, XEL was the first major corporation to declare that its electricity generation was going 100% carbon-free by 2050, and 80% carbon-free by 2030. That's a big deal.It has significant plans to add solar and wind from now to then. And that will transform energy systems in the High Plains.XEL stock is up almost 13% in 2020, but it remains a bargain. That's why Xcel Energy is one of the best solar stocks to buy. Solar Stocks to Buy: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI)Source: Shutterstock Beyond the great long-term choices the utilities here offer, this is a hidden gem that has been overlooked by the broader market.And, it is a great play for two reasons. First, it is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT), which means it pays you its net profits in the form of dividends.Second, its primary focus is the financing, development and installation of renewable energy projects. And most of these projects have state or federal backing, so the financing is rock solid, as well as the rents.At this point, HASI sports a $2.8 billion market cap, and it's about as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock, even in this hot sector. Plus, it's up nearly 45% in the last year and still delivers a 3.4% dividend. Canadian Solar (CSIQ)Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com I'm sure some of you are hankering for a pure-play solar company, so I found one that avoids the triple-digit valuations that most firms have at this point.That other danger to avoid is buying companies that have a lot of potential, but don't have the established markets to make it work. If you remember SolarCity, a solar company that was bankrolled by billionaire Elon Musk, it could barely make it through the troughs and valleys and was finally absorbed into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It's not easy.But CSIQ doesn't have those problems because its main market, as its name suggests, is Canada. But it has subsidiaries in 20 countries on six continents including 17 manufacturing facilities in Asia and the Americas.It has shipped over 46 gigawatt modules and currently sits on a 15-GW production backlog, which means CSIQ has plenty of business to keep it going, even during a global pandemic.What's more, it has a U.S. division, Recurrent Energy, that has 2.4 GW of projects up and running in the U.S. and a 7-GW project pipeline.CSIQ stock's trailing P/E is still below 6 times and it's up 17% in the past year. It has a $1.5 billion market cap, so it's not huge, but it's big enough for institutions to buy in.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

2020-08-17,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance reached a record $1.346 trillion Monday, surpassing 2017’s full-year total in less than eight months amid seemingly endless investor appetite following the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented steps to bolster liquidity.The Fed’s March pledge to use its near limitless balance sheet to buy corporate bonds has lifted nearly every corner of the market, allowing struggling cruise lines, plane makers and hotels to tap much needed financing while providing top-rated companies from Alphabet Inc. to Visa Inc. and Chevron Corp. access to some of the cheapest funding ever seen.Just five months ago, this kind of issuance was virtually unimaginable. The market was frozen as the coronavirus ravaged the U.S. and brought the economy to a standstill. But following the central bank’s intervention, demand quickly returned, and hasn’t waned since. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Corporate index reached a record low 1.82% in early August, down from more than 4.5% in March.“Corporate treasurers got the bejesus scared out of them when the funding markets completely shut down in the third and fourth weeks of March,” Gregory Staples, head of fixed income at DWS Investment Management, said earlier Monday. “So there was the recognition that liquidity is very important and the markets may not be open forever.”A $6.5 billion debt offering from Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and 10 other deals helped secure the issuance record on Monday. The sale in five parts from the owner of the New York Stock Exchange will finance its acquisition of Ellie Mae Inc. Honeywell International Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. were also in the market.As 2020 enters the home stretch, there’s little sign the borrowing binge is slowing. Investors have poured over $100 billion into funds that buy high-grade bonds over the last 17 weeks, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.And the cheaper borrowing costs are enticing American companies to return to credit markets two, three, even four times. Many are refinancing debt due in the coming months and years, taking advantage of the opportunity to extend their maturities.More than 30 borrowers priced deals last week, issuing almost $50 billion. DoubleLine Capital said it expects supply to reach $1.9 trillion before the year is out.Still, the barrage of issuance is starting to take its toll on returns, with high-grade bonds in the midst of their worst month since March. They lost 1.58% last week and are down 1.2% so far this month, on track for the first decline since the pandemic took hold and upended markets earlier this year.“With the debt that these companies have raised, you have to keep in mind that it does add cash to the balance sheet,” Barry McAlinden, senior fixed-income strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Monday. “They’re still very prudent. The narrative isn’t that they’re being reckless at all in adding leverage to the balance sheet during uncertain times.”(Updates total issuance in headline, first paragraph, adds Monday issuance in fifth paragraph and quote at the end)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","U.S. High-Grade Bond Sales Set Record, Reach $1.346 Trillion"

2020-12-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One way to think about the ESG thing is in religious terms: Proselytizers target heathens, not the saved.Environmental, social and governance investing today enjoys more hype than clarity. There is no agreement on exactly what counts as a compliant investment, and there is often a lack of clear economic signals tied to ESG-favored outcomes (elusive carbon pricing is a prime example). Does it make sense to invest in a company that’s already ticked a lot of ESG boxes or one that could yet do so? And how to be rewarded?U.S. utilities can thread this needle. Greenhouse-gas emissions from the power grid have fallen by more than a quarter since 2007, but much remains to be done. Moreover, utilities earn a regulated return on investment in new stuff, so there are quantifiable gains to be made on greening their asset base.Hugh Wynne and Eric Selmon, utilities analysts at Sector & Sovereign Research, have benchmarked this opportunity for 25 companies with a collective market cap of more than $600 billion. Their starting point is the carbon intensity of electricity generation in tonnes per megawatt-hours, both in 2019 and estimated for 2030, as implied by the companies’ decarbonization targets. In estimating that, they assume the utilities replace their highest-emitting plants (running on coal, oil or natural gas, in that order) with renewable generation at an average cost over the next decade of $1 per watt for solar power and $1.50 for wind.(1)One immediate observation is that the utilities that score better in terms of having low carbon intensity in 2019 also tend to be at the top of the table in 2030.You might think that makes them a shoo-in for ESG investors. But addressing climate change quickly means removing the highest-intensity sources of emissions first. Surely it makes at least as much sense to invest in companies that are big emitters now but have committed to fixing that — and need capital in order to do so. Bonus: As utilities, they have a chance of getting those investments into their regulated asset base.Rather than looking at absolute virtue signals, consider who is moving furthest and likely to spend big to get there.Utilities with nuclear plants — usually larger companies — or hydroelectric generation tend to score well on carbon-intensity already. Those that don’t, and which have more room for improvement, tend to be smaller utilities in the Midwest and West with significant coal-fired and other fossil-fuel generation capacity.As estimates built on objectives, these numbers aren’t set in stone. The added wrinkle is that regulators may not necessarily let utilities put investments in new capacity into the regulated asset base, but force them to contract power in competitive auctions. That would limit the overall opportunity versus the dollar amounts in the chart, although the environmental goal would still be met.Apart from ESG investors, the chart makes a useful screen for utilities themselves; ones looking to buy other utilities, anyway. Big investment requirements, particularly tied to a secular theme like renewables, make the best targets. PNM Resources Inc., the New Mexico utility that appears in that upper-right quadrant, is already the subject of a $7.6 billion agreed acquisition by Spanish renewables giant Iberdrola SA, due to close next fall. It is interesting to note Duke Energy Corp. and Evergy Inc. — both reportedly considered as targets at some point by NextEra Energy Inc. — screen low in terms of targeted cuts to emissions intensity. While that makes them potentially less interesting for an ESG portfolio, the potential to come in and execute a more ambitious decarbonization plan may make them interesting for NextEra.Regulators are another audience. By Wynne’s and Selmon’s calculations, the average cost of carbon abatement across the 25 utilities is just $19 per tonne, with a range of $13 to $37. Even if these costs do not reflect spending on associated wires and other infrastructure, they suggest further decarbonization is affordable across the states.The marginal cost rises as the highest-intensity sources are taken out; another reason to target these first. So as those costs rise, particularly as energy storage is incorporated to squeeze out gas-fired peaker plants, regulators should think more broadly. For example, with transportation now the biggest source of emissions in the U.S., it may make sense to steer utilities’ investment budgets toward lateral efforts like vehicle-charging infrastructure once their generation portfolios have decarbonized to a certain point. Either way, the ESG crowd should give their blessing.—With graphics assistance from Elaine He.(1) These are unsubsidized prices. The exact mix of solar and wind assets is determined either by published targets or the cheapest option depending on that utility's service territory. For the group, the analysis resulted in a split of 70% solar and 30% wind for the new generation capacity. The analysis does not include estimates for the spending required on new transmission or distribution infrastructure.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2021-02-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Another winter storm is heading for the eastern and central U.S., threatening to bring snow to the Northeast and icy rain to southern states already enduring power outages amid a deep freeze.Manhattan’s Central Park and Boston could get 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of snow by early Friday, with Washington and Philadelphia getting 4 to 6, the National Weather Service said. Meanwhile, cold across the Great Plains and South will continue for several more days, and there will likely be icing from east Texas to Alabama.One of the hardest hit areas will be central North Carolina and Virginia as the storm moves north. Duke Energy Corp. warned nearly 1 million homes and businesses may lose power in the North Carolina and South Carolina.A blast of frigid air has unleashed record-breaking cold from Canada to Mexico and triggered blackouts in Texas and across the South, leaving millions without power for days. For the second time this week, winter storm warnings, watches and weather advisories stretch from New Mexico to New England.The wild week of winter weather has played havoc on air travel. Across the U.S. 4,948 flights were canceled Tuesday and Wednesday, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.“Expect tomorrow to be difficult,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday in a briefing. “Stay off the roads if you can, it’s going to hit at tomorrow morning’s rush hour.”In New York, snow should start sometime early Thursday morning, said Joe Pollina, a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York. The snow will be heavy through the day, but could change to sleet and freezing rain later. In Boston, snow will start late Thursday and continue through Saturday morning.Messy ConditionsSimilar conditions will sweep through Washington and the cities along Interstate 95 to the south of New York.“It is going to be a mess for D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia until Friday morning,” said Lara Pagano, a forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.Across eastern Texas, parts of Arkansas and through the South to Alabama, as much as a quarter-inch of ice could form on trees and power lines, causing outages and making travel hazardous, Pagano said. There is “good news on the horizon” for Texas and the rest of the central U.S. as temperatures gradually warm, she said. By next week, temperatures across Texas could rise above freezing and reach the 40s and 50s Fahrenheit.Saturday’s high in Dallas could reach 45 degrees, while Houston and San Antonio could get to 55, the weather service said. As of 10:30 a.m., Seagull Lake, Minnesota posted the nation’s coldest temperature at minus 34 degrees. Three spots in Florida, including Fort Lauderdale, had highs of 87.“It is still cold, obviously, across the central U.S. but not nearly as cold as it was yesterday at this time,” Pagano said. “Things look to improve in terms of warming up and drying out.”(Adds Carolina outages in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Winter Storm to Dump Snow on New York and Icy Rain on Texas

2021-02-26,"They say March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. For the markets, it’s looking like it’s coming in as a bull. But the bull is getting a bit erratic given the big move in fuel prices and the wild action in the bond market recently. The U.S. dollar index is near its 52-week lows, and that means rates on bonds have risen significantly. That’s going to change the real estate market, and that will have spillover effects in portfolio holdings. We’ve also already seen Big Tech get hit with selling. Plus, the Federal Reserve has said it will not intervene at this point and isn’t worried about inflation, so investors will start to make different decisions in this environment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What it means for the individual investor is that it’s time to weed out the weak and vulnerable from your portfolio now. 8 Stocks to Buy for March These seven stocks to sell for March are a very good start: Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) AT&T (NYSE:T) Stocks to Sell for March: Biogen (BIIB) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com A couple weeks ago, a slew of drug companies announced earnings. All showed strong Q4 earnings and revenue. But BIIB came in mixed, with weak earnings but good revenue. But looking back isn’t what the markets or the analysts really care about. The markets are forward-looking. And BIIB’s guidance wasn’t very optimistic. As a leader in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, it wasn’t a part of the wild ride some companies had in the race to a vaccine. But even that hype has left the market, so weak guidance in a wild market like this is going to get your stock punished. There’s no point holding and hoping when there could be more downside to come, as sector rotation is sure to be the story of the next few months. This is the prime reason Biogen made the list of stocks to sell for March. BIIB is up 11.6% year-to-date, yet in the past 12 months it’s still in the red, down 15.7%. Boston Scientific (BSX) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com In late January, BSX announced that it was buying a leader in the ambulatory cardiography space, Preventice Solutions, for $925 million. It already owns a 22% stake, so when all is said and done, the deal will cost around $720 million. And while the space for implantable cardiac monitoring equipment is growing a good clip, it’s a $2 billion market, and BSX already had a nice piece of that market with its own equipment as well as its investment in Preventice. But even with that news and some new buy recommendations from analysts, the stock has been treading water for the past 12 months. 8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name Granted, it’s a major medical-device manufacturer that sells more than 13,000 products in 100-plus countries. But this isn’t the kind of stock that’s going to make much of a move any time soon. Duke Energy (DUK) Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com You would think if there were any energy company stocks to sell in March, it would be Texas-based utilities. But we’re not here to state the obvious, and that cow has already left the barn. I want you to pick stocks that you might not otherwise think are in trouble. DUK is a major East Coast utility with operations in the Carolinas, Ohio, Kentucky and Puerto Rico. It has natural gas distribution operations in a few other states as well. It’s an old school utility that has been a leader in clean energy, but it also sits in the heart of coal country and has some legacy issues to deal with in converting to cleaner operations. Last year, there was talk of another big renewable energy company looking to buy DUK, but nothing came of that. Although, that remains a possibility for some of these utilities that have soared in the past year. DUK’s recent earnings were mixed, and revenue was down year-over-year, largely due to the fact that its commercial and industrial customers were hamstrung by the pandemic. The stock is down 9% in the past three months and still trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.7, which is massive for a utility. Overpriced and underperforming is not a good combination, making this an easy pick for this list of stocks to sell for March. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com With a market capitalization of $84 billion, GSK is certainly in the Big Pharma club. Like many of its peers, it jumped into the vaccine race, but its initial vaccine had a lowered effectiveness in the elderly, and that pushed its development back a few steps. It’s now revamping its position with a new joint venture, and it has another to develop a vaccine for the Covid-19 variants that are popping up around the world. But GSK is doing a lot more than vaccine work. Some of its drugs have become go-to antibiotics, cancer treatments and HIV/AIDs drugs, and it even developed the first vaccine for malaria. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Your Retirement That hasn’t helped the stock, however. In the past month, the stock is down 13.5%, and it’s down nearly 179% in the past 52 weeks. Its 6.1% dividend won’t put a dent in those numbers. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) Source: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com If you have ever been to Las Vegas, you know how massive the properties are out there. On the big, flat desert, they lose their scale until you go inside and realize how massive these structures are. Just to keep them running costs huge sums. So, when they sit nearly dormant for months on end, keeping the lights on is a real challenge. LVS only has two resorts in Vegas at this point, but it has built a large number in Macau and Singapore. But during the pandemic these operations were also affected. And recently the high-profile CEO and founder Sheldon Adelson died. While management has been well established, a shift in leadership always brings some kind of change. The sector has been doing well as pandemic numbers improve, but the economy is going to have to improve along with it, and we’re still weeks away from a new stimulus deal. Your best bet here is to count LVS as one of the stocks to sell for March. Raytheon (RTX) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com It’s hard to believe that a defense company would make a list of stocks to sell for March. The defense sector is one of the most consistently funded departments in the government. And budgets have been rising year after year. But the U.S. has now reached a point of significant debt, as deficit spending has gone through the roof in recent years. Add in the multi-trillion-dollar stimulus packages for the pandemic, and the numbers have gone parabolic. That means cuts will have to come from somewhere, and the biggest pot of money is in defense. RTX and its peers aren’t going to starve. But they’re not going to thrive, either. Even our adversaries are struggling economically, so the thought of significant military engagements aren’t too concerning in the near future. 7 Dividend Stocks Offering Little More Than Danger What’s more, its Pratt and Whitney aircraft engine division may have some troubles after the recent incidents with their engines coming apart in-flight. The risks outweigh the opportunities here. AT&T (T) Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com For months now, I’ve been ringing the alarm on this stock. Yes, this major telecom company is delivering a tantalizing 7.1% dividend, but the stock is down 24% in the past 12 months. The math is pretty easy, and it doesn’t work out in investors’ favor. Some will argue that it’s one of America’s most iconic brands and that it will endure as it has for decades. But there are many iconic brands that are mere shadows of themselves because they thought they were bigger than the markets and had such power that they could weather any storm. We are living in a very disruptive age, and any sense of comfort derived from a legacy brand can be dangerous. Innovation has always been the hallmark of telecom companies. Even At&T understood the value of its Bell Labs, at least until 1996 when it spun it off. The danger for AT&T is that it’s no longer an innovator. And investors are picking up on this. It’s still a massive company and isn’t going to disappear, but it shouldn’t be a big investment. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had no positions in any of the stocks in this article.

2021-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Duke Energy, one of the biggest U.S. power companies, isn’t going to reach its carbon-cutting goals without the help of a controversial source: nuclear power.That’s according to Chief Executive Officer Lynn Good, who spoke Tuesday at panel called the Future of Energy. Nuclear power is relatively expensive and some environmental groups worry about accidents and the storing of spent fuel, which is dangerous. Still, it’s the only source of carbon-free power that can run around the clock.“The safety record here in the U.S. is extraordinarily strong,” Good said, referring to nuclear power. “Frankly, I don’t see a way for us to reach our carbon goals without nuclear being part of the equation.”Duke has set targets of halving its carbon emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In keeping with those, the company needs to build about 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy generation every year for the next 30 years, Good said. By comparison, the company has built about 3,000 megawatts of renewable power in the past four years.The energy giant gets about a third of its total power generation from nuclear plants, and doesn’t want to lose any capacity. The company has no plans to build new nuclear power but is seeking to renew the licenses for its 11 nuclear reactors in North and South Carolina so they can run for an additional 20 years.Nuclear power provided about 20% of all U.S. electricity last year and 52% of its carbon-free power, according the the U.S. Energy Department. There’s only one nuclear plant currently under construction in the U.S.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Duke Energy Says It Can’t Reach Carbon-Cutting Targets Without Nuclear

2021-05-10,"(Bloomberg) -- The cyberattack on the biggest fuel pipeline system in the U.S. is a stark reminder that America’s energy infrastructure is a tempting, and vulnerable, target for hackers.“The industry understands that we are a target,” said Lynn Good, chief executive officer of Duke Energy Corp., in a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday. “A level of vigilance is required.”While Duke, one of the biggest U.S. electric utilities, is not directly impacted from the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, the latest attack adds to the growing list of similar occurrences involving global energy assets. Over the last two years, a ransomware attack brought down a U.S. natural gas compressor facility, a massive SolarWinds breach targeted companies in multiple industries, including utilities, and Mexico’s oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos reported a cyberattack that crippled its computer systems.This most recent hit by hackers underscores how the utility industry needs to recognize that there is a link between their information technology systems and their operational technology that is directly connected to the grid, said Tobias Whitney, vice president of energy security solutions for Fortress Information Security, which works with large U.S. utilities.“This is an example that I think the industry needs to recognize how ransomware can be used,” Whitney said in a telephone interview on Monday. Everyone involved with critical infrastructure will want to understand how this happened and learn how to prevent it from occurring on their systems in the future, he said.U.S. grid operator ISO New England Inc. said in a statement on Monday that “the threat these types of attacks pose has long been a critical focus,” and it continues “to work with state and federal authorities and the industry on identifying threats.”Meanwhile, Duke has a policy against discussing whether it has been targeted by cyberattacks, according to Chief Financial Officer Steve Young. However, it’s clearly a growing threat and the company is working to step up its defenses.“Obviously, this is an area of concern,” Young said in an interview. “There are a great number of bad actors out there.”(Updates with comment from cybersecurity firm starting in the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Duke CEO Says Utilities Know ‘We Are a Target’ for Hackers

2021-05-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Elliott Investment Management is calling on Duke Energy Corp. to explore splitting into three companies, a move it argues could unlock as much as $15 billion in value for investors.The New York-based hedge fund said in a letter to Duke’s board Monday that it believes the company is underperforming despite owning high-quality utility franchises. Elliott, which says it’s a top-10 investor in the company, said Duke should separate into three regionally focused, publicly traded holding companies in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. A review of that potential strategy should be led by an independent board committee including some new directors, the investor said.The push by Elliott, which has successfully lobbied for change at some the world’s most prominent companies, runs counter to the trend over the past decade of large utilities buying up smaller rivals to expand their customer bases, achieve economies of scale for massive infrastructure investments and run their operations more efficiently. The activist hedge fund argues that that Duke’s “noncontiguous conglomerate” structure has made the company hard to manage and has led to few, if any, upsides.“We are confident that this independent structure and review process provides the clearest path for the company to enhance credibility with investors and maximize value,” Elliott senior portfolio manager Jeff Rosenbaum and managing partner Jesse Cohn said in the letter.Duke said Elliott has made a series of proposals since July 2020, which the utility’s board of directors decided weren’t good for the company or its shareholders. Among those, Elliott proposed Duke issue up to $7 billion in common equity to the hedge fund and its affiliates at a discount in exchange for roughly 10% of the company, according to Duke.In a statement, Duke said it will always advocate for the long-term interests of its stakeholders over “any narrow special or short-term interest.”“Given the performance of the company, there is no strategic logic to breaking the company apart, and there is serious risk of dis-synergies that would weigh down the various spun-off entities and raise questions about the viability of the dividend to shareholders,” Duke said.Duke rose 0.9% to $104 per share at 2:23 p.m. New York after earlier climbing as much as 4.8%. Shares have gained nearly 14% this year, buoyed by tailwinds including a settlement over coal ash in North Carolina and the sale of a stake in its Indiana utility to Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC.“Color us skeptical that separating Duke into smaller utilities would prompt a near-term re-rating in Duke’s share price,” said Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton. And South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster wrote a letter to Duke chief executive Lynn Good last week that said Duke should remain an independent company headquartered in the Carolinas.Investors for some time now have wanted utilities to spin off unregulated units and focus on businesses like basic utility services and transmission development, which tend to generate stable returns. Elliott’s proposal for Duke seemingly takes that a step further by asking the company to focus not just on core tasks, but core markets.Elliott estimates the Carolinas business could have an equity value of as much as $55 billion, while the Florida business could be worth up to $23 billion and the Midwest unit could be valued at $15 billion. Duke provides electricity to 7.8 million customers across six states.The activist investor has made similar pushes at utilities including Sempra Energy and Evergy Inc. in recent years.“A role that Elliott has played with utilities like Sempra and Evergy is to come in and say, ‘Your core business is the most valuable and some of these tertiary business lines actually represent a drag on value,’” said Katie Bays, an analyst at FiscalNote Markets. She added that Elliott has played a big role in financing clean energy transitions for businesses that rely on coal, an approach that could work with Duke’s business.(Updated with background in third paragraph and analyst and politician comment in ninth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Elliott Urges Duke Energy to Separate Into Three Companies

2021-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- The red-and-white flue stacks of the James M. Barry Electric Generating Station tower over the Mobile River, belching steam into the Alabama sky. The sprawling complex of coal and natural gas plants already spews more than 7.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent every year. Now it's about to get even bigger, with a seventh unit estimated to cost $635 million by the time it starts service in 2023.The new gas plant, and others like it, has a 40-year lifespan. That means it will still be there in 2035, the year that President Joe Biden has promised a zero-emission electricity sector, and in 2050, the deadline set by its owner, Southern Co., to reach carbon neutrality. It could even burn past 2060, more than a century after the first coal facility opened on the site — making the complex a testament to the endurance of fossil fuels.The decision by one of the biggest U.S. power companies to develop new fossil fuel assets is hard to square with a low-carbon future. But it’s not unusual. At least eight large utilities in the U.S. are building new gas plants right now, and another five are thinking about doing the same. That lays bare an uncomfortable truth about the sector’s commitment to fighting climate change: All those carbon-neutral pledges don’t necessarily mean quitting fossil fuels. “It seems like false advertising or greenwashing,” said Drew Shindell, a professor at Duke University who studies climate change. “We can’t be building gas infrastructure in the 2020s and 2030s. We need to be closing it down.”If all of the plants under consideration moved forward, they would release nearly 35 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, according to calculations by BloombergNEF.(1)That’s about the same as the annual tailpipe emissions of every car in Florida.Power companies explain their commitment to gas by arguing that it’s both necessary for electric reliability and an important bridge to transition from coal to cleaner energy sources. California learned that the hard way. Over the past five years, the state retired enough gas capacity to power 6.8 million homes, and had to resort to rolling blackouts last summer when a heatwave taxed the electric grid just as solar waned at sunset.“Cloud cover comes and goes,” said Katharine Bond, vice president of public policy and state affairs at Dominion Energy Inc. “The winds slows. We've got to have something that we can ratchet up.” Dominion, which has a 2050 net-zero pledge and is required by Virginia to be 100% carbon free by 2045, is also considering building a new natural gas-fired plant.To offset pollution from the new facilities, Southern, Dominion and others say they plan to invest, eventually, in technology to capture and dispose of their emissions, or rework those facilities to burn cleaner fuels such as biogas or hydrogen made from renewable sources. But neither of those strategies has been implemented at scale, and both remain uneconomic at today’s prices. Notably, almost none of the companies have laid out a timeline or budget for upgrading or transitioning their gas plants. Two of them, DTE Energy Co. and Xcel Energy Inc., acknowledge that their carbon goals rely on technology that doesn’t currently exist.(2)Southern’s new Barry plant “will support us getting to 2050” because it’s designed for both carbon capture and mixing in hydrogen, said Chief Executive Officer Tom Fanning. Right now, those technologies don’t make sense financially but “when it’s in the money, we’ll absolutely add that in.” It’s a worldwide phenomenon. The Spanish utility giant Iberdrola just finished building over $1.6 billion worth of gas plants in Mexico, though it vows to be carbon-neutral by 2050. French multinational electric utility Engie SA plans to build four new gas-fired plants in Belgium by 2025. Europe’s biggest utility, Enel SpA, pledged zero emissions by 2050 and also plans to build new gas plants in its home market, Italy, where they can replace coal stations. All of those countries have set goals to neutralize greenhouse gas by 2050, meaning that many utilities appear to be setting themselves up as potential obstacles to international climate commitments. In the U.S. alone, about 36 gigawatts of new gas generation is coming online in the next five years, according to BNEF.That raises questions about the nation’s ability to meet its own climate targets. Fossil fuel-based electricity is responsible for 25% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, second only to the transportation sector — so achieving a carbon-free economy hinges on overhauling the power sector. But of the nearly two dozen U.S. utilities aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, most aren’t on track to meet the goal, according to a September report by Deloitte LLP.The Biden administration has indicated it's skeptically eyeing new fossil fuel plants as part of its quest to decarbonize the power sector by 2035. ""There are a couple hundred natural gas units that are in the pipeline, and we have to think about those,"" White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Tuesday at a Columbia University energy summit.The electric industry is one of the easiest to clean up, thanks to the proliferation of inexpensive renewable energy. Not only has the cost of building wind, solar and batteries plunged in recent years, but those sources of energy have zero emissions and zero fuel cost: sunshine and air are free.“Renewables are now the most competitive energy sources,” said Jim Thomson, Deloitte’s U.S. leader of power, utilities and renewables.But cost isn’t always a prime concern for power companies. Most big utilities are regulated by state agencies that generally allow them to pass capital costs onto their customers. A natural gas plant built today will get funded by ratepayers and earn the company a return, even if it gets shuttered early or replaced by cleaner sources later. Buying power from a wind or solar developer isn’t always as attractive, while building renewables doesn’t always come naturally for utilities long accustomed to fossil fuels.“The thing that provides the most reliability and the lowest rates for customers is not the same thing that makes the utility money,” said Charles Teplin, a principal at RMI.Duke Energy Corp., the nation’s biggest electric utility by customer count, is weighing as many as 15 new gas units even as it commits to eliminating emissions by 2050. If the company moves forward with the buildout — which is just one of six proposals Duke has laid out — it would aim to meet its climate goals by retiring those plants after 25 years instead of 40.That prompted Duke customers Apple, Facebook and Google to complain to regulators that the new plants could become a “financial albatross” weighing on them for decades to come.Duke’s head of resource planning, Glen Snider, said gas is necessary to transition away from coal while greener technologies develop. “We don't want to be sitting still while we're waiting for these other technologies like batteries and small nuclear reactors,” he said, adding that new technologies also have risks that could add costs to ratepayer bills. U.S. utilities have so far announced plans for over $70 billion-worth of new gas-fired power plants through 2025 — almost all of which will cost more than equivalent clean energy, according to a 2019 RMI report. Those plants will be uneconomic to operate starting in about 2035 as the cost of carbon-free power keeps falling, the report said.“Utility leaders who have experience with natural gas plants are going to find that to be their go-to reliability plan,” said Miriam Wrobel, who advises utilities as part of her work for FTI Consulting's power and renewables practice.Many utilities say that their new gas plants could burn some hydrogen alongside natural gas to reduce emissions. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the biggest municipal utility in the U.S., is building a plant in Utah that’s expected to run on 70% gas and 30% clean hydrogen when it starts up in 2025. The company says it would increase the proportion of hydrogen to 100% by 2045 to meet a California law that mandates zero-carbon electricity by that date.While so-called green hydrogen that's produced without emissions is expected to be cheaper than natural gas by 2050 in many parts of the world, that won’t be the case in the U.S. due to the nation’s abundance of the fossil fuel, according to BNEF. And, for now, there isn’t any pipeline infrastructure that can safely transport hydrogen from the few areas where it may be produced to the plants where it will be used. Meanwhile, systems that capture carbon before it’s released into the atmosphere continue to have high capital costs, despite decades of research and federal funding. Most existing U.S. projects are deployed by oil companies that sell the carbon for use in enhanced oil recovery. But barring big advances in industrial utilization of carbon — such as in the production of cement — emissions captured at a power plant would likely have little commercial value even as they generate storage and transportation costs.Another option for meeting climate goals that utilities are increasingly turning to is simply selling the infrastructure later on to companies that haven’t pledged to cut carbon. Oil companies including BP Plc have already started offloading their most-polluting assets in a bid to meet their ambitious climate targets. Drax, a U.K. power producer that recently won 15-year agreements to build three new gas plants, has since said it may sell those facilities to meet its goal of being carbon negative by 2030.“We call it resource shuffling,” said Leah Stokes, a professor at University of California at Santa Barbara who studies energy and climate change.But potential buyers are already drying up as investors grow increasingly wary of fossil-fuel assets. Iberdrola, for example, has struggled to find someone to take its gas plants in Spain. Globally, the shift toward clean energy could cost companies $100 billion in stranded gas assets, according to calculations by Global Energy Monitor. “There is a cost to customers,” said Scotiabank utility analyst Andrew Weisel. “Customers will need to double pay for the gas plant and the renewable technology that replaces them.”— With assistance by Dave Merrill, Nicholas Steckler, Rachel Morison and Jennifer Dlouhy (Adds comment from White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy in 12th paragraph.)(1) Calculation uses an emissions capacity factor of 0.38.Carbon dioxide emissions per coal-fired power plant were calculated by dividing the CO2-equivalent output of all U.S. coal-fired power (1.19 billion tons) by the number of operating plants in 2018 (367). That equates to 3.25 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per coal facility. This is the same methodology used by the Environmental Protection Agency in itsGreenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.(2) While both companies said their climate goals rely on technology that doesn't currently exist, DTE said in a statement that its new gas plant will help the company reduce carbon emissions by replacing a coal plant that generates 70% higher emissions per kilowatt hour. Xcel emphasized that gas will help the utility shut coal plants earlier and that new, greener technologies will be brought online as they become available.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",New Gas Plants Threaten Carbon Hangover Long Past Biden Deadline
