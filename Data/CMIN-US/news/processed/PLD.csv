General Electric (NYSE:GE) set the pace, losing 4.4% of its value on worries that its intended Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) may not command the price previously expected. Altria Group (NYSE:MO) actually lost more ground, however, falling 6.9% in response to a Morgan Stanley downgrade.

One noteworthy winner … eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Shares of the online-auction giant jumped 6.1% after activist investment firm Elliott Management showed some interest that could be a prelude to a serious -- and beneficial -- shakeup.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Headlines generally don't make for good trading, however, as they tend to be flash-in-the-pan events. Rather, top trading prospects generally take shape over the span of several days, like the stock charts of CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP), Prologis (NYSE:PLD) and Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) have of late.

### CenterPoint Energy (CNP)

When we last looked at CenterPoint Energy back on Jan. 7, it was once again knocking on the door of a break out of a sideways trading range, between $27 and $29. That happened in the meantime. But, even then we were hesitant to view it in a fully bullish light.

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



After Tuesday's action, though, the breakout move was tested, and passed the test with flying colors.

  
Click to Enlarge • The big bullish clue is yesterday's low near $29. The bears had a chance to up-end the rally effort, but the former ceiling has become a floor, sparking a gain on a day most other names lost ground.

• Underscoring the strength of the uptrend is more buying volume than not. Although choppy, the rising accumulation-distribution line says there's been more buying interest than selling interest since the rally got going in November.

• The next plausible ceiling is the $30 area, marked with a red dashed line. That's where CNP peaked a few times in late 2017.

### Prologis (PLD)

Prologis is another name we've dissected more than once in recent months, for largely the same reason as CenterPoint Energy. That is, though range-bound, a breakout was possibly brewing within that range.

PLD has fallen out of its range, however, with no avail either way. But, Tuesday's bar offers up several clues that the rebound since late November may have run its course and the stock's now ready to pull back.

  
Click to Enlarge • Yesterday's bar is called a doji, and a spinning top in particular, where the open and close are both right at the midpoint of an usually tall bar. This level of indecision is often seen at the end of a trend and the beginning of a trend in the other direction.

• Bolstering the possibility that a reversal is taking shape is where this spinning top materialized. It's right at the intersection of the gray 100-day moving average line and the white 200-day line, where one would expect the bears to make a stand.

• Still, this is the kind of trading setup that usually requires some proof of a pivot, ideally in the form of a decisive move lower today.

### Mohawk Industries (MHK)

Finally, now's not the time to be making new, blind bets on Mohawk Industries. The company is expected to report earnings in early February, and the last two times the flooring company posted quarterly results, the stock was crushed. It may well happen again.

Nevertheless, the chart's action over the course of the past few days means it's worth adding to your watchlist. The bulls are testing the waters in front of major news, and that news may well get MHK over a huge technical hurdle.

  
Click to Enlarge • The hurdle in question is $127.80, plotted in yellow on both stock charts. Though Mohawk hasn't been able to push above it, it has been repeatedly trying to since earlier this month.

• Underscoring the budding bullish effort is the above-average bullish volume seen in two of the past three trading days, and the fact that the blue 20-day moving average and the purple 50-day moving average line are in a position to act as support.

• If for some reason Mohawk shares respond bullishly after last quarter's earnings are posted, that will likely be the beginning of a more prolonged rally. That doesn't necessarily mean would-by buyers have to jump in right away, however.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

2019-07-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Prologis Inc. agreed to buy warehouse owner Industrial Property Trust for about $4 billion to bulk up its business catering to companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and FedEx Corp.The cash deal, which includes the assumption and repayment of debt, will probably close late this year or early next, Prologis said Monday, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg. The portfolio includes 236 properties in areas such as Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle and New Jersey -- with about 96% in markets Prologis is present. Combining businesses will lower costs relative to assets, it said.“This is a high quality portfolio that we think is really strategic,” Prologis Chief Executive Officer Hamid Moghadam said in a phone interview.Warehouses and logistics are increasingly favored parts of the real estate market, in part due to strong growth and occupancy rates. Demand from corporations stems from a necessity to meet customer expectations for faster delivery times. The growth of e-commerce would probably insulate the sector from some of the impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs on goods from China, analysts from Green Street Advisors said in May.Prologis, with a market value of more than $50 billion, doesn’t intend to raise equity to finance the deal. But it does aim to sell about 20% of IPT’s assets, Moghadam said. Three-quarters of that will happen in markets in which the company is already active, and the rest in places such as Salt Lake City and Memphis, where it isn’t seeking a presence.IPT, a nontraded real estate investment trust, was put on the block in February by its owner Black Creek Group LLC, Bloomberg reported at the time.Prologis was among bidders vying to own GLP Pte’s U.S. operations earlier this year, but was beaten out by Blackstone Group LP, which clinched the $18.7 billion deal. Still, the warehouse owner acquired DCT Industrial Trust Inc. last year for more than $8 billion, its second-largest deal after merging in 2011 with AMB Property Corp.“This is not our first rodeo, this is a very bite-sized deal for us and we feel confident about not only closing this transaction in a timely manner but properly integrating the portfolio and realizing the synergies,” said Moghadam. “We’ve got this down to a science,” he said.His firm estimates general and administrative expenses relative to assets under management will decrease 4%. It expects the transaction will be accretive to annual funds from operations, a metric used by REITs, by 5 cents to 6 cents a share.Other portfolios Prologis has eyed in the past year would have resulted in a larger portion of sales, Moghadam said. The REIT would have retained around 70% of GLP U.S.’s portfolio, a number that would have dropped further if it had bought IDI Logistics, he said.(Updates with Prologis CEO’s comments from third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, David Scheer, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Prologis to Buy Black Creek's IPT for $4 Billion

At least one portfolio is valued at $1 billion or more, one of the people said.Representatives for Blackstone and Prologis declined to comment.It’s not uncommon for real estate investors to divest non-core or non-strategic holdings they amass from large transactions. Blackstone sold a myriad of properties to a variety of buyers as part of its almost $40 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007.Warehouse tenants such as Amazon.com Inc. got a respite in the second quarter from what’s been a tight market. The available supply of U.S. industrial and logistics real estate -- the sum of vacant space as well as occupied space being marketed for new tenants -- snapped a streak of declines that lasted 34 quarters, according to a report this week from CBRE Group Inc.Still, big landlords remain bullish there will be ongoing institutional investment in the sector.

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To get Brooke Sutherland’s newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.It’s going to be unbearably hot across much of the U.S. this weekend, but the early returns on industrial earnings have been decidedly cool. A nearly 30% run in CSX Corp. shares heading into its second-quarter earnings report suggested this was a company where investors thought they could find shelter amid a growing body of worrisome manufacturing data. They were wrong. The shares slumped more than 10% the day after CSX reversed a forecast for low single-digit growth in revenue this year and predicted instead that revenue would dip as much as 2%. The East Coast railroad says it’s being cautious, but the time for conservatism is when you start the guidance-giving process, so that strikes me as an inadequate explanation for such a deep cut. CEO James Foote said the macroeconomic backdrop was one of the most “puzzling” he’s ever experienced and that there are no concrete signs of improvement in weak coal, intermodal and industrial volumes.Elsewhere in transportation, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and West Coast railroad Union Pacific Corp. actually saw their shares pop on earnings, but that seems to be a case of more realistic expectations than a drastically more positive view of the macroeconomic environment. J.B. Hunt was essentially flat going into earnings, for example, and Union Pacific had sold off in sympathy with CSX before it reported. Union Pacific said it expects second-half volume to be down about 2%, which implies a decline for the full year compared with an earlier call for a low-single digit gain – basically mimicking CSX’s move. The other challenge with CSX is that it appears to be far enough along in its conversion to precision-scheduled railroading that there isn’t as much fat left to cut as there is at Union Pacific. But it’s track record of improved performance is still relatively short, capping its ability to make market share gains amid a surplus of capacity and lower spot rates in the trucking market. Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise points out the sharp divergence in the performance of S&P 500 railroads and FedEx Corp. over the past, calling it a proxy of sorts for the trade war-inspired slowdown that’s hit companies with international exposure like FedEx harder than those focused on the domestic market. If U.S. railroad stocks fail to recover from the CSX-inspired selloff and the gap to FedEx narrows, that could be a sign that the domestic economy and the bull market are running out of steam, he writes. FedEx, of course, has plenty of idiosyncratic issues holding back its stock. The company’s annual report filed this week included interesting disclosures abut the risk of an activist shareholder getting involved and some additional detail on the logistics investments that could render Amazon.com Inc. a competitor. Things were a bit better at the multi-industrial companies, but there was still cause for concern. Textron Inc. said its aviation backlog slipped by $100 million in the second quarter as macroeconomic concerns and President Donald Trump’s threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on Mexico spooked business-jet customers. That’s counteracted by Honeywell International Inc.’s report of double-digit sales growth for new business jet equipment, but still a troubling sign of just how nervous people are about making big investments. You can usually count on Honeywell to churn out an earnings beat, and the company didn’t disappoint, raising its profit guidance for the full year. But the outlook wasn’t as robust as some analysts were expecting. Organic sales growth of 5% could end up being the pace to beat this quarter, but that was weaker than anticipated and a forecast for 2% to 4% growth in the third quarter would suggest an accelerating slowdown. The dynamic of somewhat disappointing sales numbers but steady earnings growth in some ways reinforces Honeywell’s argument that last year’s breakups and a pristine balance sheet will make it more resilient in a downturn, but I remain unconvinced that margins for anything except funeral homes are recession-proof. It helped Honeywell that the sales weakness was mostly confined to its safety and productivity solutions unit, the smallest of its four main businesses, and aerospace remained impressively robust with 11% organic sales growth. The industrial companies on tap to report earnings next week may not be so lucky, particularly 3M Co., which seems destined for yet another guidance cut to reflect the deepening slowdown.ALL BOEING WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A FLYABLE MAXBoeing Co. this week pre-announced a $4.9 billion after-tax second-quarter charge to reflect its estimate of compensation owed to airlines grappling with a grounding of the beleaguered 737 Max that’s now entering its fifth month. American Airlines Group Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. this week pulled the Max from their schedules through the beginning of November – a timeline that jibes with Boeing’s call for the plane to return to service during the fourth quarter. But the risk remains that the grounding stretches into 2020. The Federal Aviation Administration, mindful of restoring its reputation as the global standard-bearer of safety protocol, is keen to coordinate a return to service with European and Asian regulators. And while a fix for the flight-software system linked to the Max’s two fatal crashes has essentially been completed, there remain hurdles to remedying a separate issue with a microprocessor that was identified in June, including convincing the FAA that a software update is sufficient, according to the Wall Street Journal. Even if Boeing can get the plane recertified and flying again by the fourth quarter, it matters a great deal which particular month that happens. Airlines estimate it will take a month to 45 days to complete the maintenance necessary to bring the Max jets they already operate out of storage, which is to say nothing of the additional planes they had been expecting to support busy schedules. I would imagine airlines’ demands for compensation would rise materially if they are forced to scramble and reassess capacity for holiday flights. Ryanair Holdings Plc said this week it’s prudently planning for a December return of the Max, but pared its growth plans for the 2020 summer travel season. It can only accept six to eight new Max planes per month, which will leave the budget airline with about half of the fleet it had been planning on for that peak season. Data points like that make me highly skeptical of Boeing’s aspirations to ramp up to a 57-per-month production pace for the 737 program in 2020.A WORD ON WAREHOUSESThere has been a surge of spending over the past few years on industrial warehouse assets. The latest deal came this week , when Prologis Inc. agreed to buy Industrial Property Trust and its 236 properties in areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and New Jersey for about $4 billion. This follows Prologis’s acquisition of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. last year for more than $8 billion and its pursuit earlier this year of GLP Pte’s U.S. warehouse assets, which ultimately went to Blackstone Group LP instead for $18.7 billion. Meanwhile, Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Inc. is exploring a sale of its unit that owns warehouses as part of a strategic review meant to resuscitate its plunging market value, according to Bloomberg News. I understand the logic of these deals: Retailers are under immense pressure to build out their e-commerce capabilities and shorten their delivery times and on the face of it, that trend looks less vulnerable to the trade war and macroeconomic uncertainties than many others. Even so, it gives me pause to hear Honeywell say customers for its Intelligrated warehouse-automation business are pushing major system rollouts into the second half of the year. Intelligrated is still growing rapidly, with organic sales growth of more than 20% for the first half of 2019, and Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said he knew for a fact that the delayed orders hadn’t gone away. But going back to my earlier comment about funeral homes, I’m getting less confident that even this trend can withstand the test of a true downturn. I asked Bloomberg Opinion's retail expert Sarah Halzack what she thought. She pointed out that companies like Walmart Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. are too far along in converting their businesses to e-commerce to back out, whereas those who are already struggling such as J.C. Penney Co. will find it harder to justify making those kinds of investments.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEJohn Flannery has resurfaced. The former CEO of General Electric Co. will now be an advisory director to Charlesbank Capital Partners, a middle-market private equity firm managing more than $5 billion of capital. I’ve always felt a bit bad for Flannery, who spent 30 years working his way up the ladder at GE and finally ascended to the CEO post, only to find out that his actual job was going to be more akin to a garbage man. Sure, he made his share of mistakes as CEO. But the reality is he was probably never going to last in that job no matter what he did. GE needed one CEO to publicize and unearth the skeletons in its closet ($22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous Alstom SA deal, $15 billion reserve shortfall in the long-term care insurance business) and another CEO to try to fix the mess. That’s now Larry Culp. Still, it has to sting a bit that Steve Bolze, Flannery’s competitor in the race to succeed Jeff Immelt, is a senior managing director at Blackstone, a slightly more prominent firm than Charlesbank. Bolze is blamed by many investors for mismanaging GE’s power unit and exacerbating the financial pain from a slump in gas turbine demand.Crane Co.’s bid for Circor International Inc. got a last minute surge of support. Mario Gabelli’s Gamco Investors Inc. agreed to tender shares to Crane after the buyer raised its price to $48 a share earlier this month. Roughly 45% of outstanding Circor shares have been elected to be tendered, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. That’s not enough to force a merger (although there are still a few more hours before the tender offer expires at midnight), but it should be enough to get the attention of Circor’s board’s. In the wake of the Crane offer, Circor laid out a bold (and by nature, rather fluffy) plan to boost margins and lower debt. Shareholders are now signaling quite loudly that they don’t have much faith in the company’s ability to follow through. It’s pretty remarkable to see this level of pushback outside of an annual meeting, though. I had worried Crane’s bid might have been the victim of bad timing, with its offer becoming public a few weeks after Circor’s 2019 meeting. The fact that Circor’s board had privately received the Crane offer prior to the meeting and didn’t feel a need to tell investors about it has been one of Gabelli’s chief criticisms. This level of support from Circor shareholders may save Crane from having to wait a year to relaunch its bid with a proxy fight.Osram Licht AG, the lighting maker that’s agreed to sell itself to Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, disclosed this week that Austrian industrial manufacturer AMS AG had made a fresh offer for the company at a higher price. Bain and Carlyle are offering 35 euros per share, or 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion), while AMS had proposed to pay 38.50 euros per share, or about 3.7 billion euros. The problem is, AMS itself is valued at less than what it offered for Osram; it’s had negative free cash flow for at least the past two years; and it’s already carrying about 1.2 billion euros of net debt. Osram agreed to let AMS perform due diligence, but said the probability of a deal materializing was “rather low.” Literally the same day that its latest offer was disclosed, AMS said it was walking away. In some ways that’s actually kind of surprising – why wouldn’t you take the opportunity to do due diligence? But anyway, this amusing M&A adventure has now come to an end.Callon Petroleum Co. agreed to buy Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $3.2 billion including debt. Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett called it a “pretty lame deal all-in-all”, while my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning said the merger sounds a “distinct sad-trombone note.” Carrizo helps Callon double down on the Delaware Basin with contiguous acreage and lets it add free cash flow on the cheap, but it also dilutes its status as a pure-play operator by adding acreage the Eagle Ford region, where it may be harder to find cost savings. Some investors may have viewed Callon as a target and are disappointed to see it on the other end of a deal. The consolidation of shale players is healthy and necessary, Liam writes. But the fact that Carrizo has chosen to sell at a modest premium when its stock was trading at the lowest levels in a decade is pretty telling, too.CRH Plc agreed to sell its European plumbing and heating-distribution business to Blackstone for 1.64 billion euros ($1.9 billion). CEO Albert Manifold has been trying to steer the company toward higher growth markets including cement and raise money for acquisitions. This deal helps it do both. Davy analyst Robert Gardiner says the purchase price is attractive at about 16 times earnings before interest and taxes.BONUS READING Saturday Will Be Hot.

I included it in my group of 10 investments because in my past life writing about the financial advisor community, I found DFA to be an excellent company providing good advice for its clients. I'm not suggesting you should get a financial advisor, but if you do, DFA would be an excellent place to start. As for the fund itself, it has $9.9 billion in total net assets invested in a total of 157 real estate investments, 32% of which are specialized REITs, another 16% are residential REITs, and 14% are invested in retail REITs. Its top 10 holdings account for 41% of the mutual fund's net assets. The average stock in the portfolio has a weighted average market cap of $27.8 billion with a price-to-book of 2.8. It got its start in January 1993. Over the past 10 years, it has had just one year of negative calendar year returns. That was in 2018 when it lost 3% of its value. However, it managed to deliver double-digit gains in four of those years.   * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What Charging 0.18% plus whatever your financial advisor charges, it's an excellent way to play the real estate markets while getting professional investment advice.      Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio (FRESX)Source: Shutterstock The Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio (MUTF:FRESX) has been in existence since November 1986. Over the past 10 years through July 31, it has delivered an average annual return of 15.41%. Year to date it's up 19.81%.As of the end of June, FRESX had $4.3 billion in total net assets invested in a total of 48 stocks with the top five holdings accounting for 31% of the portfolio, 98% of which is invested in U.S. real estate companies. Office & industrial, residential, and healthcare real estate account for 75% of the portfolio. The primary portfolio manager on the fund is Steve Buller, who has been managing it since October 1998. He turns the portfolio 15% annually, which means the entire portfolio changes approximately once every six-and-half years. Over the past decade, out of 137 funds in its category, FRESX has been ranked in the top 7%, which helps justify its annual expense ratio of 0.76%.  Schwab US REIT ETF (SCHH)Source: Shutterstock One of the key features of many ETFs is that they come with reasonable fees. The Schwab US REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) is no exception. It charges the bargain-basement rate of 0.07% annually. The ETF tracks the performance of the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index, a passive index of U.S. real estate investments. The ETF got its start in January 2011. It has $5.7 billion in total net assets with the top 10 holdings accounting for 46% of the portfolio. The other 98 holdings accounting for the rest. Like many of the ETFs, mutual funds, and closed-end funds on this list, the top three holdings are Prologis (NYSE:PLD), Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), and Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). I discuss two of these stocks below.   * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip If you want cheap and good at the same time, SCHH stock is the way to go. iShares Global REIT ETF (REET)There's a big world out there. Don't let yourself get caught up in home-country bias. ETFs like the iShares Global REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:REET) is an excellent way to do that. By paying a reasonable 0.14% annually, REET gives you 65% U.S. real estate exposure along with 35% international exposure with Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, and Canada accounting for 22% of the fund's $1.7 billion in total net assets. The ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global REITS Net Total Return Index. The fund itself has a total of 300 holdings with the top 10 accounting for 25% of the total portfolio. The most significant holding outside the U.S. -- nine of the top 10 are U.S. real estate companies -- is the Link Real Estate Investment Trust, which trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and is the largest publicly traded REIT in Asia.  In business since July 2014, REET's delivered an annualized total return of 6.2% over the past five years, considerably less most U.S. real estate ETFs, but reasonable given its international exposure.  Consider this ETF if you want a hedge against a U.S. recession.  Vanguard Real Estate REIT (VNQ)If you're thinking about investing in real estate ETFs, or any ETFs for that matter, it always makes sense to consider Vanguard's options. In real estate, you have the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:VNQ), an ETF with $34.7 billion in total net assets invested in 189 U.S. real estate stocks with the top 10 holdings accounting for 42% of the portfolio. A $10,000 investment in VNQ a decade ago is worth approximately $38,650 today. In business since September 2004, the ETF's averaged a total return of 8.86% since its inception.   * 10 Stocks to Buy for Less Than Book As passive real estate ETFs go, it's got a relatively high turnover rate of 24%. That said, it charges just 0.12% for its management expense ratio, which makes VNQ another low-cost option to gain exposure to the U.S. real estate market.  Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)As real estate investments go, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) is easily my favorite stock. In June, I suggested that BAM would make an excellent one-stock portfolio, much like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), whose vast array of holdings make it more like an investment fund (without the fees) than a publicly-traded stock. Brookfield made the news this past year when it acquired Kushner Cos. 99-year lease on 666 Fifth Ave., an office building in New York that Jared Kushner's family bought at the height of the real estate market in 2006, using a whole lot of debt, getting themselves overextended in the process. Brookfield intends to renovate the building and add some retail to the mix to make it a more attractive real estate asset. If there's one thing about Brookfield, it's that it knows how to add value to the assets it buys. It's as patient an investor as you will find. As long as CEO Bruce Flatt is running the company, I continue to believe it is the best alternative asset manager in North America, if not the world.    Simon Property Group (SPG)Source: m01229 via Flickr (Modified)Retail Dive, which covers the retail industry, recently published an article entitled Is Real Estate Poised to Save Retail? It was a deep dive into the plans of Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and its malls. The retail apocalypse continues to be discussed by media pundits as if Simon's future is very much in doubt. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Simon is alive and well and continuing to grow.Three years ago, Simon, along with its largest rival, Greatland Gold (GGP), which coincidentally is owned by Brookfield, rescued teen/tween retailer Aeropostale from certain death. That led to speculation that it would do more deals like Aeropostale.However, it's only going to buy another retailer if it feels that retailer brings a sufficient amount of brand value to the equation along with enough volume that it's worth it for Simon to backstop a turnaround. Detractors view this as an act of desperation. I see it as smart business. If you have a retailer with 10 leases, you let it die. If you have a retailer with 100 leases, you try to bring it back to health. It's like the old saying about bankers from J. Paul Getty: &quot;If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.&quot;   * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Simon continues to reformat its malls to be more experiential and less product-driven. In 10 years, you won't be able to recognize its malls.  Public Storage (PSA)With all the recession talk recently, you couldn't find a better real estate investment than the self-storage business. They're virtually recession-proof. That's why Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), the largest storage company in the U.S., continues to be a smart place to put your money. I like the self-storage business because except for the cost of the real estate and build-out of the storage facility, they're relatively inexpensive to maintain, making it a great way to invest in real estate over the long haul. &quot;We joke how [tenant improvement allowance] is only $3 with self-storage: Grab a broom, sweep and then you lease it back up,&quot; said JLL Managing Director Steve Mellon recently.   In the most recent quarter ended June 30, Public Storage generated core funds from operations (CFFO) of $2.64, 2.7% higher than a year earlier. Yielding 3.1%, you get paid to wait for some of its locations' real estate to grow exponentially to the point where it makes sense to sell the property.  This is a buy-and-hold real estate investment if there ever was one.  Ventas (VTR)Source: Sunrise1981 via Wikimedia (Modified)My InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto recently picked Ventas (NYSE:VTR), one of the largest owners of seniors housing and other medical-related real estate, as a services stock worth owning for the rest of 2019 and beyond. Josh mentioned a staggering statistic: 10,000 Americans are turning 65 every day. Those people are eventually going to require a place to live where medical care and assisted living is part of the equation. Until then, they're going to be visited medical facilities more often to treat the natural side effects of aging. I have liked the stock and its CEO, Debra Cafaro, for some time. It's nice to see Ventas stock making some progress after a couple of years in reverse. Up 24% year to date through Aug. 7, including dividends, it looks as though the headwinds facing the REIT as it repositioned its portfolio, are a thing of the past. Yielding 4.4%, it's not the highest-paying REIT, but it provides you with access to the kind of real estate properties that are going to benefit from the aging of America. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-24,"There are plenty of benefits to having an allocation to real estate in your portfolio. From income generation to having an asset class that helps fight inflation, every investor should have some allocation to real estate. For most of us that aren't high net worth investors that means either owning one or two rental properties or buying real estate investment trusts (REITs).REITs make it real estate ownership easy and without many of the hassles that come with owning a rental property. With the security type, investors can gain access to a variety of property types and locations with one ticker. And thanks to their tax structure, REITs hand back much of their cash flows as dividends. However, there is one way that being a direct property owner does win big over REITs. And that's those sweet monthly rent checks from tenants.But REIT investors may not need to fret.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are a handful of top-notch and high yielding REITs that do reward their shareholders every month. And with these firms, investors big and small can finally gain all the benefits of a landlord without all the hassles.  * 5 Red Hot Housing Stocks Sprinting to Decade Highs With that, here are three monthly paying REITs to buy today. STAG Industrial (STAG)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.81%Talk about being in the right place at the right time. Thanks to rising e-commerce/omnichannel growth and a strengthening economy, STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) has been a winner since its IPO back 2011- offering plenty of dividend growth and capital appreciation. The key is that the firm focuses on warehouse and light industrial properties. These property types have been big winners in the shift towards reshoring and online consumerism. Rising demand and rents have simply translated into gains for STAG.But it's the kind of warehouses that STAG owns that sets it apart from rivals like Prologis (NYSE:PLD).STAG focuses on single and smaller warehouse properties. The benefit to the REIT is that often these warehouses can be bought on the cheap and below replacement costs. Secondly, tenant pricing power and quality for many of these small- and mid-size firms allows STAG to charge higher rents than other warehouse REITs. Since 2007, rents for Non-Super Primary markets -- the fancy way of saying STAG's niche -- have grown by nearly 16%. This contrasts to just 9% growth for Super Primary ones. In the end, the combination of these two factors has helped support STAG's FFO growth and dividends.To reduce risk, STAG has grown large. Today, the REIT owns more than 409 properties and no tenant makes up more than 2.1% of its warehouses. A strong balance sheet doesn't hurt either.The best part is STAG is willing to share the wealth via a growing monthly dividend. All in all, STAG could be one fo the best ways for investors to become a landlord via REITs. Apple Hospitality (APLE)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 7.31%When it comes to REITs, the lodging industry is often overlooked by investors. That's because, unlike something like an apartment building or medical office, hotel demand is very economically sensitive. So, historically, the lodging REITs have been a more volatile subsector of the market. But there are ways to reduce that risk and score a monthly dividend. Case in point, Apple Hospitality (NYSE:APLE).APLE owns 234 hotels across 38 states. Like previously mentioned STAG, the win for Apple comes down to its niche. The hotelier focuses on so-called select-service or room's focused hotel properties. These fall within middle ground between budget conscience travelers and upper-scale consumers. Moreover, select-service hotels tend to be frequented by business travelers who aren't very price-sensitive given then tend to use expense accounts or receive reimbursements for travel. Top brands in APLE's portfolio include Hilton's (NYSE:HLT) Embassy Suites and Marriott's (NASDAQ:MAR) Courtyard, Residence Inn, and TownePlace Suites concepts.What's great about the middle ground is that operating margins tend to be better than even upscale hotels. There's less demand from clients, but the rooms are still nice and command a premium over budget hotels. As a result, Apple has some of the best operating margins in the lodging sector while still maintaining high revenues-per-available-room (RevPAR) numbers.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Under $10 And it's used those margins to reduce debt, expand its portfolio of hotels and pay a steady 7.31% monthly dividend. LTC Properties Inc (LTC)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.50%Rising healthcare spending and the continued &quot;Graying of America&quot; could easily be two of the biggest megatrends facing investors these days. Better and greater access to healthcare solutions is only increasing longevity and our lifespans. That's a major problem considering the specialized facilities needed to care for the elderly. Luckily, LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) is up to the task.The LTC stands for Long-Term Care and REIT invests in senior housing and assisted living facilities. This is a particularly sweet spot in the medical property market as demand for these facilities continues to grow as longevity rises and more seniors need aid. Even better is that private-pay facilities can generate very high margins from tenants. Currently, LTC has about 200 properties under its umbrella. However, it continues to add deals that are instantly accreditive to its bottom line.The cool thing about LTC is that it is considered a hybrid REIT. That is, it owns both physical properties as well as invests in mortgages/provides loans to other developers. This creates a varied income stream for the REIT that helps pads its bottom line. Also helping is that fact that LTC doesn't operate the facilities, it just simply collects a rent check. This eliminates many of the risks associated with the healthcare sector.What it all really does is make LTC an earnings machine. Last quarter, FFO did rise slightly despite plenty of building/construction activity for the REIT. Meanwhile, LTC has managed to raise its monthly dividend 32% since 2010. Currently, LTC yields 4.5%.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-10-24,"Real estate investment trusts have been on a roll for a while now. It might be that the last time you heard from the REITs was when shopping malls were emptying out due to e-commerce competition and everyone was writing an epitaph for mall REITs.But those days are gone. And there are far more types of REITs than shopping mall owners (although some of the good ones have recovered well). In this low interest rate environment, REITs are in their prime. They can refinance debt on properties they currently own and save money, and they can also buy properties at lower total costs.Also, because of the way REITs are structured, they pay shareholders a cut of their net profit in the form of dividends, so you get a solid income stream. Income should actually be high on the priority list for any growth investor, and I explain why in this free investor briefing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlso, most of these businesses are U.S.-focused, so external trade problems aren't an issue to growth. But you can't just buy any REITs. Quality is important. And, as the shopping mall scenario showed, so are strategic sectors.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential Below, my seven top-notch REITs to buy for income are great choices for the long term. EastGroup Properties (EGP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.3%EastGroup Properties (NYSE:EGP) focuses on industrial properties around the U.S. It currently owns distribution facilities in Florida, California, Texas, Arizona and North Carolina.If you notice, most of those states have the largest ports in the U.S. and others have distribution hubs for e-commerce. And some have both. The point is, EGP is well positioned to take advantage of the true fuel of the U.S. economy, the U.S. consumer.And this is a very good time to be on this end of the market, as the U.S. economy continues to chug along and rates are likely headed lower.EGP stock is up 36% in the past 12 months and delivers a solid 2.3% dividend at current levels. Agree Realty (ADC)Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.9%Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is a REIT that buys, develops and manages properties for large national retailers outside the mall environment.Its clients include The TJX Companies' (NYSE:TJX) T.J. Maxx, Wawa, Hobby Lobby, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), Walgreen's (NASDAQ:WBA) and  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). These are high-quality clients with great credit quality, so the risk of default is minimal.Also, ADC operates as a net lease REIT, meaning the client pays all expenses related to property management, taxes and maintenance. This an even better deal for ADC, since it doesn't have to spend money on any of those issues. When you have an income play where the yield is backed up by a solid business model, that's a recipe for what I sometimes call Bulletproof Stocks.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold Through 2020 ADC stock is up 43% in the past year and still delivers a nearly 3% dividend. Spirit Realty Capital (SRC)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 5.1%Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC) is also a net lease REIT that has 255 tenants in over 1,600 properties. These properties span 48 states and their tenants represent 32 major industries.Its top five tenants are: Church's Chicken, Walgreen's, Home Depot, Circle K and CVS (NYSE:CVS).What's more, SRC's tenants are signed into long-term leases of 10-20 years, and their client base is full of quality companies that aren't going to be shifting their strategy quickly over time.SRC stock is up 24% in the past year, and it continues to deliver a generous 5.1% dividend. What's more, it's pretty fairly valued, even after its recent strong performance. Prologis (PLD)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.3%Prologis (NYSE:PLD) is all about logistics. And if there's anything that drives the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer at this point, it's next-generation logistical support.And while that word might not inspire a great deal of excitement, logistics are the backbone of the e-commerce industry -- the movement of goods from around the world to your home or office.It's a very big deal. And PLD is one of the biggest players. Currently it has nearly 800 million square feet of storage properties with 5,000 customers in 19 countries.Remember, moving goods from point A to B means having properties at point A and point B for greater efficiencies. This does expose PLD to the global economic slowdown, but its diversification means it can exploit areas of opportunity within its locations.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown And so far, it has worked -- the stock is up nearly 44% in the past 12 months and it comes with a solid 2.3% dividend. What's more, its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is still only 33, so it's not overvalued. That being said, beyond the P/E, there's a few other things you should be looking for in your stocks now. Extra Space Storage (EXR)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.1%Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) is a self-storage operation that has been around since 1977. It now carries a respectable $15 billion market capitalization and has operations in 38 states.To be more specific, it has 103 million square feet of available space across 910,000 units in 1,400 stores.It also offers reinsurance to EXR tenants for any losses in its stores. That insurance business is a solid way to build cash flow and build up a nice store of investment monies.Since 2008, people have begun moving around the country for opportunities, especially millennials. On the other end of the demographic spectrum, baby boomers are starting to downsize. Both are great trends for the storage business.Up 34% in the past year, EXR stock also sports a solid 3.1% dividend. Vereit (VER)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 5.6%Vereit (NYSE:VER) is another net lease REIT that focuses on high-quality tenants that are interested in long-term leases.It currently has around 4,000 properties in 49 states and Puerto Rico, with about 90 million square feet of space.Its top 10 tenant concentration makes up about 27% of its portfolio and includes the likes of Golden Gate Capital's Red Lobster, Family Dollar, Walgreen's, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and CVS.Casual dining and quick-service restaurants make up about 20% of its portfolio. As long as the consumer stays strong, this is a good choice, since the dining segment will stay strong. At Growth Investor, we are very much focused on the consumer trend in our economy, and you should be, too.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy VER stock delivers a very generous 5.6% dividend and that's after a 35% run in the past year. Kimco Realty (KIM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.3%Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) specializes in open-air shopping malls in the top metropolitan markets.Currently, it has over 420 shopping centers with 75 million square feet of leasable space. This is the new trend in brick-and-mortar shopping. It's all about one or two anchor stores with a lot of parking and then satellite stores off of them. Its focus is on strong retail locations with plenty of consumer demand.It has been around for nearly 60 years, so it knows how to deal with the dynamics of the U.S. retail space. And Kimco has mastered these retail dynamics through being a full-service REIT that manages and maintains the properties, unlike net lease REITs.KIM stock is up 42% in the past year yet it still produces a nearly 5.3% dividend yield. And its trailing P/E is only 26, which is pretty low for the top stocks in this sector. Why Dividend Growth Stocks Are So Important NowThese days, the global bond market is just going haywire: We've got falling and even negative yields overseas. But as investors retreat to U.S. Treasurys it's causing bizarre effects here, too. Just look at what happened this summer, when the two-year Treasury actually began to yield MORE than the 10-year Treasury.And even the 30-year Treasury can't be relied upon for good yield anymore. In August, its yield dropped below 2% for the first time ever.So -- whether you're managing big institutional cash, or your own portfolio -- you'll also want to look at the group I sometimes call the Money Magnets.Not only did these stocks earn an &quot;A&quot; in my Portfolio Grader tool, thanks to strong buying pressure and great fundamentals …The stocks also earn an &quot;A&quot; in my Dividend Grader tool.

2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Prologis Inc., one of the world’s largest warehouse owners, has agreed to buy Liberty Property Trust in an all-stock transaction valued at $9.7 billion, extending its reach in markets such as Chicago, Houston and Southern California.The transaction gives Liberty stakeholders 0.675 Prologis shares for each Liberty share they own, the companies said in a statement. That represents premium of about 21% based on Friday’s closing prices.Warehouses and logistics facilities -- Liberty’s specialty -- have become a hot part of the real estate market as more shopping moves online and consumers demand quick shipping. Blackstone extended its bet on e-commerce last month, agreeing to buy Colony Capital Inc.’s warehouse unit for $5.9 billion.Prologis itself has been a big acquirer of rivals in recent years.“The deal solidifies that the quickest way to increase exposure to fast-rent-growing warehouses is through M&A,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch.Shareholder Land & Buildings Investment Management began pushing Liberty to consider selling itself about a year ago. The firm, led by Jonathan Litt, said last month that a “credible party” had contacted the real estate investment trust with an interest in buying it at $60 a share.“The proposed sale of Liberty Property Trust to Prologis is a great example of maximizing value for all shareholders,” Litt said.The pricing of the deal is similar to Prologis’s purchase of DCT Industrial Trust and its pending takeover of Industrial Property Trust, Dutch said, adding that Liberty would still be the biggest of the three transactions.Including debt, the deal is valued at $12.6 billion. Prologis is buying a portfolio of 107 million square feet of logistics properties that’s owned or managed, as well as buildings under construction and land for future development. It also includes 4.9 million square feet of office space.“Liberty’s logistics assets are highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio, and this acquisition increases our holdings and growth potential in several key markets,” Prologis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hamid R. Moghadam said in the statement. “The strategic fit between the portfolios allows us to capture immediate cost and long-term revenue synergies.”Prologis plans to dispose of approximately $3.5 billion of assets on a pro rata share basis, including $2.8 billion of logistics properties and $700 million of office properties.Liberty shares have risen 21% this year, compared with the 55% jump in Prologis shares and a 45% gain for a Bloomberg index of industrial REITs.Liberty may be required to pay a termination fee of as much as $325 million if the deal falls apart.The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley advised Prologis, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. represented Liberty.(Updates with quote from investor.)&#92;--With assistance from Noah Buhayar, Patrick Clark and Scott Deveau.To contact the reporter on this story: Meghan Genovese in New York at mgenovese@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Giammona at cgiammona@bloomberg.net, Linus Chua, Kevin MillerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Prologis to Buy Liberty Property in $9.7 Billion Stock Deal

2019-10-29,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the year of the warehouse mega-deal, and the two largest players are running away from the pack.Blackstone Group Inc. and real estate investment trust Prologis Inc. are locked in an Amazon-fueled acquisition battle, gobbling up U.S. warehouse space in a bid to profit from rising consumer demand for fast shipping.Together, the two companies have inked warehouse acquisitions worth more than $38 billion in 2019. More than 40% of that total comes from a pair of deals announced in the last month.“There’s a huge amount of demand coming from e-commerce,” said Lindsay Dutch, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “The growth of online shopping and the desire for quick delivery times has really driven a need for more warehouses, especially in the last mile.”When the most recent transactions close, Blackstone and Prologis will own nearly 1.1 billion square feet of warehouse space in the U.S., more than the next 14 largest owners combined, according to data compiled by CBRE Group Inc.Their combined footprint could decrease as the companies dispose of newly acquired assets. Blackstone sold about $3 billion worth of logistics real estate to Nuveen Real Estate in October, and Prologis has said it will sell some assets.On Sunday, Prologis agreed to buy Liberty Property Trust for $9.7 billion, adding 107 million square feet of space in markets including Chicago and Houston. It was the third time in the last 18 months that Prologis has swallowed up a competitor, following deals for DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and Industrial Property Trust Inc.Blackstone, too, has been adding to its warehouse portfolio. In June, the private equity giant agreed to pay $18.7 billion for U.S. logistics owned by Singapore’s GLP Pte., and followed that with a $5.9 billion deal for more logistics space in September. Globally, Blackstone has spent roughly $70 billion on logistics space in recent years.There’s a simple reason the two warehouse giants are winning an outsized share of available deals, said Eric Frankel, an analyst at Green Street Advisors: They have capital available. In the case of Prologis, its scale allows it to pay a premium for property, Frankel said.While online shopping has grown rapidly in recent years, there’s reason to think the e-commerce boom has plenty of room to run. About 20% of sales in consumer electronics and apparel now come online, but only 4% of food and beverage sales happen there, according to eMarketer.Amazon and Walmart are investing billions to automate warehouses and accelerate delivery times, in part to help deliver on pledges they’ve both made this year to get millions of orders to customers’ homes in just one day.Amazon’s shift to next-day delivery “will raise consumers’ expectations,” Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman said in a note Tuesday. “To avoid losing relevance, retailers might also need to move to one-day delivery.”That could spur more warehouse deals, which accounted for 35% of large real estate transactions over the 12 months ending in September, according to Real Capital Analytics data on sales of portfolios and whole companies. That’s up from 20% in September 2015, as investors shift focus from retail and office deals to industrial real estate.For its part, Prologis is stepping up where competitors are backing off. In August, the chief executive officer for industrial REIT Duke Realty Corp. said that the company preferred investing in its development pipeline rather than paying up for a warehouse portfolio at current prices.Still, the recent run of large warehouse deals can’t go on indefinitely, if only because there aren’t many large portfolios left to buy.“The availability of high-quality portfolios is dwindling,” Prologis CEO Hamid Moghadam said in July.When those assets do hit the market, the company plans to compete for them, Moghadam said, because “we can really squeeze a lot more juice out of those oranges.”To contact the reporters on this story: Patrick Clark in New York at pclark55@bloomberg.net;Matthew Boyle in New York at mboyle20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Giammona at cgiammona@bloomberg.net, Steve DicksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Two Companies Are Dominating the Battle for Warehouse Space

In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (used for comparison because the majority of REITs are smaller companies) has gained 18.9%.Of course, people don't ordinarily invest in REITs to beat the stock market averages. They invest in them for income. By law, REITs must pay out at least 90% of their net earnings as dividends. The average REIT in the FTSE index delivers a dividend yield of 3.6%, compared with 1.8% for both the bellwether 10-year Treasury note and the S&P; 500&#92;. When the yield of bonds and stocks are so low, REITs become extremely popular.Real estate also provides diversification. While REITs are still stocks, they don't always move in the same direction as the broad market. And their above-average dividend yields are a nice shelter in a downturn.While you can invest in a real estate fund, such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), there are plenty of good individual REITs to buy, many of which offer high yields and reasonable valuations, despite the sector's towering heights this year. &quot;REITs are not a homogenous group,&quot; says Chris Kuiper, equity analyst at CFRA Research.

2020-01-10,"It has certainly been a long bull market. And growth stocks have led the charge.But in all this passion for growth, don't forget that income is an important part of your portfolio as well. It is a great asset when growth slows.And, while 2019 was a big year for stocks, remember that the trouncing the market took in the fourth quarter of 2018 made that possible. Last year's performance in many stocks doesn't look as impressive if you include that quarterly performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's why at Growth Investor we know it's important to have some stocks that will deliver solid returns and deliver a good, inflation-beating (and sometimes inflation-trouncing) dividend as well. You can take the cash, reinvest it, or let it pile up to buy other investments.Whatever you choose to do, it's smart to have some income in your portfolio.Below are seven high-yield real estate investment trusts (REITs) to ground your income portfolio. Low rates and strong lenders make this a great sector to start your income stock collection. REITs to Buy: Store Capital (STOR)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.8%Store Capital (NYSE:STOR) is actually an acronym for what the REIT specializes in -- single-tenant operational real estate.That means it focuses on maximizing the value of companies that run businesses like chain restaurants, health clubs, supermarkets, distribution facilities and retail.Mind you, it doesn't build or manage shopping malls. Just standalone stores.It's also a sale-leaseback structure, which means the companies sell the property to STOR and then lease it back so they can take advantage of the depreciation of the property.The idea has worked so well that Warren Buffett invested $377 million in the company back in 2017. That's nearly 10% of outstanding stock.The stock is up more than 25% in the past year and still delivers a very respectable 3.8% dividend. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.2%First Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) focuses solely on industrial real estate, like warehouses and light industrial properties.In the age of e-commerce, this is a very important sector. And with a $5 billion market capitalization, FR is a good-sized player.As we have seen with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) cutting ties with FedEx (NYSE:FDX), logistics is a very competitive industry at this point. And getting warehouses as close to customers' homes as possible means better possibilities for next-day and even same-day delivery.And that concept goes up the chain. Having products close to distribution centers is crucial. So, instead of stores popping up, it's warehouses and distribution hubs. It's the kind of business model that earns stocks a high grade in my stock-picking system.The stock is up 40% in the last 12 months, which has brought down the dividend to about 2.2%. But it's still trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 27, so there's still some value there. Prologis (PLD)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.4%Prologis (NYSE:PLD) is the stock you want if you're a true believer in the world of e-commerce. It's the largest industrial real estate company in the world.It has facilities all around the world. And by its $56 billion market cap, you can be sure it's a major player in this sector.What's more, now that the U.S. and China have sheathed their trade war swords for the moment, it allows the global economy some breathing space, not only on the retail level but also on the global business side as well.While 2020 may not be a massive year like 2019 was for U.S. stocks, the global market should fare better than it did last year. And PLD will benefit from that.The stock is up more than 45% in the past year, but that has dropped its dividend yield down to around 2.4%. That still beats inflation and gives you some solid growth to boot. Duke Realty (DRE)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.7%Duke Realty (NYSE:DRE) has been around since 1972, and has about 155 million square feet of industrial rental space in 20 key logistical markets in the U.S.It has warehouse properties in many of the major U.S. ports, which provides for solid, regular business. And because of its longevity, it has snapped up some of the best locations for its properties, giving it the ability to keep its properties busy, regardless of the economic cycles.As I always say in Growth Investor, the United States is the oasis around the world, so many of the best investments are here. Plus, since it has properties all across the U.S., it can avoid any regional downturns. And to further insulate it from market cycles, it also owns and manages medical office properties, which is another key growth area.It has a $13 billion market cap, so it's big, but not massive. And it has been in the business for a long time, so it knows what it's doing -- and is doing it well.The stock is up 30% in the last 12 months, and it delivers a respectable 2.7% dividend. Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.6%Armada Hoffler Properties (NYSE:AHH) is a geographically focused REIT, with a variety of properties in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.Currently it has over 50 properties, with 36 of them in Virginia. Remember, Virginia has two significant population centers. It surrounds Washington, DC -- which includes the Pentagon as well as Amazon's new HQ2 -- and even more densely populated is the Tidewater area, where there is one of the biggest naval shipyards in the world as well as significant military bases.Both these areas are booming. And AHH's mix of properties -- from multi-family housing to office buildings to student housing -- allow it to take advantage of the growth in these states.And since it's focused and has been around for more than 40 years, it knows its region very well, which helps when it comes to selling properties and buying new ones.Up 23% in the last 12 months, it delivers a lush 4.6% dividend. Arbor Realty Trust (ABR)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 7.9%Arbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR) has been one of my favorite REITs for a long time.It's not that big -- about $1.6 billion in market cap -- but it has a relatively new model that has been working well over the years.It doesn't own properties. It originates the financing on properties. And it focuses on some of the best sectors in the markets today -- healthcare, senior housing, multi-family housing and other commercial properties.By not taking ownership of the properties, its only risk is making sure the organizations it helps develop are reliable and the business looks sustainable.Having been around since 2003, it means the company survived the 2008 real estate market implosion. That's a good sign it knows what it's doing moving forward.The stock is up 29% in the past year and it delivers a whopping 7.9% dividend, yet it trades with a trailing P/E of 10. Between its growth and income prospects, ABR is a top candidate for my Money Magnets strategy. PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 8.3%PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE:PMT) is similar to ABR in the sense that it focuses on the origination of loans and not the ownership of property outright.The difference is, PMT focuses on the residential market. It does mortgages and mortgage-related loans (like refinancing and home equity lines).Now that rates will remain low and the economy is showing some stability, this is a good time for the housing market. Plus, as Gen Xers start to pay off their student debt and begin to start families, they'll be a driving force in the housing market in coming years.The stock is up 17% in the past year and has a very rich 8.3% dividend yield. But PMT stock has a trailing P/E of just 9. Even if the markets just edge higher slowly, this is a lot better than sticking extra cash in a CD. 'Money Magnets': The Best Dividend Growth Stocks AroundWhatever your portfolio size and goals, you'll also want to look at the group of stocks I've nicknamed the Money Magnets.Not only did these stocks earn an &quot;A&quot; in my Portfolio Grader, thanks to strong buying pressure and great fundamentals …The stocks also earn an &quot;A&quot; in my Dividend Grader. These stocks are able to pay great yields -- and have the strong business model to back it up.All in all, I've got 28 strong dividend growth stocks for you now in Growth Investor  -- averaging 4% yields -- far more than the S&P 500 or even a Treasury bond. These stocks are poised to do well as we continue to see international capital flow to the U.S. markets. Click here to see how I found these stocks, and how you can get great performance out of YOUR portfolio -- come what may.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-04-21,"Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD), the world's leading logistics real estate investment trust (REIT), sees its business slowing in the near-term, but believes that there will be a strong snapback in demand after a vaccine for COVID-19 is discovered.On its first quarter 2020 earnings conference call, management said that approximately 60% of its customers are growing, while 40% are shrinking. The company is seeing strong demand for logistics real estate, especially anything related to the consumer staples and e-commerce segments while hospitality and brick-and-mortar retail real estate is off. Management believes that the ""reduced demand environment"" will persist for the remainder of the year, but noted that e-commerce as well as inventory increases in the supply chain will provide tailwinds.In an update call held earlier in the month, management outlined the prospects for supply chains carrying incremental inventory moving forward in efforts to avoid the supply shock they just endured. Management believes that some supply chains could add as much as a 5%-10% to ""safety stock"" in the future.Prologis reported first quarter 2020 core funds from operations (FFO) of $0.83 per share, a penny ahead of analysts' expectations.  Prologis' Key Performance Indicators""Our strong first quarter operating performance is a result of our long-term focus on the world's top consumption markets. While the current environment is challenging, we are well-prepared. We have confidence in our team, our strategy and in the strength of our portfolio,"" stated Prologis CEO Hamid R. Moghadam.Prologis has seen an uptick in rent release requests, representing 4.3% of gross annual rent to date. Seventy percent of the requests have been denied, 23% are under review and 7% have already been granted. Prologis expects to grant rent deferrals in the form of a repayable loan due by the end of 2020 to clients representing less than 1% of the company's annual gross rent. The company has already collected 85% of rent payments for April, a level that is within 1% of normal payment collection rates.Management said that a high percentage of its customers will likely benefit from some form of government stimulus, but conceded that of its customers that are struggling, some will see longer roads to normalcy and some are likely to fail.Prologis modestly trimmed its outlook. The company now expects to see $3.55 to $3.65 per share in core FFO in 2020 compared to its prior guidance calling for $3.67 to $3.75. Year-end occupancy is expected to be in a range of 94.5% to 96% versus the prior outlook of 96% to 97%.  Management expects occupancy to spike higher around the time a COVID-19 vaccine is announced, noting that some experts are calling for this to occur next summer.Prologis has roughly 8% of its leased properties up for renewal in 2020.Management expects market rent growth to be flat in 2020 given the demand headwinds from the outbreak that have resulted in shutdowns and shelter-in-place mandates globally. They said that rent growth was 200 basis points better than expected in March and 400 to 500 basis points better that expected for its recently acquired portfolio. Prologis closed on the acquisitions of Liberty Property Trust and Industrial Property Trust, Inc. (IPT) earlier this year.The company's guidance assumes no new capital deployment other than the projects already under contract. Prologis is moving forward with speculative development that is fully committed and 30 previously negotiated build-to-suit agreements. The clients represented in all 30 of the build-to-suit agreements have ""indicated their intention to move forward as planned.""Management said that the cost to complete current projects stands at $1.6 billion.Prologis ended the first quarter with $3.8 billion in credit line availability and $800 million in cash. The company's debt-to-market capitalization ratio was 22%. Including the company's co-investment ventures of $3.1 billion and open-ended funds, it has ""well over"" $10 billion in investment capacity.""We entered the COVID-19 crisis in a position of financial strength. We have significant liquidity as well as investment capacity and our dividend is well-covered,"" said chief financial officer Thomas S. Olinger.San Francisco-based Prologis owns nearly one billion square feet in industrial real estate across 19 countries.

2020-06-18,"Leading global logistics real estate provider Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) believes the pandemic has &quot;accelerated the retail evolution&quot; and is &quot;pulling forward several years of adoption.&quot;The comments referred to the growing trend of retailers seeking to bolster their online presence and commitment to ecommerce fulfillment. These were some of the highlights from the real estate investment trust's (REIT) sixth installment of a special reporting series on the impacts COVID-19 is having on demand for logistics space.Ecommerce requires more space Findings from the report showed ecommerce penetration in the U.S. has spiked during the pandemic, reaching a level of more than 25% in April compared to just 15% at the end of 2019. The company is forecasting this metric to equal approximately 20% for the entirety of 2020 compared to the 16.9% forecast issued prior to the pandemic.Prologis estimates ecommerce fulfillment requires more than three times the logistics space than traditional brick-and-mortar retail sales. The primary difference in ecommerce is that all of the inventory sits in a warehouse rather than on retail store shelves until it is pulled for delivery. Additionally, many ecommerce supply chains retain larger inventories with more product variety and their fulfillment facilities require dedicated space for parcel packaging and shipping and processing returns. The report called out the 3x &quot;intensity-of-use&quot; ratio as a primary driver for the need of incremental logistics real estate. &quot;The persistently high ratio supports the need for additional e-fulfillment space should ecommerce penetration keep gains made during the Stay-at-Home Economy phase.&quot; This ratio has remained in the 3x to 3.5x range for the last five years, bucking the original expectation that the ratio would decline as e-fulfillment supply chains became more efficient.As both brick-and-mortar and ecommerce fulfillment supply chains seek improved resiliency and attempt to minimize the potential for future shocks to supply like those seen in March, the intensity-of-use ratio will likely move higher in both types of supply chains.In Prologis' prior installment in the reporting series, the company noted inventories were likely to increase by 5% to 10% to protect supply chains against future supply shock. This level of inventory growth produces an incremental need for 285 million to 570 million square feet. That report also indicated that re-tooling current supply chains to accommodate more e-fulfillment solutions would create net demand for an additional 140 million to 185 million square feet.Retail bankruptcies not likely to impact demand The recent report showed the potential offset to new logistics warehouse demand from retailer insolvencies may be minimal. Of the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in 2020, their logistics real estate footprint represents less than 20 basis points of total U.S. logistics real estate occupancy.Prologis said its portfolio of properties capture roughly twice the household income within 10 miles of the facility location compared to facilities operated by retailers that have recently filed for bankruptcy. Many of those companies operate large facilities in less populated areas, bucking the trend of turning products faster in smaller facilities located in consumption centers.Industrial activity rebounds in May Prologis' activity index, the Industrial Business Indicator, bounced off of historic April lows to a reading of 45.1 in May, a level the report referred to as &quot;consistent with a shallow recession.&quot; A reading under 50 implies contraction in warehouse activity.Prologis views the sharp bounce in the index as indicative that a demand slowdown for logistics space will be &quot;short-lived.&quot; The company said that its lease proposals increased 5.4% year-over-year in April and May.Chart: Prologis ResearchLogistics space utilization increased 90 basis points sequentially in May, but still remains approximately 150 basis points below pre-COVID-19 levels. Higher activity from some customers and swollen inventories for retailers with closed stores was credited with driving this metric higher.San Francisco-based Prologis owns nearly one billion square feet in industrial real estate across 19 countries, serving 5,500 customers in B2B and retail anTd online fulfillment.

2020-07-21,Is (PLD) Outperforming Other Finance Stocks This Year?,Is Prologis (PLD) Stock Outpacing Its Finance Peers This Year?
2020-07-21,"The world's leading logistics real estate investment trust (REIT), Prologis Inc (NYSE: PLD), said demand for logistics real estate has held up well through COVID-19, accelerating further during June. Lease proposals are up 21% over the recent 30-day period given the scarcity of logistics space.The San Francisco-based company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2020 financial results Tuesday, with core funds from operations (FFO) coming in at $1.11 per share, 12 cents better than the consensus estimate and 34 cents higher year-over-year.Earnings call reaffirms tightness in logistics real estate markets On its earnings call with analysts, management said rent collection has been &quot;excellent,&quot; with the company collecting 98% of June rents and 92.1% of July payments thus far. Deferred rents stood at 195 basis points in June and 70 basis points so far in July. France and the U.K. have been the most delinquent, but management asserts most of those late payments are from financially healthy companies that have taken the advice of their respective governments not to pay rents during the pandemic.Management believes it will collect all cash on future rents except for what it has already recorded as bad debt, approximately 60 to 90 basis points. Historically, the company's bad debt expense hovers around 20 basis points and hits the 56-basis point level during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.Rent amounts are expected to remain level in the second half of the year. Management still sees market rents in the U.S. on the favorable trajectory they were on prior to the downturn, albeit on pause currently. They believe high levels of occupancy and utilization entering this downturn place the logistics real estate market on firmer footing than in past recessions.Further, they believe supply chains will carry as much as 5% to 10% in incremental inventory or &quot;safety stock&quot; in the future to avoid supply crunches like the ones seen in the early part of the outbreak.Looking across the Prologis portfolio, 60% of its customers are expanding while some are shrinking. Verticals seeing the most strength are home improvement, including appliances, and food and grocery. Management said that while Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been busy building out its distribution footprint, market leasing activity has been &quot;more broad-based than just Amazon.&quot;The company's book of business is more diversified now as e-commerce accounts for 24% of new leases after climbing as high as 40% during the peak of the shutdown mandates.On the potential for retail conversion — converting big-box retail properties into logistics warehouses — negatively impacting the tight supply dynamic, management expects conversions to occur but notes the process isn't easy. Most retail spaces have strict reciprocal easement rules and rezoning is a requirement. The conversion from retail to industrial is tough as retail locations are based in densely populated areas and local homeowners don't want the heavy-truck traffic in their neighborhood.Asked why they haven't sold more of the properties that were acquired in recent deals as planned, management said they are in no rush to sell as the company is &quot;underleveraged.&quot; However, they did highlight one transaction.They are selling the Platform Portfolio, 22 warehouses in the U.K. that were acquired in the $13 billion acquisition of Liberty Property Trust. The properties are stand-alone facilities, outside of Prologis' core portfolio that consists primarily of assets in logistics and industrial parks. Management said they are receiving two to three times more letters of interest than originally expected. The initial guide price has been reported to total 435 million pounds (the U.S. $555 million).Guidance raise Prologis raised its 2020 guidance for core FFO to $3.70 to $3.75 per share, compared to the prior range of $3.55 to $3.65 and ahead of the consensus estimate of $3.59.The company increased its outlook from the first quarter for development starts to a range of $800 million to $1.2 billion, still roughly half the initial 2020 guide. It also increased expected building acquisitions to a range of $500 million to $600 million and added in $250 million in new spec projects as they are much more confident in building spec now than they were in April.The company's first-quarter guidance assumed no new capital deployment other than the projects already under contract.Second-quarter resultsConsolidated revenue increased 60% year-over-year to $1.27 billion, with rental revenue increasing 35% to $944 million. A more than threefold increase in strategic capital revenue and previous portfolio acquisitions were the key drivers. Lease starts increased 14% to 42 million square feet, customer retention climbed 150 basis points to 80.9%, but the occupancy rate slid 110 basis points to 95.7%. Asia saw a 320-basis point decline year-over-year in occupancy, down 210 basis points from the first quarter.The 34-cents-per-share increase in core FFO was in part due to a 23-cents-per-share increase in net promote income, returns paid by third-party investors for performance exceeding expectations. No net promotion income was recorded in the prior-year period.Prologis' key performance indicatorsPrologis ended the second quarter with $4.05 billion in available credit and $549 million in cash. Including open-ended funds and liquidity of $3.3 billion in its co-investment ventures, Prologis has more than $13 billion in investment capacity. The company's investment funds have raised more than $2.2 billion in equity this year.The company's debt-to-market capitalization ratio was 20%.Shares of PLD are up 4% compared to the S&P 500 and FTSE NAREIT Composite, which are up less than 1% on the day.Prologis' industrial real estate portfolio exceeds $90 billion in gross book value and total expected investment. The company's nearly one billion square feet of owned and managed properties spans 19 countries, serving 5,500 customers. Many of its warehouses in the U.S. service ports on both coasts, regional distribution hubs, and rail and intermodal facilities.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden.  * YRC loan under scrutiny; board shied away from company stock in 2019  * Comcar bankruptcy sale hits snag on trailer title dispute  * Truckload earnings have good start, Cass data still ‘lagging'See more from Benzinga  * Carriers May Face Penalties, Shutdowns Under Virginia COVID-19 Regulations  * FreightWaves 3PL Summit: Reducing Workforce Costs With Hubtek's TABi Virtual Assistant And Colombian Nearshoring  * Pandemic, Economy And Market Oversupply Weigh On GATX's 2020 View(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-13,"The total value of goods passing through a Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) facility is estimated at $2.2 trillion annually, up 69% from the company's 2017 throughput. That equates to 2.5% of world GDP and 4.4% of global household consumption.In the U.S., $1.4 trillion of throughput, or 6.3% of GDP, resides in a Prologis warehouse at some point during the year.These were a couple of highlights in a report performed by advisory firm Oxford Economics on the economic impact of the world's leading logistics real estate investment trust (REIT). San Francisco-based Prologis commissioned the firm to refresh the company's study, &quot;Future Flow of Goods,&quot; which was first compiled in 2017.&quot;This study shows just how critical logistics real estate is to the vitality of the global economy,&quot; stated Prologis Chairman and CEO Hamid Moghadam.The growth in warehouse throughput is in part due to an increase in customers ordering goods online, with fulfillment being accomplished without the product ever reaching a retail store. In its second-quarter earnings report, Prologis said 24% of new leases signed were related to e-commerce. That grew to 40% during the peak of COVID-19 shutdowns.E-commerce in the U.S. has grown in the mid-teen percentage range over the past two years, up 14.8% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020, according to the Census Bureau. The increase in e-commerce fulfillment is driving the need for logistics real estate higher.Prologis recently indicated the supply chain disruption caused by COVID-19 could result in many companies carrying 5%-10% more inventory in the future to avoid the supply shocks that have marked the pandemic.However, Prologis' 69% two-year growth rate isn't indicative of the increase other logistics REITs are seeing. The company has seen outsize growth compared to the industry due to a couple of large portfolio acquisitions. Earlier this year, Prologis closed on a $13 billion transaction for Liberty Property Trust and a $4 billion deal for Industrial Property Trust. The company has also inked several expansion projects and other ventures, which drove consolidated revenue 60% higher year-over-year in the second quarter.By comparison, the Prologis portfolio included 684 million square feet in 2017 and represented 2.4% of GDP in the 19 countries where it operates. In 2019, the company's portfolio grew to nearly 1 billion square feet, touching 3.5% of GDP in those countries.The report also showed the jobs impact Prologis has. More than 850,000 people go to work each day in a Prologis facility, up 57% since 2017. The report estimated that activities at a Prologis facility directly and indirectly support 2.8 million jobs globally, including 1.3 million in the U.S and 334,000 in China.The report concluded that Prologis' total global economic impact from operations in its facilities accounts for $226 billion annually.&quot;Every day, Prologis sees many of the goods that make modern life possible flow through our distribution centers, which in turn underscores the interconnected nature of global trade,&quot; said Moghadam.See more from Benzinga  * US Weekly Intermodal Traffic Goes Positive For First Time In Months  * The Daily Dash: Tax Penalties, HOS Exemptions And A Better Way To Price Insurance  * HMM Makes Steep Climb Toward Profitability(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

After all, somebody has to store, process and deliver that mountain of goods. Here's a way to cash in now, with plenty of income and growth to follow. A Pro at Problem-SolutionsPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is one of the largest warehousing and logistics support companies in the US and around the major economies of the globe. It has 4,655 buildings amounting to 963 million square feet (MSF) of warehouse and related facilities.Its occupancy is currently running at 95.7%, and it's expanding its capacities with eager tenants. It added new facilities in the second quarter and expanded and locked-in tenants at others. Its commenced new construction on additional facilities that are 100% pre-leased and committed with more in the works.Like other real estate investment trusts (REITs), it has some stressed tenants, but that only amounts to 0.5% of its overall rents. And rent collection continues to rebound strongly, hitting 98%.The company calculates that $2.2 trillion worth of goods flow through its facilities on an annual basis. And in the countries where it operates, the goods and services running through amount to 3.5% of those nations' gross domestic products (GDPs). That equates to 2.5% of the globe's overall economy.Its top customers leasing properties are a &quot;who's who&quot; in logistics and commerce. They include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), DHL Worldwide Express, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS (NYSE:UPS) and XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO).Home Depot (NYSE:HD) wouldn't have its depot without Prologis. And it even has some data centers for its customers Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others. A Pro at Income & GrowthRevenue at Prologis is up over the trailing year by 18.8%. And that includes the highly challenging first and second quarters of this year, complete with remote work, stay at home and all of the lockdowns and cross-border limits.But that isn't just a one-off good year.

It's only valued at 2.3 times its intrinsic (book) value. This is far cheaper than the average S&P Real Estate Index member, which is running at 3.3 times book.

2020-09-01,"When it comes to betting on long-term stocks set to benefit from the novel coronavirus acceleration of secular trends preceding the pandemic, the most obvious plays are in digital technology.Academic research papers are being churned out to explain just how Covid-19 has changed the world of business permanently. Some industries and sectors have fared much better than others during the crisis.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just one example of a company that's benefited from Covid-19, with higher e-commerce revenue, greater demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and even growth in digital advertising. Founder Jeff Bezos is now worth almost $200 billion as a result of AMZN stock rising by 80% in the first nine months of 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns Of course, some industries haven't fared nearly as well. Airlines are one sector unlikely to see any semblance of normalcy for several years.So which are the best industries to invest in right now? Here are 10 long-term stocks to ride this wave:  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  * Prologis (NYSE:PLD)  * Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)  * Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY)  * Kinaxis (OTCMKTS:KXSCF)  * Chegg (NYSE:CHGG)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Teladoc (NASDAQ:TDOC)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)While these stocks have benefited from coronavirus tailwinds, they were already well-positioned for gains in our increasingly-digitized world. Let's dive right in. Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Amazon isn't the only e-commerce business to benefit from Covid-19, but it is the biggest.Stock Twits founder Howard Lindzon recently interviewed Alex Danco on his Panic With Friends podcast. Danco's take on Amazon says all you need to know about Jeff Bezos and company:&quot;In order to compete against Amazon, you need to have taste or you need to be ok with losing.&quot;A lot of people probably think they have taste, but Danco's talking about bankable taste, and that's much harder to come by. In March 2018, I argued that Amazon wanted to own your home. Not literally, of course, but to be the provider of every product and service found in your house. And it would do so through its Prime services.&quot;In Amazon's case, it increases the number of Prime members and the amount those members spend annually by providing everything you need to run your home and life,&quot; I said back in 2018. &quot;Over time, revenues will exponentially climb, and with it, the price of Amazon stock.&quot;AMZN stock is up 127% in the two years since. I expect it to continue to move higher as it grabs additional market share across people's lives. Covid-19 tailwinds have only accelerated this land grab.  Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Intuitive Surgical was a major player in robotics even before Covid-19 hit the world. Now, its surgical systems have become crucial to medical professionals.Wired published an article in March discussing the difficulties of getting robots into hospitals:&quot;A cruel irony of the coronavirus pandemic is that medical professionals know better than anyone that social distancing is critical for slowing the rate of new infections, yet they're forced to be the closest to the disease. And those that need social interaction perhaps more than anybody -- the elderly -- are the ones who need to isolate the most, since they're the most susceptible to the disease.&quot;In this instance, writer Matt Simon is talking about robots providing care to patients in hospitals and the like, but it illustrates why robotics are necessary to the future success of hospitals and other medical facilities.Intuitive could also partner with iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) to develop a robotic orderly that helps humans do their jobs more effectively while reducing the spread of infectious diseases.  * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns With Intuitive already a big part of hospital life, the acceleration of robotics in healthcare is bound to help ISRG stock continue moving higher. Prologis (PLD)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com This segment of the real estate industry was benefiting from e-commerce long before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 has accelerated this trend.&quot;Accelerated adoption of e-commerce was definitely a positive trend of the pandemic,&quot; said Michael Coppola, a partner with Bluewater Property Group. &quot;E-commerce has changed our industry. We'll all be attuned to how much of that sticks.&quot;How good has this positive trend been for owners of industrial real estate? Beyond their wildest expectations.&quot;The e-commerce increases we've seen in the last few months have been astounding,&quot; Duke Realty vice president of leasing and development, Stephanie Rodriguez, said in June. &quot;In this short amount of time, we're outpacing where we thought we'd be in three years.&quot;Prologis, the world leader in logistics real estate with 963 million square feet of space in 19 countries, is ideally situated to benefit from this acceleration. Despite the gains it will be seeing from e-commerce, PLD stock is up just 14.6% year to date through August 26. As far as long-term stocks go, I think investors are undervaluing Prologis' future potential in 2020. Look for that to change in 2021 and beyond. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com With so many people working from home for the foreseeable future, augmented reality (AR) is going to experience an acceleration in demand for products that allow businesses to provide a simulated in-person customer experience.&quot;[T]he use of AR technology for collaboration and remote support of frontline workers has soared, enabling experts to be much more productive in helping to debug problems and resolve production issues remotely,&quot; U.K. industrial innovation technology specialist Jim Heppelmann told IoTNow in May.&quot;COVID-19 has meant industry has been forced to adapt quicker than it probably would have done under normal economic circumstances, but now they've had a taste of the operational and financial benefits it can deliver, I can see a major rise in adoption.&quot;In April, InvestorPlace contributor Eric Fry discussed how Covid-19 would accelerate technology changes, and how Nvidia would benefit from those changes.&quot;To protect your portfolio, you need to have exposure to these nascent trends. And let's be clear: All roads lead to Nvidia. Thanks to the company's dominance of the GPU market, it is at the very center of several powerful multi-decade growth waves, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, AI and machine learning,&quot; Fry stated back on April 8.  * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns I couldn't agree more. That's why I believe NVDA stock is an excellent long-term buy. Accor (ACCYY)Source: Shutterstock I would bet my left arm that one of the big companies operating ghost kitchens in the U.S. will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the next 12 months. It's a business that just seems tailor-made for someone with a big name in the restaurant industry to raise half a billion and find such a target.But this isn't about SPACs; it's about ghost kitchens, and ACCYY stock in particular.At the end of June, The New Yorker discussed why ghost kitchens would be our future. If you don't know what a ghost kitchen is, it is a restaurant that's expressly set up for take-out and delivery only -- no in-house dining.The subject of the article was Reef Technology, which is backed by SoftBank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). Reef operates kitchens in 18 cities across the U.S. It also repurposes parking lots into dining spaces. The pandemic has accelerated its plans.In February, I recommended Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) because of C3, the mall owner's partnership with SBE Entertainment Group and Accor, to develop 200 ghost kitchens in the U.S. by the end of 2020.While a lot of restaurants have been laying off people, C3's been hiring. While you could go with Simon, I like Accor because it owns 50% of SBE Entertainment Group, run by hospitality and real estate entrepreneur Sam Nazarian.Malls have to do something with all that empty retail space. Why not ghost kitchens? Kinaxis (KXSCF)Source: Blackboard / Shutterstock Of all the stocks on this list, Kinaxis is most likely the one least familiar to U.S. investors.Based in Ottawa, Ontario, the company's RapidResponse cloud-based supply chain management software has garnered a lot of attention, not to mention business, this year due to all of the supply chain issues resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic.My wife is in the construction business. You wouldn't think it would be hard to get ahold of bathtubs right now, but the pandemic has made it difficult for companies across industries to maintain their supply chains.On August 10, Kinaxis raised its guidance for 2020. Covid-19 had everything to do with that change. In the three months ended June 30, company sales increased by 45% over last year to $61.3 million. In 2020, it expects revenue of at least $216 million, up from guidance of $211 million in the previous quarter.&quot;Kinaxis has quite simply never been more relevant,&quot; stated CEO John Sicard in a statement. &quot;There has never been more attention on global supply chain resilience and the power of concurrent planning to provide the agility needed to respond to daily disruption.&quot;  * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns Back in 2018, I discussed how Toyota (NYSE:TM) started using Kinaxis' software to handle its supply planning instead of doing it by hand. I expect more companies to lean on Kinaxis in the years ahead as supply chain management becomes even more critical than it already is. Chegg (CHGG)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Last July, I wrote about seven stocks to invest in that are making life easier for students. One of those picks was Chegg, an online platform that helps individuals become better students by providing tutoring, writing instruction and grammar correction, better study aids, etc.&quot;Chegg might not be profitable just yet, but it will be. Buy in now while its shares are still affordable,&quot; I wrote on July 16, 2019. Chegg is up 75% since then.   In the second quarter, Chegg had 3.9 million subscribers for its Chegg Services offering, which includes all of the aforementioned services. For the quarter, subscriber base grew by 29%, while revenue was up 31%. With permanent changes to education expected post-Covid-19, Chegg delivers a winning formula. It might fall back in the near-term, given how hot it's been in 2020. However, long-term, I like it a lot. And so does Piper Sandler. which has an overweight rating and a $90 target price on CHGG stock.   Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com The obvious pick when it comes to virtual meetings stocks is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), whose stock was trading below $70 at the start of the year and now is closing in on $300.While there's no denying its success, Zoom is a niche specialist. By contrast, Microsoft has several businesses that have benefited from Covid-19 -- Teams, Cloud, Gaming and Windows -- and should continue to outperform the competition in the months and years ahead.Now Microsoft is teaming with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to buy TikTok's U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand businesses. Estimates suggest the duo will have to pay anywhere from $20 to $30 billion for the short-form video application's business in those countries.While there are other bidders for TikTok, there's no doubt that they'll be looked upon in a positive light by U.S. government regulators.    * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella continues to show why he's one of the best chief executives in America.     Teladoc (TDOC)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Before Covid-19, I'm not sure many people thought telehealth or virtual medicine would become an everyday norm for Americans. Post-Covid, I'm sure many patients will go back to in-person visits with their primary healthcare provider. On the surface, this suggests that Teladoc's revenues could be at risk. That said, I'm confident that Teladoc has built this reality into its business model. Recently, Teladoc announced it would acquire Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) in an all-stock transaction worth $18.5 billion. Teladoc shareholders will own 58% of the merged company and Livongo Health shareholders the rest. My InvestorPlace colleague Matt McCall recently reminded investors that mergers don't always work out so well. Matt, you're preaching to the choir here. On July 9, I recommended that investors consider Livongo Health's stock because it would stay hot for years to come:&quot;With an asset-light business model, I find it hard to believe Livongo's revenues are going to slow anytime soon. Further, it has more than enough cash to survive the novel coronavirus and anything else Mother Nature chooses to throw at the world. I see LVGO as the diamond-in-the-rough of the seven hot stocks on my list. It's going to surprise a lot of people in the future.&quot;Well, 18.5 billion reasons later, the merger gives Teladoc a broader foundation upon which to grow its market-leading telehealth business. Long-term, Teladoc's a winner. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com This last pick probably seems at odds with reality. Covid-19 has decimated small business. And while it might be hard to imagine small businesses rebounding anytime soon, in my experience, these are some of the most resilient entrepreneurs around. I'm not trying to downplay the facts. According to McKinsey and Co., small businesses were much less prepared for the economic shock of the pandemic, with approximately one-third operating at break-even or even at a loss pre-Covid. This is where Shopify comes in.It has the resources and know-how to get businesses rolling again. This technology platform's reason for being is to help small businesses to be successful. If they win, Shopify wins.In Canada, the company partnered with the Canadian government to launch Go Digital Canada, expressly set up to help small businesses go digital.  &quot;From our perspective, small businesses, they are the backbone of the Canadian economy. They make up 98 percent of Canadian companies,&quot; Sylvia Ng, general manager of Shopify's Start product line, told BetaKit in July. &quot;The fact that they're faced with these unprecedented challenges due to COVID right now [made us want] to provide support to help bring these businesses online, and help future proof that backbone of the Canadian economy.&quot;  * 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns Ditto for the U.S. I first recommended SHOP stock in May 2017 and I still recommend it today.

2020-11-10,"One of the more ambitious initiatives in Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD) history began with LED lighting.Several years ago, the San Francisco-based logistics warehousing giant embarked on what turned out to be a successful plan to drive down its warehouse lighting costs. Prologis then realized it could offer its customers LED retrofits at prices they couldn't obtain on their own. What's more, Prologis could help customers avoid the inevitable time and resource commitments to search for and vet suitable suppliers.The episode sowed the seeds of a project that became known as ""Essentials,"" which after a decent amount of spade work launched in mid-2017. Whether it be forklifts, conveyors, robotics, janitorial services or soft drink machines, the mission behind Essentials is the same: to rely on Prologis' supplier connections and enormous scale to help customers facilitate the inside-the-warehouse procurement process and buy or lease goods or services at more favorable rates through their relationships with the developer. As Prologis tweaked the model, the across-the-board upside began to emerge. Its network of established vendors would gain additional business opportunities. Customers could drive down costs and make life easier and more productive for themselves. Meanwhile, Prologis would pocket profitable revenue — it charges a fee for the service on top of the negotiated rent for the warehouse space — by wringing more value out of its size. ""You can't do this without scale,"" Gary Anderson, the firm's COO, said in a late October interview with FreightWaves, referring to the Essentials program.In business lingo, Essentials would be considered a ""turnkey operation."" Anderson has tried to take a less consultant-speak perspective. The Essentials model is built to work with customers at the local level to get them up and running quickly and cost effectively. Then, it helps them manage their supply and procurement demands as they evolve, he said. The value add for a tenant beyond any cost savings, Anderson said, is in collaborating with a dedicated Prologis customer support team to identify current and future procurement needs and in having the trusted resources readily available rather than having a customer spend time searching for them. Either through full ownership or investment ventures, Prologis operates across 976 million square feet in 19 countries. It has about 5,500 customers.""You couldn't do this kind of operation without scale,"" said Anderson, referring to Essentials. ""I've got people in every market.""To support the program, Prologis has merged previously siloed functional disciplines into dedicated ""customer experience"" teams working with locally based operators, Anderson said. Prologis tries to avoid escalating the interactions up the customers' corporate hierarchies, believing local warehouse managers have the best understanding of their facilities' current and future needs. (During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual meetings have replaced in-person gatherings and Prologis has built a website, Prologisessentials.com, to onboard customers and keep the process going with its existing base.)As it refined the customer-service concept, Prologis came to grips with the reality that for all its expertise, it could do a better job of deepening its customer relationships. ""We weren't as customer-centric as we needed to be,"" Anderson acknowledged in the interview.The program, which has been kept at a relatively low profile since its launch, does not ""leverage Prologis' balance sheet,"" according to Anderson. Instead, the company connects customers with vendors and financiers to help execute transactions. The financial terms will vary, though it's  doubtful a company that's not Prologis' size could strike a better deal if attempted on its own. Prologis doesn't get involved in cost analysis for its customers, Anderson said. ""Our customers know what their costs are."" There is a lot of runway for Essentials to taxi, Anderson said. At companies of comparable size, 20% of the largest customers generally account for about 80% of the business. However, at Prologis, 20% of the largest customers comprise just 20% of its business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Prologis' largest customer by square footage, makes up just 3.5% of its revenue. That leaves a lot of small to midsize businesses that lack the size or the network to cost-effectively procure warehouse goods and services, Anderson said. Bigger companies could also find Essentials to be a valuable service depending on the specific market or the scope of operations, he added.According to Prologis' analysis, the typical good-sized company's global supply chain costs work out to $132 a square foot. Of that, warehouse rentals account for about $6 a square foot. Transportation accounts for about $60 per square foot of that cost pie. Labor is next at the equivalent of $42 per square foot, followed by inventory carrying costs at $18 a square foot equivalent, based on company data.Labor is Prologis' customers' ""single largest pain point"" and it is an area the Essentials program eventually plans to penetrate, according to Anderson.  The company has partnered with community groups in various cities to hire and train 25,000 warehouse employees by 2025. Programs like these strengthen long-term landlord-customer relationships — the average Prologis lease length is five years — and helps improve the value of a facility that Prologis has developed and could own for 50 years, Anderson said.""The building owner has more of a stake in developing high-quality labor because they own the building,"" Anderson said.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Mexico Avoids Tariffs On Steel Used In Energy Sector  * Workhorse Says 36% Of Plant Workers Impacted By COVID(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of course keeps chugging along, but none of the add-to-cart clicks will mean anything if the items aren’t there in the warehouses to ship.
Much of the stuff that we all buy is either assembled or originated in Asia and particularly in China. And from factories in Shenzhen, Chengdu and beyond, these goods need to make their way through to export warehouses, including those owned and run by Prologis (NYSE:PLD).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
This leading warehouse/logistic company keeps these warehouses humming along and leases paid, which feeds a dividend yield of 2.3%.
Prologis is also on the other end of the crossing of the Pacific with its facilities to accept goods as they are readied for further transport throughout the U.S.
The company continues to be my go-to for warehouses and logistics and keeps performing for shareholders. Over the trailing five years, the stock has returned 168.3%, including the year to date return of 14.6%.
But there’s more to know about the shipping market, especially what happened between the warehouses in China and ports in the U.S.
Shipping Isn’t Free
Containers are what goods come in when they arrive in U.S. ports. And getting them here requires a very important and growing collection of container and shipping companies.
One of the leading indexes for shipping across the Pacific from Asia to the U.S. is the Shanghai Shipping Exchange Index, which tracks pricing from the shipping exchange where companies and brokers do their battles for access to ships and containers to move the goods.

Shanghai Shipping Exchange Index – Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.
After a bit of a surge earlier this year, the market really went south as COVID-19 took hold on both factories in China and markets in the U.S. But after sliding in demand into May, demand has been surging. This is causing shipping rates to soar, with the Shanghai Index climbing to date by 37.3%.
Another good indicator of all Asian-sourced shipments headed into the U.S. market is the Port of Los Angeles Inbound Containers Index. This tracks the number of standard twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

Port of Los Angeles Inbound Containers Index – Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.
The number of TEUs has been soaring since March, climbing through to the most recent data by 130.0%.
This is all very good news for shipping companies. And one of my favorites is a company that doesn’t operate ships but instead owns and leases them out to operating companies.
Think of it as a landlord of the high seas. It leases and collects rent on ships and does so with little to no operating expenses for the ships.
Seaspan was acquired by an interesting investment company called Atlas Corporation (NYSE:ATCO) that also owns APR Energy, which owns and provides larger scale clean power generating mobile power facilities. These are used for both critical backup for all sorts of government and industrial customers and works well on its own.

Atlas Corporation (ATCO) – Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.
Seaspan’s ships are running full out right now with 127 units that are young at an average age of seven years and are currently leased under lucrative and dependable contracts by some of the leading shipping companies eager for needed capabilities to ship and deliver goods.
Revenue is soaring right now for ATCO with the current quarter showing a gain of 36.6% following the prior quarter’s surge of 32.1%. The holding company is run really efficiently, and this shows up in operating margins running at 60.7%.
It continues to be shareholder-focused with a dividend yielding 4.3%.
ATCO also has a Seaspan-backed preferred stock that works with an income focus – the Series H Preferred (ATCO.PH), CUSIP#81254U304. It pays a fixed and dependable quarterly distribution that yields 7.9%.
The Value of the Box
Remember as a kid when a big box showed up at the house? You might have cared about what was inside, but it was the box that held a lot more attention. A fort? Something to be transformed into a plane or a ship or even a playhouse… Boxes are great for all of that.
But TEUs, the big boxes of big boxes, are what makes shipping work. And they are not only surging in demand, they are both in shortage in number and out of place right now.
The major surge in shipping from Asia to the U.S. has led to containers getting stuck in and around ports. There hasn’t been much of a need to use them for goods heading to Asia. And in turn, shipping companies are now short TEUs in Asian ports.
This is leading to two things. First, some shipping companies are shipping the boxes empty just to get them back to Asia where they are short in supply. And second, those with container boxes are leasing them out to ever more eager customers.
This problem led me to another problem-solution company in Triton International (NYSE:TRTN). This is the leader in TEUs and leases them out to shipping companies.

Triton International (TRTN) – Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.
This was a bit of a sleepy company until more recently. And while the stock is getting more attention in the market, it is quite cheap at only 1.6 times its intrinsic value of all of its boxes and other net assets.
Yielding a nice 5.0%, it proves that boxes can have a lot more value than what’s inside.

2021-02-04,"Global rents on industrial real estate properties increased 2.9% during 2020, according to logistics real estate giant Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) Even with several sectors of the economy meaningfully impacted by the pandemic, tenants were willing to pay up for logistics space. The San Francisco-based company published its annual Logistics Rent Index Wednesday. The report showed rents in the U.S. and Canada climbed 3.2% during the year as surging e-commerce growth accelerated need for current and incremental space. Many supply chains are reevaluating inventory needs, often opting to carry higher stock levels to avoid future shortages. Further, supply chains are seeking locations closer to consumers to shorten delivery times and improve e-commerce execution. ""[The] willingness to spend on expanding logistics networks has increased as users view e-commerce distribution and speed to market as competitive advantages for revenue generation,"" the report stated. ""At the same time, the incremental cost of logistics real estate remains a small portion of total supply chain costs, with rents representing approximately 5%."" The Baltimore/Washington market led the way in 2020, recording the highest rental growth. Increased competition in adjacent markets like New Jersey and Virginia drove rents higher in Baltimore as tenants looked for less expensive alternatives. Strong trade and tight supply in the East landed Toronto and New Jersey/New York City in the top-10 markets for U.S. rental growth. Other market leaders were gateway regions like California's Inland Empire, Pennsylvania, Dallas and Atlanta. Source: Prologis The report noted that the overall 2020 growth rate deteriorated from the 8% level recorded in 2019 as new supply entered the market and the pandemic caused disruption. Prologis reported on its fourth-quarter call that net absorption in the U.S. reached a record 100 million square feet during the quarter. More than 300 million square feet of space was brought to the market during the year. ""The strength of logistics fundamentals was tested and proven in 2020 and underscored structural trends that the pandemic accelerated,"" the report stated. Not surprisingly, negative growth rates were recorded in most markets during the height of the outbreak, the second quarter, except for in Japan and Brazil, which remained positive throughout the year. North America and Brazil (+5.9%) led rent growth in 2020 as replacement costs moved higher. Markets with excess supply like Houston, Poland and West China recorded declines. Rent growth throughout Europe inched higher, up 0.3%, with the greater London area seeing the biggest increase. 2021 outlook The need for increased inventories, more space and close proximity to the consumer, the result of mass e-commerce adoption, are expected to carry 2021. There is also a growing need for updated and modern space to accommodate improved supply chain technology. However, COVID-related disruptions are expected to continue but with less severity than in 2020. The report expects economic recovery will spur along cyclical demand during the back half of 2021 but cited the speed of inoculation as a determining factor. Growing competition for a limited number of parcels that are able to be developed is driving up land costs in the U.S., especially in infill areas. Regulatory headwinds along with resistance from community organizations are adding to development hurdles. Inflows of capital into the logistics real estate markets, along with higher replacement costs and constrained supply, will increase competition for existing properties and new developments. The report cautioned that the ""wall of capital"" that has targeted industrial real estate markets could lead to ""areas of oversupply."" Prologis' management team provided full-year 2021 expectations on the fourth-quarter call. The company expects rents to increase by 5% in 2021, with last-touch and gateway distribution markets in the U.S. leading the increase. ""Substantial structural demand tailwinds remain, replacement costs continue to rise and new supply is unlikely to meet this demand in most markets, in turn setting the tone for a year of strong rent growth,"" the report concluded. The Prologis Logistics Rent Index compiles trends in market rent growth, net of concessions, for logistics properties, along with the company's insights on local market pricing dynamics. Prologis' industrial real estate portfolio stands at nearly 1 billion square feet of owned and managed properties and spans 19 countries. Roughly $2.2 trillion in goods, or 2.5% of the world's GDP, move through a Prologis facility each year. Click for more FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden.

2021-03-11,"The research arm of San Francisco-based real estate investment trust Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) said in a report issued Wednesday the pandemic has ""forever altered"" the landscape for logistics real estate. ""The long-term structural growth rate of logistics real estate has risen"" as ""economic growth now requires more logistics real estate than in the past,"" Prologis Research asserts. Not surprisingly, the surge in e-commerce fulfillment is driving the change. E-commerce fulfillment requires more space In 2020, global e-commerce penetration increased at a rapid rate, up 390 basis points, accounting for a full five years of adoption, according to the report. E-commerce accounted for 20% of all retail sales last year compared to only 4% in 2011. E-commerce requires more than three times the space of traditional brick-and-mortar operations because all of the inventory sits in a warehouse. A large portion of merchandise in a retail store is kept on shelves. Also, online product menus have more variety and can experience greater volatility in sales, both requiring incremental space. Prologis expects the share shift to e-commerce from brick-and-mortar to represent at least 125 million square feet of additional space required annually through 2025. That forecast only includes the U.S and Europe. The group is calling for global e-commerce penetration to increase 150 basis points per year over the next five years. Some of the drivers cited were rising incomes among millennials — 23% of the world's population — as well as an increase in dual-income households, both of which are key targets for retailers. Also, internet access has expanded to include more than 2 billion people in the past decade. ""Innovation and supply chain investments made during or in the wake of the pandemic should increase competitiveness of online options. This is especially true for segments with low e-commerce penetration prior to the pandemic such as grocery and home improvement,"" the report stated. There is also the expectation that many supply chains will look to operate with inventory levels that are 5% to 10% higher than normal in efforts to avoid the stockouts that were recently experienced. Prologis sees higher inventories creating the need for 57 million to 114 million square feet of additional space annually over the five-year period. The forecast doesn't factor in any sales growth. However, the group does expect a transition to spending on experiences, including in-store shopping, later in 2021 as the vaccine distribution advances. Growth abroad is moving the needle The report cited a growing global market for e-commerce as more economies see incomes advance and companies with well-established e-commerce supply chains look to replicate their success abroad. ""The resilience of the supply chain is being tested as companies expand globally, in turn driving the need for modern stock and decentralized networks. Coupled with a rising consumer class, this worldwide upgrade should generate the need for three to four billion square feet or more of modern logistics stock over the next cycle."" That forecast suggests the adoption rate of modern logistics space could increase from 35 square feet per household today to roughly 40 to 50 square feet by 2030. The report also noted that many tenants are now willing to pay higher rents in exchange for ideal locations. Rents only account for 5% of total supply chain costs compared to transportation, which can take up to half of the budget. Sophisticated supply chains view warehouse location as a competitive advantage and less of an expense. Paying a higher rent in the right location is often negligible compared to choosing a less optimal spot. Additionally, advances in technology and warehouse automation have helped neutralize the impact of higher rents and labor costs in heavily populated urban areas. ""Demographic, economic and technological mega-trends will continue to drive the future of retail and supply chain planning, raising the structural long-term growth rate of logistics real estate demand through the next decade and beyond,"" the report concluded.

2021-03-24,"The e-commerce market continues to drive the industrial warehouse market in the U.S. as warehouse operators snap up capacity whenever possible. RPG, a developer in San Diego County in California, has acquired a 202,844-square-foot facility at 1 Viper Way in San Diego for $26.1 million. Cushman & Wakefield represented Stockbridge, a private equity real estate investment management firm, which sold the property. Cushman has been retained by RPG to handle project leasing. RPG intends to redevelop the property and optimize it for e-commerce and distribution center users, as well as potential manufacturing. The firm will remove the mezzanine and add dock and grade-level doors to the front of the building and feature cross-dock loading with 28-foot clearance heights. ""1 Viper provided one of San Diego's largest lease-up opportunities and was a rare and versatile opportunity enabling the ability to execute multiple lease-up strategies, including either as a single or multi-tenant facility,"" said Aric Starck, vice chairman of Cushman. ""The reposition opportunity uniquely positions 1 Viper to capitalize on the unmet demand for distribution and last mile requirements in San Diego with superior loading capabilities and great clear heights while also providing a significant discount to reproduction cost."" The conversion of the property to handle e-commerce is part of a vast expansion of e-commerce warehouse capacity. E-commerce requires as much as three times the warehouse space as traditional brick-and-mortar warehousing. Real estate investment trust Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) expects e-commerce to require an additional 125 million square feet of space each year through 2025 in the U.S. and Europe. CBRE looked at the warehouse trends in its 2020 North American Big Box Review and Outlook. The company defines an industrial big-box facility as a warehouse or distribution center of 200,000 square feet or more. ""E-commerce retailers signed more deals in big-box facilities than ever before, while third-party logistics providers (3PLs) expanded in logistics hub markets to better serve their growing customer base,"" the CBRE report said. Transactions involving big box facilities increased in 2020 to 349.5 million square feet, up from 280 million square feet in 2019. The number of transactions dedicated to e-commerce only reached 27.1% in 2020. There is also the expectation that many supply chains will look to operate with inventory levels that are 5% to 10% higher than normal in efforts to avoid the stockouts that were recently experienced, a recent Prologis report noted. The company sees higher inventories creating the need for 57 million to 114 million square feet of additional space annually over the five-year period. Prologis' report noted that millennials, which now make up 23% of the world's population, are driving retail sales and therefore boosting logistics demand. Dual-income households and the expansion of internet access to more of the world's population is also changing retail, the firm said. ""Consumer expectations have increased in a permanent way, favoring convenience, choice, reliability and immediacy. Naturally, the combination of new digital options and a desire for convenience have propelled the adoption of e-commerce,"" the report explained. ""Taken together, this intensity of use generates substantial incremental demand as a greater proportion of retail goods are sold online.
