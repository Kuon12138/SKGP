2019-06-17,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Novo Nordisk&apos;s  Victoza, a liraglutide injection, for the treatment of young patients 10 years or older with Type 2 diabetes. Although Victoza has been FDA-approved to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes since 2010, it is the only non-insulin drug approved for children other than metformin, which was approved for pediatric use in 2000. &quot;Victoza has now been shown to improve blood sugar control in pediatric patients with Type 2 diabetes. The expanded indication provides an additional treatment option at a time when an increasing number of children are being diagnosed with this disease,&quot; said Lisa Yanoff, acting director of the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA&apos;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to keep blood sugar at normal levels. It&apos;s the most common form of diabetes, normally occurring in patients 45 years or older. However, in the past two decades, its prevalence among younger patients has dramatically risen. More than 5,000 new cases of Type 2 diabetes are now diagnosed each year in the U.S. among people younger than age 20, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.

2019-10-22,"The winter holiday season is kicking into high gear now. With that in mind, it's time to start positioning your portfolio for 2020. It's a great time to cut loose some stocks that have stopped working and redeploy the capital elsewhere. Tax-loss selling in particular can make for a great time to jettison some old positions and pick up more promising stocks to buy going forward.And now, as 2019 winds to a close, it's time to start thinking about more defensive stocks. Over the past two months we've seen a clear rotation out of pure growth stocks into more value-oriented names. Particularly with the move in interest rates, investors will demand safe income-paying stocks to buy in 2020. Here's seven safe stocks that should be great buy-and-hold candidates for at least the next year.   Stocks to Buy: Altria (MO)Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 7.6%InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt appears that the bottom may be in for the tobacco stocks. The sector has rallied sharply since I highlighted it recently. As these things tend to do, it appears the general media scare around vaping illnesses is starting to taper off. Additionally, more and more focus is going to the vaping of THC, often in illicit cartridges. Very few of the reported lung problems so far have been tied to Juul or other credible regulated nicotine suppliers.This doesn't mean Juul's problems will go away overnight. In the long run, however, I expect Altria (NYSE:MO) to make money on its vaping investment. That's in sharp contrast to the market, which has recently been pricing MO stock as if the company will need to write off the full investment entirely.As it is, Altria's existing cigarette sales along with cash flow from its stake in Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is enough to cover the dividend. If and when Juul starts providing meaningful cash flow to Altria, it will support a higher share price and dividend -- but you don't need to justify the current $46 MO stock price and greater than 7% dividend yield. Over the long haul, tobacco companies have continued to make tremendous amounts of cash flow despite considerable regulatory intervention and downright hostile media coverage.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy Vaping worries will pass sooner or later; the desire to consume nicotine, however, isn't going anywhere. By the end of 2020, people that bought Altria when it was cheap will be enjoying their dividends with the vaping scare already long forgotten. Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.1%It's almost unbelievable that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock remains this much of a value. The company has announced all sorts of good news this year, but the share price hasn't gone anywhere yet.The company brought in a highly credible new CEO in the form of Charles Scharf, the former head of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and Visa (NYSE:V). Those are two of the largest and most reputable financial firms in the country. Wells Fargo's critics had slammed the company, saying management was untrustworthy and that the company couldn't attract a competent outsider CEO. The board proved them wrong and brought in a superstar new chief executive. Scharf's particular competence in financial technology matters will assist Wells Fargo greatly.WFC's earnings have also come in stronger than expected. People have been slamming the bank stocks all year. As interest rates have dropped, people are afraid of what will happen to banks' profit margins. Yet Wells Fargo's diversified business has continued to generate steady earnings despite the net interest margin headwind.That point, combined with the company's excess capital position, leads to the dividend. Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, companies have stockpiled capital in response to regulatory demands. Capital levels reached historically extreme levels, in fact. Now the regulators are starting to loosen up a bit, and that is letting the banks put money back to work. Wells Fargo is doing so with both a double-digit dividend increase this year and a massive share buyback. Management intends to repurchase more than 10% of all outstanding WFC stock over the next year. With the company paying an over 4% dividend and providing a massive persistent bid under the share price with the buyback, Wells Fargo is a great safe stock holding for 2020. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3%Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) isn't the most exciting stock on this list by any means. But it is one of the safest. In fact, the company has been a bedrock of conservative portfolios for an entire century now. And nothing has changed. The company remains well-diversified with business operations spanning prescription drugs, consumer health and hygiene products, and medical devices.J&J runs as a decentralized firm, giving each unit independent management and operating authority. This creates a high level of resilience, as Johnson and Johnson has always been able to offset weakness from any one division or product with strength in others. Now, for example, the company is seeing weakness in consumer products but strength elsewhere has balanced it out.Why JNJ stock for 2020 in particular? Recently, the company has been dinged by lawsuits for both its involvement in the opioid crisis and various other matters. It just got hit with another scare this past week, as JNJ stock slumped on news of a baby powder recall. However, some folks tend to trade the headline and not think about the longer-term impact. Generally, J&J is able to get fines reduced greatly on appeal, and despite many decades of making sometimes controversial healthcare products, it has rarely gotten stung with true shareholder-value destroying liabilities.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown With JNJ stock down 20% from its highs despite a strong rally in defensive stocks, there's a great argument for locking in the stock's rock-solid dividend for 2020, along with a potential run-up in the share price to $150 as lawsuit fears diminish. Dow (DOW)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 5.9%Dow (NYSE:DOW) is not the safest company on this list. There's generally a trade-off between dividend yield and safety of said dividend. But at least through the end of 2020, Dow should be able to maintain its current dividend level, offering shareholders an almost 6% yield. And the stock price could appreciate nicely as current recession fears and worries about the chemical market recede.Simply put, Dow is a high-yield company that also faces significant potential trade war disruption. Throw in all the confusion around the recent spinoff, and investors don't quite know what to make of the new DOW stock. My take, at least through the end of 2020, is to look for a safe 6% dividend yield and the possibility of some nice share price upside if global economic sentiment improves.Already, we've seen some significant improvement on the economic front. Not only does data keep coming in reasonably strong, now the yield curve has reverted to normal. Remember everyone panicking over the yield curve inversion a few months ago? That's gone now. A company like Dow wins the most as the economic tide rises again. At 11 times forward earnings, DOW stock is a bargain too. Public Storage (PSA)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.3%Looking to park some money away for safekeeping at a higher interest rate than you'd get at the bank? Why not consider stowing it at Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)? Real estate investment trusts have been hard stocks to buy lately -- the sector has soared to new all-time highs as investors hunt for yield. This has made valuations extremely expensive for real estate stocks in general.Due to concerns about pricing and capacity in the self-storage space, REITs like Public Storage have trailed their peers to an extent. PSA stock is up nicely this year, but it's still well short of its all-time highs, at least for the time being.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now That could change in 2020 though. New self-storage site building has slowed down dramatically. Meanwhile, the industry remains fragmented with mom-and-pop operators holding a major portion of the business. This gives Public Storage the opportunity to keep using its industry-best balance sheet to pick up properties opportunistically and create additional growth. And at worst, PSA stock would tread water, safely kicking out its rock-solid dividend as Americans continue to store their belongings, regardless of the economic winds. Walgreens (WBA)Source: saaton / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.3%Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is having a bad year. And this bad year comes on top of a series of mediocre ones. Dating back to 2013, WBA stock has been merely flat during a raging bull market. Don't bet against Walgreens forever though. In fact, 2020 could be the rebound year for WBA stock.You may not know Walgreens as a safe conservative stock play. Historically, Walgreens has had a surging share price, and as a result, a relatively low dividend yield. Things have changed though. With the prolonged stagnation in the share price, Walgreens' dividend yield has now moved up to 3.3%.That's in large part because Walgreens' earnings continue to grow, and it pays a higher and higher dividend with every passing year. In fact, it's a dividend aristocrat stock with more than 25 years of consecutive dividend hikes.There are long-term concerns about the company's business model. Drug pricing is a question mark, and investors fear that Walgreens will earn lower profit margins on prescriptions in the future. Meanwhile, front-of-the-store sales of convenience goods such as soda and candy may be pressured due to the changing retail climate. Still, Walgreens has proved resilient over the decades and any sort of political clarity on drug pricing in 2020 as the election plays out could send WBA stock sharply higher. In the meantime, enjoy the stock's highest dividend yield in ages. Novo Nordisk (NVO)Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.2%If you're a newer investor, you may not have heard of Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). You've certainly heard about its products though. Novo is the world's leader in producing insulin and other therapies for diabetes. As the diabetes public health crisis continues to worsen both in the U.S. and abroad, Novo's importance in the global healthcare system increases with every passing year.Short of some massive dietary and lifestyle changes, it's hard to imagine a world in which the rate of diabetes declines significantly in coming years, given current demographic trends. This, in turn, will ensure that Novo Nordisk has much work to do.NVO stock is still down significantly from its all-time highs. There was a major concern about insulin pricing a couple years ago, and even with that largely resolved, shares aren't back to their peak -- yet. The company just picked up a huge regulatory approval, adding a specific catalyst to the company's already powerful demographic tailwinds. Novo pays a steadily rising dividend (as measured in its home currency, Danish Kroner) and should enjoy a significant share price increase in 2020 as well, making it a perfect growth and income opportunity in a defensive safe stock.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned DOW, JNJ, MO, NVO, PSA, WBA and WFC stock.

2020-09-22,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 September 2020 – Today, Novo Nordisk announced results from three phase 2 clinical trials for insulin icodec, an investigational once-weekly basal insulin analogue, which were presented during the 56th European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2020.  The first showed that switching to insulin icodec from other basal insulins using two different switch approaches was efficacious and well-tolerated compared to once-daily insulin glargine U100 and the switching approaches were without an increased risk of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemic episodes compared to once-daily insulin glargine U100.1 This 16-week phase 2 clinical trial involved 154 adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs and once/twice-daily basal insulin  randomised to once-weekly insulin icodec with or without a loading dose or insulin glargine U100.1,2 The primary endpoint of the trial, the blood sugar ‘time in range’ 3.9–10.0 mmol/L during weeks 15 and 16, showed that people receiving insulin icodec with a loading dose demonstrated a significantly greater ‘time in range’ compared to insulin glargine U100 (73% vs 65%, respectively). People who received insulin icodec without a loading dose demonstrated similar blood sugar ‘time in range’ compared to insulin glargine U100 (66% vs 65%, respectively).1“We know that many people with type 2 diabetes prefer simplicity, meaning fewer injections and more convenience than what is currently provided with once- or twice-daily basal insulin treatment regimens,” said Dr Harpreet Bajaj, lead trial investigator and endocrinologist, LMC Diabetes & Endocrinology, Ontario, Canada. “This phase 2 trial demonstrates the potential benefit insulin icodec could offer to people with type 2 diabetes in need of insulin therapy, aiding easy transition onto a new treatment option without the daily burden and complexity that is associated with current therapies and potentially even experience more time in good glycaemic control with low risk of hypoglycaemia.”Key secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in HbA1c, which were not statistically significantly different for icodec with and without a loading dose compared to insulin glargine U100 (–0.77, –0.47 and –0.54 % points, respectively). Rates of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemic episodes, also known as a hypo or low blood sugar, were similar between insulin icodec with a loading dose and insulin glargine U100 (observed rates of level 2 [<3 mmol/L] and 3 [severe] hypoglycaemia were 0.78 and 0.79 events per patient year of exposure for insulin icodec and insulin glargine U100, respectively), and numerically lower for insulin icodec without a loading dose (0.15 events per patient year of exposure). No new safety issues were identified in relation to once-weekly insulin icodec and no severe episodes occurred in this trial.1Data comparing the effect of different titration algorithms of insulin icodec with insulin glargine U100 to better understand the optimal titration for a once-weekly basal insulin in people with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetics were also presented at the meeting. In this 16-week trial, all three once-weekly titration algorithms for insulin icodec investigated were shown to be well-tolerated and efficacious, and demonstrated an improved or similar ‘time in range’ versus once-daily insulin glargine U100, depending on the titration algorithm applied.3,4Results from the 26-week phase 2 clinical trial in insulin-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes where insulin icodec demonstrated comparable blood sugar lowering and a similar safety profile to once-daily insulin glargine U100 were also presented at the EASD Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.5,6 The data were previously presented at the 80th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2020.7“As a leader in diabetes innovation, Novo Nordisk understands that there is a need to continue to offer innovative treatment options to support people living with diabetes and improve outcomes,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. “We are excited by the phase 2 data that have been presented at EASD 2020 and ADA 2020 for insulin icodec, which demonstrated its efficacy and tolerability, and has the potential to offer a simplified treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin treatment, as well as the option for those to switch.”The phase 2 trials will inform the trial designs for the phase 3 clinical development programme for once-weekly insulin icodec, which Novo Nordisk will initiate later in 2020.For more news and media materials from Novo Nordisk at EASD 2020, please visit: https://www.epresspack.net/novonordiskEASD2020/phase-2-once-weekly-insulinAbout the phase 2 switching trialThis 16-week, randomised, open label, treat-to-target, phase 2 trial compared the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec with and without a loading dose versus once-daily insulin glargine U100* in 154 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.0–10.0%) with oral antidiabetic drugs and once/twice-daily insulin. A unit to unit switch (or a 20% reduction for those receiving twice-daily basal insulin or insulin glargine U300 prior to randomisation) with and without an initial 100% loading dose of insulin icodec was investigated compared to insulin glargine U100.  Insulin doses were titrated weekly based on the lowest (if below target) or the mean of 3 pre-breakfast self-measured blood glucose values to a target of 4.4–7.2 mmol/L. The primary endpoint was ‘time in range’ 3.9–10.0 mmol/L (70–180 mg/dL) based on continuous glucose monitoring (Dexcom G6®, Dexcom Inc, CA, USA) during weeks 15 and 16. Secondary endpoints included HbA1c and body weight changes from baseline to week 16, weekly insulin dose during weeks 15 and 16, and hypoglycaemic episodes.1,2About insulin icodecInsulin icodec is an investigational, long-acting basal insulin analogue with a half-life of approximately one week.8 Once injected, insulin icodec binds strongly but reversibly to albumin. This results in a continuous, slow and steady release of active icodec to achieve effective lowering of blood sugar throughout the week. The injection volume of once-weekly insulin icodec is equivalent to daily insulin glargine U100 due to the concentrated formulation.9About Novo Nordisk  Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

2020-09-24,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 September 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced the results of the CAPTURE study, a global non-interventional study to uncover the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk and its management in people living with type 2 diabetes. The study, the first of its kind and involving nearly 10,000 participants from 13 countries across five continents, showed that 1 in 3 people with type 2 diabetes have established cardiovascular disease, and 9 in 10 of these had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is caused by the build-up of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls, which narrows the vessels and results in reduced blood flow, potentially leading to events like heart attack and stroke. CAPTURE also highlighted that only 2 in 10 people with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are receiving a glucose-lowering treatment with proven cardiovascular benefits.“The findings of the CAPTURE study are significant for anyone involved in the care of people with type 2 diabetes. The data highlight that while the prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease within the type 2 diabetes population is high, the vast majority are not being managed with treatments that are proven to reduce the risk of potentially life-altering cardiovascular events,” said study investigator Dr Ofri Mosenzon, who consults for Novo Nordisk and the Diabetes Unit at the Hadassah Medical Center in Israel. “It is critical that we prioritise cardiovascular disease as a key factor in the management of type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes need to be more aware of their risk factors and physicians need to be actively screening for them. Today, we can address this risk through treatments with proven cardiovascular benefits, as recommended by various treatment guidelines.”For the first time, information on cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes has been gathered from both primary and secondary care settings, also reflecting that a significant proportion of people with type 2 diabetes are being treated by primary care physicians in conjunction with diabetes specialists.“Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of disability and death among people with type 2 diabetes. Until recently, the importance of this link between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease was not fully recognised on a global scale,” said Stephen Gough, chief medical officer at Novo Nordisk. “Through our ongoing investment, including the CAPTURE study, Novo Nordisk hopes that with increased understanding of the disease and its management, healthcare professionals will have greater knowledge of the most appropriate way to manage this disease and improve patient outcomes.”For more information on the CAPTURE study, please visit:  https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/!/9143/presentation/485   https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/!/9143/presentation/664   https://www.epresspack.net/novonordiskEASD2020/CAPTUREAbout CAPTURECAPTURE is the first global non-interventional study to capture the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk and its management in people living with type 2 diabetes. The objectives were to establish the proportion of people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and to document the use of cardiovascular risk-reducing medicines in people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined as cerebrovascular disease (including carotid artery disease), coronary heart disease and/or peripheral artery disease. The CAPTURE study, sponsored by Novo Nordisk, was conducted in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Czech Republic, China, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, involving nearly 10,000 people with type 2 diabetes. Participants had to be at least 18 years of age and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 180 days.Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

2020-11-17,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 17 November 2020 - Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial, a phase 3b 40-week, efficacy and safety trial with once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg vs once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg as add-on to metformin and/or sulfonylureas in 961 people with type 2 diabetes in need for treatment intensification. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c at week 40 with semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg.  When evaluating the effects of treatment taken as intended1 and from a high mean baseline HbA1c of 8.9%, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c of 2.2% compared with a reduction of 1.9% with semaglutide 1.0 mg at week 40. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 68% of people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg vs 58% on semaglutide 1.0 mg.From a mean baseline body weight of 99.3 kg, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a statistically significant1 and superior weight loss of 6.9 kg compared with 6.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg.When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a reduction in HbA1c of 2.1% compared to 1.9% for people treated with 1.0 mg dose at week 40. People treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a statistically non-significant weight loss of 6.4 kg compared with 5.6 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Trial product estimand[1]Treatment policy estimand2  Once-weekly semaglutide2.0 mg1.0 mg2.0 mg1.0 mg  HbA1c reduction2.2%*1.9%2.1%*1.9%  Body weight reduction6.9 kg*6.0 kg6.4 kg5.6 kg    *Statistically significant vs once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mgIn the trial, both doses of semaglutide appeared safe and well-tolerated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time and were consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, the gastrointestinal adverse events were similar for semaglutide 2.0 mg with nausea rates around 15% for both doses. The treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar and below 5% for both doses of semaglutide.“We are very pleased with the results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial with the large HbA1c reduction from a high baseline as well as the safety and tolerability profile, which establish a attractive benefit-risk ratio for treatment of type 2 diabetes with semaglutide” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. “Semaglutide 1.0 mg has across the SUSTAIN programme demonstrated that up to 80% of patients achieved HbA1c levels below 7%. This study demonstrates that patients in poor glycaemic control increase the likelihood of achieving their HbA1c target when treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg.”About the SUSTAIN clinical programme   The SUSTAIN clinical development programme for once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide injection currently comprises 11 phase 3 global clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, involving more than 11,000 adults with type 2 diabetes in total. Semaglutide 1.0 mg is approved under the brand name Ozempic® indicated for type 2 diabetes.About Novo Nordisk  Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

2020-11-23,"Wellness, as many know, is a tremendous industry with a global value north of $4.5 trillion. Whether it's diet plans, exercise regimens, or the latest in meditation practices, more people around the world want to feel better and improve their health. This also means that there are new and innovative companies in the wellness space to serve consumers. One of these is Bellabeat. Based in San Francisco, Bellabeat is a data-driven wellness enterprise that creates custom plans for its users based on their individual needs and quirks. Its primary focus is on closing the wellness gap which disproportionately affects women despite the fact that women constitute the largest number of caregivers worldwide. The company works by collecting data from its users regarding their menstrual cycle and then forming a wellness program around it. By taking various factors into account, such as mood swings and energy levels, Bellabeat not only sheds the stigma regarding period discussions but also helps to ensure better results. Since its inception four years ago, the firm has seen not only support from its users by encouraging results as well. Per its website, Bellabeat facilitates over 6.4 million workouts each day and have sparked over 600 thousand discussions about women's health. Jeppe Christiansen Joins Bellabeat Photo: Jeppe ChristiansenWith all its success, it is only natural that Bellabeat would see some new changes, particularly to its management. Earlier in November, it was announced that the company would be welcoming Jeppe Christiansen as a new board member. Christiansen is an internationally acclaimed economist and investment manager from Denmark, bringing decades of professional experience to this new role. He began his career in the financial sector in 1984, has worked as executive director at Danske Bank from 1999 to 2004, and has led the Copenhagen-based, nationally-recognized asset management firm Maj Invest since 2004.Most notably, Christiansen has held the vice-chair position of the multinational pharmaceutical powerhouse Novo Nordisk (Pink: NONOF)  since 2013. The corporation currently operates offices in five countries and production facilities in eight, with revenue surpassing $19 billion in 2019. In addition to his board positions at Bellabeat and Novo Nordisk, Christiansen is also a member of the Board of Directors at KIRKBI. The Danish holding company is primarily known for its subsidiary The Lego Group, the world's leading toy manufacturer by revenue and employer of more than 18,000 workers globally.The Need for a Data-based Approach in the Wellness Sector While Bellabeat's current business model is innovative in its own right, it is also representative of a changing climate within the wellness industry. When many people think of wellness, they think of mass-produced quick fixes or fads that are marketed to large audiences. Take the average fad diet that promises to help everyone lose weight regardless of differences in body composition, genetics, and so on. This is one of the reasons why most diets are poised to fail. This is why new companies like Bellabeat are going against the grain. Data is one of the most powerful tools in the internet age and the proper leveraging of data can be very beneficial to consumers. For example, a person who experiences heavy periods might be recommended an exercise regimen during their period that helps relieve cramps as opposed to one that might worsen their symptoms. This means that the user is more likely to stay on track with her program and achieve her goals with more ease. As the wellness industry evolves, it has become apparent that companies cannot mass-produce impersonal products and services but must be attentive to their customers. This, however, can only be possible with the right data used in a creative and ethical manner. And Bellabeat is big on data. The company reports having an average of 50,000 data sets for each user. These sets come together to create a unique consumer profile that means that no two customers receive the same program. It is clear that there is no going back to the ways of old. Hopefully, this new addition to the management of Bellabeat means that it can continue to create a new world based on ethical data use and inclusion of women.

2020-12-04,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 4 December 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced the submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for chronic weight management. A priority review voucher has been applied to the NDA, leading to an anticipated review time of six months from the submission date, according to standard FDA review timelines.  The potential indication is for the treatment of adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.The submission is based on the results from the STEP phase 3a clinical trial programme, which included more than 4,500 adults with obesity or overweight. Across the STEP programme, people with obesity treated with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in body weight compared to placebo. Across STEP 1, 3 and 4 a weight loss of 15-18% was reported for people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Furthermore, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal and were transient, and mild or moderate in severity.  “Obesity is associated with a wide range of serious complications, yet many healthcare providers still do not have sufficient medical options available to help people with this chronic disease ,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. ""We are excited about the regulatory filing of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the US and we believe once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg has the potential to transform the medical management of obesity.""About obesity and subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management   Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer.Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a potential treatment for obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon‑like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake.About the STEP clinical programme   STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity. The global phase 3a programme consists of four trials and has enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity.STEP 1 – a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 1,961 adults with obesity or overweight. For more information, please read the company announcement hereSTEP 2 – a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of subcutaneous  semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg in 1,210 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. For more information, please read the company announcement hereSTEP 3 – a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of subcutaneous  semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in combination with intensive behavioural treatment in 611 adults with obesity or overweight.

2020-12-16,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 16 December 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced the decision to enter phase 3 development in Alzheimer’s disease with 14 mg oral semaglutide, a once-daily oral formulation of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue semaglutide. The decision follows evaluation of GLP-1 data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies, post-hoc analysis of data from large cardiovascular outcomes trials, as well as discussions with regulatory authorities.  Novo Nordisk intends to initiate a pivotal phase 3a programme with approximately 3,700 people with early Alzheimer’s disease. The programme is planned for initiation in the first half of 2021 and will investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide, compared to placebo. The expected main treatment period in the trials is around two years.“As a company we aspire to address high unmet medical needs within serious chronic diseases, and we are therefore pleased to initiate phase 3 development of semaglutide within Alzheimer’s disease,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer at Novo Nordisk. “Alzheimer’s disease has been an area of extensive research in the past decades, unfortunately without any major medical breakthroughs. Due to the growing unmet medical need and the increasing evidence of a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1, we will investigate the benefits of oral semaglutide in early Alzheimer’s disease.”Conference call  On 16 December at 4 pm CET, corresponding to 10 am EST, a conference call for investors will be held where members of management will elaborate on the decision and provide a brief update on the GLP-1 R&D strategy. Investors will be able to listen in via a link on the investor section of novonordisk.com.About Alzheimer’s disease  Alzheimer’s disease represents a rapidly growing public health concern causing significant detrimental consequences to the affected people and their families and has led to substantial and increasing global socioeconomic impact. Worldwide, 70-100 million people are estimated to have early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stages).    About data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies and the post-hoc analysis  Animal studies highlight the key effects of GLP-1 relevant for Alzheimer’s disease including improved memory function and reduced phospho-tau accumulation. Semaglutide has specifically been shown to reduce measures of neuro-inflammation which may affect cognition and function.Further, real-world evidence from two Danish nationwide registries, the US Truven claims database and the US FDA FAERS database support a potential association between lower risk of dementia following treatment with GLP-1.Finally, in a post-hoc analysis of data from three large cardiovascular outcomes trials conducted by Novo Nordisk (LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6), which included 15,820 patients with type 2 diabetes with median follow-up of 3.6 years, a total number of 47 people were identified with development of dementia, of which 32 were on placebo and 15 on GLP-1 (liraglutide or semaglutide). The rate of developing dementia was statistically significantly reduced by 53% in favour of GLP-1.   About oral semaglutide  Oral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in the US, EU and Japan. The approval of Rybelsus® is based on the results from 10 clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus® demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the clinical trials, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time.Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

2020-12-18,"Bagsværd, Denmark 18 December 2020 ­– Novo Nordisk today announced the submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for weight management. The potential indication is for the treatment of adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.The submission is based on the results from the STEP phase 3a clinical trial programme, which included more than 4,500 adults with obesity or overweight. Across the STEP programme, people with obesity treated with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in body weight compared to placebo. Across the trials in people without diabetes STEP 1, 3 and 4, a weight loss of 15-18% was reported for people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Furthermore, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal and were transient, and mild or moderate in severity.  “We are excited about this regulatory filing following the recent regulatory filing with the FDA in the US,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. “It is a milestone for Novo Nordisk but more importantly it represents a new treatment option with the potential to transform the medical management for people living with obesity in Europe”.About obesity and subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management   Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer.Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a potential treatment for obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon‑like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake.For more information on the FDA filing for semaglutide 2.4 mg, please read the company announcement hereAbout the STEP clinical programme   STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity.

2021-01-20,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 January 2021 – Novo Nordisk today announced the submission of a label expansion application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the existing marketing authorisation for Ozempic®, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, to introduce a new dose of 2.0 mg. Ozempic® is currently approved in the US in 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg doses for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. The submission follows the application on 29 December 2020 for label extension to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The submission is based on the results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial, which included 961 people with type 2 diabetes in need of treatment intensification. In the trial, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the trial, both doses of semaglutide appeared to have safe and well-tolerated profiles. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time and were consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, the gastrointestinal adverse events were similar for semaglutide 2.0 mg. “We are excited about the regulatory submission of semaglutide 2.0 mg to the FDA,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. “In the SUSTAIN programme most people achieved the treatment target of HbA1c levels below 7%. However, some patients need treatment intensification and with the 2.0 mg dose, more people with type 2 diabetes will be able to achieve treatment target”. About the SUSTAIN clinical programme The SUSTAIN clinical development programme for once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide injection currently comprises 11 phase 3 global clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, involving more than 11,000 adults with type 2 diabetes.

Sales in International Operations increased by 7% in Danish kroner (10% at CER), and sales in North America Operations increased by 1% in Danish kroner (3% at CER). Sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19, driven by fewer patients initiating treatment.Sales within Diabetes and Obesity care increased by 5% to DKK 108.0 billion (8% at CER), driven by GLP-1 growth of 26% in Danish kroner (29% at CER) reflecting the uptake of Ozempic® and Rybelsus®.

Members of Executive Management have in 2017 participated in a long-term incentive programme consisting of a one-year performance period (2017) and a three-year vesting period (2018-2020). The shares allocated after the one-year performance period (2017) have been locked up for a three-year period.

Hence, the original number of shares allocated after the one-year performance period has on 3 February 2021 been transferred to current and former executives as specified below. No dividend has been paid to the executives during the one-year performance period or the three-year vesting period.

KRAS G12C mutation positive cancers were once thought to be untreatable. However, there are several companies with promising therapies with the potential to soon hit the market. Drugs which treat once intractable diseases often become blockbusters, and there’s great potential for these types of pharmaceutical stocks. However, Mirati Pharmaceuticals is not alone in the race to treat KRAS G12C mutation positive cancers. According to FiercePharma, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) looks likely to commercialize its drug, Sotorasib first. That might not be as bad as it appears. That’s because there are clear indications that Mirati Therapeutics’ Adagrasib will prove more effective in the long run. It produced a higher response than Amgen’s drug and exhibits greater tumor reduction potential. MRTX stock is down 12.5% in 2021, but analysts have it overweight with an average target price of $244.77 Novartis (NVS) Source: Shutterstock Novartis, like a few other pharmaceutical stocks, is off by roughly 12% since beginning 2021. Even so, the company has two potential blockbuster drugs in development: Kesimpta and Inclisiran. Kesimpta is an injectable drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug has recently received approval. Inclisiran is used to battle high cholesterol. Inclisiran is known commercially as Leqvio. Novartis is currently launching Leqvio in Germany for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The U.K. launch is set to occur in the third quarter of this year, while the U.S. launch is facing setbacks. The setbacks look to be related to production issues rather than efficacy. Inclirisan/Leqvio is manufactured at an Italian facility controlled by Corden Pharma. Process control related issues caused the FDA to delay the drug’s approval in December. 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness Novartis assumes that Kesimpta will be a growth driver during 2021. At the same time, the company recognizes that launches of both Kesimpta and Leqvio will require significant investments. Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) Source: Bukhta Yurii / Shutterstock.com Biohaven Pharmaceutical has a potential blockbuster on the market in its migraine drug called Nurtec. Nurtec helps migraine sufferers return to normal functioning for up to 48 hours with a single dose. The drug was launched commercially in the U.S. in March of 2020. Furthermore, Nurtec accounted for $63.6 million in revenues during calendar year 2020. And the drug’s sales really took off in the fourth quarter. Nurtec pulled in $35.1 million in sales, which was a 98% increase over the third quarter. Biohaven Pharmaceutical recorded no revenue in 2019. All of its 2020 revenues were attributable to Nurtec which was prescribed to 337,000 times during the period. Biohaven Pharmaceutical CEO Vlad Coric believes that Nurtec competes in an addressable market that could grow to $4 billion-$5 billion annually in the U.S. alone, which makes this one of the most compelling pharmaceutical stocks. BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) Source: Shutterstock BioMarin Pharmaceutical has an opportunity to occupy a significant corner of its market. That’s because BioMarin recently increased its production estimates in its gene therapy facility. BioMarin Pharmaceutical previously stated that it could treat up to 4,000 hemophilia A patients with its single dose drug. However, the company later upped that number to 10,000. That’s an important number because it may mean that BioMarin can treat the entire U.S. population suffering from severe hemophilia A in two years. Existing hemophilia A therapies require repeated injections. BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec therapy is a single dose gene therapy. If it receives FDA approval, it will provide long-lasting effects with a single dosage. The therapy costs between $2 million and $3 million. The current standard in the highly competitive hemophilia. Gene therapy costs about $700,000 annually but must be continued indefinitely. 7 of the Top Transportation Stocks to Buy Right Now Phase 3 study results for the gene therapy are expected in early 2021. Company CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime expects 2020 revenues of around $2 billion to increase to as much as $10 billion within a decade. Novo Nordisk (NVO) Source: Shutterstock Novo Nordisk launched type-2 diabetes drug Rybelsus in 2019. Full-year 2020 sales reached $305 million, which exceeded the expectations of many analysts. Rybelsus is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy and is the second from Novo Nordisk. The first such therapy was Ozempic which was launched in 2018. Novo Nordisk will have a strong opportunity to dominate the market over the coming decade with both drugs. Researchers studying both semaglutide drugs have noted other interesting side effects: “Our trial showed that among adults with overweight or obesity (without diabetes), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide plus lifestyle intervention was associated with substantial, sustained, clinically relevant mean weight loss of 14.9%, with 86% of participants attaining at least 5% weight loss.” I cannot say if this opens up an additional sales channel in non-diabetic patients. Whether it does or does not remains irrelevant. Novo Nordisk looks to have struck gold with its newest diabetes therapies. Daiichi Sankyo (DSNKY) Source: Shutterstock Enhertu is a drug that received FDA approval in December against interstitial lung disease. Additionally, the drug is indicated against HER2- positive breast cancer. The drug is approved for use in both Japan and the United States. It is indicated for use in patients who have received two or more anti HER2 based regimens previously. As mentioned previously, a blockbuster drug is one that exceeds $1 billion in annual sales. Enhertu could eclipse that based on a prediction which pegs its 2024 sales at $2.4 billion. A monthly regimen of the drug cost $13,300 at launch. 7 Hot Stocks Ready to Ride Retail Growth SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens, M.D., predicted that the drug could reach peak sales of $2.5 billion annually. In one study, Enhertu reduced tumor size in 61% of cases and completely eliminated them in 6% of cases. The drug is also being evaluated for efficacy against non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The obvious upshot here is that other potential large revenue streams may exist for Enhertu moving forward. arGEN-X (ARGX) Source: Shutterstock arGEN-X is a company and stock that had a great 2020. In early March of 2020 ARGX stock sat at $150. As of March 12, it sits above $309 per share. The company’s potential blockbuster drug is a severe autoimmune disease therapy called Efgartigimod. The drug is closest to approval for use in treating myasthenia gravis. Efartigimod is also being reviewed for two other diseases and is in Phase 3 trials. It also is being studied in a Phase 2 trial. This means the drug could receive approval for four separate diseases. Investors are keenly following, as the revenue implications are intriguing. Stifel analysts predict that peak sales of Efgartigimod for use in treating myasthenia gravis could reach $1.7 billion annually. Efgartigimod is nearest FDA approval as a therapy for that specified condition. That application alone would vault it into blockbuster territory. However, investors must remember that the drug is in two Phase 3 trials and another Phase 2 trial. That means revenue streams could peak much higher.

2021-03-18,"Gilead Sciences Inc (NASDAQ: GILD) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) have expanded their clinical collaboration in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The companies will conduct a Phase 2b study of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide and a fixed-dose combination of Gilead's cilofexor and firsocostat, alone and in combination in people with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. The four-arm study in approximately 440 patients will evaluate the treatments' impact on liver fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution. Patient recruitment will start in the second half of 2021. This new Phase 2b study builds on results from a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study presented at Liver Meeting Digital Experience in November last year investigating semaglutide, alone and in combination with cilofexor and firsocostat, in 108 people with NASH and mild to moderate fibrosis. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that all regimens were well tolerated over 24 weeks. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Across all groups, 5–14% of people discontinued any trial treatment due to adverse events. Also, post-hoc analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints assessing liver health biomarkers at 24 weeks showed statistically significant improvements in hepatic steatosis and liver injury in the combination treatment arms versus semaglutide alone. Price Action: NVO shares are trading 0.81% lower at $71.2 in premarket on the last check Thursday, while GILD shares closed 0.6% higher at $64.42 on Wednesday.

2021-03-18,"Gilead and Novo Nordisk are expanding their clinical collaboration for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Shares of Gilead, a biopharmaceutical company, are down about 1.2% in the pre-market session today. Gilead (GILD) and Novo Nordisk will conduct a Phase 2b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide and a fixed-dose combination of Gilead’s cilofexor and firsocostat in people suffering from compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH. This study, building on positive results from a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study, will evaluate the impact of the treatment on liver fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution. Recruitment is expected to begin in the second half of 2021. Gilead’s Senior Vice President, Inflammation Clinical Development, Mark Genovese, MD, said, “Gilead is pleased to expand our collaboration with Novo Nordisk and advance understanding of the potential for combination approaches in treating people living with cirrhosos due to NASH.” Martin Holst Lagne, Executive Vice President and Head of Development, Novo Nordisk, said, “NASH is a disease with a high unmet medical need, as no drugs are currently approved to treat this potentially life threatening condition. Building on the positive results from our proof-of-concept trial, we hope together with Gilead to demonstrate the potential for semaglutide with cilofexor and firsocostat to help people living with NASH.” Additionally, on March 15, Gilead and Merck entered into an agreement to co-market and co-develop long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Gilead’s lenacapavir with Merck’s islatravir into a two-drug regimen. (See Gilead stock analysis on TipRanks) On March 16, Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman reiterated a Hold rating on Gilead and maintained a price target of $65. Commenting on the Merck partnership, Seigerman said, “Not only does this provide clarity on the highly anticipated combo agent with lenacapavir, but it also provides potential commercial synergies and a complementary profile for maximizing the effect of long-acting treatments.” Turning to the rest of the Street, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating alongside an average analyst price target of $78 (21% upside potential), based on 11 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell.

2021-03-22,"Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 March 2021 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Refusal to File letter covering the label expansion application for once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes which was filed on 20 January 2021. A refusal to file letter is received when the FDA determines additional information is required to review a complete application. In the letter, FDA has requested additional information including data relating to a proposed new manufacturing site. While additional information needs to be included in the resubmission, Novo Nordisk believes the already completed clinical trial programme will be sufficient for approval of the label expansion application.

The decision follows the completion of the STEP phase 3a clinical programme with once-weekly subcutaneous (sc) semaglutide 2.4 mg. Novo Nordisk intends to initiate a pivotal phase 3a programme with approximately 1,000 people with obesity or overweight with comorbidities. The global 68-week trial is planned for initiation in the second half of 2021 and will investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo. “There is a significant unmet medical need within obesity treatment today. With oral semaglutide we aim to introduce a convenient and effective treatment option for people with obesity and healthcare providers enabling broader use of anti-obesity medication,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. “As a complement to our injectable anti-obesity medications, oral semaglutide has the potential to help more people living with obesity achieve weight loss goals and improve their health.” About obesityObesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health complications and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain types of cancer. The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that obesity also increases the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. Approximately 650 million adults are estimated to live with obesity worldwide. About semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management and STEPOnce-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg is currently under regulatory review in the US and the EU as a treatment for adults with obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feeling of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. The submissions for regulatory review are based on the results from the STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) phase 3 clinical development programme. The global clinical phase 3a programme consisted of four trials and enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity. About oral semaglutideOral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in the US, EU and Japan under the trade name, Rybelsus®. The approval of Rybelsus® is based on the results from 10 clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus® demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the clinical trials, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time.
