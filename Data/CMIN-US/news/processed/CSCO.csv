Indeed, over the past five years, companies in Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index bought back a stunning $2.82 trillion of their own stock, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Although it takes more than share repurchases to support stock prices, they sure do help - and investors generally love them.

2018-12-31,"The past several months have been torture for anyone who owns tech stocks.

After a heroic run in 2017 bled into the beginning of 2018, led by the so-called &quot;FAANG&quot; stocks - Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) - the technology sector has been severely battered and bruised since early October.

That beating may have run its full course, though, and in retrospect looks like a garden-variety correction that tech stocks often must make. Besides, as volatile and unpredictable as the sector can be, technology still is technology - it remains the best growth opportunity that investors will find for the indefinite future.

With that as the backdrop, here are a dozen of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019. These companies all should perform better in the new year than they did in 2018. And in a few cases, a solid dividend and strong track record of payout increases bolsters the bullish case.

2019-01-09,"The name of the game in investing is &quot;total return.&quot; When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks. Pick up Amazon.com (AMZN) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!

Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.

To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.

Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.

2019-01-16,"Will Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) split its stock? Between the high nominal stock price and its climb to the world's biggest market cap, this becomes a natural question for AMZN stock. Previous market cap leaders, such as Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), often split their stocks once they rose above a certain level.

However, in today's world, nominal share prices hold less relevance, except in some respects to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In a world where investors care little about whether a stock trades at $20 a share or $2,000, an Amazon stock split isn't likely.

### Alexa, When Did Amazon Stock Split?

Though few may remember, AMZN stock split three times in its early days. The shares rose quickly following its 1997 IPO. Believing lower-priced stocks would see better liquidity, Jeff Bezos didn't hesitate to split the stock. Amazon stock touched $100 per share in early 1998 and the shares split 2:1 the following June. A few months later -- and many dollars higher -- AMZN stock owners got three shares for each one they were holding. Rinse, repeat… and September 1999 saw another 2:1 split.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



Then, the dot-com bubble went bust. By early 2001, AMZN stock fell below $10 per share. It would not recover its 1999 high until 2009. While the stock may have come back, Mr. Bezos's love for stock splits did not.

### Little Need for a Split Now

Attitudes have shifted since 1999. Today, stocks with four-figure nominal share prices still attract investors. For this reason, only one reason exists to split this stock -- a move into the Dow Jones Index. The Dow exists as a weighted index. Hence, Amazon at its current price would wield a disproportionate influence on the gauge. The only way Amazon will move onto that index is through a stock split.

I don't they'll do it. With Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) already on the index, the tech industry already has good representation. As well, splits change nothing fundamental. After a 2:1 split, the price cuts in half, but with twice the number of shares available. So, no change in the market cap. And with changes in the rules regarding partial shares, small investors are able to buy a fraction of a share eliminating the need for companies to keep nominal share prices low.

### Dow Membership Not Much of a Motivator

Moreover, investors should ask if the Dow remains relevant. The public still looks at it because they always have. However, professionals tend to look more to the S&P 500 index. Also, only three of the world's 10 largest market caps are currently Dow components.

Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) doesn't trade on a major American index at all. Others, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), refuse to split their shares to match Dow standards. In a concession to shareholders, Buffett allowed a 50:1 split on the B shares in 2010. The A shares remain untouched. He holds to this maxim despite the nearly $300,000 price tag for a single BRK.A share. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also avoided splits, except to divide shares into voting (GOOGL) and non-voting (GOOG) blocs.

Amazon has shown similar attitudes toward stock splits in recent years. Both Berkshire and Alphabet seem to care little about becoming Dow stocks. I think Amazon feels the same.

### Bottom Line on an Amazon Stock Split

No factors appear compelling enough to answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Will Amazon stock split?&quot;. Once happy to do it -- until the effects of the dot-com bust took AMZN stock below $10 per share -- the company spent years recovering, and now, massive growth has given Amazon the largest market cap in the world.

However, it's a world that's changed. People care less about stock prices, and small investors can purchase fractions of shares. The Dow's importance is up for debate. calling into question the one remaining motivation for a stock split. Still popular, it's no longer the gauge all of the most-important stocks. In 1919, or even in 1999, an AMZN might have willingly split the stock to join this index. However, in 2019, Charles Dow's gauge seems much less relevant.

Despite successes, Amazon stock faces a high valuation and formidable rivals. Given these challenges, I believe Bezos will continue to focus on the business rather than the company's potential place on an antiquated stock index.

2019-01-16,"It doesn't take a genius to realize that social media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is in serious trouble. Last year, SNAP stock dropped more than 55%, making it one of the worst-performing investments in the marquee New York Stock Exchange. Unfortunately, the embattled organization will likely suffer a repeat performance in 2019 unless it can turn the ship around.

In a shocking announcement Tuesday, management revealed that CFO Tim Stone will step down from his post. As a result, Snap stock tumbled over 7% during extended trading. Heading into Wednesday's session, SNAP stock is trending down more than 11%!

If you've followed the company's (usually negative) news stream, you'll know that Stone's departure comes amid a wave of high-profile executives abandoning ship. Last year, marketing VP Steve LaBella and chief strategy officer Imran Khan sought greener pastures. Most recently, HR head Jason Halbert resigned earlier this week.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As if things couldn't get worse for SNAP stock, Stone's tenure was one of the shortest in the organization's history. The now-former CFO lasted only eight months.

  * Top 10 Global Stock Ideas for 2019 From RBC Capital 



Per protocol, SNAP CEO Evan Spiegel offered the usual niceties. As far as the real motives behind the quick exit, we can only speculate. But we can make one statement with reasonable certainty: the decisive catalyst(s) must have been overwhelming.

We have to remember that executives don't make these decisions lightly. While they enjoy impressive salaries and benefits, a poor reputation can quickly end that joyride.

Specifically, Stone left e-commerce and technology giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for this role. That's not an easy gig to walk away from. Further, Stone's prospective employers will rightfully question his motives and commitment.

Not only that, the company offered him $20 million in restricted stock, with an option to buy 500,000 common shares.

### Bad Omen for SNAP stock

No matter how rich you are, you never willingly leave money on the table. In fact, the affluent become more emboldened with their negotiating skills: that's why they're rich!

Therefore, it's shocking for anyone to let so much wealth go. Because of his extremely truncated tenure, Stone will not receive a majority of the compensatory benefits tied to SNAP stock. Simultaneously, the executive indirectly sullied his 20-year career at Amazon.

So what could drive someone to this drastic decision? Again, we can only speculate. But examining the common reasons why CFOs quit is revealing, and portends further pain for Snap stock.

From an administrative perspective, CFOs typically leave due to interpersonal conflicts. This is a broad category that covers situations such as executive and directorial dysfunction, a poor relationship with the CEO, and ineffective talent within the finance group.

On a personal level, a CFO could simply get bored with non-stimulating work. Or they could simply jump ship for more money.

None of these reasons satisfactorily explains why Stone pulled the plug. Moreover, they're related to executives who put in the time to discover these negatives. As The Wall Street Journal explained a few years back, a sudden departure may spell trouble.

In some cases, the problem is due to executives butting heads. But in others, a fundamental vulnerability may exist in the target organization.

The WSJ chronicled 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) former finance chief Ted Hull similarly brief tenure. When 3D Systems initially hired Hull, he represented a steal. Previously, Hull worked at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).

In reality, Hull was a bad omen. The 3-D printing industry's growth narrative declined significantly. Apparently, there was nothing he or anyone could do to save DDD.

### Huge Uphill Battle Lies Ahead for Snap Stock

Prior to the news, a temptation existed to take the contrarian trade. As I mentioned earlier, SNAP stock absorbed significant pain. However, its Snapchat app remains popular with its core young audience. Additionally, management is actively seeking international opportunities.

But at some point, we must read between the lines. Among publicly traded competitors Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap has the smallest subscriber footprint. However, its youth-centric focus means it has to win the volume game with its core audience. After all, Snap stock isn't exactly an older person's investment.

Unfortunately, Facebook's Instagram app has disrupted the company's dominance in the younger demographic. Further, FB has the resources to bombard SNAP relentlessly. All management can hope for is that they can be bought out at a reasonable price.

That sounds awfully negative until you realize that Stone left a fortune on the table. For him, leaving was the rosier option compared to gobs of money. If that's not an indictment against SNAP stock, I don't know what is.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for CSCO with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CSCO.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Neutral

ETF activity is neutral. The $7.55 billion in inflows that ETFs holding CSCO received over the last one-month is a decline from earlier in the period and among the weakest of the past year.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Technology sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

The current level displays a negative indicator. CSCO credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-17,"Tech conglomerate Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is one stock whose share price hasn't been hit nearly as hard as some of its peers. Cisco stock was able to deliver 13% to its shareholders in 2018 and so far this year the stock is up 3%. That's pretty impressive given the context.

The tech sector has been a shaky one over the past few months as jittery investors and a massive sell off in December hurt share prices for several big names. However, while some of the flashier names in technology have taken a beating, safe, reliable companies that were once overlooked have come back into focus.

Cisco's solid balance sheet, reliable dividend and proximity to some of the most promising tech trends make it a great pick for risk-averse investors. 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens 



### Old Faithful

Cisco stock offers investors a 3% dividend yield, which is unlikely to go anywhere but up because of the firm's impressive cash coiffers. The new tax code allowed Cisco to bring back around $67 billion from overseas and management has been generous in using those dollars to reward shareholders. 

The firm has also been on a buying spree trying to beef up its wireless, cybersecurity and software arms and those purchases are likely to pay off in the coming years.

Although Cisco's business has been largely dependent on network traffic switches, the company has been working to shift its strategy to focus on software and create a recurring revenue model and so far that switch appears to be paying off.

The firm was initially hurt by the move, but its software subscription revenue has started to move in the right direction after just a few years. 

### Tailwinds

While Cisco's strong balance sheet and reliable dividend payments offer investors stability in a very uncertain sector, the company also looks to have a few growth catalysts on the horizon as well.

Cisco's Catalyst 9000 switches are likely to enjoy a tailwind over the next few years as data centers up their processing speeds and wireless companies release 5G products. The demand for faster data speeds is rising rapidly and Cisco's products are smack dab in the middle of that rising tide.

Plus, Cisco is also exposed to some secular growth opportunities like edge computing, which takes some of the stress off data centers by performing computing jobs close to the end user rather than in the cloud.

Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath said he sees CSCO transforming from a product cycle stock to a secular growth stock this year, setting a price target of $60. That's nearly 30% upside from where Cisco stock is trading today.

### Risks

Of course, no stock comes without risk and Cisco is no exception. Although the company looks poised to deliver growth this year, there are some scenarios in which that may not materialize.

Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said investors should be cautious about the company's growth story as weakness in IT spending strength this year could hit the firm hard. 

There's also some concern that companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) could start to sell white box switches that run on off-the-shelf chips and undercut Cisco significantly on price. That kind of competition would be risky for CSCO because it might sway price-conscious customers away from Cisco-branded hardware which would hit the firm's revenue and margins hard.

### The Bottom Line on Cisco Stock

Things look bright for Cisco stock and the company's reliable dividend payments are icing on the cake. Right now CSCO is benefitting from several tech trends that put it's hardware and software in high demand.

Cisco's successful transition to a recurring revenue model means CSCO is on-track to deliver solid gains as its business ramps up. 

The firm has made several smart acquisitions that should help enhance its network offerings and create more valuable service and hardware bundles for customers. While there's some risk that economic uncertainty could put a damper on spending, CSCO's iron-clad balance sheet means the firm can likely withstand the storm. 

Competition from unbranded hardware is certainly a risk, but as CSCO continues to improve its bundles and add value for customers, it is unlikely to lose out to cheaper alternatives.

As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-18,"Diving into a discussion about the U.S.-China trade war is a tough business, so allow me this caveat: anything can happen, especially with our current administration. Nevertheless, those who are seeking to capitalize on the best stocks to invest in may be onto something.

First, the obvious statement: neither side wants to budge an inch. On the one hand, decades of superior economic growth emboldened Chinese pride and nationalism. Naturally, this sentiment has translated into a significant military buildup. Backing down means losing credibility, something the Chinese leadership cannot afford.

On the other hand, the U.S. must protect its intellectual property and its national-security interests. According to author and noted China critic Gordan Chang, controversial tech company Huawei stole technology from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Furthermore, Chang claims that the Chinese government and military supported Huawei's thievery.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Under normal circumstances, we should not expect an imminent resolution, confusing matters about what to invest in now. However, we don't live under any sense of normalcy. Plus, headwinds on both sides suggest the best course of action is a workable truce.

Despite their recent fiery rhetoric, the Chinese government harbors serious fears. The latest economic data indicates declining growth, job losses in U.S.-tariff targeted industries and deteriorating consumer sentiment. Moreover, the ultra-rich are getting increasingly tense about future economic prospects.

For Americans, we're on the verge of unprecedented instability unless the government shutdown ceases. Additionally, President Trump and the Republicans have a political incentive to negotiate a truce with China. Scoring a victory here means assuaging the electorate, many of whom have turned their backs.

  * Top 10 Global Stock Ideas for 2019 From RBC Capital 



Therefore, the pieces for a negotiation to occur are present. If so, here are the best stocks to invest in:

### Alibaba (BABA)

Among Chinese stocks, none get more attention than dominant tech giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). After a series of bumpy trading following its initial public offering, BABA stock skyrocketed in 2017. Around the middle of last year, Alibaba appeared on track to make a repeat performance.

Unfortunately, the escalating U.S.-China trade war derailed the company, knocking it off its perch as one of the best stocks to invest in. That said, BABA is enjoying a strong start to the new year, gaining over 16%. Of course, Alibaba also posted strong numbers in January 2018.

But for those seeking what to invest in now, the tech giant's troubles offer an enticing entry point. As our own Dana Blankenhorn argued, Alibaba offers underappreciated cloud solutions. Combined with U.S.-China optimism, BABA could surprise in 2019.

### Baidu (BIDU)

Another one of China's best stocks to invest in, internet stalwart Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has grown exponentially since its 2005 IPO. It, too, suffered a few years of choppy trading until it regained decisively bullish momentum in 2017.

While it got off to a turbulent start last year, optimists hoped for a repeat performance. Unfortunately, the U.S.-China trade war had other ideas. Moreover, BIDU stock was particularly affected by the ensuing volatility. In the second half of 2018, shares dropped a staggering 33%.

For speculators eyeballing what to invest in now, BIDU stock has substantial upside potential. Unlike other Chinese companies, Baidu has yet to enjoy a noteworthy dead-cat bounce. Therefore, you're getting the internet firm close to the bottom.

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



Of course, the caveat is that we're assuming no other economic or geopolitical event suddenly dampens enthusiasm. That's a big risk, but the rewards may justify it for adventurous investors.

### Tencent (TCEHY)

Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) follows a familiar trajectory with its Chinese compatriots. Following a dramatic rise against its IPO, Tencent's mercurial rise slowed noticeably between 2014 and 2016. However, 2017 produced a monster result for the popular internet-services company.

Unfortunately for shareholders caught up in the enthusiasm, TCEHY stock peaked in January of last year. Since then, it has largely been a downhill slide. Overall, Tencent lost more than 26% in 2018.

But what makes TCEHY one of the best stocks to invest in is momentum. Since hitting bottom on Oct. 29, shares have jumped more than 33%. More importantly, the bulls have carried this enthusiasm into the new year, moving toward double-digit territory.

While you're not getting the biggest discount with Tencent, you're receiving in its place more stability and confidence. Plus, a diplomatic headway will almost surely attract a surge in investor dollars.

### China Green Agriculture (CGA)

At first glance, China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) doesn't meet the criteria for what to invest in now. For starters, CGA has become a veritable penny stock, with shares currently trading for less than a can of soda. Plus, the U.S.-China trade war directly and negatively impacts the agricultural industry.

But as a contrarian, CGA is also a candidate among the best stocks to invest in. The reason? Fundamentally, it can absorb many of the troubles associated with the U.S.-imposed tariffs. Management is sitting on $153 million in cash, while it only has $7.2 million in debt. Despite obvious pressures, CGA has enjoyed consistently positive free cash flow.

  * The Bogle Way: 7 Index Funds for Passive Investors 



Still, a resolution will go a long way. The tariffs have negatively impacted growth. In its most recent quarter, CGA suffered a 6.6% decline in revenue year-over-year. But based on its price action, we may have seen a bottom.

### Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

Should we enjoy a breakthrough in the trade war, Chinese companies won't be the only ones to benefit. Several American organizations, including Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), offer plenty of upside potential.

As a manufacturer of smartphone components, Skyworks is heavily levered towards China. According to CNBC, 83% of its revenue originates from the world's second-largest economy. Based on that statistic, it's no surprise that SWKS stock tanked last year, giving up 29%.

That said, Skyworks is enjoying a positive start to the year, gaining 5%. This sets up an intriguing case for speculation. On one hand, the company has likely suffered severe damage due to the trade war. China is the biggest smartphone market in the word.

On the other hand, SWKS will easily become one of the best stocks to invest in following a truce. Like the other names on this list, it's a tough call, but the possible rewards are tempting.

### Qualcomm (QCOM)

From a glance at its technical chart, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) doesn't belong on a list for what to invest in now. Last year, QCOM stock lost shareholders 8% of market value. Even worse, since peaking around mid-September, the tech giant has slipped more than 26%.

Of course, Qualcomm is a major player in the smart-device sector. Therefore, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war levers an onerous headwind. At the same time, if American and Chinese leaders agree to a practical solution, QCOM would suddenly look attractive.

More importantly, Qualcomm has other avenues to explore, namely the 5G rollout and autonomous-vehicle technology. The former is already a reality: we're just talking about when global integration occurs, not if.

  * Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy 



The latter component is a little trickier because autonomous vehicles will take time to implement. However, QCOM does have reasonable assurances of a long-term revenue stream, which helps buffer the trade-war waves.

### Micron Technology (MU)

When the international community greenlighted China's insatiable thirst for all things tech, semiconductor firms flourished. But now that the U.S.-imposed tariffs dampened enthusiasm, companies like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are feeling the heat.

Its price chart tells you all you need to know. In the first half of 2018, MU stock was cruising to another outstanding year, gaining over 25%. But the second half told another tale, with shares sliding over 38%. With neither side budging, Micron ended last year down nearly 24%.

Betting on diplomacy isn't the safest thing to do, especially with the Trump administration. However, an unexpected breakthrough could make MU one of the best stocks to invest in. Currently, the company generates over half its revenue in China, so a truce is crucial.

### United Continental (UAL)

With the world's two largest economies going at it, you'd think international airliners would stall. However, United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) has surprisingly been one of the best stocks to invest in. Last year, UAL stock returned a surprisingly robust 23%.

As it turns out, diplomatic troubles don't always translate downstream. Demand for flights to Asian countries have performed relatively well. Moreover, UAL has witnessed a surge for European travel, as well as domestic routes. Plus, a steep decline in fuel prices for the final quarter of 2018 provided an earnings boost.

  * The 3 Best Telecom Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio This Year 



All that said, if UAL wishes to see continued momentum, a truce holds the key. On average, a Chinese tourist spends nearly $7,000 in the U.S. Therefore, sustained tensions between the two countries along with economic damage won't do our tourism industry any good.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-24,"U.S. stock futures are largely unchanged this morning following a quiet overnight trading session. News remains light this morning with the ongoing government shutdown continuing to dominate the discussion.

Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.1% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.01%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.31%.

In the options pits, call and put activity were balanced as overall volume remained near average levels. Specifically, about 15.3 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Over at the CBOE, little changed versus Tuesday's trading session. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio closed at 0.64 for the second day in a row. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held firm at 0.63.

Here were three stocks atop the most-actives list. Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shares jumped following better-than-expected earnings. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) calls were hot after the stock broke above its 50-day moving average. Finally, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) options were active ahead its report after the closing bell.

Let's take a closer look:

### Proctor & Gamble (PG)

Proctor & Gamble reacted to its quarterly earnings report with a solid 4.9% gain yesterday. The consumer staples giant tested its previous peak and all-time high intraday before paring gains into the close. PG earned $1.25 per share compared to analyst estimates of $1.22.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



The price action of PG has been admirable during the broader market's recent rout. And the strength has come despite the entire consumer staples sector getting dragged lower with everything else. While its industry and the S&P 500 remain well off their respective highs, PG is now a stone's throw from record territory.

On the options trading front, calls won the day. Total activity swelled to 489% of the average daily volume, with 90,445 total contracts traded. Calls contributed 68% to the day's tally.

With the uncertainty of earnings now past, implied volatility sunk like a stone to 19%, which places it at the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $1.12, or 1.2%.

### Cisco (CSCO)

Though all was quiet on the news front, Cisco stock's pop above the 50-day moving average on Wednesday lit a fire in the options market. For most of 2018, CSCO was rangebound, giving little inspiration to trend traders. Thus far this year the chop continues, but yesterday's clearing of the 50-day does set the table for a potential run back to the upper end of the range near $49.

On the options trading front, calls were all the rage. Total activity rocketed to 263% of the average daily volume, with 104,636 total contracts traded. 85% of the trading came from call options.

Implied volatility ticked higher to 31%, placing it at the 55th percentile of the one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 90, cents or 2%.

### Intel (INTC)

Intel is slated to release earnings after the close on Thursday and options activity is surging in anticipation. Shareholders are hoping the quarterly report will be the catalyst to finally push INTC stock out of the box it's been stuck in for six months. A break above the 200-day moving average and the heavy horizontal resistance zone at $50 would kickstart a new uptrend.

On the options trading front, calls dominated the session despite the down day. Total activity grew to 180% of the average daily volume, with 137,564 total contracts traded. Calls added 77% to the day's take.

The options market provides a glimpse into market expectations for how much Intel should shift after earnings. Right now, option premiums are baking in a $2.02, or 4.2%, move. Regardless of how things shake out tomorrow, I see little reason to get bullish or bearish on INTC until it takes out $50 or $43.

A variety of issues -- from the trade war to the government shutdown -- have made investors nervous. And with those nerves have come plenty of volatility and big swings. For investors -- especially those near retirement -- the volatility can cause plenty of restless nights. But there is a way to get over the malaise.

And that's dividend stocks.

The steady stream of payments from dividend stocks can act as some ballast in the rough seas. After all, if you're already getting a 3 to 4% return in cash, market swings may not matter as much. Moreover, reinvested dividends can provide an extra boost when the markets return to gains once again. All in all, dividend stocks can be a portfolios best friend in markets like these. The question is which dividend stocks to buy.

High yield isn't everything. It takes a certain combination of payout growth and current yield that makes a dividend stock great. And with that, here are five dividend stocks that are perfect for the market's current situation.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)

Dividend Yield: 4.46%

If you read the headlines, traditional brick & mortar retail is dying a quick death. However, that simply isn't the case. Retail in non-prime areas is suffering. Those malls, power centers and shopping plazas in high-income, growing areas are thriving. And one of the best dividend stocks of the all hones in on these areas.

Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is one of the largest mall operators around -- with hundreds of properties across North America, Europe, and Asia. After a spinout a few years ago -- before online shopping really took off -- Simon became focused strictly on A or Prime retail space. Because of that focus, occupancy is a high 95% and SPG has continued to see record sales/cash flows from its tenants. Last quarter alone, its tenants saw a big 4.5% increase in their retail sales per square foot.

This has translated in a big jump for the dividend stock's cash flows and net income.

For investors in SPG stock, its meant a long history of dividend payouts and increases. Since the recession, SPG has managed to increase its dividend by over 230%. And with the continue record results and focus on upper-income areas, those increases will continue.

With a current yield of 4.45%, Simon Property could be a wonderful dividend stock to help surf the tide of market volatility.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Union Pacific Corporation (UNP)

Dividend Yield: 2.0%

Monopolies are great for investors. And one of few legal monopolies left in the world happens to be the railroads. That's great news for dividend stocks in the sector like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).

UNP happens to have the largest rail networks in the U.S. But perhaps, more importantly, that rail network connects all the major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways as well as connects to Canada's rail system and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. It literally covers all of North America. That's a great place to be as other railroads need to pay UNP to use its system. Even better has been the fact that the economy has improved.

Because of this, volumes across the board have continued to rise at the railroad. And with some moves to reduce waste, improve reliability and lower taxes, UNP saw a whopping 29% increase to its per-share net income for the full year 2018. Naturally, these continued profits have resulted in a strong set of dividend increases and rich buyback program.

And while investors may get nervous because UNP is an economic play, the dividend stocks low payout ratio of 41% provides plenty of cushion for its payout.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Apple (AAPL)

Dividend Yield: 1.89%

A lot of ink has been spilled on the state of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), slowing iPhone sales and perhaps the lack of recent innovation at the company. And those are all valid concerns. But looking at Apple through a different lens may be helpful. The reality is, AAPL may not be a &quot;growth stock&quot; anymore and that's alright for income seekers.

Apple still sells a lot of products, but the real driver last quarter was its strong services and cloud product portfolio. Like many former tech darlings -- think Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) -- Apple is shifting its resources to the cloud. And so far, the results have been impressive. During its latest results, Tim Cook mentioned that cloud services revenue was up 40% year-over-year and the number of Apple Pay transactions more than doubled to 1.8 billion. This very important and shows that even though iPhone growth has slowed, Apple can still keep the cash flows coming as users start using apps like Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

And speaking of that cash, Apple still managed to end the quarter with more than $245 billion on its balance sheet. That's a staggering amount of money and provides plenty of runway for Apple to develop new gear, pay dividends and even buy opportunities through M&A.

With a P/E of under 13 and 1.89%, Apple is cheap and now represents a big value. Looking at it like as you would dividend stocks, there's a lot to like.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Medtronic (MDT)

Dividend Yield: 2.31%

One of the best places to find dividend stocks is the healthcare sector. Demand tends to be steady in all sorts of market environments and that allows many healthcare firms to be strong dividend payers. And you can't get much strong that Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). MDT has now been paying a steady and increasing dividend for over 40 years.

Since producing a wearable pacemaker back in the 1950s, Medtronic has become a juggernaut in the field and now offers a variety of medical appliances that hospitals need every day. This includes some very high-tech solutions to well everyday items. As a result, sales at MDT continue to be robust. The medical-device firm managed to pull in just under $30 billion in total sales last year. Increasingly, it's been turning those sales into higher profits as it devotes more time to higher-margined, higher-tech devices. New A.I. diabetes monitors and pain stimulation devices are now on the menu.

For investors, all of these sales and better margins have continued to help the firm's dividend growth and buyback programs. Over the last five years, the focus on higher-margined goods has allowed MDT to see annual dividend growth of 12%. Medtronic has a current yield of 2.31%.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: United Technologies Corporation (UTX)

Dividend Yield: 2.49%

What global slowdown? That's exactly what investors in United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) are asking themselves after the firm's last results. The results were splendid and showed plenty of growth. All in all, UTX managed to pull in more than $66 billion in total sales and see a huge 29% jump in its full-year profits.

Driving that has been United Technologies new forays into the &quot;connected aerospace&quot; sector and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With software now joining traditional jet engines, margins at the firm have continued to jump. That's resulted in a big boost to profitability and 5% increase to its dividend.

But the story at UTX isn't just about last quarter. It's about the future. And that's because the firm is planning on separating into three different stocks. One will cover the fast-growing aerospace market, the other two with cover Otis Elevators/infrastructure products and heating, cooling and building automation.

For those investors looking for dividend stocks, this is great news. One stock will have a smaller yield, but potentially faster dividend growth, while the other two will larger initial yields and steadier profits. Buying UTX today gets you a whole portfolio's worth of dividend investing styles tomorrow. Meanwhile, you're paid to wait with UTX's current 2.49% yield and great profit profile.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

2019-02-08,"There's no doubt we've been in a growth-driven market for some time now. Fortunately, the transition from growth-driven to income-driven is a bit gentler than it was when the tech crash happened in 2000. Back then, people were saying things like &quot;growth is the new income.&quot;At the time, most long-term investors were in solid total return plays, getting some decent long-term growth with a bit of income. When the dot-com boom hit, investors were being sold a whole need breed of company with completely different valuations and expectations.Fortunately, we're no longer in those innocent days when a triple-digit price-earnings (P/E) was a good sign for a company. And now, after the extended bull market, smart investors are once again seeing the value of having some solid stocks that will be there for them over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio Following are seven fundamentally sound dividend stocks to buy for now and hang onto for years to come: General Motors (GM)Dividend Yield: 3.94%  Fundamental Score:AGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) hasn't figured into many of my 'Top' lists in recent years. But this nearly 111-year-old company continues to find its way through the challenges of a rapidly changing automotive industry.It's also interesting to note that that automotive giant only has a $54 billion market cap. That's about the same size as Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA). As a matter of fact, all of the U.S.' &quot;Big Three&quot; carmakers have lower market caps than Tesla. That means either GM is wildly discounted or Tesla is wildly overvalued.GM is trading at a current P/E just a hair below 7X. Since Tesla has negative earnings, it doesn't even have a P/E. What's more, GM is delivering a 3.9% dividend. It may be boring, but it will be making cars for a long time to come. Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO)Dividend Yield: 2.81%  Fundamental Score:BCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking pioneer and one of the biggest players in the game today. Starting in 1984, when network servers were really just for major corporations, governments and institutions that could afford to buy and maintain them, CSCO was aggressively growing the market for its products.When the dotcom boom hit, it opened up an entirely new world of possibilities. The great challenge was, numerous competitors also entered the market and CSCO needed to adapt to challenges and grow simultaneously.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months While that has been a bumpy road, it has endured in very dynamic industry. And it now also delivers a respectable 2.8% dividend on top of its solid annual returns. Eli Lilly & Co (LLY)Dividend Yield: 2.41%  Fundamental Score: BEli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) is one of the oldest (founded in 1876) and biggest U.S. drug makers.From introducing the world's first commercially available insulin in 1923, to the first pharma to produce and distribute the polio vaccine in 1955, to its introduction of Prozac in 1986, LLY has been on forefront of discovery. And that tradition of innovation continues.This month has seen LLY cut a few drugs from its oncology pipeline and also announce the final divestment from its Elanco animal pharmaceutical wing. And, while 2019 may not be as big a year as last year (LLY stock is up 58% year to date), it will still keep chugging along, delivering a rock-solid 2.1% dividend on top of its capital gains.  Progressive (PGR)Dividend Yield: 3.71%  Fundamental Score: BProgressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) is one of top property and casualty (P&C) insurers in the US. It started in 1965 in the auto insurance business and continues to be a very skilled player in that sector.Having grown more than 50% in the past 3 years, PGR recently announced that it was going to add 10,000 more people to its staff in 2019. Centers all around the country will be getting more staff, with the focus on its IT and customer service departments. The latter will be focused on Spanish-speaking customer service support.PGR has always had a reputation as a tech innovator in the sector and this news shows that its dedication to finding ways to grow its margins and expand its customer base continues.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Rising rates also help insurers, since they hold a lot of premium cash in US Treasuries. Up nearly 30% year to date and still delivering a nice 3.7% dividend, PGR has what it takes to keep on growing. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Dividend Yield: 3.38%  Fundamental Score: BArcher Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) is one of the largest agricultural commodity businesses in the world. It stores, processes and ships everything from seed oils to cocoa.While Q3 came in ahead of expectations, ADM recently released Q4 numbers, which were off by a hefty margin. However, the markets haven't punished ADM too much for the divergences. It's likely that analysts know the China trade war has put a temporary kink in revenue and earnings, and the fortunes of the stock are held hostage by those negotiations.But the reality is, ADM has the national infrastructure to manage the movement and the processing of massive amounts of agricultural goods, so these short-term challenges pale in comparison to the long-term power ADM holds on the global food supply.For now, its 3.4% dividend buys investors some patience. ConocoPhillips (COP)Dividend Yield: 1.81%  Fundamental Score: BConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of my favorite stocks of the moment. It has shown up in a number of these 'top stock' articles. And for good reason.It is a rock-solid, balanced play on the expanding global demand for energy products. Whether it's oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) or bitumen (the natural form of asphalt), COP is one of the leading exploration and production (E&P) companies in the world.Given the fact that its 1.8% dividend isn't exactly mouth-watering, I usually talk about its strength as a growth stock. However, this is long-term growth stock and given that view, the power of compounding makes that 1.8% kicker very welcome over the years.Its continued expansion into natural gas opportunities in North America will also become good investments as exporting natural gas and NGLs around the world opens up in the coming years.  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio Most countries pay significantly more for natural gas than we do in the US, which means margins will grow substantially. Extra Space Storage (EXR)Dividend Yield: 3.45%  Fundamental Score:BExtra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) is the only real estate investment trust (REIT) that made the cut.REITs differ from your typical stock because of the way they're structured. Because it's set up as a trust, shareholders are considered owners and that means they get a distribution of the net profits from the REIT. As in this case (and most cases) those distributions are in the form of dividends.Storage REITs have been one of the strongest sectors for years now, as new generations of Americans are more than willing to look for growth opportunities around the country.While this trend started when the economy was weak, now that it's strengthening, the same trend is only expanding with job opportunities and higher wages.EXR is up 24% in the past 12 months and is still delivering a respectable 3.4% dividend to go along with it.

2019-02-08,"I've never been much of a fan of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock. Nokia has traded sideways since late 2013 and seemingly with good reason. It has some good attributes, a solid balance sheet, and a 4% dividend, but it's long been difficult to make a compelling case for buying Nokia stock..  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock Indeed, eighteen months ago, after NOK rallied, I advised caution. Since then, including dividends, Nokia has been about flat. And I don't see the case here as all that different. Over the next few years, 5G will provide a driver, the balance sheet still is strong, and the troubles of China's Huawei will position Nokia to take market share. But the cost savings from the merger with Alcatel-Lucent have been harvested, and the 2020 EPS guidance doesn't make NOK stock look all that cheap. The networking business continues to be a difficult one and seemingly offers cheap and more intriguing plays. There still seems to be a decent chance that the next few years for NOK look much like the last few.  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio  NOK Stock After EarningsThe Q4 earnings report from Nokia truly sums up &quot;the eye of the beholder&quot; nature of Nokia stock. Investors looking for good news can look to Q4 numbers and initial guidance for 2019 and 2020. Revenue in the quarter rose 3% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income grew a solid 12%. The software business (a key part of Nokia's long-term growth strategy) posted a 12% constant-currency increase in sales for the quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, the outlook seems rather strong. Nokia generated EPS of 0.23 euros in 2018 but expects that figure to grow sharply over the next two years. Initial 2019 guidance is pegged at EUR 0.25-0.29, followed by a sharp gain to EUR 0.37-0.42 in 2020.At the midpoint of the latter range, EPS should grow 72% over the next two years. That seems to show that the shift to 5G, which should start hitting Nokia results in the second half of next year, is a real driver for Nokia earnings.Taking a broader fundamental view, however, the results look far less impressive. Q4 numbers were good but full-year 2018 results were disappointing. Sales rose just 1% excluding foreign exchange effects; revenue growth in Software was just 4% at constant currency. Consolidated adjusted operating income declined 16%, with margins dropping 140 bps.Adjusted EPS is growing the next two years but it fell 30% in 2018 and  2019 guidance is below 2017 levels, and even the high end of the 2020 range only suggests a little over 8% annual growth over the three years.In the context of the 5G shift, Huawei's issues, and the supposed importance of software as a growth catalyst, that performance isn't all that impressive. And even with Nokia stock at $6, it hardly seems impressive enough. The Valuation of Nokia StockNOK might seem cheap but its valuation is hardly an outlier in the networking space. At the high end of 2020 guidance, and backing out the company's net cash, NOK is valued at a little under 13x earnings per share.That's not a bad multiple, certainly. A dividend yield (based on the 2019 payout of EUR 0.20) of 3.75% helps the case as well. But paying 12x+ out-year earnings in a bullish scenario is a good, but hardly spectacular, deal.Meanwhile, in the same sector, there are even cheaper plays. Networking leader Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is available for a similar multiple. Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) can be owned for even less. Neither company necessarily is posting torrid growth, but again, at the midpoint of guidance and looking at the multi-year trajectory, Nokia's own growth is rather muted.Certainly 5G is going to help revenue and earnings but even with that growth NOK looks fairly valued. And as far as 5G plays go, NOK stock hardly seems like the best, or cheapest one.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has issues with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and I've long been a skeptic toward that stock, but back at the lows it looks intriguing. QCOM's dividend yield is higher (almost 5%) and its valuation lower, at less than 12x 2019 earnings.Even a provider like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) or, for more adventurous investors, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), should see benefits from 5G. VZ, in particular, looks like an attractive dividend play, as I wrote last month.The long-running problem for Nokia persists: it's simply difficult to get that excited about the stock. The dividend yield is nice (though there are added complications for US-based investors), but there are other income stocks out there. Growth has been muted, and other similar networking plays seem to be available for cheaper.It's tough to see what makes NOK the best play, and what gets Nokia stock out of its range. That's been the problem for years, and it still is.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-02-12,"Even the best tech stocks eventually succumb to the problem of slowing growth. And while many of tech's elder statesmen can reinvent themselves, others firmly move out of the &quot;growth&quot; category and into the &quot;value&quot; slot. That's exactly what could be happening at online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Since adding a dividend eBay stock has gotten a lot more interesting.There's no denying that since kicking-out PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) as separate stock, eBay has seen its once-torrid rate of revenue generation slow to a crawl.In that decelerating pace, many investors (mainly big activist shops) have gotten pretty impatient with the stock and its management. To appease investors, eBay decided to pay its first dividend in 24 years and up its buyback program significantly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe question for investors today, now that eBay is dividend stock is worthy of your time? Is slow and steady growth worth the 1.65% yield? eBay Stock and Slowing GrowthThe last five years or so haven't exactly been going eBay's way. Despite investors love affair with tech stocks and the fact that online/ecommerce has seen tremendous growth, the online marketplace has significantly underperformed many of its tech peers- both old school and new.Part of underperformance continues to be the exodus of buyers/sellers on the site. Originally, the auction site was a place to find unique finds. However, today, its mostly professional sellers unloading odd-lots of name branded merchandise.Online shoppers are simply choosing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when it comes to online shopping. Ironically, AMZN has its own marketplace for third-party sellers integrated into its core website.So, on one hand, fewer people seem to be using eBay. The other cause for concern was perhaps self-induced.The crown jewel in eBay's fortune was PayPal. After the site purchased the online payment gateway shortly after it's IPO, PYPL quickly became a giant in online payments and became one of the industries leaders.The problem for eBay was that PayPal clearly was running the show and was perhaps too successful. Activist investors thought that the traditional marketplace business was slowing down the quicker moving payments side and forced eBay to spin-off the stock. Given the returns and growth that PYPL has seen, this was the right decision.The problem is that now eBay proper is hurting on the growth side.The firm's recently reported numbers underscore this fact. For the whole of 2018, eBay managed to see total revenues grow by 6%. That's not too shabby until you look at the trends in place.Initially, management pegged full-year growth to come in closer to 9%. Moreover, the full year jump was below 2017's 7% revenue increase and below 2016 numbers as well. It should be noted that 2016 was the first full year without PayPal helping the firm's numbers.Other metrics have begun to trend lower as well. For example, eBay's pool of active buyers showed just 4% last year. That's again lower than the increases seen in 2017. Meanwhile, sales volumes have been flat for the third consecutive quarter, and when just looking at strictly the U.S., volumes actually fell. eBay Hands out the CashSo, it's no wonder why Paul Singer's Elliott Management and Starboard Value LP have taken big stakes in eBay. Both have been pushing for changes at the company including a spinout of its StubHub ticket marketplace and a potential sale/spinout of its advertising segment, both of which are seeing some decent growth compared to the traditional marketplace business.To appease the activists, eBay opened up its wallet in a big way. The firm is planning on returning $5.5 billion to shareholders in 2019 and another $1.5 billion in 2020. This includes a new upsized $4 billion buyback program and initiating a dividend of 14 cents per share.At current prices, that gives eBay a yield of around 1.59%. That provides eBay with one of the highest initial yields when looking at old dot-com era tech. eBay Is a Big MaybeWith the new dividend payment, eBay is clearly courting a different class of investor. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Old tech stock Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is now a dividend-seeker's dream with its payout history. The question is, whether dividend/income seekers are willing to give eBay a similar go.There are positives with the eBay story. The firm is still one of the largest online retailers in the world. The company pegs that it has around 179 million active users and features over 1.9 billion listings on its site at any one time.The best part is that eBay does have some pretty high margins and cash flows when it comes to people actually making a purchase on the site. It's just not as many people are clicking buy any more, with the stock guiding for revenue growth of just 1% to 3% this year.That's basically utility speed. But you can pay a lot of dividends and buybacks with that sort of slow/steady growth.The problem is whether or not the declines will keep coming. eBay faces plenty of serious competition from Amazon, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and even Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) marketplace. If that competition keeps eroding eBay's numbers, then no dividend is going to save the stock.So, is eBay stock a buy? Well, maybe. Perhaps, the best course of action would to place it on a watchlist and see the next quarter or two, focus on its declines. If they keep coming, the stock is a hard pass. But, if it stabilizes, investors may just have the next big tech dividend on their hands. All in all, eBay is wait and see.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-02-14,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), much like most technology stocks, has had a violent couple of months trading. Back in November, I wrote an article about its upside potential and Cisco stock temporarily delivered. Unfortunately, the market-wide Christmas collapse took CSCO down, and my pride with it.The 2019 bullish start of the year recovered all of that, so the stock went into earnings with a lot of pent-up pressure. Last night, Cisco reported earnings and Wall Street liked what it saw. This morning, Cisco stock is rallying 4% on the headline, so CSCO more than delivered on the expectations.In fact, Cisco beat on both the top and bottom lines. These days, a solid profit and loss statement is not good enough … investors want to see strong guidance. Cisco managed that and increased its quarterly dividend by 6% and added an additional $15 billion to its stock buyback plan.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFundamentally, Cisco is a survivor of dot-com bubble, so its management has proven it can execute on plans even through tough times. CSCO stock sells a 15X price-earnings ratio, meaning value is not a threat to Cisco's stock price action. This valuation is in line with other tech companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).For the long-term, if I own the stock I would hold it. Because if the stock market is higher then so is the Cisco stock. Critics could argue with me on that point since it is nowhere near its highs of $80 per share.So. from a trading perspective, I turn my attention to the shorter-term time frames to evaluate a stock entry point here. The stock has failed on two occasions near $49 for share in the past and since October. So there are some headwinds in that zone. But those also serve potential as breakout levels. There are also some technical patterns developing from this repeated testing of the neckline that has been resistance for a while. If the bulls can muster up enough energy to break through $49.50, then this rally could have another $5 left in it or more.So is it too late to buy the stock after this earnings Spike? Not necessarily.Nimble traders can still capture the rest of this breakout unfolding here. But I understand the hesitation of buying a stock that has run so far so fast. CSCO has already rallied 16% coming into the earnings so from here some would say that this rally is long in the tooth. Also, the markets overall are in a similar situation. So traders expect them to give back a little bit to release some tension before they can continue on higher.But without any regressive headlines from the negotiations with China or from the passing of the U.S. funding bill, I anticipate that this rally will continue and retest the S&P 500 last failing zone near 2,825. So Cisco stock will need the overall market's help to cooperate to fill this upside potential.The bottom line is that Cisco stock has had a great recovery, but this earnings report is reason enough to launch it into another leg higher. Perhaps it's not too late to get in.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-26,"U.S. stock futures are trading lower after yesterday's failed rally attempt. Optimism over the latest turn in the bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and China sent futures flying when traders returned from the weekend. Unfortunately, stocks experienced a classic &quot;sell the news&quot; reaction and gave back the lion's share of the gains by the closing bell.The selling pressure is continuing this morning, if slightly, with futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.49% and S&P 500 futures lower by 0.27%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 0.45%.Monday's early morning euphoria was enough to send call volume sharply higher even as overall volume climbed well above average levels. Specifically, about 20.7 million calls and 16.7 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe growing disparity between calls and puts pushed the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio down to 0.55. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average slipped further to 0.58.General Electric (NYSE:GE), Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) were three of the hottest stocks on the options board.Let's take a closer look: General Electric (GE)The budding recovery for General Electric went into overdrive on Monday after the company reported it was selling its biopharma business to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion in cash. Money received from the deal will allow GE to accelerate the paying down of its debt and better shore up its balance sheet.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market While the stock ended 6.4% higher on the day, the market's reaction was a massive &quot;sell the news&quot; event. At its morning peak, GE stock had gained 15.5% before sellers emerged to spoil the party. Chart watchers will point to the location of the rejection as telling. The 200-day moving average has lorded over the stock for over two years, halting many recovery attempts along the way. Yesterday proved no different.The news sparked a flurry of trading in the options pits. Total activity swelled to 285% of the average daily volume, with 1,027,272 total contracts traded. Calls won the popularity contest, accounting for 57% of the day's take.Implied volatility ticked higher on the day to 46%, placing it at the 38th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 31 cents, or 3%. Alibaba (BABA)China stocks took to the sky following news of the U.S. delaying its planned tariff increases. Alibaba was one of the biggest gainers with a 3.6% jump on large volume. The leap is serving as an exclamation point to the e-commerce giant's recent recovery.Friday's breakout precipitated the rally and gave spectators a clear signal to climb aboard. With BABA stock now above the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, buyers have officially wrested control of the trend across all time frames.On the options trading front, calls led the way. By the closing bell, activity ballooned to 159% of the average daily volume, with 244,326 total contracts traded. 69% of the sum came from call options alone.With BABA back in bull mode, fear has left the building. At 28%, implied volatility is now scraping the bottom of its one-year range (9th percentile). With premiums now on the cheap, the expected daily moves stand at a mere $3.27, or 1.8%. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The once-sleepy Cisco is getting its mojo back. Though the gains aren't as jaw-dropping as the late '90s, they are notable nonetheless. Last week's earnings release and the subsequent follow-through have sent CSCO stock to a fresh 19-year high.Trading volumes have ticked higher over the past two sessions, showing continued accumulation after earnings. Tack on the rising moving averages across the board and Cisco's price trend is on fire right now.Options activity is confirming the bullish undertones. Call options ruled the roost accounting for 82% of the day's tally. Total activity climbed to 246% of the average daily volume, with 166,346 total contracts traded.The increase in demand bumped implied volatility up to 20%, or the 14th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 64 cents, or 1.3%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-28,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is one of the hottest tech stocks of 2019, as investors prioritize safety over all else.Cisco stock is up 19% in 2019, but its dividend, recently hiked to 35 cents per quarter, still pays a nice yield of 2.71% as of this morning. And the price-earnings ratio of CSCO stock is under 19, so the shares aren't expensive.Best of all, that dividend is covered twice-over by earnings. Cisco has shown a commitment to the payout since 2011, when it was started at 6 cents per share. Investors who bought Cisco stock then, when the price of the shares was a little over $17, have tripled their money and now have a double-digit yield that looks as solid as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) payout.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism  The 5G HypeCisco stock should keep rising thanks to the hype over 5G, the new wireless technology everyone's talking about at this week's Mobile World Congress.CSCO is making one of the biggest investments in the new technology, but 5G has yet to positively impact its results. Cisco's revenue of $12.4 billion for the quarter ending in January was actually its lowest quarterly revenue in a year, and just 7% ahead of last year's $11.9 billion. The launch of 5G will require both wireless and wireline networks to be rebuilt. The new technology takes advantage of higher frequency bands and can match the gigabit-per-second speeds of the latest wired systems. Additionally, new application spaces based on adding computer controls for objects and devices should increase demand for Cisco's entire line of networking gear.Meanwhile, CSCO has transformed itself from a company with seasonal results based on hardware sales to one with steady results based on subscriptions for software, including security tools. The Cisco of CEO Chuck Robbins is very different from that of his predecessor, the legendary John Chambers. Now Cisco stock appeals to a different type of investor than in the past. Chambers created enormous capital gains in the 1990s. In fact, at the turn of the century, CSCO was the most valuable company on the planet. Robbins' CSCO is more conservatively managed, focused on delivering a steady stream of earnings and dividends to more conservative investors. Can Cisco Stock Keep It Up?The question for a tech company on a roll is always whether its good performance will continue. Cisco seems to have a decent chance. While the rise of Huawei would have been a huge headwind for Chambers' hardware-focused Cisco, Robbins' company has neatly sidestepped the Chinese company. Driven by software subscriptions, the gross margins  of CSCO are over 60%.Cisco is next due to report its quarterly results on May 15, and analysts'expectations for its results are modest; specifically, analysts' consensus estimate calls for revenue of $12.89 billion, just marginally ahead of the company's top line of $12.46 billion in the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings per share of Cisco stock is 63 cents, compared to last year's 56 cents. Given the increased demand for cloud-based software and networking, CSCO should easily beat those estimates. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockCisco stock is not for everyone.If you need fast capital gains now, you're much better off with an IT security company like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), which is growing its revenue off a lower base. PANW stock is up 37% so far this year, against an 18% gain for Cisco.But if you're looking for safety and income, as well as a tech stock with good prospects, Cisco stock may be for you. You can buy it at a decent price right now, accumulate it steadily, and look back eight years from now with the same smile that someone who bought CSCO stock in 2011 wears today.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-11,"It may not look like it over the last few days, but the bull market just celebrated its tenth birthday. From a low of 666 points in March 2009, the benchmark S&P 500 has soared over 300%. However, the search for the best stocks to buy today is much more complicated.For starters, the current bull market is the longest one in U.S. history. While that's an enviable position to be in, especially considering global jitters, it's also a target. Prospective investors will likely require more fundamentally positive news to drive equities higher. Otherwise, they might adopt a defensive stance, which might hurt even the best stocks to buy.On the other hand, every investor who's not approaching retirement anytime soon wants some exposure to growth names. Unfortunately, international markets don't provide much joy: ambiguity over the U.S.-China trade war clouds Asia, while European indices have failed to break above their bearish trend channels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio If you're looking for the best stocks to buy, or just stocks in general, you'll only find the most reliable names right here in the U.S. Here are ten companies that may spark growth for the next ten years:Source: Shutterstock  Nvidia (NVDA)I'm going to go out on a limb and place semiconductor firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the top of my list of best stocks to buy. Admittedly, it's a scary proposition. Since the beginning of last October, NVDA stock has dropped nearly 47%. This year, shares have gained over 12%, but much work remains.Still, the theme of this gallery isn't about what are the best stocks to advantage right now; instead, we're discussing companies that will not only survive, but thrive over the next decade. Irrespective of whether we continue this bull market or not, I have confidence in the longer-term prospect for NVDA stock.Here's why: Nvidia is deeply involved in multiple industries of tomorrow. From driverless technologies to deep learning and artificial intelligence, the company constantly pushes the envelope. And don't forget about bitcoin: should cryptocurrencies rise again -- and they very well could -- NVDA stock almost surely swings higher.Source: Shutterstock  Cisco (CSCO)In terms of relevant, long-term plays, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) easily represents one of the best stocks to buy. Its dominant position in the networking and telecommunications-equipment sectors makes CSCO stock a reliable, albeit typically boring name.However, Cisco has recently shed its somewhat dull reputation. On a year-to-date basis, CSCO stock has jumped nearly 20%. A few days ago, shares hit a multi-year high. As such, you may want to wait for a pullback before diving in.That said, Cisco isn't mooning without justification. Because of the Huawei controversy and the trade war, the Donald Trump administration has essentially blacklisted the Chinese firm. And despite the fierce rhetoric in Washington, punishing Huawei is a bipartisan priority.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy That suits Cisco just fine, as Huawei is a prime competitor to its business.Source: Shutterstock  AT&T (T)While we're on the subject of telecommunications, we've got to talk about AT&T (NYSE:T). Depending on what camp you fall under, you either believe T stock holds undervalued opportunity, or that it's cheap for a reason.My colleague Vince Martin holds the latter position, and I strongly recommend reading his analysis. Mature investors always want to know the reasons why they should avoid a stock; after all, you've already made a decision why you want to buy it in the first place.To briefly summarize, AT&T has struggled to grow in a saturated sector, and that has reflected poorly on T stock. Plus, with the telecom giant overextending itself with its aggressive acquisitions, obvious questions cloud the investment.At the same time, T stock represents a viable play in the next-generation 5G network. Specifically, AT&T will focus on the business aspect, while Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) attacks the residential market. The burgeoning network should provide ample opportunities for both, making AT&T a risky, but also a somewhat easy choice.Source: Shutterstock  Amazon (AMZN)I almost hate mentioning this company because I've mentioned it many times before. However, I can't deny the painfully obvious, so I won't even try. If you want a list of the best stocks to buy for the long haul, you must include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Sure, AMZN stock has taken a dive since October of last year, technically making it an undervalued prospect. Furthermore, recent volatility suggests that speculators may get another shot at a generous discount. Considering that Amazon has a long track record of success in the markets, you can certainly buy with confidence.But the biggest argument I offer is the company's disruptive nature. They've upended traditional, brick-and-mortar retail. At the same time, e-commerce trends show that AMZN stock has more growth to extract in this arena.  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News More importantly, management operates with a chip on its shoulder. Always hungry, they'll stop at almost nothing to expand their presence, even if that means stomping on everyone else.Source: Shutterstock  Magellan Health (MGLN)Automatically, you'll find healthcare-related companies included in almost any extensive list of best stocks to buy. Naturally, this industry benefits from consistent, almost captive demand. Everyone eventually requires medical attention. Moreover, the rapidly aging baby boomer demographic ensures a robust revenue stream.However, focused plays within this broader category, like Magellan Health (NASDAQ:MGLN) may net significant longer-term profits. Unlike many of its competitors, Magellan incorporates a holistic approach to wellness. As they make clear on their website, this includes behavioral health.Fundamentally, MGLN stock rides a powerful tailwind. According to a report last year from NBC News, major depression is on the rise in every demographic. That fact alone provides immediate legitimacy to Magellan and its holistic health approach.Moreover, mental health concerns have sharply impacted the under-18 crowd. It's a problem that necessitates a response, as Generation Z will soon enter the labor force en masse. Therefore, Magellan's relevancy will definitely rise, as may MGLN stock.Source:  Steve Pomeroy via Flickr (Modified) Raytheon (RTN)It's always the hope that problems can be solved nonviolently. Unfortunately, in some cases -- such as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un -- other options also need to be available. In these awful situations, you call Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), which has been a leader in electronics and defense since 1922.The recent  failed negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea highlight how important it is to have a company like Raytheon in your corner.Although the second round of talks ended miserably for Trump, it boosted relevancy for RTN stock. To keep our enemies and adversaries in check, they must recognize and respect American military supremacy.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound Further, the modern nature of warfare emphasizes precision targeting as opposed to old-school carpet bombing. This again benefits RTN stock, where the underlying company is on the cutting edge of weapons deployment.Source: David via Flickr (Modified) FireEye (FEYE)Common misconceptions lead many people to believe that we have an unassailable technological edge over terrorist states like North Korea. While no one can match us in the digital realm, that doesn't mean our enemies are in the stone ages.For example, a recent report from the U.N. Security Council revealed that North Korean hackers have infiltrated cryptocurrency exchanges to circumvent economic sanctions. Because it's a rogue nation, any cyberattack they commit has an overwhelming asymmetrical leverage: they can devastate us while we can't do much in retaliation (short of war).As a result of this asymmetry, I think investors should consider FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) for the long haul. Granted, FEYE stock isn't the most stable name within the cybersecurity industry. Nevertheless, it has tremendous growth potential because the industry itself enjoys guaranteed demand.More importantly, cybersecurity is a broad category. Whether you're an individual, a corporation, or a government agency, everyone needs online safety. The cost for a cyber-breach is simply too detrimental to ignore. That fear factor will likely keep FEYE stock running for the next decade, and beyond.Source: Shutterstock  Robert Half International (RHI)If you needed proof that the nine-to-five concept of employment was dying, the gig economy's rise is it. Rather than depend on a single employer to provide a living wage, workers today seek temporary or contract work. As independent contractors, their professional lives are never dull, which is an important factor for millennials.According to a report from Intuit, by 2020, 40% of American workers will ply their trade in the gig economy. That's next year, which means you likely know someone who has ditched the cubicles for a more dynamic lifestyle. Although not a direct play on this phenomenon, the movement nevertheless benefits Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI).In prior years, Robert Half specialized in job placements for their corporate clients. They still do, but the emphasis among workers has changed from stability to variability. That works to the company's advantage, as they have many clients that require temporary help. Not only that, an increasing number of organizations actively encourage the gig economy.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio So while RHI stock is going through turbulence now, expect this name to do big things over the next decade.Source: Bixentro via Flickr Match (MTCH)Back when I was in the dating scene, online dating was a bit of a novelty. That's actually putting it nicely. If you couldn't meet someone through the traditional channels, something was wrong with you.Things have dramatically changed since those days. Now, it's very common for people to hook up through the internet. Today, 40% of Americans use online-dating services, and that figure will likely increase over the next several years. Obviously, this boosts dating site Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) and by logical deduction, MTCH stock.But what further bolsters the case for including MTCH in this list of stocks to buy is gender representation. Unsurprisingly, more men than women use online dating services. However, that gap is a lot smaller than you might initially think: 52.4% of men versus 47.6% of women.What this translates to is an ample consumer base that should yield long-term growth for MTCH stock.Source: Shutterstock  Tilray (TLRY)Last year, cannabis firms ranked very highly among stocks to buy. This year, the situation is significantly more muted. For instance, during a brief moment one September day last year, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was a $300-a-pop company. Today, you can buy TLRY stock for around $70.Such extreme volatility has knocked the wind out of the sector, pushing would-be investors away. Look, I don't blame them. While I love weed -- as an investment, just to be clear -- I admit it's not a sector for everyone. But where will TLRY stock be in 10 years' time? Probably a lot higher than $70.I say this because marijuana's Schedule I classification is on its last leg. Just look at the evidence. Public opinion on legalization has completely reversed from the turn of the century. Conservatives like John Boehner and Michael Steele have conspicuously supported the green revolution.Even Trump and the Democrats saw eye-to-eye on the farm bill, which legalized hemp. Really, what more evidence do you need than this?  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy And once Schedule I classification goes, it's open season. Without fear of federal reprisal, financial institutions will back cannabis firms, legitimizing the industry.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long bitcoin and T stock.

2019-03-13,"U.S. equities are extending their bounce higher on Wednesday, moving back over major technical resistance levels as the S&P 500 pushes up and over the 2,800 level it has been toying with since late February and has proved intractable since October.If the bulls can hold above this level, a push to prior highs could be in the cards -- putting a nice end to the impressive rally out of the late December low. While Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to dominate much of the attention of the markets, with much of the world grounding its 737 MAX jetliner after two crashes within five months of each other, the familiar catalysts of steady corporate buybacks and central bank dovishness are powering the buying.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash With large-caps leading the way, a number of key large-cap stocks are extending to the upside.

2019-03-18,"Despite its long history, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) may have only just begun. Cisco stock once flew so high that it briefly attained the largest market cap. After the end of the dot-com boom, CSCO languished for years.Source: Shutterstock However, CSCO stock has taken on a new identity as a dividend-paying stock focused more on software and security. As a result, it appears positioned to benefit from the growth of 5G wireless technology.Between the dividend and the emergence of 5G, CSCO appears set to become one of the essential growth and income stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs  Cisco: The Income StockI once had quite a history with Cisco stock. I bought shares in 1997, and I was thrilled when they had risen eightfold in just over two years thanks to the dot-com boom. Depressingly, I then watched most of my gains melt away over the next year and a half before I finally sold for a more modest profit.Much like I have become a different investor, Cisco has become a different company. The old Cisco focused on hardware. Today, the emphasis has shifted to software and security. Moreover, the Cisco of old focused on investments, buying companies, and inspiring a higher stock price. Today's Cisco trades 36% below its record high of 19 years ago and emphasizes its rising dividend.As for the payout, the company will pay out $1.40 to shareholders this year. This places the current yield at almost 2.7%. Moreover, CSCO has hiked the payout every year since the stock began paying dividends in 2011. Those who have held since 2011 earn a double-digit percentage yield. It would surprise me if CSCO stock did not become attain dividend aristocrat status (meaning 25-plus years of dividend hikes) in 17 years. Poised for More GrowthThis does not mean I advocate writing off Cisco stock as a stodgy Dow 30 equity. CSCO will produce necessary products and generate dividends. That said, I do not think Cisco will become more like Dow peers Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) than growth stocks such as Square (NYSE:SQ) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).However, I expect Cisco's products to generate more investor enthusiasm, and with that, more growth to add to the income stream. Wall Street forecasts profit increases of 18.1% this year and 10.1% the next. Moreover, CSCO has attained something unimaginable with the old Cisco stock--a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Today, CSCO stock maintains a forward multiple of about 15.4.That appears cheap when considering the role Cisco will play in the 5G space. CSCO has created a &quot;Cloud-to-Client&quot; solution for 5G. This will affect the network at every level. It offers a seamless 5G solution end-to-end that will enhance security while optimizing speed and performance. This should drive profit increases as Cisco stock moves into the next decade--and the next quantum leap in wireless tech. Concluding Thoughts on Cisco StockExpect 5G to turn Cisco into the quintessential growth and income stock. Put simply, this is not the dot-com boom CSCO. This one-time growth stock has morphed into a more conservative, dividend-oriented company. Payouts have increased every year since 2011. With these rising payouts, it could eventually become a dividend aristocrat. Moreover, with its move into 5G, double-digit profit increases have returned.However, the real benefit may come as 5G represents the next great quantum leap in wireless technology. We already know 5G will probably equip every appliance, light fixture, and meter with wireless technology. However, the real power could come from what we do not imagine.Few could have imagined all of the apps that would come about when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone in 2007. Investors should expect the same, surprising level of innovation as 5G becomes more prevalent.I do not know what products will emerge. However, regardless of what creation comes about CSCO could serve as the backbone to that technology. Even beyond the financials, that function could become reason enough to buy Cisco stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-20,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average takes a fair amount of criticism from market pundits and financial experts. Some of that criticism is justified and often stems from just how the index its weighted. But you can't deny that the Dow Jones stocks are still some of the most important companies in the entire U.S. and overall world. With the thirty Dow Jones stocks being powerhouses in their respective fields, they feature enviable moats, large cash flows and big-time profits.And yes, stable and growing dividend payments.Overall, the Dow Jones stocks can be an income seeker's best friend. And just buying the index can lead to some good results. The index tracking SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) pays a decent 2.25% yield. That's not too shabby at all. However, investors who are serious about finding more income need to dig deeper into Dow Jones stocks and take a look at individual names.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter But which ones? Here are five of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to buy today.  Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.63%Dow Jones stock Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is proof that old dogs can learn new tricks and that tech's elder statesmen still have plenty of growth behind them.After being the go-to networking firm during the dotcom days, CSCO switched gears to offer more services and other products to go along with their networking equipment. It turns out this was a great idea. Services revenues for the firm continue to surge. Even better is that subscriptions for software and services jumped to be 65% of Cisco's non-equipment revenues. These reoccurring revenues provide the firm with a long runway to keep growth going. And with reoccurring and services profit margins well into the double digits, Cisco has indeed been growing.The firm managed to see double-digit non-GAAP per share growth in the last quarter.And as expected, CSCO has been sharing its growth with shareholders. Since its first dividend payout in 2011, Cisco has upped its dividend by over 480%. That includes the 6% jump at the beginning of this year. This dividend growth rate puts the networking firm in very elite company among Dow Jones stocks.Add in its hefty buyback programs and continued revenue/cash flow growth, CSCO belongs in every income investor's portfolio. Pfizer (PFE)Source:  Kojach Via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.45%Like Cisco, pharmaceutical firm Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been able to find growth and additional sources of revenue in recent years. Like many pharmaceuticals, PFE was facing a major patent cliff as several of its blockbusters -- such as Lipitor and Viagra -- went off patent. However, PFE was able to fill those holes with several other major product launches as well as targeting biosimilars and generic drugs. New cancer and recently launched biotech drugs have set the firm back on the path to growth once more. And with a robust pipeline, PFE should continue to shine in the future.And those drugs will get a chance to shine pretty bright thanks to a spin-off/merger.Pfizer already spun-out its slow-moving animal health division as Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). However, the firm announced that it plans on merging its consumer health division with GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK). The deal will push some of the boring and slow-growing pieces of its pie outwards and let the higher-margined drugs shine. This should strengthen its cash flows and dividends further.  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Under $10 And speaking of those dividends, PFE recently upped its payout by 5.88% on the back of robust cash flows and increased earnings from its new drugs. That dividend represents the company's 322 consecutive payout and its ninth year of annual dividend increases. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Chevron (CVX)Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 3.58%Big oil is a great place to find big dividends. That includes top Dow Jones stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). CVX has long been a great place to find higher yields and more recently that yield has gotten better.Like many energy stocks, Chevron dug in deep and cut costs, reduced its drilling and focused on profitable long-term production efforts during the last oil rout. With many of these projects now starting to produce some hefty natural gas and oil, CAPEX spending at the oil giant has decreased. Meanwhile, higher overall oil prices have helped boost cash flows at the firm. All of which has made its dividend that much stronger.After several years of token dividend increases, CVX has finally gotten back to meaningful raises and upped its payout by 6.25% at the start of the year. Today, CVX yields a high 3.58%. That's all thanks to rising cash flows and better margins.Even better is that the firm has recently announced that it plans on doubling down its exposure to low-cost shale in the Permian Basin. Over the next four years, CVX plans on doubling its output in the region to more than 900,000 barrels per day. Given how juicy margins are in the shale, this will only help the firm and its investors further.After a rocky patch, Chevron is back on track to being one of the top Dow Jones stocks. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3%When it comes to banks in the Dow Jones, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) can't be beaten. As the nation's largest bank, JPM features a huge competitive advantage, large moat and an asset base that only a few competitors can even come close to. And that base continues to get better.Last quarter, JPM managed to see its loans and deposits grow by 2% and 3%, respectively. Meanwhile, credit card sales jumped by 10% year-over-year. This is wonderful news for the bank. Banks like JPM profit from something called net-interest margins. Basically, it's the difference between what they charge on loans and what they hand back on deposits. With rates rising and the economy growing, this has been a boon to JPM's cash flows over the last year or so.Meanwhile, the firm continues to benefit from rising trading, asset management, corporate and high net worth/private banking growth. All of which has helped grow the bank at superb rates. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor Tom Taulli recently highlighted J.P. Morgan's amazing ability to generate strong returns on tangible common equity -- besting many of its peers by a wide margin.  * 7 Video Game Stocks on Steep Discount With the bank trading at 3% yield and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 10, JPM is one heck of a bargain. And with its ability to generate strong returns and cash flows, income seekers should be snagging up shares of this Dow Jones stock with both hands. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.8%When it comes to Dow Jones stocks, boring can be beautiful. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a testament to that. Selling Crest toothpaste, Tide laundry soap and Bounty paper towels isn't a very exciting business, but it is stable. And over the decades, that stability has made PG a dividend machine. The firm has managed to raise its dividend for 62 consecutive years and currently offers a hefty 2.8% dividend yield.The best part is that PG has continued to try and improve its business and add some significant innovation to its portfolio.That turnaround is paying benefits in a big way. The firm has managed to pick up some meaningful market share versus rivals, with organic growth growing by over 4%. This was driven by product innovation and is now the second quarter of 4% organic growth. Meanwhile, cost cutting exercises and a lower overall tax rate helped boost margins to 22%. Overall, Procter & Gamble managed to crush expectations when it came to earnings-per-share. With the big beat, it helped cement that PG's turnaround is working.Also underscoring that fact further was Procter & Gamble's massive $4 billion in operating free cash flows.For investors, PG stock isn't insanely exciting, but it can provide a steady stream of dividend growth for years to come. And that makes it one of the best Dow Jones stocks for income seekers.At the time of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-20,"Stock buybacks crashed through the ceiling in 2018. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index alone announced plans to repurchase almost $1 trillion in shares - a tactic that not only makes the remaining stock worth a little more, but improves per-share financial metrics in their quarterly reports.Generous corporate tax cuts took hold in 2018, making it easy for many of the nation's businesses - which already were flush with cash - to pull the trigger. The same business-friendly tax environment could make 2019 another strong year for stock buybacks.Eclipsing last year's tally would require continued economic growth, of course, although not even a nagging tariff war appears to be a problem for capitalism just yet. Inflation is being held in check, too, and the Federal Reserve is leaning dovish, so few landmines lie ahead. The only plausible threat to buyback mania to date is legislation aimed at crimping excessive stock repurchases. Even then, the idea has minimal support and could take until at least 2020 to put in place if approved.In other words, the environment is right for 2019 to be another strong year for share repurchases. In fact, several organizations have already made their announcements. Here are 10 companies that have initiated or increased stock buybacks just since the beginning of the year.

2019-03-28,"Ah, retirement. After a life's work it's finally time to enjoy what's the most important to you.Source: Shutterstock But to make the most this time, it pays to focus on building an effective retirement portfolio that will build wealth as you work -- and even continue to grow when you start living on this savings. Investing for dividends is one of the usual strategies for retirement. Often, that means investing in dividend stocks for income once you reach retirement. But for me, I advocate that investing in dividend stocks shouldn't just start after your retirement, but should be a regular part of your portfolio throughout your life. Betting on stock prices rising is a lot more risky than having stocks that pay dividends -- even when you're young.It's much harder to go broke when you have regular checks coming in. So even before retirement, your portfolio will have a better chance of growing in value by stacking up dividend payments and reinvesting those payments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Bloomberg<br />Click to Enlarge S&P 500 With DividendsAnd the proof element can be seen in the power of dividends in the general stock market. If you take a look at the performance of the S&P 500 over the past thirty-years you'll see that in price, the index is up 872.07%. But if you add in the dividends -- or even the average dividend yield of the index -- the return swells to 1,751.42%. An Even Better Dividend StrategyOne of my favorite strategies for a dependable retirement portfolio is dividend stocks that pay their dividends throughout the year. Now, most leading U.S. stocks pay dividends each quarter. But by selecting good dividend stocks that pay in different cycles -- January, July and October, then February, May, August and November, and finally, March, June September and December -- you can have dependable monthly payouts throughout the entire year.  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos And this is what is behind The Incredible Dividend Machine, one of the model portfolios inside my Profitable Investing service.As an introduction, let me walk you through the three payout cycles and some prime examples of good dividend payers for income and growth for the ultimate retirement portfolio. Dividend Cycle A (January, April, July and October)In Cycle A there's a great technology company that's increasingly focused on more dependable revenue and dividend payments that's also a good performer. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up 28.43% over the last year -- including dividends.Much like the strategy I'm outlining here, Cisco is also shifting to the successful business model of recurring -- or subscription -- income. Bundling equipment with services is adding to the rise in revenue flows. There is still a lot to be done, but I like what I've seen from CSCO so far during this shift. And a 2.63% yield makes CSCO a good start for the year's income.Drug companies are one of the big winning sectors in the market and in Cycle A, Merck (NYSE:MRK) -- up 57.77% for the trailing year including dividends -- is a great performer for income. Merck is balancing its management of its existing drugs and funding its development pipeline to keep the revenues coming and growing. Yielding 2.67%, MRK makes for another great Cycle A buy. Dividend Cycle B (February, May, August and November)In the second dividend payout cycle, there are plenty of good companies to look to for income.In particular, the market for natural gas continues to be a bullish market on genuine supply and demand conditions. One of the best in this market is ONEOK (NYSE:OKE)  -- up 27.20% over the last 12 months with dividends -- is a gas-focused company that is making hay while the sun shines on gas. With its dividend running at 5.00,% OKE is a buy for income and growth.Utilities continue to be another of the dependable part of the market. And in Cycle B, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) -- up 34.35% for the trailing year including dividends keeps -- delivering good income with its yield of 3.97%. Dividend Cycle C (March, June, September and December)The third dividend cycle, Cycle C provides many solid companies with histories of good dividend payments. Here are some highlights.One is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which is up 24.65% for the trailing year including dividends. The pharmaceutical giant is now working on a co-op deal with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to combine their consumer health businesses and it should be good for shareholders. It makes PFE a good buy -- with a yield of 3.42%.For another pick from the utilities sector, Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) serves the Northeastern and MidAtlantic. PEG is up 24.13% in 12 months and has a nice dividend yield of 3.18%.Lastly, this REITs is set to profit as the baby boomers age. Ventas (NYSE:VTR) focuses on senior housing and healthcare properties. VTR is up 39.76% for the trailing year and pays a dividend 4.90%. The Bottom Line on Your Retirement PortfolioI have one more stock for you to consider that fits into my retirement strategy, but not into my cycles: Realty Income (NYSE:O) has been dubbed &quot;The Monthly Dividend Company&quot; and pays out its 3.69% dividend -- you guessed it -- monthly. This diverse REIT is up a whopping 53% in 12 months and will guarantee you a monthly check.  * 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now All in all, by focusing on monthly dividends in your portfolio, you'll be on your way to building the ultimate retirement portfolio that will pay you for the rest of your life.Neil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

2019-04-01,"A new quarter is upon us and bulls are already expressing their dominance. Friday's rally to end the first quarter on a high note is persisting Monday, as stocks gap almost 1% higher. The strength is particularly impressive in the technology sector, which offers many of the best stocks to buy for this week.Last Monday's gallery highlighted three top buy-the-dip candidates in the tech sector. Today, we're going back to the well, but focusing on breakout setups instead.While many tech stocks created pullback patterns over the past few weeks, some have held firm near resistance. The sideways consolidation has allowed overbought pressures to ease and moving averages to catch up. With bases now formed, today's selections could see nice upside follow through.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cannabis Stocks Set to Skyrocket -- According to Wall Street's Top Analysts Here are three breakout tech stocks to buy: 3 Tech Stocks to Buy: Cisco (CSCO)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Since jumping to record highs after February's earnings release, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have been on a mission to the moon. With little by way of overhead resistance, the San Jose, California-based company's ascent has been relentless, bringing its year-to-date gains to 25%.The torrid pace is likely unsustainable, but no sense in fighting the extremely bullish trend. What caught my eye over the weekend was the clear two-week base that is on the verge of breaking. Friday's hammer candle ushered CSCO stock to the top end of the range.And before I could fire off today's message, CSCO breached resistance. With implied volatility in the tank, long calls or call spreads are the way to go.Buy the June $55 calls for $1.75. Nvidia (NVDA)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The 2019 recovery in Nvidia turned both the short-term and intermediate-term trends higher. Since carving out another higher swing high, NVDA stock formed a high base pattern. Volume signals during the pause remained bullish with few signs of distribution compared to the many accumulation days that cropped up during the previous rally.This sets up an interesting breakout opportunity over $185 resistance that could take the stock to $200 and result in the outsized November gap finally filling.The early morning gap is fading, so wait for NVDA to reverse higher and climb above $185 before pulling the trigger on bullish trades.  * 7 Emerging Market Stocks to Buy as Certainty Around U.S. Stocks Dwindles Consider buying the June $180/$200 bull call spread for less than $10. Shopify (SHOP)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Shopify's trend has mirrored that of Cisco's. But with a much higher beta, the rise in SHOP stock has been much more dramatic. Since eclipsing $200, the stock has been consolidating to digest recent gains. With the 20-day moving average now caught up, the time for a breakout is nigh.This morning's rally was rejected at the $210 ceiling, so we've yet to see a successful breakthrough. Either set a price alert or trigger for bullish plays above this level. The tech sector seems to be pausing a bit as other areas pick up the slack so SHOP may need a few days before powering through the high.Consider the May $200/$220 bull call spread to play the pattern.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-03,"U.S. stock futures are moving higher this morning. Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.42% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.58%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.63%.In the options pits, volume fell off a cliff to one of the lowest readings in months. Approximately 14.2 million calls and 11.7 million puts changed hands on the session.With optimism continuing to drive equity prices, calls continue to rule the roost. Yesterday's dominance drove the single-session equity put/call volume ratio down to 0.57. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held steady at 0.63.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity stood out in the following three stocks: Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA),  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).Let's take a closer look: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)The demise in Walgreens Boots Alliance shares quickened Tuesday after the pharmacy chain company released underwhelming earnings data. For their second fiscal quarter of 2019, WBA earned $1.64 per share on revenue of $34.6 billion. Both measures came in below analyst estimates.  * The 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally WBA shares were punished to the tune of -12.8% for the misstep. With the massive markdown, Walgreens now sits at a five-year low. The technical take at this point is simple. It's bearish across the board. Deteriorating fundamentals alongside a steep downtrend is creating a toxic environment for bulls. You should view rallies with skepticism.On the options trading front, WBA was the most active stock on the field. Total activity rocketed to 894% of the average daily volume, with 132,312 total contracts traded. Puts won the day if slightly, accounting for 51% of the tally.Because the 12.8% thrashing fell well outside of the expected move, implied volatility didn't drop as much as usual after earnings. It currently sits at 28%, or the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Facebook (FB)Facebook capitalized on the bullish backdrop for technology stocks by jumping 3.3%. The rally places FB stock on the cusp of a breakout, though intraday the social media giant did tag a fresh seven-month high at $174.90.The news was light, so I'm chalking the rally up to technical catalysts. Since ramping on earnings in January, FB has been treading water. With the 50-day moving average now caught up, it was time for the stock to rise anew. High volume accompanied the rally adding legitimacy to the move and suggesting it should have staying power.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity grew to 200% of the average daily volume, with 504,294 total contracts traded. 66% of the sum came from call options alone.Implied volatility ended the day at 31% which places it at the 39th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $3.35 or 1.9%. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco shares are partying like its 1999. Though this year's ascent doesn't quite match the insane trajectory of its glory days, it's about as close as we've seen the technology behemoth come over the past two decades.Its newfound leadership in the tech sector has undoubtedly drummed up excitement in the options market. CSCO has made multiple appearances atop the most-active options leaderboard. Nothing brings buyers to the yard like fresh highs.The price trend in CSCO stock is consistent and well-behaved. This week's breakout is simply the latest in a long line of bullish patterns delivering profits to traders.On the options trading front, traders went cuckoo for call options. By day's end, activity grew to 192%  of the average daily volume, with 101,702 total contracts traded. Calls ran the tables contributing 82% to the sum.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher to 24% placing it at the 33rd percentile of its one-year range.

2019-04-04,"Is Micron (NASDAQ:MU) stock finally a must-own name? This name has become a battleground, with bulls insisting that MU stock is too cheap to ignore. Bears counter with the fact that DRAM demand has slowed and that Micron will head lower as a result.Source: Shutterstock The bears have been right so far, as Micron has fallen precipitously from its highs last summer. However, we're starting to see a turn take place and that bodes well for the memory maker.Is now the time to get in? Let's examine.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Micron Is a Second Half StoryAt the Goldman Sachs Technology conference on Feb. 12 CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that Micron should see a stronger second half in 2019. He noted that DRAM demand remains healthy and that the company is working through its higher inventory levels.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises We knew these inventory levels would be bloated, as management for companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) said they intentionally pulled forward future orders as tight DRAM markets continued to push pricing higher. It was a smart move by Cisco, while Micron and others manufacturers are now paying the price.Anyway, last month Mehrotra again reiterated that outlook when Micron reported its fiscal second-quarter results. While the company beat on lowered earnings and revenue expectations, Q3 guidance came up short for both metrics. In short, Micron is still struggling to work through its inventory, but that doesn't mean a H2 2019 recovery is off the table.Now we're seeing it in other places, as semiconductor stocks are getting a boost with expectations for a stronger second half too. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NASDAQ:TSM) is seeing strong order growth for its 7nm chip, while sources are saying Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will see a &quot;significant&quot; boost in second-half sales.This bodes well for Micron too. Valuing Micron StockOne of the main catalysts for Micron stock has always been the valuation. How does a stock with such profitability trade with such a low valuation? Well, Micron hasn't always been this profitable, but it has always been prone to booms and busts.When we're in the boom phase, life is great for the bulls, as Micron is printing money and its bottom line continues to swell. During the bust phase though, revenue is under pressure, inventories are bloated and margins take a beating.Because of the volatility in the business cycle, MU stock garners a lower valuation than the rest of the market and many of its peers in tech. Case in point, analysts expect the company to earn more than $7 per share this year. With the stock price near $44, that values Micron stock at just over 6 times earnings. What a paltry multiple!However, consider that revenue is forecast to fall almost 20% year-over-year in 2019 and another 1.5% next year and it starts to make sense. Further, earnings are expected to fall 40% this year and another 18% in 2019. Who's going to pay a premium for that?That's always been the issue with Micron stock. Even though the company churns out strong free cash flow and is healthily profitable, it's prone to these wild swings. Investors with a strong gut and a long-term outlook can justify a long position in this name when the right price presents itself. Trading MU Stock  Click to EnlargeMicron stock is moving nicely, now over the 200-day moving average and knocking on that $44 to $45 resistance zone once again. The stock has met this level twice in as many months and has put in a higher low each time after its test. That bodes well for bulls, as the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to give way.It helps that MU is trending higher and with the latest move, is trading above all three major moving averages. That said, should MU stock pullback, it still looks healthy so long as it holds uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average.If investors really start to gobble up Micron on the belief that the second half will mark a turnaround in its business, we need to see it close above $45. If it can, that opens up the door to a few upside targets.The first isn't very high, at just $46.61 where the 50% Fibonacci retracement stands. However, a rally up to $50 would be attractive, with some follow-through potential to ~$51 to possibly $52, the former of which is the 61.8% retracement.On the downside, MU stock will need to reset should uptrend support and the 50-day not buoy the stock price.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

And that makes them some of the best stocks to buy.I ran a quick scan last night for new yearly highs. With Wednesday's rally, dozens of stock made the list, giving me ample choices from which to identify who deserved a coveted spot in today's gallery. The infatuation with stocks that are blazing into virgin territory, or at least new yearly highs, is well founded.Shareholders are basking in profits. There is no overhead supply, no group of afflicted owners begging to get back to breakeven. Short sellers are losing money -- more than ever before. And that creates some serious incentive to cover their positions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives More demand + less supply = bullish.Check out these three stocks to buy at new highs. Stocks to Buy at New Highs: Cisco (CSCO)Source: ThinkorSwim Were it not for Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) inclusion in the list, the title would have been &quot;3 Stocks to Buy at Record Highs.&quot; But during the height of the dot-com bubble, CSCO stock rallied as high as $82 before its crash to single digits. And that means this week's jump to $55.82 only represents a fresh 19-year high.It's still impressive. The strength of this year's uptrend has been matched by its consistency. The 20-day moving average has proven the perfect companion by supporting every pullback. Recent profit-taking formed a high base pattern that potentially triggered with yesterday's rip.Given this year's history of profitable breakouts, I see no reason to bet against another upside thrust. Consider buying the June $55 calls for $2.65. Paypal (PYPL)Source: ThinkorSwim Since breaking out of last year's trading range, Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been on a tear. With yesterday's bump, its year-to-date gains now stand at 28%. The last upswing saw increasing momentum, and all major moving averages are rising beneath the price.Volume patterns are also backing the bulls. I see a handful of accumulation days over the past quarter, with only a few sporadic episodes of distribution.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back The next earnings report looms on April 24, so consider that the wild card. But if you believe the trend continues, then buy the June $105/$110 bull call spread for $2.70. You could come close to doubling your money if PYPL stock rises above $110 by June expiration. VMware (VMW)The price action of VMware (NYSE:VMW) has largely mirrored PYPL, at least recently. Its trend is booming, with the moving averages stacked atop each other in bullish form. Distribution has disappeared, with hardly any significant selling pressure.  Implied volatility is even tanking, showing uncertainty is running low these days.Pattern-wise, we've seen VMW stock develop a mini ascending triangle formation that it finally completed with Wednesday's surge. If this breakout follows the script of its predecessors, big gains await. I suspect we will see a push toward $200.To capitalize, buy the July $190/$200 bull call spread for $4.60. The liquidity of VMW options is mediocre, so limit orders are a must here.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Cash on the sidelines with investors who are underinvested at a time when central bankers are &quot;more dovish than ever.&quot; Also helping the major indices is a rebound in semiconductor stocks, which has been a highlight of the market in recent days.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth In honor of Fink's comments, here are four large-cap stocks that are already melting higher and still look good for new money:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Intel (INTC)  Click to Enlarge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are extending their year-to-date uptrend and pushing to new record highs after eclipsing levels reached last summer.

2019-04-17,"The birth of exchange-traded funds over the past several years has led to the birth of thematic stock investing, and that's a good thing. Specifically, ETFs -- through diversification -- allow investors to invest in themes, not stocks. This reduces the risks inherent in picking a single winner in an industry, while still giving investors exposure to the upside throughout the entire industry.In other words, thematic investing through ETFs is a great way to simultaneously reduce risk and maintain solid upside exposure.The key with ETFs, of course, is to pick the right ones. As opposed to picking the right stock, investors have to pick the right theme. This is easier to do than picking the right stock and the right theme. But, it still requires ample due diligence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever With that in mind, let's take a look six big growth ETFs investors should consider if they are looking to invest in tomorrow's most important themes. First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR)The Big Idea: The value of cybersecurity will only dramatically rise in an increasingly digitally connected world.Key Holdings: Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA)Thanks to the widespread proliferation of the internet and rise of things like AI, IoT and the cloud, the consumer and enterprise worlds are becoming more digitally connected than ever before. Ostensibly, this is a good thing. But, we've been reminded recently of the downfalls of this unprecedented connection through various hacks and data security breaches. Broadly speaking, everyone and every company's data is running around on the internet, and that presents huge risks for both the individual and the enterprise.Cybersecurity solutions protect against these risks. Over time, as the world becomes more digitally connected, these risks will only grow. As they do, the value of protecting against these risks will grow, too. Consequently, the outlook for the whole cybersecurity space to rise dramatically in value over the next several years is favorable. That's why the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR) looks like a solid long-term holding. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKY)The Big Idea: Everything is going to cloud, and as it does, the companies that provide cloud-based services will grow tremendously.Key Holdings: VMWare (NYSE:VMW), Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)Technology used to be delivered and stored on-premise. That is, you used to buy software at a store, bring it home or to the office, download it and use it on-site, with all the operations, data and workflow hosted on-site. Over the past several years, this process has changed thanks to the cloud. Now, there's no need to go to a store and buy anything. Services are delivered directly through and stored in the cloud, and this removes frictions related to on-premise delivery and storage.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm This revolution is well underway. That's why the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY), which focuses on companies that deliver cloud-based services, is up more than 100% over the past three years. But, only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud. At scale, that number will be closer to 100%. Thus, we are only one-fifth of the way through the cloud growth narrative, and that means SKYY still has lots of runway left to head even higher in the long run. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)The Big Idea: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks are winning investments, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world's best SaaS stocks.Key Holdings: Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK)SaaS stocks are winning stocks. Broadly speaking, these are high-growth companies with robust exposure to the cloud and software revolutions. They're also high-margin companies since costs associated with delivering cloud-hosted solutions at scale are relatively small. Further, they are often supported by steady and predictable revenue streams, which gives investors confidence regarding go-forward operational stability. Because of these winning attributes, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV) is up 115% over the past three years.This big rally will continue. As stated earlier, only 20% of workloads have migrated to the cloud, so revenue growth potential remains huge. Plus, margins have lots of room to expand as the industry matures, and revenue predictability will likewise improve with scale. Overall, then, the three big tailwinds which have produced huge gains in IGV will persist for the foreseeable future, and that means that this big rally is far from over. Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO)The Big Idea: The robots are coming, and companies that provide automation technology and services will profit tremendously in the long run.Key Holdings: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT)One of the biggest trends over the next several years will be automation. Specifically, automated technologies will continue to get better and better, until they are good enough to largely replace human labor in many parts of the workforce. That's not great news for the labor market. But, it is great news for the companies that are leading this automation revolution, like Intuitive Surgical -- the company that is putting robots in the surgery room -- and iRobot -- the company that is putting robots in your house to clean your floors.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth All of these leading automation companies are packaged into the Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO). As such, as the automation trends gain mainstream traction over the next decade, the ROBO ETF will explode higher alongside all the important automation stocks. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY)The Big Idea: E-commerce is still in the early stages of a multi-year secular growth narrative, and e-commerce companies will continue to grow at a rapid rate for the foreseeable future.Key Holdings: Amazon, Wayfair (NYSE:W), Chegg (NYSE:CHGG), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)One of the biggest growth narratives over the past several years has been the rapid rise in e-commerce. Companies like Amazon, Wayfair and Etsy have pioneered of new of era shopping from the comfort of your own home, and in so doing, have stolen tremendous market share from traditional retailers. Consequently, all those stocks have soared, as has the Amplify Online Retail ETF (NASDAQ:IBUY).These gains will continue. At the present moment, e-commerce sales represent just over 10% of total retail sales in the U.S. That's still a relatively small piece of the pie. Further, the whole industry continues to grow at a healthy double-digit rate. Thus, it increasingly appears as though we are still in the early stage of e-commerce's long-term growth narrative. As that narrative plays out over the next several years, the IBUY ETF will continue to rise. ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY)The Big Idea: Digital payments, and specifically mobile payments, are gaining massive traction, and the companies behind these payments project as big growers.Core Holdings: PayPal, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), Square (NYSE:SQ) and American Express (NYSE:AXP)As digital shopping has grown, so has the digital payments world. When you shop online, you can't pay for an item with cash. You have to use a card or a digital payment account. Thus, cash has become less prevalent throughout the economy over the past several years, while digital payments have become more prevalent. This has led to huge gains in digital payment stocks like Master, Visa and Square, as well as in the Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NASDAQ:IPAY).  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile As stated earlier, e-commerce sales only represent 10% of total retail sales, so that growth narrative is far from over. Consequently, the parallel digital payments growth narrative is likewise far from over. Specifically, within the digital payments world, we are going to see a huge rise in mobile commerce over the next several years as mobile-first apps like Instagram dive deeper into shopping. All of this implies big growth ahead for digital payments stocks and the IPAY ETF.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PANW, CIBR, CRM, NFLX, AMZN, ADBE, NOW, ROBO, CHGG, PYPL and SQ.

2019-04-18,"The premium on Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) continues to increasingly draw attention. Despite warnings about valuation coming from multiple quarters, Twilio stock has recovered quickly from all of its temporary pullbacks over the last 16 months. Consequently, this has taken TWLO stock to multiples that worry investors not typically concerned with value.With any path to higher stock prices becoming more unpredictable, investors should avoid this equity for now. Trading on Vision PremiumTwilio has come to dominate the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) market. Given that so many mobile apps rely on the company's product, the company appears poised to become one of the more essential tech firms. The upshot is that Twilio stock trades with what I call a &quot;vision premium&quot; -- that is, companies that bring cutting-edge technologies and trade on potential future earnings rather than the multiples of today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTwilio's vision premium has taken its forward price-to-earnings (PE) to an astronomical 437 times earnings. As a result, both my InvestorPlace peers and I have cautioned traders not to buy at these levels.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Admittedly, Twilio dominates the PaaS niche. Also, the fact that Twilio stock has become very expensive will not necessarily take the shares down. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) moved higher for years despite supporting triple-digit PE ratios at times.My colleague Bret Kenwell calls TWLO stock a &quot;buy on any pullback.&quot; He points to several instances where buying at near-term bottoms led to massive profits. This thesis may continue to prove correct. Voting, Weighing and Twilio StockUnfortunately, when a stock trades well into triple-digit multiples, &quot;predicting&quot; begins and ends with the limits of charting. Moreover, when looking at this, I find myself turning to a quote from Warren Buffett's mentor, Benjamin Graham.&quot;In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.&quot;The &quot;weighty&quot; factors which could affect Twilio stock extend beyond the fact that TWLO trades at about 23.4x sales and more than 28x its book value. We also trade in the 11th year of a bull market, making a stock selloff more likely. With no fundamentals to support its value, Twilio might bear the brunt of such a downturn.Also, traders should consider the history of past tech leaders. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) lost about 90% of its value after becoming one of the more popular tech equities of the dot-com boom. Assuming a company survives such a stock loss, the effects of these high valuations can also last for decades. Cisco still has not recovered its 2000 high more than 19 years after the dot-com bubble reached its peak. Many high-flying tech stocks have and will continue to face similar situations. Competitive Threats RemainMoreover, while Twilio has become the dominant PaaS company, competitors such as Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) do exist. These PaaS providers hurt Twilio stock last year when Uber announced that they would look at other PaaS companies. Twilio stock recovered when the company expanded its product and service offerings. However, TWLO could face further trouble if large, deep-pocketed cloud companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon decide to compete in this space.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards As things stand now, Twilio stock trades at about 9.6% below its 52-week high. A move higher remains possible. Still, considering its situation, I see more factors that could bring about a pullback than inspire a recovery. Bottom Line on Twilio StockTwilio stock lacks a predictable path to further share price increases in the near term. Given that valuation has not influenced the price of TWLO, it could rise from these levels. For now, TWLO stock commands a vision premium, and the likelihood that it will dominate this up-and-coming industry drives this stock for now. Still, at some point, valuation matters. With forward PE ratios well into the triple digits, TWLO appears more likely to attract more weight than votes.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-22,"The initial public offering (IPO) of Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is reading like a classic venture capital &quot;down round,&quot; in which new capital is raised at valuations lower than in the previous round.Source: ZoomShares that launched at over $83 each less than one month ago are trading at around $58 each on Monday. That's a 30% haircut.This doesn't bode well for Uber Technologies, which issued its S-1 April 11 and is now trying to convince people its stock is worth buying. Uber's most recent private capital raise was also a classic &quot;down round,&quot;  with Softbank buying about 20% of existing equity at a valuation of $48 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut things don't have to be that way. Why Zoom ZoomedZoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) broke fast out of the gates after listing shares at $36 each on April 18. They were trading at $65 on Monday.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Zoom's S-1 showed it making money for the fiscal year ending in January, 3 cents per share on revenue of $330.5 million. The April 22 valuation of nearly $16 billion looks rich, but Zoom's revenues more than doubled between 2018 and 2019, rising faster than expenses. If Zoom continues to grow, in other words, it should be a profit-making machine.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan also provided an attractive cover story, that of a Chinese-born former Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) engineer beating his former employer with a &quot;freemium&quot; model, built entirely in the cloud.Before coming public, Zoom had just five funding rounds, the last bringing in $115 million.  While videoconferencing is established as a technology, researchers see its growth continuing, approaching $14 billion in four years.  Why Lyft FailedLyft, by contrast, issued an S-1 that was big on promises, but even bigger on losses. Like Zoom, its revenue doubled in the year before going public, but expenses nearly did too. The company reported a 2018 loss of $43.04 per share, on revenues of $2.16 billion after losing $35.53 per share on 2017 revenue of $1.06 billion, and $37.08 per share on revenue of $343 million the year before.Lyft claimed a valuation of $11 billion when it raised $1 billion in cash late in 2017, raised capital twice more in 2018 and carried a market cap of under $16 billion early on April 22.Ride-hailing is great in theory, but in practice it's a taxi, one without a license beyond the driver's license and organized online. That's why Lyft is promoting other forms of mobility, without drivers, like scooters and bikes. That's why Lyft bulls are talking about self-driving cars. The gig economy is not where you want to place your bets when unemployment is below 4%, and Lyft insists its drivers don't really have jobs , The Bottom LineThere are two important lessons here for cloud investors.First, you don't want to buy something that doesn't make money. Zoom makes money. Lyft does not make money.Second, if you're buying technology, it should be self-service. Zoom's technology is self-service, and the price starts at free. Lyft technology is not self-service, even bikes have liability issues and its vision of making transportation &quot;people-centric&quot; is still vaporware.Zoom went public, in other words, because it could offer public investors a good opportunity. Lyft went public because it had run out of private investors to fleece.The short version is this. Buy Google, not Webvan.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-22,"So far 2019 has been spectacular for Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). Cisco stock has risen 30% this year. That's the best performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, narrowly ahead of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Among the 27 stocks with a market capitalization over $200 billion, only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has outpaced CSCO stock YTD.Source: Shutterstock The optimism makes some sense. Cisco's legacy networking business long has struggled with growth, but the company is shifting into areas of better growth. It's becoming more of a security play, giving it exposure to that hot sector. Growing recurring revenue from increasing software sales add to the case, and 5G offers yet another catalyst for Cisco stock.Again, the optimism here makes some sense. Indeed, I laid out the potential bull case for CSCO ahead of its fiscal first quarter report. But with Cisco stock up 25%+ since then, the concern is that even that bull case now is priced in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees  The Cisco Stock RallyFrom a broad standpoint, there are four key drivers of the big gains in Cisco stock. First, the company's Catalyst 9000 switches have launched well, driving double-digit revenue increases. For a company that has struggled to increase sales (fiscal 2018 revenue was basically equal to FY16 levels) the new product is welcome, to say the least.Second, Cisco is adding more software to its legacy hardware products, including the Catalyst switches. That shift improves margins and adds the recurring revenue tech investors seek these days. It also allows Cisco to continue to monetize its hardware after installation, instead of receiving just a one-time sale.Third, the company continues to move into security. Like more focused players like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), here, too, Cisco has built out its software offering instead of focusing on just hardware. Cisco has integrated its SD-WAN products with cloud-based software, which drove double-digit growth in the second quarter.Finally, 5G is on the way, and that represents a real profit driver going forward. The adoption of that technology should help revenue, but Cisco already is investing in its development at the moment, meaning incremental costs should be lower.Obviously, there are other factors at play; this is a company that generates revenue of roughly $50 billion a year. These areas are where Cisco has an edge and an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth. Smaller rival Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) hasn't had the same success, and while CSCO stock has soared, JNPR has been flat for basically four years now. Cisco's moves explain much of the outperformance of its stock. The Concerns with CSCO StockIn sum, the moves make Cisco sound a bit like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) earlier this decade. Microsoft had similar growth questions, and relied on a legacy market (personal computers) that seemed to have little room for growth.Then new businesses like its Azure cloud platform, a go-to-market change for Office and Windows, and smaller efforts in gaming and hardware have dramatically changed the story. MSFT has more than quadrupled since 2013, thanks to earnings growth and multiple expansion.That said, there are two concerns here. The first is whether the Microsoft model actually is in play here. While there are growth opportunities going forward (perhaps most notably in 5G) the legacy business still is flat, if not shrinking. Security was just 6% of revenue in fiscal 2018, according to figures from the 10-K. Cisco itself is guiding for just 4-6% revenue growth in the third quarter.Growth might be improving, but it's not exactly torrid and certainly not yet. Meanwhile, Cisco stock's big rise has notably changed its valuation. As recently as last year, CSCO was pricing in basically zero growth.Now, Cisco stock trades at over 18x FY19 consensus EPS. Even with the Street projecting 10% growth in FY20, that's not a hugely attractive multiple. It suggests, at the least, that Cisco's recent success will continue for years to come. And it's worth noting that Cisco stock now has outrun the average analyst target.To be sure, that doesn't mean CSCO's run is definitely over or that the stock is a sell. Strong Q3 earnings, likely due next month, can lead those estimates and price targets up. The advent of 5G probably starts contributing next year, and its growth won't end any time soon.Still, the upside looks thinner, and Cisco really can't stumble back at a high-teen P/E multiple. Investors sticking with CSCO at this price had better be sure the transformation will continue.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-23,"A lot of companies have great starts on Wall Street. But, few have had as successful of a Wall Street debut as Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). ZM stock has been on a straight line up since its debut last week.The hyper-growth video conferencing company originally priced its IPO in the $28-$32 range. Investor demand was so high at those prices that the list price range for the Zoom IPO eventually moved north to $33-$35. The IPO was finally priced above that already-increased range, at $36. Then, Zoom stock soared more than 80% on its public debut to above $60. The stock kept moving higher the next day, and today, it trades at $67, nearly 90% above the already twice-boosted IPO price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy the huge demand? Plain and simple, Zoom is a great company. The company is in the right space, with 100%-plus revenue growth rates, a healthy long-term outlook, and sky high gross margins. Oh, and the company is already profitable, with only $330 million in revenue last year.All in all, Zoom is simply a really good company. The huge success of the Zoom IPO reflects that.But, Zoom was a hypothetical $30 stock a few days ago. Now, it's nearly a $70 stock. After such a huge rally, one has to look at the underlying fundamentals, and see if the valuation today is worth it.When you do that, it becomes obvious that ZM stock is very richly valued -- perhaps too richly valued. Even under aggressive long-term growth assumptions, I think today's valuation is slightly stretched. While the Zoom IPO was a huge success because its a great company, I'm in no rush to buy Zoom stock today. Instead, I think there's a pullback coming around the corner and investors can afford to wait for better entry points. Zoom Is A Great CompanyIn a nutshell, Zoom is a great company oozing with long-term profit growth potential, and that's why the  IPO was so successful.First and foremost, the company is in the right space. Video conferencing is a huge growth market in the enterprise world. There are so many tailwinds at play here. The enterprise world is more connected than ever, and as such, communication between offices around the globe is not only possible, but necessary. Video is considered the tool-of-choice when it comes to digital communication.Further, you have this massive shift from on-site work to remote work, which has been enabled by technology trends and empowered by the gig economy. Also, employee work forces are getting younger, and as a result, want to see all these up-and-coming trends play out at the office.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Second, Zoom is a leader in that market with rapidly expanding market share. Next to Cisco (NYSE:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Zoom is the other large player in the video conferencing market. But, the company has grown revenue at a consistent 100%-plus rate for several quarters. If the company keeps that up, Zoom will be the number one player in this market soon.Third, Zoom has sky-high gross margins. For the past several years, gross margins have hovered around 80%, and management's made gradual improvements. These robust gross margins allow for robust profit potential at scale.Fourth, Zoom is already profitable. Unlike other hyper-growth companies, Zoom isn't spending an arm and a leg to sustain that big growth. Instead, the company's opex rate sits below 80%. With gross margins around 80%, that combination produced profits last year. The Valuation Is StretchedAlthough Zoom is a great company with a ton of long-term potential, it increasingly looks like that all that potential is more than priced into the stock today.Consider this: The Zoom IPO was supposed to price around $30 per share. Today, the stock trades near $70. That's a 100%-plus increase in just a few days and it's stayed there. For most stocks, such a move higher absent a monumental catalyst would be a sure-fire sign of overbought conditions. Investors aren't applying the same logic to the Zoom IPO because it's an IPO. But, my numbers say they should.The video conferencing market measured roughly $11 billion in 2017. With revenue of $150 million, Zoom had just over 1% market share. That market share grew in 2018, likely to somewhere around 3% (assuming the video conferencing market grew at the projected 10% rate). Over time, as Zoom continues to prove out its competitive advantages, the company should continue to expand its foot print. From this perspective, I think 10-15% market share by 2025 is very doable.Current estimates peg the video conferencing market at $20 billion by then. That seems light to me. IDC forecast the unified communications and collaboration market as being worth nearly $45 billion over the next few years, and video should command the lion's share of that market given secular trends towards video adoption. As such, I think video conferencing will measure closer to a $30 billion market by 2025.A 10-15% market share on that implies $3.75 billion in revenue, at the midpoint, by 2025. Assuming 85% gross margins and a fairly regular 40% opex rate, that flows into roughly $1.7 billion in operating profits. Taking out 20% for taxes, you're left with $1.35 billion in net profits. Based on a growth average 20x forward multiple, that implies a reasonable 2024 valuation target of $27 billion. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 market cap of just under $17 billion.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm That's roughly the market cap of Zoom today, and it's April 2019. As such, upside in the near term seems limited by a stretched valuation. Bottom Line on the Zoom IPOTo recap, the Zoom IPO was a huge success because Zoom is a great company, and at $30 per share, the stock was way undervalued considering the company's long-term growth potential.But, after a huge IPO pop, Zoom stock now seems fully valued. Near-term upside is capped by what is already a stretched valuation. As such, while ZM stock is a long-term holding, investors can afford to wait for better prices to enter for that long haul.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-24,"On Wall Street, it's said the trend is your friend. And nowhere has that gospel been more a reality than in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). But all good things must come to an end, and now, if it looks too good to be true, you're either late to the party or staring at a short in Cisco stock. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock From the rollout of 5G networks to network security, Cisco has its hands in some of today's and tomorrow's growth markets, to be sure. And with the former, Cisco stock is enjoying one of Wall Street's buzz words of the moment. That's the good news.The bad news for CSCO is that where there's growth, there's also growing competition from smaller and more nimble rivals such as Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) or Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The truth is, unlike Cisco's go-go days at the turn of the century, the company is far from being the dominant player in these new growth markets. But that's not all.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs InvestorPlace's Vince Martin recently noted, investors have priced in a very optimistic or aggressive outlook for Cisco shares. Off the price chart, long-term growth of around 10% and today's comparatively rich multiple are warning signs Wall Street's rose-colored glasses will come off.Bottom line, today's hot buzzword or promotional deal Wall Street style, such as Cisco stock's stake in the 5G market, has a history of sometimes turning out badly for investors. Most recently, the music stopped playing for those who stayed the course in cryptocurrencies or stocks bandied about as blockchain disruptors.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains Ironically enough, Cisco is no stranger to this phenomenon of hyped up marketing gone bad. Just look at the dot-com era, or what became known as the dot-bomb debacle in the ugly aftermath. It's a period from which CSCO stock has still not fully recovered. CSCO Stock Weekly ChartTo say the least, it has been a very friendly trend for Cisco stock bulls in 2019. From last year's corrective bottom, shares are up over 40% and have outperformed nearly every single one of its peers in the Dow Industrials. Only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has turned in a stronger return from the nadir of December's broad-based low. Its shares are up 46%. But on the weekly price chart, Cisco's straight-line run to continued relative new highs since January has put shares in a much more technically tenuous position versus AAPL stock.Shares of CSCO are coming off a run of nine straight weeks hugging the upper Bollinger Band, while sporting an extremely overbought stochastics that has come along for the entire ride. Now and with Cisco stock putting together a confirmed hangman topping candlestick, shares are positioned for some backing and filling.It's recommended that investors who can't resist Wall Street's 5G siren song -- who are positive on Cisco's security prospects or maybe the company's switching gear (which admittedly has been selling well) -- still wait. At a minimum, if you're looking to play momentum in CSCO, a shorter technical pause of two to three weeks before entering a long position makes sense given the severity of the price run.And if you're less hot on Cisco stock's future prospects and see the rally built more on hype and hope than solid ground, shorting today's topping pattern is definitely approachable. However, keeping a stop tethered to last week's high, or better yet using a protective options position with earnings scheduled next week, is also 100% advisable.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Last week, we bought to close our CSCO May 3rd $54.50 Put Write because the stock had rallied, making the options we sold less valuable. Rather than risk having the stock move against us, we thought it was better to lock in our profits. That way, we could wait for CSCO to pull back before opening another position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow that CSCO has dropped back down to support at around $56, we have a good opportunity to open a new trade. CSCO's Highest Price in Over a DecadeWe like CSCO from a technical and fundamental perspective. CSCO isn't just trading above its 2018 highs. It's also breaking out of new bullish continuation patterns to reach its highest price in more than a decade.The company has been able to gain ground because while many sectors of the global economy have experienced slower growth this year, networking infrastructure isn't one of them.Companies are spending billions as they continue to build out their cloud and internal networking infrastructure. CSCO also seems to be taking advantage of the legal and political woes of Huawei, one of the company's biggest competitors, to claw back market share.From a more macro perspective, CSCO is not only likely to be in favor with investors as a large-cap growth stock, but also as a reliable dividend payer. Interest rates are expected to remain very low this year, which increases the value of each dividend payment. New Support at $56As we mentioned above, the stock has come down a little over the last few days, and it is currently up from short-term support near $56 per share. If you look at the daily chart below, you can see that there was some resistance around that level before CSCO's recent move higher.Daily Chart of Cisco Systems (CSCO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe fact that CSCO has found new support just above its old resistance level gives us a great chance to open a new put write.We think CSCO will continue to head higher in the near term. The pressure on Chinese telecom equipment-makers, like Huawei, will give CSCO an edge for the next 18-24 months. And as one of the few tech stocks with a non-negligible dividend, CSCO should see stronger than average momentum over the next few weeks.To find out which puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-04-29,"Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), which recently launched an IPO of its stock, seems like the perfect reflection of the broader battle over equity valuations. Investors who are skeptical of this stock market which has reached all-time highs will see ZM stock as the pinnacle of absurdity. On the other hand, those who see stocks in general and tech stocks in particular going higher will rave about the opportunity offered by Zoom stock.Both sides can make a strong case.The valuation of ZM stock does look close to obscene. But the company's capabilities in videoconferencing - a technology that literally could change the world - suggest that it has a massive addressable market.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 For some time, then, it seems likely that market sentiment will move Zoom stock. ZM stock will be the ultimate trade on the &quot;risk-on&quot; versus &quot;risk-off&quot; attitude that has defined market trading over the past few years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Tech Overvalued?There's no shortage of investors who see U.S. equities in general, and tech in particular, as overvalued. The same risks that led stocks to tumble in December still exist, yet equity markets have risen above their previous levels. Unprofitable or barely profitable software companies trade at massive valuations. For instance,  Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) trades at 20 times its revenue and 250 times next year's consensus earnings per share estimate. As impressive as that company's opportunity is, at some point valuations have to matter, as I wrote earlier this month.The same can be said of other high-flyers like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), or Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Their opportunities for growth are enormous. But that was true for Internet stocks , and it took even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) years to reclaim its dot-com bubble peaks. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) didn't reclaim its highs for well over a decade. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) dominates the networking space, and it's still below its 2000 highs.And those are the winners. Many losers have long since gone bankrupt or lost huge chunks of their peak valuations. ZM Stock Is the Most Expensive Name in the MarketWhat's perhaps amazing about ZM stock is that even in this market, it looks like the most expensive stock out there. Per its most recent S-1, there are some 269 million diluted shares of Zoom stock  outstanding. That suggests a market capitalization for ZM stock of nearly $18 billion. Yet Zoom generated just $330 million in revenue in its fiscal 2019 which ended on Jan 31. That's a price-sales multiple of 55.That's an enormous price-sales multiple. MDB, which has also sparked valuation concerns, has a price-sales ratio of under 30. Zoom's sales are growing quickly, as they more than doubled in FY19. But assume they rise another 100% in FY20. ZM stock would still trades at something like 27 times its sales. And it's not as if other high-flyers aren't growing rapidly.To many investors, 55 times revenue on its face is simply absurd. It's a multiple that makes Zoom stock untouchable. Zoom is modestly profitable. But the amount of growth priced in at its current level almost by definition suggests that investors are expecting perfection.And, at the least, it seems like a multiple that cannot be supported if the bull market ends. If investors start fleeing risk - as they did at the end of last year - Zoom stock would seemingly be one of the first to plunge. Is There a Case for ZM Stock?All that said, as prohibitive as the valuation of Zoom stock appears to be, investors might not want to dismiss ZM stock so quickly. An $18 billion valuation might seem ridiculous against $330 million in sales. But ZM has a real opportunity.Zoom's videoconferencing platform, and the pending introduction of its Zoom Phone, create an enormous addressable market. The S-1 estimates that market at $43.1 billion in 2022. Software-as-a service communications providers RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) and 8×8 (NYSE:EGHT) combined are worth over $10 billion alone.Both companies trade at much lower valuations: 8×8, in fact, has modestly higher revenue than ZM and a valuation of just $2.25 billion. But if Zoom can transform videoconferencing and take share in the UCaaS (unified communications as a service) market, it will have the opportunity to generate billions of dollars of revenue annually.Meanwhile, its profit margins should be enormous if that scenario materializes. Its subscription revenue should be sticky. If Zoom can take 20% of its market, which would equate to- some $8 billion of revenue and generate 30% EBITDA margins, it could easily be worth $50 billion. That process would likely takes a decade, at least,  but a stock that triples over ten years provides a solid, annualized return of 12%.Skeptics might say that  ZM would need to grow at an enormous  annualized rate of 38% for that scenario to unfold. Many of the conditions that would have to happen for Zoom stock to reach that valuation may not occur. In that context, 12% returns for a bet on a bullish scenario might not seem worth it. Watch the MarketBut the point right now is that the numbers can work. And for now, that's all that really matters. SHOP stock looked overvalued to many at half its current price. Pretty much any trader who has tried to short SaaS stocks on valuation in the last few years has been run over. In contrast, those who have paid attention to the companies' opportunities, and not to their multiples, have been handsomely rewarded.But  market skeptics say valuations can't just keep moving higher forever. And ZM stock, trading at a multiple double that of &quot;expensive&quot; stocks just days after its IPO, will be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.Perhaps. But what the market has shown in 2019, and indeed for the last few years, is that a stock with the potential to transform and dominate its industry is going to find buyers. Even in the ugly market of Q4, SaaS stocks actually did well: WDAY, MDB, and TWLO all rose in that quarter. At some point, valuations may just get too high. Until then, however, there's no reason Zoom stock can't move even higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-30,"There's one long-running issue with Nokia Corporation (NYSE:NOK): a lack of consistency. That's true for Nokia as a company, and it's been true for Nokia stock as well.Source: Shutterstock After a 10% decline on Thursday following NOK's disappointing Q1 earnings report, Nokia stock now sits where it did back in early 2012. Shareholders have harvested some dividends along the way, and those who have timed NOK stock correctly have made out well. But over the long haul, Nokia stock simply hasn't delivered.On its own, the first-quarter report doesn't necessarily prove that NOK won't deliver going forward. It may not even completely refute the bull case on Nokia stock. NOK did reiterate its  full-year guidance. The timing of the company's 5G deals appears to have been an issue, one that should resolve itself as the year goes on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares At the same time, the report highlights the broader concerns about NOK stock at this point. It emphasizes the problem I detailed back in 2017, and again in February. Specifically, it's exceedingly difficult for a stock to rise consistently without consistent execution and performance by the underlying company. For most of this decade, NOK stock has proven that rule, and it did so again on Thursday. Nokia's EarningsThere's no way to spin it: Nokia's earnings were disappointing. Adjusted revenue of €5.1 billion did rise year-over-year , but only thanks to the weaker euro. In constant currency, according to management, NOK's adjusted sales dropped 1%, while its reported sales fell 2%. Nokia had guided for a lighter quarter relative to its performance over the full year. But analysts were expecting at least some growth, and it appears likely that Nokia management was as well.NOK's sales dropped, and so did its earnings, which in fact turned negative. Adjusted earnings per share came in at negative €0.02, a mirror image of the €0.02 per share profit the company reported during the same period a year before. The Street had projected EPS of  €0.03. Operating profit, too, turned negative after a modest profit in the first quarter of 2018.Granted, the miss wasn't huge - and in that context, the 10% decline of Nokia stock might seem like an overreaction. But it seems likely investors were expecting a beat; Nokia has, in recent years, generally guided a bit light, enabling it to often exceed consensus expectations. And beyond the issue of the miss, there's the question of what the quarter means for the rest of 2019 and beyond. Is the Selloff of Nokia Stock an Overreaction?Nokia's management did try to minimize the importance of the quarter. Its full-year guidance was reiterated, though the company noted &quot;significant pressure on execution in the second half.&quot;  Revenues from 5G projects were previously expected to rise in the second half of the year, but more of the revenue appears to have slipped to the second half. Specifically, NOK cited some €200 million of 5G revenue that wasn't able to be recognized in Q1, but should positively impact the company's results before the end of the year.The issue with Q1 isn't that sales and profits were lost,  but rather that they slipped into the second half. And that explanation makes sense. The rising pressure on Chinese rival Huawei presents a potential opportunity for Nokia and rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC). But it's also led some customers to rethink their buying decisions, lengthening sales cycle.The case for buying the weakness of NOK stock, then, is based on the idea that nothing has really changed. The quarter was disappointing, but the company still has at least a chance to hit its full-year guidance.NOK's growth is supposed to be much stronger in 2020: EPS of €0.37-€0.42 against €0.25-€0.29 this year. In 2020, 5G projects and cost-cutting are expected to boost its bottom line. The bull case for Nokia stock, from a long-term standpoint, may not have changed all that much after the report. Yet after the decline, NOK stock is cheaper, trading at less than 13 times even the low end of next year's EPS guidance range. The Worries About Nokia StockAt the moment, investors aren't buying that argument and truthfully, neither am I. NOK has lost credibility over the past few years in terms of delivering on its promises. As a result,  it's difficult to trust its 2019 guidance at this point.There's also the risk that Huawei's troubles won't quite help NOK and Nokia stock as much as some might presume. Ericsson clearly is going after  the customers of its Chinese rivals, and having some success: it posted very strong results last week. NOK's rivals in other areas of networking  like Cisco Networks (NASDAQ:CSCO), Ciena (NYSE:CIEN) and even smaller Adtran (NASDAQ:ADTN) are performing well and posting growth, yet Nokia looks to be falling behind there, too.Nokia has a big opportunity in 5G. But NOK has had opportunities for years, and it hasn't been able to take advantage of them. The acquisition of Alcatel Lucent was supposed to be transformative, yet Nokia stock trades well below its pre-merger levels. NOK supposedly had an opportunity in digital health, yet it sold that business after taking an enormous writedown. Cost-cutting was supposed to drive profits, but its revenue hasn't grown.At the end of the day, the problem with NOK's Q1 results is that they require investors to trust the company. They require trust that NOK's guidance still is correct, and trust that Nokia can nimbly navigate the new 5G equipment environment while fending off Ericsson.Investors don't have that faith, with good reason. That's why Nokia stock is falling so hard after its earnings and why it doesn't feel like the plunge of Nokia stock is an opportunity.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Rather, it's stock charts of Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:BHF), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that are shaping up as your best bets. Here's what's happening, and what has to happen next. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The tone and timbre of Cisco Systems changed late last month, by virtue of a move out of a well-established uptrend and into a sideways rut. CSCO isn't in an irreversible downtrend just yet. But, as of yesterday's action, it's one bad day away from falling into more serious trouble.Just as bad, there's a ton of room and reason for Cisco to slide lower if the bears can deliver just one more decent blow. The stage is already set.  Click to Enlarge  * The make-or-break line is around $55.40, plotted in red on the daily chart. Cisco has found a low near the first three days of this week.  * CSCO shares are certainly ripe for some selling. The stock is now 16.7% above its white 200-day moving average line, which is about as much divergence as shares have demonstrated in the past.  * Fanning the flames of a potential pullback is the weekly chart's RSI indicator now being in bullish territory above the 70 level. Brighthouse Financial (BHF)Brighthouse Financial isn't exactly a household name. Not only is its $4.9 billion market cap just not enough weight to garner much in the way of media attention, but the company has also only been a publicly traded entity since the middle of 2017, when it was spun off from Metlife. It didn't get started on a great foot either, falling out of the gate, and then continuing to fall through late last year.The past few months have been distinctly different though, and decidedly better. They've been so good, in fact, that the stock is one step away from kicking off a self-fueled rally supported by an oddly low valuation.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money   Click to Enlarge  * Last month, BHF pushed its way back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. This instance looks like it's going to stick.  * As of this week, the purple 50-day average has crossed above the aforementioned 200-day line. This event, highlighted in blue, is called a golden cross and generally portends the beginning of a bigger rally.  * The volume since the turn in January has been leaning bullishly, as suggested by the fact that the weekly chart's Chaikin line is above zero, and still rising.  * The last line to watch is the resistance line that tags all the peaks since October. That technical ceiling is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. ConocoPhillips (COP)When we last looked at ConocoPhillips a week ago, it had just broken below a key technical support level, but it had been meeting increasingly tough resistance for several weeks. The stock followed through on that rekindled downtrend that very day. But, it was a flawed follow-through in that it left behind a gap that needed to be filled.Sure enough, the stock bounced, closing the gap yesterday. The stock may well be back in serious trouble again though, given the shape of Wednesday's bar and the backdrop of that move.  Click to Enlarge  * The gap is highlighted on the daily chart. Yesterday's high of $64.53 filled the gap, but the sellers tore right back in to close near the low for the day. That's a sign that the mode remains net-bearish.  * Bolstering the bearish case is the degree of volume behind Wednesday's rollover. But, that wasn't exactly a shocking development. Bearish volume has been above average and growing since mid-April.  * For better or worse, ConocoPhillips is still being pushed around by the sentiment surrounding oil and natural gas prices. COP can't be traded entirely in a vacuum.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Pritchard also saw &quot;weak product trends&quot; in the first quarter and said that this is the area of the business where problems would normally show up first.

The stock suffered further in March when the company revealed that some transactions with the Alcatel-Lucent division faced compliance issues.To its credit, NOK has transformed itself into a 5G equipment provider. However, it seems to lack the drive to succeed in its new industry. Political pressures have all but eliminated Huawei as an option in many countries. Unfortunately for investors in Nokia stock, the company has not benefitted from the reduced competition. Nokia Is Falling BehindOn the other hand, eliminating a major rival has boosted Ericsson's (NASDAQ:ERIC) numbers. Ericsson stock rose by 7.3% after it announced an earnings and revenue beat in its last quarterly report.Its 17.8 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio comes in higher. Still, that appears cheap in light of expected profit growth of more than 272% this year and a predicted 31.7% earnings increase in 2020.It also lags firms such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in other areas of networking. Double-digit profit growth, a 16.4 forward PE ratio, and the track record of dividend increases make Cisco a viable option. Dividend Investors and Nokia StockDespite these metrics from its peers, I see a case for buying Nokia stock, at least for dividend investors. The 24-cent per share annual dividend yields about 4.6% at current prices.Given the expected demand for 5G, I do not see Nokia's financials warranting a dividend cut. Moreover, it surpasses Cisco's yield of around 2.6% as well as Ericsson's which comes in at about 1.2%. The payout also gives investors some return even if it remains rangebound.Furthermore, Nokia's forward PE comes in at about 13. If it fulfills some of its potential as a 5G equipment provider, profits should finally rise. That could take it above $7 per share, a price level it has not surpassed since 2015. Concluding Thoughts on Nokia StockAmid the struggles, the buy case for Nokia remains lucrative for dividend investors. Nokia's latest earnings and revenue miss confirmed some long-held negative feelings about NOK stock.In recent weeks, compliance issues have weighed on NOK. Moreover, missing on revenue and earnings even with less competition has many investors perplexed. This has arguably made a case for investors to choose Ericsson or Cisco over Nokia.Nonetheless, Nokia leads its peers by a wide margin on dividend yields. Moreover, the rise of 5G will likely push NOK higher despite itself. Even if Nokia fails to produce stellar earnings reports, the cash payouts should keep dividend investors happy for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-06,U.S. President Donald Trump said China will pay billions of dollars in tariffs. Here is American businesses' plan to deal with the new tariffs go into effect.,How Corporate America is prepared for Trump’s 25% tariffs on China
2019-05-06,"On Sunday night, President Trump tweeted that trade talks were progressing too slowly with China and that he planned to increase certain tariffs as a result. This sent futures tumbling in the overnight session, although many bulls should be cheering the market's resilience on Monday. Let's look at some top stock trades in light of the market's action. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: PinterestShares of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) have been on fire since the company went public in mid-April. The IPO was priced at $19 and ran higher for seven straight days. On the eighth, it opened higher and tagged a new all-time high at $35.29 before embarking on a multi-day pullback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow what?Pinterest gapped down below $28 on Monday, but has reversed higher and is showing excellent relative strength on the day. I really like PINS here and tried to get a fill in the morning. Unfortunately, I did not. But sub-$28 looks good for an initial position for long-term investors.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio Over $30 and PINS can breakout, potentially giving short-term traders a nice payout. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: General ElectricAfter reporting earnings in April, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is opting for higher prices rather than lower. We outlined the stock ahead of time, saying it was vital for it to hold $9 support. From there, should the stock rally, we wanted to see how it did with its conflux of moving averages between $9.85 and $10. It did well, pushing through all three major moving averages.Now hovering near $10.40, GE stock is at long-term downtrend resistance. It's also contending with short-term range resistance. Should it breakout over this area, bulls will likely turn their attention to $12. On a pullback, I would really like to see $9.85 hold as support, maintaining those post-earnings gains and notching a short-term higher low.Finally, keep note of how many times GE has flirted with this $10.50 level. It doesn't always hold when it pushes through. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Cisco SystemsCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was looking good on Friday and as we highlighted, has several catalysts to justify a long position. However, the stock looks much better after Monday's pullback.CSCO shares pulled back to and held the 50-day moving average. The stock also filled its gap from back in March and a potential rebound could be in store. I like Cisco on the long side here against Monday's low. Below and a larger decline could ensue.Otherwise, a press back to $55 and the 20-day moving average could be in the cards, with potentially higher prices on the table depending on momentum. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Tyson FoodsWhat a beast Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has been. This stock has been surging all year -- up more than 50% from its December lows -- and by the looks of Monday's action, you wouldn't even know that the market was feeling any heat.TSN stock is up 2.6% after the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations. Shares are hitting 52-week highs as a result.Its relative strength and momentum is attractive, but with an RSI pushing 80 and with shares near channel resistance, now may not be the best time to buy TSN stock. Shares may have upside to $78 and overshoot to $79 or possibly as high as $80, but I would rather look for a buy on channel support.Should shares pullback and channel support fails, see how the the 20-day holds up. Below that and a dip into the $72 to $72.50 area could be a good spot to try a long position. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: FerrariFerrari (NYSE:RACE) will report earnings on Tuesday and the stock is losing some traction.After hitting resistance in mid-April, Ferrari quickly lost the 20-day moving average, which quickly turned to resistance. On Monday, it gapped below the 50-day moving average and failed to get back above it. It's also below uptrend support (blue line).That's not very encouraging action!  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio I want to see a few things after the company reports. On the downside, should RACE pullback, I want to see the 200-day moving average hold as support. Should shares rally, I want see if $140 acts as resistance. If it doesn't, a potential breakout can commence. If it does, I need to see the 20-day and 50-day moving averages hold as support.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-06,"For being a &quot;dinosaur stock,&quot; as some say, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) sure has been hot. Cisco stock is up 24% over the past year and has doubled over the past three years. Yes, doubled. As in, it's done better than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) over that time span.Source: Shutterstock Short of the stock performance, it feels that, in some ways, Cisco does not get the credit that it deserves. Take its WiFi 6 networking stack. This doesn't get a whole lot of attention -- unlike 5G -- but it's something that could be just as transformative if (and more likely when) it plays out. A passage from the linked article above:&quot;Wi-Fi 6 can offer 400 percent greater capacity and operate well in dense areas such as lecture halls and stadiums. The 5G and Wi-Fi 6 tandem is likely to handle outside wireless connectivity and inside, respectively.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is just one catalyst for a company that has many. What are they? Valuing Cisco Stock  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Cisco stock pays out an attractive 2.5% dividend yield, something that's hard to find in the tech sector. Usually to find that type of payout, investors have to sacrifice growth. That's somewhat true with Cisco too, at least to a certain degree. The company sports mid-single-digit revenue growth and that's okay, but its double-digit earnings growth is far more attractive.Analysts forecast revenue to grow 4.8% this year to $51.7 billion and 3.5% next year. On the earnings front, estimates call for 18% growth to $3.07 per share. Admittedly, those estimates drop down to growth of &quot;just&quot; 10% in 2020 to $3.38 per share.A lot can change in 12 months, which is why estimates that are 24 months out oftentimes are not worth basing an investment case around. Cisco is already more than halfway through its fiscal 2019 year though, with third-quarter results due up on May 15. Better-than-expected results may get analysts to nudge those 2020 estimates higher, so let's see how the company does this quarter.One last note on the company's capital return policy. Cisco stock got a boost when it reported a top- and bottom-line beat back in February. However, the company also added $15 billion to its buyback plan. The share repurchase authorization now sits at $24 billion, or roughly 10% of Cisco's current market cap.On a valuation basis, shares trade at 17.75 times this year's earnings estimates. That's not bad for a 2.5% dividend yield, double-digit earnings growth and a company that's sure to benefit from 5G, WiFi 6 and a continuing secular trend of connected devices. Trading CSCO Stock  Click to EnlargeWith all that said, how do we trade Cisco stock and where's the best spot to buy it?There are actually two attractive spots for Cisco stock, depending on how conservative or aggressive investors want to be. Conservative bulls can consider a long position on today's phantom test of the 50-day moving average. Shares sank in early Friday trading after Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) disappointed investors with its earnings report.Not to jump down that rabbit hole, but a quick note on ANET: The company beat on earnings and revenue estimates, but sank as Q2 guidance came up well short of analysts' expectation. That miss is mainly due to the action of a large unnamed cloud customer.<br />Solid risk/reward outline on the weekly chart.Click to EnlargeSo why should CSCO stock fall because ANET is getting less commitment from one of its larger customers? Already down about 6% from its highs and pulling into potential support, Cisco stock is a long for more aggressive traders. Below the 50-day moving average and the gap fill and short-term traders may consider stopping out.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 A drop down to $48 is where I would really love to scoop up Cisco stock. It's just above the 200-day moving average -- although, admittedly, by the time it gets down there, the 200-day will likely be higher. Further, this was a big breakout area back in February after this level had been resistance all through Q4.I don't know if we'll see Cisco stock back down there, but it's a buy if we do.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-13,"The quarterly earnings reporting season is wrapping up, and with the numbers are mostly in we can start to interpret the data. And the data shows that this earnings season wasn’t the bust that Wall Street had predicted. Instead of the 3% to 4% year-over-year decline that was forecast, the aggregate earnings showed a gain of 1.2%. Even better, that gain was powered by a wave of companies beating their earnings expectations – some 75% of S&P 500-listed companies reported earnings beats, well ahead of the 67% average.Even with the upbeat earnings reports, the S&P 500 slipped some 2% last week after President Trump tweeted that he would set new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese trade goods. His Administration carried through on Friday, May 10.We’ll know later this week just how big a factor tariffs turn out to be. In the meantime, there are still a few more major companies reporting earnings, so let’s check in with TipRanks’ database and see what Wall Street’s best analysts have to say. Alibaba Group (BABA – Research Report)The Chinese giant’s stock performance has mirrored the overall markets over the past year: posting losses in the second half of 2018 but going on a tear this year. In fact, BABA shares are up 30% year to date, more than double the S&P 500’s own 14% gains over the same period.Alibaba will be reporting Q4 earnings on May 15, along with full-year results for fiscal 2019. Quarterly unadjusted EPS is expected at $1.05, with full-year earnings at $5.46. The company is expected to show $13.49 billion in quarterly revenue, which would translate to a 36.6% gain over the year-ago quarter. While these are objectively good numbers, they come in the context of slowing revenue growth. BABA’s Q3 showed 41% year-over-year growth, and Q2 showed 54% growth. As some pundits have noted, when a company hits Alibaba’s size, it gets harder to maintain the breakneck pace of revenue increases.This past year has seen Alibaba’s slowest growth since 2016. The company has been hurt by a visibly slowing Chinese economy along with simmering trade tensions between China and the US. Last week, BABA shares slumped almost 9% on the heels of President Trump’s tariff tweet. And despite the slowdown and the share price hit, it’s important to remember that BABA still has strong support: US and Chinese negotiators are still talking, Alibaba controls China’s two largest e-commerce platforms which generate 82% of company revenues, and it’s main customer base is China’s 1.4 billion-strong domestic market. BABA has a firm foundation to rest on.That firm foundation gives Wall Street’s analysts cause for cautious optimism BABA. Jason Helfstein (Track Record & Ratings), of Oppenheimer, recently said, “We are encouraged as the rate of slowdown is stabilizing and BABA delivered solid core commerce results under tough macro environment this past quarter. In addition, sentiment is more positive now vs. a quarter ago due to Chinese government’s stimulating policies… we think there is potential upside in the outlook.”Helfstein gives BABA a price target of $215, suggesting that the ‘potential upside’ he sees could reach as high as 20%.Overall, BABA gets a ‘Strong Buy’ rating on the analyst consensus, based on a unanimous 6 buy ratings given over the past three months by the best performing analysts. The average price target is $220, indicating a 24% upside potential from the current share price of $178.View BABA Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Walmart, Inc. (WMT – Research Report)We normally focus on the more bullish stocks, but Walmart is too important a player to ignore. After all, with annual revenues exceeding $510 billion, it is the world’s largest single company, and with 2.2 million employees, it is also the world’s largest private employer. While size may insulate Walmart from some of the market’s vicissitudes, it does not shield it from everything. Walmart remains vulnerable to the US-Chinese trade difficulties, as increased tariffs would have a negative impact on the company’s supply chain and famous low-price guarantee.Trade was aren’t the only headwinds facing Walmart. The increasing shift of American retail from brick-and-mortar to online in increasing competition from the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart is responding by expanding its own online initiatives, including the implementation of ‘site-to-store,’ allowing US customers to order products online for pick-up at the nearest Walmart store. Since it is estimated that everyone in America lives within 10 miles of a Walmart, this is a viable model.So, Walmart brings a combination of strengths and vulnerabilities to its May 16 quarterly earnings report, and this is reflected in the forecast. The company is expected to show a 2.1% increase in quarterly revenues from one year ago, to $125.24 billion, while EPS is expected to slip 10% relative to the year-ago quarter, to $1.02 per share. One important point to remember: Walmart has a history of outperforming forecasts. The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters, with a 6% EPS beat in its last report.Turning to the analysts, we find mixed reviews for WMT over the past few weeks, starting with five-star Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul (Track Record & Ratings), who reiterated his ‘buy’ rating on WMT and set a $115 price target, indicating his confidence in a 13% upside to the stock. Oppenheimer’s Rupesh Parikh (Track Record & Ratings) followed, putting a hold on WMT at the end of April. And last week, Scott Mushkin (Track Record & Ratings) of Wolfe Research placed a ‘Sell’ on Walmart. So, this company has the full range of possible ratings, in just a short time. We’ll see on Thursday how the earnings report stacks up. In the meantime, the analyst consensus on Walmart’s stock remains a ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 17 ratings given in the last three months: 10 buys, 6 holds, and 1 sell. WMT sells for $101, and has an average price target of $112, giving the stock a potential upside of 10%.View WMT Price Target & Analyst Rating DetailRemember – WMT has a history of beating expectations. This is a company that put American retail on a whole new scale and has enormous resources available as it adapts itself to the expanding digital retail space and the conditions imposed by a US/China trade dispute. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO – Research Report)We talk so much about the cloud, online services, e-commerce, and other web-based ventures as the future of tech that it’s easy to forget how all of it, from the phone in your hand to largest initiatives by Alibaba or Amazon, depends on hardware, too – hardware that we rarely, if ever, see. Cisco Systems is a world leader in networking hardware, selling the telecom equipment (routers, switches, cables, and the like) that the online world depends on.Cisco will be reporting quarterly earnings the same day as Alibaba, May 15. Recent trends have been revising the consensus EPS forecast higher, a good sign for this company. Right now, CSCO is expected to report $0.77 EPS, a gain of 16% year-over-year. Revenues are expected to show a more modest 3.5% increase, to $12.9 billion.Some stocks require a great deal of verbiage in the discussion, but not CSCO. Simply put, this is a company that positioned itself early on (in the 1980s) at the forefront of the emerging tech niche and has maintained that lead ever since. The stock performance reflects this. CSCO shares have been consistent gainers over the past five years, up 165% in that time. On a smaller scale, CSCO is up 26% year-to-date. In addition to its steady equity growth, CSCO pays out a regular 35-cent quarterly dividend, annualizing at $1.40 per share per year and a rate of 2.62%.Blair Analyst Jason Ader (Track Record & Ratings) writes of Cisco: “Feedback remains positive, with VARs highlighting positive spending trends, new product momentum, security strength, and customers upgrading to newer Cisco products. VARs further highlighted Cisco’s steady transition to recurring revenue deals.”Ader did not set a specific price target for CSCO, but the stock’s average target is $57, which gives an 8% upside when compared to the $53 share price. The analyst consensus rating is a ‘Strong Buy,’ based on 13 buy ratings and 4 holds set in the past three months.View CSCO Price Target & Analyst Rating DetailEnjoy Research Reports on the Stocks in this Article:Alibaba Group (BABA) Research ReportWalmart, Inc.

2019-05-13,A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week:,"This Week: Cisco Systems and Deere results, housing starts"
2019-05-13,Cisco Systems stock has risen faster than the broader stock market so far this year. Its next quarterly earnings report could offer clues about whether the outperformance will last.,Cisco Systems’ Earnings Are Coming. Here’s What to Watch.
2019-05-13,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has pulled back in recent weeks from its post-dot-com boom highs. Cisco stock fell back after rising by almost 43% in less than four months. Since hitting that high, CSCO stock has declined to the $52 a share level.Source: Shutterstock Now flirting with correction territory, many wonder if CSCO will fall further as it reports earnings on Wednesday after the market close. If so, with its double-digit profit growth and the future in 5G, I see CSCO stock as a buy on any pullback. Earnings and Sales Beats Could Boost Cisco StockFor its third quarter, Wall Street expects Cisco to report earnings of 77 cents per share. If this holds, that would represent a 16.7% increase from year-ago levels of 66 cents per share. Analysts also forecast revenues of $12.9 billion. This would stand as a 3.5% increase from the same quarter last year when the company brought in $12.46 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Cisco stock has developed a reputation for frequently beating earnings over the last 20-plus years. I do not expect anything different this quarter. The company has worked to restore its reputation for something it has seen little of since the 1990s tech boom -- stock price increases. Since the beginning of 2016, CSCO stock has more than doubled in value. Last month, it reached its highest level since the fall of 2000 before pulling back. Wi-Fi 6, 5G Will Drive CSCO StockMoreover, as my InvestorPlace colleague Bret Kenwell points out, the San Jose-based networking giant leads the way in the emerging Wi-Fi 6. The Wi-Fi 6 networking stack will offer 400% greater capacity and better performance in high-density areas. Though it lacks the publicity surrounding 5G, where Cisco has pursued a &quot;cloud-to-client&quot; approach, it could become just as significant in many respects. Furthermore, the company's moves into software and network security have also improved the fortunes of Cisco stock.Detractors point out that this is not the 1990s, and companies such as Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET), and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) present genuine competitive threats. Still, while vendors certainly have other choices, Cisco brings a measure of stability and income not found in newer names. Favorable Financial Metrics RemainCase in point, CSCO stock trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio that compares well to its younger peers. This valuation stands at around 19.5 times earnings, and it falls to a PE of 15.4 on a forward basis. Moreover, analysts predict the company will deliver profit growth rates of 18.1% this fiscal year and 10.1% in fiscal 2020.The 19.5x PE comes in at the high end of ranges seen in recent years. If the re-emergence of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) serves as an example, Cisco stock could benefit from multiple expansion. Even if that does not occur, the profit growth rates alone make double-digit returns in CSCO stock likely.Investors should also remember one additional benefit to Cisco stock that did not exist in the 1990s -- the dividend. Since the company began paying a dividend in 2011, it has increased its payout every year. The most recent increase went into effect in April. Now at an annual payout of $1.40 per share, the yield stands at around 2.5%.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From The eight-year streak is a long enough time that the equity's price will depend heavily on annual payout hikes. I even speculated that Cisco stock would achieve dividend aristocrat status (meaning 25-plus years of annual payout hikes) in 17 years. Time will tell if that occurs. Still, for investors wanting a growth and income play in the networking sector, I see CSCO stock as one of the top choices in the coming years. Final Thoughts on Cisco StockCisco stock has become a buy on any pullback, and pull back it has. The stock has corrected following a 40%-plus move higher from its December lows. Now, predictions for the upcoming earnings report strongly indicate that its double-digit growth will continue.If its track record serves as an indication, Cisco stock should beat earnings by at least a penny per share. Bolstered by a move into security and software, as well as its position in both 5G and WiFi 6, Cisco's double-digit profit growth should continue for years to come. It could benefit further if CSCO stock sees Microsoft-like multiple expansion. Moreover, the eight-year track record of payout hikes adds a growing income stream to add to the returns.Perhaps Cisco stock rose too far and too fast over the last few months. Admittedly, it makes buying into earnings a riskier prospect despite a recent pullback. However, even with this potential hiccup, the likely rewards in CSCO stock outweigh the possible risks.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-14,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) hasn't been this hot since the turn of the century, when it was (briefly) the world's most valuable company. Since the start of the year, the shares are up 22%, against an S&P 500 gain of 15%. This puts the market cap at $235 billion, just $9 billion short of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).Source: Shutterstock Despite this, the recently raised 35-cent-per-share dividend still delivers a 2.7% yield to current investors. Since the collapse of the dot-com bubble, Cisco stock has become a conservative dividend stock. The company began emphasizing its pay-out in 2012, doubling it from 6 cents to 14, and since then it has more than doubled. It also has a big stock buyback program.Yet headlines are treating Cisco today as a speculative investment. What gives?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Market Is Hot for 5GIt turns out a lot of investors are hot for 5G.Cisco says 5G will also bring demand for WiFi 6, a new version of the venerable technology used for local networking. Demand will be driven by machines and devices talking to each other, not to you, in areas like managing store and warehouse inventory, monitoring factory machine wear, or just telling you when to call the refrigerator repairman before the milk spoils.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) says the company's routers, switches and security products will also benefit from the new wireless technology, as machine traffic is routed onto the internet and requires network upgrades.CSCO is due to report earnings Wednesday, and net income of 77 cents per share on sales of $12.9 billion is expected, with 79 cents per share hoped for. During the same quarter last year, net income was 56 cents.As usual, a beat on earnings could send the stock up 5%-10%, and a miss of even a few pennies could cause it to drop by a similar amount. Our Bret Kenwell says it's currently too rich to buy on a short-term bounce -- he'd be a buyer at $48. Vince Martin has been impressed by the recent rally, caused by a solid beat for the January quarter, but Chris Tyler expects the stock to cool.There are even analysts suggesting you play Cisco stock with options. The Real CiscoPersonally, I don't care about these short-term gyrations.As a conservative investor approaching 65, I put some of my retirement money into Cisco stock for the dividend. Because I don't need cash right now and think the stock price will rise over the next few years, I take my dividend in stock.Assuming a modest 10% gain in the share price, and a corresponding hike in the dividend, over the next five years, I am expecting to see shares at about $80 and a dividend of about 50 cents in 2024, when the IRS says I need to start taking out my retirement money and kick back. (I believe writers retire to pine boxes, but a cruise would be nice.)This is the difference between investing and speculating. Investors look for good long-term plays, put some money in them, and then walk away. Let time perform its magic. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockRouters, wireless and security are all likely to grow throughout the 2020s, and Cisco is well-positioned in them. If it misses a trick, it has the financial strength to buy what it missed, as it has done six times just in the last year with companies like Singularity Networks, Luxtera and Duo Security.While it's nice to see people writing about Cisco, it's not a short-term play. The company has worked hard for a decade to make itself a solid, conservative investment. Let it be one for you.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-15,"Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.Just as IoT (Internet of Things) became a buzzword for many years before it started taking off, the same is happening with 5G.  If you're unfamiliar, 5G is the next-generation standard for wireless communications. It promises to give wireless devices, especially the mainstream smartphone, lower latency and faster speeds. And because such uses as video streaming and IoT in automotive and appliances benefit from a faster backend network, investors will not want to miss out on the 5G revolution.The 5G upgrade is being driven by big U.S. telecom firms that are getting ready to test 5G sometime in the middle of this year. So as the upgrade cycle unfolds, investors will want to buy network suppliers offering 5G equipment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore hopping on the 5G investment play, be wary on one outlier: Huawei. The U.S., along with other G7 countries, are blocking the company from selling telecom equipment. If this happens, other networking suppliers will win more business deals. But if Huawei somehow appeases the U.S. and is allowed to sell its 5G equipment, then that may raise the competitive pressures for all players in this space.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk With all of that in mind, here are five of the best 5G stocks to invest in now.Source: Shutterstock  Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) may offset its slowing Security business if it wins 5G networking supply deals. It sells connections and network that protect connections worldwide. Cisco 5G Power x is a cloud-to-client approach to 5G. The solution delivers an open, hyper-programmable architecture (according to the information posted on its website). Any combination of cellular, Wi-Fi and IP access is supported.Cisco stock trades at just below 20 times forward earnings and earnings are expected to grow by nearly 10% for the next five years. This pace could be even higher as the rate of 5G orders increases this year.  Source: Shutterstock  Ciena Corporation (CIEN)Trading near yearly highs, Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN) will probably continue posting impressive quarterly results. In the Q4 report posted on Dec. 13, 2018, Ciena's earnings grew from 46 cents to 53 cents a share. It fell back to earth after the market was unimpressed by its March earnings, but appears set for a big comeback.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days Looking beyond the current quarter, the strong demand for 5G will drive fiber densification into the access network. This creates a great opportunity for Ciena to help as new platforms get created. The new set of capabilities include integrating coherent optics into these platforms.This is Ciena's core market strength. 5G is not a direct driver for Ciena, but the bandwidth and user experience needs in the back-end are. So, expect revenue growth in this segment to do very well for 2019.Source: Shutterstock  AT&T (T)AT&T (NYSE:T) introduced the first standards based on the mobile 5G network in 12 cities very recently. It is ahead of schedule in deploying the network. On the backend, fiber deployment, which is foundational to its 5G network, now reaches 11 million customer locations. This is on top of 8 million business locations.AT&T's leadership in 5G gives the telecom giant an edge over other carriers as it offers network improvements that include better speeds for its customers. As the rollout for 5G reaches critical mass, investors in AT&T stock will look forward to sustained revenue growth, strong cash flow and a dividend yield that is close to 7%.Investors might worry over the cost of building a nationwide 5G network. Competitors are offering the same, but AT&T benefits from a wider bandwidth and higher revenue per user. This happens as customers upgrade to a better, faster service offering.Source:  David Via Flickr Juniper Networks (JNPR)Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) shares dipped slightly after the company reported light fourth-quarter results. Still, the business model pressure will be offset with the MX 5G product refresh. Management believes MX 5G will add meaningfully to revenue in the second half of this year. The routing business will strengthen, thanks to the 5G investment cycle. Should Juniper grow its market share, the firm may cross-sell its secure infrastructure solution, firewall technology, further adding to its revenues in the years ahead.For 2019, the carrier 5G deployment will help lift revenue. Juniper also believes the 400G upgrade cycle and the enterprise multi-cloud initiative will be a positive tailwind for the company over the next few years.As of this writing, Chris Lau held shares of Nokia Corporation.

Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 1.06%.With bulls running the tables yesterday it should come as no surprise that calls proved more popular than puts. Overall volume climbed to above average levels on the session with 19.8 million calls and 18.9 million puts changing hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe uptick in call activity was enough to pull the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio down from its lofty panic-induced levels. It fell to 0.66, which is a one-week low. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held firm at its highest reading of the year at 0.69.Options activity was a mixed bag on Wednesday (Options traders zeroed in on analyst actions yesterday). Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) jumped following a robust earnings report and solid forward guidance. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefited from Warren Buffet revealing the size of his stake. Finally, Boeing (NYSE:BA) scored its third up day in a row.Let's take a closer look: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco Systems surged 6.66% on the back of strong earnings. For its fiscal third quarter, the technology conglomerate raked in earnings-per-share of 78 cents on revenue of $12.96 billion. Both metrics topped analyst estimates of 77 cents and $12.89 billion, respectively.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio Its revenue forecast for the next quarter was also robust, adding to the excitement surrounding the event. Cisco expects 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth, handily beating analyst calls for 3.5% growth.The sharp rally carried CSCO stock back above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, effectively healing all the damage inflicted during the recent market temper tantrum in a single session. It now sits within striking distance of its 52-week high of $57.53. With solid sales growth at its back, CSCO shares should be viewed as a buy into any weakness this quarter.On the options trading front, earnings enthusiasm spurred call demand. Activity lifted to 305% of the average daily volume, with 193,495 total contracts traded; 68% of the trading came from call options alone.With the uncertainty of earnings now in the rearview mirror, sellers slammed implied volatility down to 27% or the 22nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 77 cents or 1.4%. Amazon (AMZN)Warren Buffet surprised the Street recently when he revealed his flagship Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) was buying shares of Amazon. On Wednesday, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he finally revealed the size of the purchase: 483,300 shares.Based on Thursday's closing price that pegs the value of his investment at $921.9 million.AMZN stock scored its third up day, rising 2% amid a comeback in the tech sector. This week's successful defense of the rising 50-day moving average confirmed that dip buyers are still alive and well. With the bounce, $1,815 has established itself as the crucial support zone to watch. As long as we remain above it, the path of least resistance is higher.As far as options trading goes, calls outpaced puts by a slim margin accounting for 56% of the total. Activity ticked higher to 130% of the average daily volume, with 245,923 total contracts traded.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far Implied volatility sunk to 25% placing it at the 25th percentile of its one-year range. The expected daily move is now $28.23 or 1.5%. Boeing (BA)Boeing shares finally achieved liftoff, but with overhead resistance looming large it's bound to be a short flight. Yesterday's 2.4% climb marked its third up day in a row and recovered some of the ground lost during last week's nasty breakdown.The $362 area was a significant support level on the way down, and I fully expect it to prove stiff resistance moving forward. This run-up smells like a dead-cat bounce.Nonetheless, yesterday's jump was enough to create a surge in options trading. Speculators favored calls almost 2 to 1 over puts. Total activity grew to 109% of the average daily volume, with 118,273 contracts traded.Meanwhile, on the implied volatility front, the reading fell to 27% which lands it at the 26th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-05-22,"The IPO market in 2019's been a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde affair with some well-known unicorns such as Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) disappointing investors while others like PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) have exceeded investor expectations. It's never been easy separating the good IPOs from the bad ones. You never know how a stock is going to perform once it's trading in the secondary markets. However, there are two ETFs available to help investors take advantage of the IPO phenomenon on a long-term basis. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf the two, the First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX) is the larger ETF with total net assets of $1.1 billion. However, it is the tiny Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO) at $42 million in total assets that has a more appropriate methodology for finding the best stocks to buy. That's because IPO primarily adds new stocks on a quarterly basis -- though it can make fast-track additions if the offering is large enough as was the case with Lyft, while FPX adds IPO stocks after the sixth day of trading, which means in the case of Beyond Meat, that the fund is buying shares at hugely inflated prices.The other difference is that FPX holds for four years while IPO kicks IPO stocks out after two years. In my experience, the best time to buy IPO stocks is between 12-24 months after going public.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors So, based on the holdings of IPO, I've selected the seven best stocks to buy for the long haul. VICI Properties (VICI)Source: Shutterstock VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust that was spun off from Caesars Entertainment (NYSE:CZR) in October 2017. VICI went public on January 31, 2018, at $20 a share. Its first-day return was 4.5%. Since its IPO, VICI shares are up 11.5% through May 15. What's to like about the experiential and gaming real estate portfolio?First, it has a 100% occupancy rate with its tenants (Caesars, Harrah's, etc.) on triple-net leases. That means the tenants pay for all the upkeep on the properties. Secondly, it has a diversified group of revenue streams. Although gaming accounts for 51% of its overall revenue, it gets another 19% from hotel rooms, 18% from food and beverage, and 12% from management fees, etc. I know what you're thinking. VICI is the asset-heavy castoff from Caesars. Caesars keeps the operating contracts and VICI is stuck with assets that are near-impossible to convert from a casino operation should the business go sourThe fact is, VICI's properties generate some of the highest adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) yields in real estate at 6.3%Furthermore, it's got excellent non-gaming external growth opportunities ahead of it to tap into an ongoing desire by consumers to spend on experiences rather than things. Sixteen months into its IPO, it's underperformed. That lack of performance won't last forever. In the meantime, enjoy the 5.1% yield.   Roku (ROKU)Source:  Roku If you're a cord cutter, you probably are familiar with Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), the company behind the Roku Channel and its streaming platform that brings together consumers, content publishers, and advertisers for mutual benefit. Roku went public in September 2017 at $14 a share. Its first-day return was 67.9%; its total return since its IPO is 495.3%. I'm not usually a fan of stocks that aren't profitable, but Roku's got a pathway to profitability that's sure to make IPO investors even more money than they've already made. Roku makes money in three ways: advertising, licensing fees from Smart TV makers who license the Roku operating system, and from the sale of streaming players. This trifecta of growth is what's got me so darn excited about its future. I recently stated that an analysts prediction Roku's stock price could triple over the next five years wasn't as crazy as it sounded. That's because Roku continues to grow its user base and hours streamed by 40% or more a quarter.  * 5 Great Tech ETFs That Aren't the XLK In my opinion, Roku's got an excellent shot at hitting $200 within the next 2-3 years. It's got that good a business model.    Ceridian HCM (CDAY)Source: Shutterstock Although I said in the intro that it's virtually impossible to know how a stock's going to perform in the secondary markets, I had a real strong feeling about Ceridian HCM (NYSE:CDAY) when it went public in April 2018 at $22 a share. Up 41.9% in its first day of trading and 128.0% since its IPO, I recommended CDAY within a week of the human capital management software company selling shares to the public. &quot;Dayforce has over 3,000 customers who pay a per-employee, per month (PEPM) subscription with an initial term of 3-5 years. If the customer grows headcount, Dayforce wins,&quot; I wrote May 7, 2018. &quot;Dayforce has grown its cloud revenue by more than 60% on a compounded basis over the past five years. I see it as one of the best up-and-coming stocks to own on the NYSE.&quot;Fast forward to the end of Ceridian's Q1 2019 results that it released May 1, and Dayforce now has 3,851 customers, a 28% increase in less than a year. As it continues to build market share in North America and beyond, I expect its profitability will increase dramatically. CEO David Ossip is Canadian (as am I) so I'm biased about his leadership capabilities. However, if you read up on the Toronto resident, you'll find out he's the real deal.    Focus Financial Partners (FOCS)Source: Shutterstock If you've owned shares of wealth-management consolidator Focus Financial Partners (NASDAQ:FOCS) since it went public last July at $33, I feel your pain. That's because FOCS made 13.8% on its first day of trading but has given it all back and then some -- down 3.0% in the 11 months since its IPO. The biggest problem with consolidating independent wealth management firms is that you can pay the right price when making an acquisition but lose ground anyway due to market corrections, slowing economies, etc., which lowers the assets under management and by extension the fees you charge as a result. Therefore, you can acquire the smartest money managers in the world, and still lose.&quot;Organic revenue growth(1) was 7.7%, which when compared to the prior year quarter, was impacted by the effect of the markets, primarily equities and fixed income, decline in the 2018 fourth quarter and the advanced billing structure utilized by certain of our partner firms,&quot; Focus stated in its Q1 2019 press release. &quot;Based on our M&A momentum and the general recovery in the financial markets, our organic revenue growth for the second quarter of 2019 is expected to be above 10%, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model.&quot;I believe the consolidation of independent registered investment advisor (RIA) firms is only in the early stages. That being said, if you do buy shares in FOCS, be less concerned about M&A and more concerned about organic growth. Watch that number like a hawk.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential That's because in 3-5 years, the music will stop, and you don't want to be left without a chair. Dropbox (DBX)Source: Shutterstock So many IPOs go public each year it's hard to remember when some of the better-known issues listed their shares. Take Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), the web-based cloud storage and collaboration platform. I could have sworn it was the granddaddy amongst the seven stocks I've recommended. No, that title goes to Roku, which went public in the fall of 2017. Dropbox's IPO was March 22, 2018, at $21 a share. On its first day of trading, DBX shares gained 35.6%. However, since then, investors haven't been nearly as enthusiastic about its stock. It's up only 8.6% in the almost 14 months it's been trading on NASDAQ.It's not unusual for IPO shares to lose ground after a robust first-day return. According to UBS head of asset allocation Jason Draho, the average first-day return is 18%, followed by six months of underperformance relative to the broader markets. Furthermore, as I often point out when discussing IPOs, you can often buy shares of an IPO for less than its original price within 12-24 months of going public. Dropbox announced its Q1 2019 results May 9 and they were solid across the board. However, DBX dropped perilously close to falling below $21, the price at which it went public. This is one stock where I'd buy a little now and wait to see if it falls below $21 in the next 3-6 months. Zoom Video (ZM)One of the Best Stocks Class of 2019, Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) went public on April 17 at $36 a share. It was an immediate hit with investors gaining 72.2% in its first day of trading and is up 121.6% through May 15, an annualized total return of almost 1,500%. Yikes.I had never heard of the company until I read a Yahoo Finance story by Brian Sozzi about CEO Eric Yuan. In it, he talks about how Zoom would always leave money on the table when obtaining funding from VC investors so that long-term everyone would win.  In case you're not familiar with Zoom, it provides outstanding video conferencing technology to companies on a monthly subscription basis. The subscription economy continues to gain traction, so the IPO timing was good on Yuan's part. However, it is the fact that Yuan left Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in 2011 to create better video conferencing technology than the giant networking company offered, that makes this IPO a must own. And, let's not forget it's one of the few Class of 2019 IPOs that makes money. Spotify (SPOT)Source: Spotify I don't know if it's a coincidence, but Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) went public on April 3, 2018, at $132 a share. Its first-day return was a respectable 12.9%. However, its total return through May 15 is 3.4%, 520 basis points worse than Dropbox, whose IPO was two weeks earlier.  Unless you've been living on Mars, you're likely familiar with the global music streaming service. At the end of April, it announced its Q1 2019 results that included a 26% year over year increase in active monthly users to 217 million and a 32% increase in premium subscribers to 100 million. Of greater importance is the fact it generated $173 million in free cash flow, 134% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. While it's best known for streaming music, it is the work it's doing for podcasters that's got my attention. Between launching Spotify for Podcasters last October and Soundtrap for Storytellers on May 14, the company's capturing a potentially lucrative secondary market from its original business idea.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy Like Dropbox, I see it plodding away at its business until economies of scale force investors to take notice. Until then you're paying about the same valuation for its stock as you would have a year ago, but you're getting a much stronger company from a financial perspective. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-24,"The revival of older tech companies continues. In recent years, we've seen Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other such powers of the 90s tech boom turn back into hot stocks again after years of doing nothing. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is becoming the latest to buck all expectations and turn once more into a star performer. CSCO stock is 6.2% below its 52-week high.Source: Shutterstock Cisco stock peaked around $80 a share in 2000, a lofty level that most analysts assumed the shares would never reach again. CSCO crashed to the teens following the dot-com implosion and would not reach $40 again until 2017. As recently as the end of 2016, it was still trading at just $30. Now, however, shares have doubled in just a couple of years and are making a run to top their long-standing all-time high. What's led Cisco's revival, and will the good times continue? Rare Tech Trade War WinnerWhile the trade war hasn't been a disaster for the U.S. stock market as a whole, it's had an almost universally negative impact on tech stocks in particular. That said, CSCO stock has been unusual in that it is gaining from the tensions with China. Why's that? The answer is 5G.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUntil recently, it appeared that Huawei had a dominant lead in the race to build 5G gear. It got so bad at one point that Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins had to assure the market that there wouldn't be just one supplier of 5G equipment. With Huawei's central role in the Chinese tech spying scandal, however, the tables have turned. Huawei's CFO is in legal trouble, while the Trump administration is putting the screws on the company. The White House has urged European nations, for example, to stop buying products from Huawei as well.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Cisco is the clear winner from this. Until recently, most analysts assumed Huawei would be the dominant player in this space. But Cisco never gave up, and now the political winds have given the company a golden opportunity. As Robbins put it in an interview with Barron's earlier this year: &quot;We're singularly focused on 5G, and have every confidence we will win&quot;. He added that, &quot;I would put our innovation against theirs or anyone else in the world […] I feel not only can we be competitive, but we are beating them.&quot;The battle for 5G is still in the early stages. Some estimates suggest that less than 5% of mobile traffic will be on 5G by the end of 2019. That leaves plenty of room for Huawei to regain its edge if political pressure eases. But for now, Cisco has to like its odds. For what it's worth, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is another potential winner in 5G if Huawei can't regain its leadership role. Earnings Strength in DetailsCisco's recent earnings report was a good one, and was stronger than it may look at first glance. Revenue just barely topped expectations, while GAAP earnings beat consensus by three cents a share. That's all fine, if not extraordinary.Where things get good is when you look at the details. The company's gross margin ticked up nicely. This was aided by a rather remarkable 12% increase in operating income, while operating costs grew by only 1%. This is showing the power of Cisco's growing subscription and services businesses. Additionally, the company put in solid guidance for next quarter, casting aside worries that the company was seeing a slow down due to trade war issues. CSCO Stock Shed Dead-Money ValuationIn recent months, Cisco's P/E ratio has marched steadily higher. Not too long ago, CSCO stock was trading for as low as 10x earnings. Like Intel and Microsoft, Cisco stock was treated as &quot;dead money&quot;, good for little more than the dividend. Throughout 2018, Cisco's forward P/E ratio advanced to around the 14x mark. Now, CSCO stock has hit 17x forward earnings with the latest burst of enthusiasm.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors That shows just how bad sentiment had been until recently. That 17x forward earnings is hardly terrible for a leading tech company that is pushing something like 6% revenue growth this year. Additionally, it's worth noting that Cisco is increasingly deriving its revenues from subscriptions and services. Like so many tech firms have done in the past, Cisco stock's P/E ratio will rise as the market credits its more stable and long-lasting subscription-based revenue streams.You shouldn't forget about the dividend here either. Even with the strong rise in CSCO stock, it is still yielding 2.5%. On top of that, it is a leading dividend growth play. Over the past five years, Cisco has grown its dividend by a compounded 20% per year. Cisco Stock VerdictObviously Cisco stock has gone up a lot over the past year. It'd be better to buy a dip, should one present itself in coming weeks.Even at $54 per share, however, CSCO stock should make its owners more dough in 2019. As the market prices in further upside from 5G, Cisco stock could trade toward $70 by the end of the year.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned INTC and CSCO stock.

2019-05-28,"Under ordinary circumstances, most people would likely have a bullish view on Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). In its prior life, Cisco stock represented the distortion of unbridled enthusiasm during the tech bubble and subsequent crash. But with key divestments and a laser-focus on relevant technologies, CSCO has transitioned into a reliable dividend-paying entity.Source: Prayitno via Flickr (Modified)There's just one problem: the U.S.-China trade war. Just a month ago, political experts and economic analysts largely expected that the Trump administration would work out a deal with its Chinese counterpart. Both parties made their points, but both also incurred damage in the tariff tit-for-tat.Suddenly, though, President Trump did an about-face, accusing China of dirty trade tactics. Ominously, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned of a &quot;Long March&quot; referencing China's civil war during the 1930s. Obviously, this harsh sentiment bodes poorly for most investments, including CSCO stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors Diplomacy requires a delicate touch. Since neither side will completely win this zero-sum game, compromise is necessary. Where it gets worrisome for Cisco stock and many other technology-based names is that Trump lacks basic decorum. Having insulted the Chinese, the U.S. should not expect a friendly response, nor a quick resolution.Specifically for CSCO stock, the underlying company must hope that things don't get worse from here. Although Asia-Pacific Japan China (APJC) accounted for less than 16% of total revenue for Cisco in fiscal 2018, it's a viable growth channel that management can't overlook.Still, Cisco stock offers a distinctly bullish play here, but with some caveats. The Cautious Bull Case for Cisco StockFor starters, let's quickly talk about the dividend. At its current 2.5% yield, Cisco stock doesn't offer the most generous payout. However, it is one of the most reliable, especially compared to its tech peers.Based on what we're seeing in the geopolitical realm, that reliable dividend may act as a buffer in case of a downturn. Typically, volatility disproportionately impacts equities that are pure growth names as opposed to income generators.Second, Cisco's management team smartly anticipated at least some of this trade war's fallout. The tech firm reduced its manufacturing exposure in China, just in case tensions escalated.This isn't just the usual corporate fluff piece. Compared to many names in the broader tech industry, CSCO stock has stayed relatively calm. Year-to-date, shares are up almost 30%. That compares favorably to the sector benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), which is up 18% YTD.As Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins stated, the current China situation is &quot;relatively immaterial.&quot; It's also baked into the guidance.Third and most importantly, Cisco is levered toward the industries and technologies of tomorrow. As I've noted in prior write-ups about Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), we're locked in a digital battle for dominance.Without question, the U.S. won the 20th century, excelling in manufacturing and other analog technologies. We also dominated the infancy stage of the digitalization of everything movement.However, other countries desperately want to control the 21st century and beyond. Thus, investments like CSCO stock take on greater importance than they would have in prior generations.What I'm trying to get at is that Cisco stock is too big to fail. It's among companies which the federal government considers vital for national security and prosperity. Wait for the OpportunityDespite multiple reasons to bet on Cisco stock, I wouldn't do it at this very moment. Fundamentally, I'm confident that the underlying organization can weather this storm. But right now, the markets are not moving on the fundamentals, but rather emotions.As such, you've got to respect the tape. I don't like the pensive trading following its recent better-than-expecting earnings report. Clearly, a resistance level exists at the $57 mark. With all the ugly noise surrounding this and other tech names, I anticipate turbulence. It won't surprise me to see CSCO stock drop below $50.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement If that happens, I might jump on board. Most companies do their thing for themselves. But with large-scale tech firms like CSCO, their growth and operations have more significant meaning. During this cloudy season, Cisco offers the luxury of clarity.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AT&T.

2019-05-28,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has suffered a bruising recently. The index posted its fifth straight weekly decline, and is now down 3.79% so far this month. However it’s not all doom and gloom. On Monday, Dow Jones futures traded up thanks to the news that President Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Abe Shinzo met to discuss a whole host of trade issues.“Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!” tweeted President Trump on May 26.And from an investing perspective, there are certainly compelling stocks to be found in the index. You just have to know where to look. Luckily TipRanks has released a new tool that allows you to compare stocks- and pinpoint the most promising investing opportunities. Here we ran a screen on all the stocks in the Dow Jones- and then sorted the results from the most to least bullish according to the Street. View Stock Comparison Tool As you can see these 5 stocks all boast a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus based on ratings published by analysts over the last three months. Here’s why these are the five favorite Dow stocks of analysts right now: Microsoft (MSFT)In first place comes software giant Microsoft. Even though shares are down in May, the stock is still trading up 24% year-to-date. And according to five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, plenty of upside lies ahead. He has just reiterated his buy rating with a $145 price target after attending the Microsoft Build Developer Conference a couple of weeks ago. From current levels that indicates shares can surge 15%.Following the conference, Horan told investors it’s become “obvious that the company has totally restructured itself around the intelligent edge cloud.” As a result it is now better positioned to create and drive new services through developer partnerships. According to Horan, MSFT sees Azure as a base layer that customers use to run their applications but also as a building block for MSFT services up the software &quot;stack&quot;. That’s through dozens of new PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings. Plus MSFT's services are being re-architected to run on Azure—Office 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn and Teams. By running on Azure, MSFT applications become cheaper to operate and easier to innovate and integrate. “We are just at the beginning of this transformation, with innovation accelerating” the analyst concludes. Overall, 22 out of the 24 analysts polled rate Microsoft a ‘Buy’- hence its ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. See what other Top Analysts are saying about MSFT.  Visa (V)Next up comes the mighty payments processor Visa. Like Microsoft, Visa has posted impressive gains year-to-date (23%), however in the last month shares have marginally pulled back in keeping with the broader market.But there’s plenty to look forward to. Notably, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has just initiated coverage of the stock. He starts Visa off with a buy rating and a bullish $188 price target, citing volume growth in Europe, price increases and an expanding business payments unit. Schneider believes Visa enjoys ‘multiple opportunities’ to beat current consensus estimates. He also singles out upcoming product announcements and earnings reports as positive price catalysts. And for investors cautious about pending legal and regulatory issues, Schneider has a reassuring point. He notes that both Visa and Mastercard have escaped recent litigation relatively unscathed, by settling claims with minimal financial impact or change to their market leading positions.This isn’t the only analyst optimistic about Visa’s outlook. In the last three months Visa has received 18 buy ratings and just 1 hold rating. “We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and its strong, recognizable international brand” cheers Cantor Fitzgerald’s Joseph Foresi. Looking forward, he sees a basket of catalysts pushing V higher, including Visa Direct, contactless payments, & B2B to name but a few. See what other Top Analysts are saying about V.  Disney (DIS)These are exciting times for Disney. The company is on the brink of launching its much-hyped streaming service Disney+. And it has just allowed a lucky few into its new Star Wars Land, &quot;Galaxy's Edge&quot; at Disneyland, California. One of the visitors to the new park was Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger. Although he wasn’t allowed to take photos, Juenger nevertheless revealed that the two main attractions (Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, and Rise of the Resistance) were &quot;absolutely jaw-dropping.&quot;For investors, Juenger advised that the attraction will exceed reasonable guest expectations by a wide margin; and that it is more incremental for revenue than previously imagined. That’s because in Disneyland, it adds almost 14 acres of capacity, while in Disney World it will utilize the most-underused gate, meaningfully expanding overall guest capacity.&quot;This is the biggest attraction we’ve ever built,&quot; Scott Trowbridge, Portfolio Creative Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, said in a recent presentation. &quot;It should be epic, because, Star Wars, right? That’s why we’re going big with this attraction.&quot; The Disneyland park will open on May 31, and from June 24 it will be possible to enter without reservations. Encouragingly, Disney’s recent earnings report shows a bullish story for theme parks. The Parks and Consumer Products segment delivered results roughly $200M above consensus estimates. “The segment has been a key growth driver for the company over the last few years, accounting for roughly 60% of total segment operating income gains from '16-'19E” writes Rosenblatt’s Mark Zgutowicz.“We are encouraged the company continues to invest in this segment with Star Wars Galaxy Edge opening in May/ August in CA/FL, as well as Marvel properties and expanding in Asia. We assume the segment is able to continue to grow returns at roughly the same rate over the next five years” concludes the analyst. This ‘Strong Buy’ stock boasts 15 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings, while the average analyst price target comes in at $152. See what other Top Analysts are saying about DIS.  United Health (UNH)Managed healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group has had a bumpy ride recently. That’s as UNH, and indeed the health care sector in general, continue to be pressured by worries around “Medicare For All.” This proposes a transition to a national single payer health plan backed by a number of the Democrats’ 2020 presidential hopefuls.“Although the extreme versions of such a bill would be devastating to the healthcare sector, we see no shot of them going through in today's (and tomorrow's) political environment” writes top-ranked Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn. He reiterated his buy rating recently with a $305 price target indicating robust upside potential of 23%.“We believe the regulatory fears that have pressured the group are significantly overblown. We would be buyers of UNH on the weakness and maintain our Outperform rating” advises the analyst. He is a fan of the company’s diversification, strong track record, elite management team and exposure to certain higher growth businesses (including the Optum IT business). A similar message comes from Citigroup’s Ralph Giacobbe. Tellingly, the analyst has just upgraded UNH from Hold to Buy. He also boosted his price target considerably from $247 to $280. &quot;We acknowledge that the diversification story isn’t a new phenomena, but buying a bellwether name at discounted valuation presents an attractive opportunity considering the pullback has largely been premised on fears that we don’t expect to materialize” explains Giacobbe. Overall, UNH scores a buy rating from 10 out of 11 analysts polled by TipRanks. The average analyst price target works out at $284 (15% upside potential). See what other Top Analysts are saying about UNH.  Cisco Systems (CSCO)For our final best-rated Dow stock we have network leader Cisco Systems. The company has just posted a slightly ahead of consensus quarter on nearly all metrics once again. “Overall market demand and execution prove resilient; maintain Outperform” celebrated Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver following the report.“Management continues to string together solid quarters during the ramp phase for Cat 9K and SD-WAN. Cisco's EPS algorithm produced normalized growth of 18% in 3Q19, which appears sustainable for the visible future” commented the analyst. He has a $57 price target on shares. Cisco reported FQ3 revenue/non-GAAP EPS of $12,958 million/ $0.78, representing revenue growth of 4% YoY (+6% excl. SPVSS), versus consensus of $12,889 million/$0.77. Meanwhile gross margin was up roughly 50 bps QoQ and up 70 bps YoY. The key takeaway: “We remain enthusiastic towards the product strategy and runway for growth over the next several years despite some concerns over a shakier spend macro and political instability.” Clearly the Street shares this upbeat analysis. With a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus, 15 out of 19 analysts give CSCO the thumbs up. Their average price target works out at $59 for 9% upside potential. That’s with shares surging 25% year-to-date- and experiencing a relatively minor dip of 3% in May. See what other Top Analysts are saying about CSCO.

2019-05-30,"Just when it looked like the major U.S. equity benchmarks were poised to snap out of their recent doldrums, market participants sold modest early session gains, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 slightly lower in the afternoon, but buyers rallied late in the day to send all three indexes slightly higher.Source: Shutterstock The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.21% and 0.27%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.17%. Eighteen Dow members finished higher Thursday, a day after just three closed up. Careful What You Wish ForThese should be the ideal days for investors to embrace defensive sectors, but some supposedly low-volatility names are betraying that reputation. As was noted in this space yesterday, the strong dollar is hampering consumer staples stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWalgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was the second-worst performer among the 30 Dow stocks Thursday, shedding 2.1%.

Hodulik reiterated a $59 price target on the stock, implying modest upside from Thursday's closing levels.&quot;Hodulik said that potential industry consolidation and the adoption of 5G technology might provide some upside to the shares, but any such benefit 'appears partially priced in,&quot; according to Barron's.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the Dow's largest components, traded slightly lower on speculation that if China decides to use rare earths metals as a weapon in the trade war against the U.S., smartphone makers could be constrained by limited supplies.China dominates the market for rare earth metals and those metals are primary components in an array of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets. Fears of crimped rare earth exports come as Apple is getting ready to unveil yet another iPhone.&quot;So even a short term action affecting production could have longer term consequences for the company,&quot; said Goldman Sachs, according to Barron's. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor equity investors, it feels like there is nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide this month, but some familiar sectors are providing shelter from trade war storms.

2019-05-30,"Are companies doing massive buybacks the best stocks to buy?The reason I ask is that the Wall Street Journal ran a story in mid-May that discussed the ongoing popularity of stock buybacks. It noted that companies continue to buy back a ton of their stock despite the fact volatile markets have made the exercise that much more difficult.According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, as of May 16, the 86% of S&P 500 companies that had already reported first-quarter results repurchased $188 billion (Editor's Note: paywall) in stock, the second-highest quarterly amount since it started to keep track of the figures in 1998. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether you're for or against stock buybacks, it's hard to argue with their popularity. Companies are repurchasing their shares because they provide a significant tailwind to share prices. Data suggests that 25% of the S&P 500 experienced a 4% increase in earnings per share in the first quarter due to buybacks.I've always said that investors can't just look at the earnings per share growth, they also need to look at the increase in net income, but investors don't want to hear it. EPS is what drives share prices higher. Everything else is immaterial. Care to guess when S&P 500 companies repurchased the highest quarterly amount of stock? It was the fourth quarter of 2018, a time when stock prices were cratering. The Wall Street Journal smartly suggested that the fact companies were buying toward the end of 2018 is proof they weren't worried about the prospect of slower global growth.I'd have to agree because companies generally aren't good at timing stock buybacks. The WSJ article listed the top ten stock buybacks by S&P 500 companies in 2018. I thought it would be fun to rate each of them in terms of the average price paid and the return on investment so far in 2019. This should show if these buybacks created stocks to buy or not.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War To make things simpler, I'll be using the 10-K's for share repurchase data. Each stock will get a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the best and 10 the worst). The stock with the lowest combined score will be rated the best stock to buy, and so on.

2019-05-31,"The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is having an unmistakably negative effect on the technology sector. Numerous tech stocks have heavy Chinese exposure, whether it's via the rare-earth materials they use in their products, manufacturing done in China or just deriving a large percentage of revenues from the country. And their shares have been punished as the rift between the two countries has widened.As a group, the outlook is worrisome. But a few tech stocks are more shielded than others from Chinese trade issues. Just look to the cloud.Cloud computing has been a lucrative mega-trend on its own; whole industries have moved into scaled data centers, linked by fiber cable and wireless networks. But it also is shaping up to be something of a safe haven from trade concerns. China may make some of our devices, and their chips may go into our technology infrastructure, but the clouds themselves are ours, and so is the value inside them. Thus, many companies that operate cloud-based services look to be relatively well-insulated against this long-running U.S.-China trade spat.The following are six tech stocks that can help China-proof your portfolio. Many of these stocks have run hot in 2019, and some of them are expensive as a result.

2019-06-04,"There's no denying Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) has been an impressive performer over the course of the past couple of years. Since the end of May 2017, Twilio stock has rallied more than 120%, backed by noteworthy sales growth.Source:  Web Summit Via FlickrThe lack of actual GAAP earnings hasn't been a problem for its buyers, who apparently believe the company can address such minor, pesky problems at a later date. Except, maybe it won't be able to address that profit problem at a later date when it desperately needs to. And, even if it can, it may not matter.Take a closer look at Twilio, and you'll see prior red-hot growth rates aren't sustainable. Revenue is projected to improve by an amazing 70% this year, versus last year's 77%. Next year's projected top-line growth of 34% is still huge but a relative letdown. The following year's expected revenue growth of 26% is also better than average, but far from compelling to a crowd of TWLO stock owners accustomed to much more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Worse, while Twilio's top line is stabilizing and normalizing, there's still not a hint of actual income let alone real income growth as that revenue rally starts leveling off. That's a problem for a ticker valued as richly as Twilio stock. Twilio, Reality and PerceptionFans and followers have most certainly already prepared their counterarguments, ranging from &quot;You just don't understand the business&quot; to the (fair and accurate) point that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) wasn't profitable for years. A well-rehearsed crowd is also going to note that on an operational basis, Twilio actually is profitable. They'll argue GAAP numbers aren't an indication of the true strength of the business.All three arguments break down under scrutiny though.As for the Amazon argument, for every Amazon, there are five more companies like it that investors liked even more in their infancy that never survived. Palm Pilots, GeoCities, Gizmondo and etoys.com are just some of the names that come to mind.They all had a loyal fan base, and some of them even made a go of it. None of them had real staying power. They were unable to turn an actual profit (not just an operating profit) long enough to remain intact.As for the business itself, there's a distinct lack of barrier to entry. Now that Twilio and others have proven there's a market for cloud-based self-service-everything through the use of apps, more companies can replicate the idea.And they are. Nexmo and Bandwidth along with several other unfamiliar names are quietly moving into a price war with one another, but more concerning than that, powerhouse players like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) are slowly encroaching onto Twilio's turf.No young, unprofitable outfit wants to go toe-to-toe with a Cisco.And, as for the lack of real earnings, this is where the bullish case for Twilio stock starts to break down.Just for the sake of argument, let's say Twilio manages in the foreseeable future to drive typical tech profit margins of 10% of revenue. With 2021's projected revenue of $1.86 billion translating into earnings of $186 million, TWLO stock is still priced at a stunning 86 times its long-term forward-looking earnings.And of course, that's a stretch assumption. As the top line's ascent starts to fade along with operating income growth, reported (or GAAP) income is expected to continue to deteriorate.Sooner or later it's going to have to make some money, but it's not clear that's in the cards.Underscoring the concern that the bigger the company gets, the uglier its fiscal results become, is the cash flow trend to date.For a short while last year Twilio actually mustered positive cash flow, but on the heels of best-ever revenue last quarter, operating cash flow turned deeply negative again.It tacitly suggests that scale works against, rather than for, the business that's become increasingly crowded and now entered a price war/outspending phase. Bottom Line for Twilio StockPerhaps the final argument against any bearish thesis for Twilio is the fact that despite all the reasonable concerns, analysts still love it. The pros collectively rate it a little better than a &quot;Buy&quot; (stopping short of a &quot;Strong Buy&quot;), and the consensus target of $146.59 is 15% higher than the current value of Twilio stock. Surely this many analysts can't be wrong.They're not &quot;wrong&quot; per se, but they arguably are speculating.It's a reality that not even most people in the research industry care to concede, but these professional stock-handicappers are just as prone to buying into hype as the average retail investor is. This is one of those times where analysts may be making optimistic calls for the wrong reason. Maybe it's fear of being on the wrong side of the mob.So far it's worked out. Just bear in mind that the consensus target price for GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) back in 2014 shortly after its IPO was $60. Reality has dragged GPRO back to its current price near $6.Analysts dive into the hype-pool too. Too many of them choose to not even discuss a fan-favored company's weak spots, so the average investor won't either.That doesn't mean Twilio doesn't have them though.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-06,"One-third of the way into 2019, the U.S. stock market looked more resilient than ever with the bull snapping back from a devastating correction like a bovine half its age. Stocks hit a new high on April 30, delivering an early 2019 return of 18.3%, including dividends--nearly two years' worth of the long-term average gain for stocks in just four months. Assuaging worries of a looming recession, the economy grew at a robust 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Instead of earnings dipping into negative territory, as analysts had expected, corporate America ended the first quarter slightly in the black. And perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve Board pivoted from telegraphing as many as three rate hikes in 2019 to zero rate hikes. Then President Trump tweeted about trade. Stocks have been volatile since, and the downdraft served as a swift reminder that substantial risks are building in this aged bull market and in an economic expansion that in July becomes the longest one ever.With the easy gains behind us this year, we think you'll do best by scouting stocks that can eke out reliable earnings growth in a low-growth economy and looking to dividends to bolster returns. We favor large-company stocks over small, and we think investors can find good candidates in a number of market sectors and in overseas markets--but you'll have to be discerning and selective within each category. In the second half of 2019, investors will have to stay defensive, while also taking advantage of tactical opportunities as they arise.Here are five stocks we believe fit the bill and are worth considering for your portfolio: SEE ALSO: 2019 Midyear Investing Outlook: Where to Put Your Money Now",5 Stocks to Buy Now for the Rest of 2019

2019-06-06,"Alongside the rest of the market, shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower in May as trade tensions across the globe heated up. To be sure, Cisco stock bounced from this selloff in mid-May after the company reported strong third-quarter numbers. Management emphasized on the conference call that the then newly announced 25% tariffs on China imports would have minimal impact.Source: Shutterstock But those gains in CSCO stock were short lived. By the end of May, shares were trading near their mid-May lows as the global trade situation deteriorated.In the big picture, this trade-related weakness in Cisco stock is an opportunity. This company is firing on all cylinders right now. It has appropriately adjusted its business model to align with secular growth trends and should benefit from operational tailwinds over the next several years. Meanwhile, management has done an excellent job of mitigating the impact of higher and more widespread tariffs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNet-net, Cisco stock is presently defined by overstated trade weakness and understated medium to long-term growth potential. That combination ultimately implies that CSCO is a good buy here. Indeed, the fundamentals imply runway for shares to run to $60 by the end of the year. Cisco Is a Solid Business Managing Trade Conflicts WellCisco is a stable growth company with healthy margins and secular tailwinds. These factors should drive significant profit growth over the next several years. At the same time, management has appropriately adjusted the business model to reduce the impact of tariffs. Plus, they have businesses to drive through the choppiness.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Cisco essentially builds the things which power the global internet. But once upon a time, many investors thought that the market was moving past it. Additionally, they thought CSCO wasn't doing enough to keep up with the internet's rapidly changing trends. That is no longer true. Over the past several quarters, Cisco has adjusted its infrastructure and security solutions to better align with today's trends. This includes adaptability toward IoT, cloud, and mobile platforms.In so doing, Cisco stock has successfully defended its market share in the internet infrastructure and security markets, and materially improved its overall business growth trajectory. IoT, cloud, and mobile trends will likely remain relevant for the foreseeable future. Therefore, Cisco should be able to likewise defend itself over that timeframe. Plus, gross margins are currently stable and improving, while the opex rate is falling thanks to greater scale.Net result? Profit growth looks good today. It projects to remain healthy over the next several years.The primary risk to this growth narrative is tariffs. That's because higher tariff-related costs threaten Cisco's supply chain. But management said on the conference call that they've already taken steps to optimize the supply chain and adjust pricing schemes.In the big picture, then, Cisco stock looks good here. Growth is promising and stable, and management has mitigated risks. Cisco Stock Has Runway to $60From a numbers' perspective, CSCO stock has runway to $60 by the end of the year.The math here is simple. The global internet-infrastructure market has grown at a very consistent and stable low single-digit rate for several years. It should maintain that growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. Assuming Cisco can successfully maintain its market leadership, its staring at low single-digit infrastructure-solutions growth over the next several years.Meanwhile, experts forecast the cybersecurity market as anywhere between a 10% to 15% revenue-growth market over the next several years. Cisco is a big and important player in that segment. Even assuming Cisco loses some market share to newer, more cloud-focused security players, Cisco should still grow its security business at a high-single digit rate over the long term.Putting those two together, Cisco would likely report mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next few years. I peg the growth rate at somewhere between 3% and 4%. Gross margins should trend higher as the company continues to pivot more towards a subscription model. Opex rates should continue to fall with scale. Buybacks will persist. Thus, roughly 3.5% revenue growth should flow into high single-digit profit growth.That would put earnings per share around $5.50 by 2025. At that time, given renewed revenue and profit growth, Cisco stock should trade at a market-average multiple. That average is 16-times forward earnings. Based on that metric, a reasonable 2024 price target for CSCO stock is $88.Discounted back by 8% annually (the yield here is 2%), that equates to a 2019 price target of nearly $60. Bottom Line on CSCO StockAll things considered, Cisco stock is undervalued today. The company has solid growth potential through continued internet-infrastructure and security-market expansion. Margins are healthy, and buybacks are big. Meanwhile, management initiatives have mitigated the tariff risk.Altogether, there's a lot of good here, and not a lot of bad. Because of that, CSCO stock has runway to hit $60 by the end of 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-07,"Income investors typically seek ample yield in their dividend stocks, but dividend sustainability matters every bit as much.Just ask GameStop (GME) investors, who saw a 19%-plus dividend yield on May 4 turn into a nonexistent yield after the retailer suspended its payout to save cash in an attempt to salvage its troubled business.A high yield can be a sign of a troubled distribution, but it doesn't have to be. There are hundreds of stable dividend stocks with above-average yields - including a few in the typically growth-minded technology sector. Better still: These are affordable, sustainable payouts that even have room to grow.We've leaned on the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares to identify seven tech stocks with market-beating dividends that also have a high chance of growing in the future. DIVCON's methodology evaluates dividend health factors including profits, free cash flow and even bankruptcy risk, then assigns a score between 1 and 5. Low scores (1-2) are a sign of unstable dividends; high scores (4-5) signal healthy dividends that likely will grow in the years ahead.Here are seven &quot;double threat&quot; dividend stocks in the tech sector.

2019-06-07,"I often talk about &quot;vision premiums,&quot; or elevated valuations that are given to hot stocks. At this time, arguably no equity defines that premium better than Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock.Source:  Web Summit Via FlickrBolstered by the leadership status of TWLO's communication platform-as-a-service (CPaaS), Twilio stock has climbed to elevated valuations amid the company's massive growth. However, the expensiveness of both the company's service and Twilio stock could drive its customers and investors to alternative options.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3%  Investors Continue to Ignore the Sky-High Multiple on Twilio StockFirst, I will point out that a stock can stay &quot;expensive&quot; from a price-earnings (PE) ratio standpoint for a long time. This is especially true when a firm seen as the company of the future launches new technologies or lines of business. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and many cannabis stocks have proven that point over the last few years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, once a stock has reached such levels, buying it becomes a bet that somebody will willingly pay more in the future. The higher the multiple, the less likely one is to find such a buyer.Expensive stocks sometimes keep moving higher. That  pattern could play out with Twilio stock, which has risen by about 575% since December 2017. However, given Twilio stock's forward PE ratio of over 490, that is not a bet I endorse. Profit Deceleration, Competition Could Weigh on the Valuation of Twilio StockTWLO's profit growth, while impressive in a general sense, appears meager when compared to the multiple of TWLO stock. Headwinds will limit its profit growth to an estimated 9.1% this year. Things should improve next year, as its earnings will jump 141.7%, according to the consensus estimate. Still, that level of growth should also prove to be temporary, as analysts foresee average annual growth of 33.2% per year for the subsequent five years.Moreover, Twilio stock no longer remains the only CPaaS name that investors can buy. Bandwidth Inc. (NASDAQ:BAND) launched its IPO last year. It trades at only 8.2 times its sales, compared to more than 25 times sales for TWLO.Investors can also choose a much safer CPaaS stock. As InvestorPlace columnist James Brumley pointed out, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has begun to compete in this business. CSCO's  $34.64 billion cash hoard will allow it to easily outspend Twilio. CSCO's profit is growing at a double-digit percentage rate, and CSCO stock has a forward PE, based on the consensus EPS outlook, of only 16.5. Twilio's Services Are Also Perceived as PriceyMoreover, the prices that Twilio charges for its services have become too expensive for some.Unfortunately for the company, the CPaaS industry has a low barrier to entry, and lesser-known peers have hurt TWLO in the past. Investors hammered Twilio stock in 2017 when Uber (NYSE:UBER) moved to reduce its dependence on the company.Given the strong growth of CPaaS,I do not think increased competition will lead to an overall reduction in Twilio's customer base or revenues. However, new entrants -- particularly an established, profitable entrant such as Cisco -- could slow Twilio's growth and will likely create pricing pressure. The Bottom Line on Twilio StockAlthough Twilio stock can deliver much of the massive growth it promises, investors and customers who find Twilio too expensive can turn to lower-cost options. TWLO stock has benefited from the company's  leading position in the CPaaS industry. It may even exceed analysts' consensus revenue growth projection of 70% for the current fiscal year.However, with Twilio stock trading at over 490 times its earnings, this cloud company has moved into the stratosphere. Also, large customers have shown a willingness to abandon the platform. The company  faces competition from upstarts such as Bandwidth and well-funded, established tech companies such as Cisco. Even in a world where PE ratios don't matter much, TWLO stock is more likely a sell than a buy under these conditions.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The Bull Case for TWLO StockThe bull case starts with CEO and co-founder Jeff Lawson, who also co-founded Stubhub and was one of the original product managers at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web services.Lawson has been profiled as &quot;the wizard of apps,&quot;  because Twilio's APIs let companies add fully automated text and voice services to their apps. Twilio software is now used by customers ranging from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Investors are betting that Lawson can beat the &quot;bad actors,&quot; tracking use of the platform to keep out spammers and robocallers, using machine learning to spot efforts at phishing and abuse. This, and automating protection under Europe's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), helps keep Twilio from becoming a commodity product. Bulls are also betting Lawson can keep spotting good acquisitions like Sendgrid, an e-mail platform purchased last year for $2 billion.Bulls can also point to institutional confidence in Twilio. Institutions now own more than 50% of the common. These investors can usually distinguish between short-term success and sustainability. The Bear Case for TwilioThe bear case starts with the fact that voice, text and e-mail are commodity services, and that this market is shrinking as data calls replace voice calls.Speculators are already seeking options protection for their long positions, concerned that growth has to slow as the market is absorbed.Our James Brumley is among those who insist the company's growth can't be sustained. He writes both start-ups and giant companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) can incorporate Twilio's concepts in their apps, and that scale isn't yet leading to profit.This is what I mean about landing the rocket ship. Many companies grow quickly only to falter when it comes time to turn revenue into profit. Securing apps is becoming an increasingly vicious game. The Android operating system of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unit was recently infested with adware that can wreck phones, through what had been a reputable app provider.But competing with bad guys is competing. If Twilio can continue to secure its services, real profit becomes possible. The Bottom LineInvestors who have ridden the Twilio rocket ship to this point are right to try to lock in their profits and seek protection, if only because large numbers are harder to grow than smaller ones. With a market cap approaching $20 billion on trailing year sales of $650 million, Twilio is more than fully valued.But I wouldn't hit the panic button just because antitrust officials are going after the Cloud Czars upon whose success apps like Twilio depends. Get your money out, seek protection but know that a hard fall may become a buying opportunity.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-10,"Wall Street darling Zoom (NASDAQ:ZOOM) did not disappoint with its first earnings report as a public company. The hyper-growth cloud video conferencing giant reported strong first quarter numbers in early June that topped revenue and profit estimates. Zoom stock rallied more than 20% in response to fresh all-time highs right around $100.Source: ZoomManagement also delivered above-consensus revenue and profit guides for both the second quarter and the full year. Investors were impressed. As a reminder, Zoom went public in mid-April 2019 at $36 a share. That means Zoom has nearly tripled in less than two months. Naturally, one has to ask: has this rally come too far?  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% In the big picture, yes. Even under aggressive long term growth assumptions, the fundamentals here don't support a $100 price tag on Zoom until the end of fiscal 2019. The stock is already nearing that level today near the beginning of its fiscal 2019. Further, under more conservative growth assumptions, one could reasonably argue that the stock is actually considerably overvalued here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs such, Zoom stock does appear fundamentally overvalued here and now.Having said that, Zoom may continue to zoom higher in the near term. This company has a lot of momentum. The stock does, too, and there are certain dynamics at play which could keep the uptrend alive for the time being.All in all, while I'm not rushing to buy ZM stock here, I'm also not waving the short flag. This stock may be overvalued, but it's too hot to bet against, too. Lots to Like About Zoom StockA lot of things look very good about this company. First, Zoom is in the right space. Cloud video conferencing is the next big thing in enterprise communication, and as enterprise communication does migrate from voice to video, this whole market will grow by leaps and bounds.Second, Zoom is currently a small player in the market (depending on who you ask, Zoom's market share hovers around 2-3% today), but they are leveraging a video and cloud-first focus to rapidly win market share. For example, Zoom reported revenue growth of over 100% last quarter; the video conferencing market is growing at a 10%-plus pace.  Third, at the same time that revenues are running higher, gross margins are remaining largely stable in the sky-high 80%-plus territory, while opex rates are falling with scale. Indeed, the company reported a GAAP and non-GAAP profit last quarter. That's rare for a 100%-plus revenue growth company.Fourth, the opportunity is massive. Zoom exited the quarter with around 60,000 customers. There are 5.6 million employer businesses in the U.S. alone and far more globally. Thus, the company is tapping into only roughly 1-2% of its total potential. Zoom Stock Appears OvervaluedAlthough there is a lot to like about ZM stock, one thing not to like is the valuation. Long term growth fundamentals imply that Zoom stock presently sits in fairly valued to overvalued territory.The global video conferencing market is expected to grow at a 10%-plus compounded annual growth rate to over $20 billion by 2024. I actually think that projection is conservative. Video is the new voice, and the global enterprise communications market is marching towards $160 billion. As such, the video conferencing market will likely head towards $30 billion or more by 2025.As stated earlier, Zoom is presently a small player in this market with 1-2% share. That figure is rapidly expanding. Where will it land by 2025? Probably between 10% and 15%.At 10%, you're looking at $3 billion in revenue, which represents 30%-plus annualized growth from 2019's projected revenue base. At 15%, you're looking at $4.5 billion in revenue, which represents 40%-plus annualized growth from 2019's projected revenue base.Gross margins are guided to remain north of 80% in the long run. Meanwhile, the adjusted opex rate is in the high 70s and dropping. Competitors in this space like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) operate at mid-30s opex rates. To be sure, those companies are much bigger. But, a 40% opex rate seems doable for Zoom by 2025.Thus, Zoom projects as somewhere between a $3 billion and $4.5 billion revenue company by 2025, with roughly 40% operating margins. That should produce EPS of somewhere between $3.50 and $5 by 2025. Using an application software average 35-forward multiple and 10% discount rate, that yields a fair 2019 price target range from $75 to $110.Zoom stock currently trades towards the top end of that range, and as such, does appear somewhat overvalued here. The Uptrend May Stay AliveAlthough Zoom appears somewhat overvalued, the stock may not collapse just yet.This is a small company in a big market with a lot of momentum. In practice, that combination means the sky is the limit for bulls. So long as the sky remains the limit, the market will turn a blind eye towards valuation, and the stock will march higher.To be sure, this honeymoon phase won't last forever. If growth starts to falter, or if broader markets go into sell-off mode, then ZM stock will drop, and the fundamentals won't provide much support. That's why this is a risky situation.But, until that happens and so long as this company continues to fire on all cylinders, ZM stock should drift higher. Bottom Line on Zoom StockZoom is a great company that's firing on all cylinders. The stock just appears slightly overvalued here and now. As such, I'm not rushing to buy here. Instead, I'll wait out this rally, wait for a dip, and then buy at a more reasonable price.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11,"Ever since Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced its streaming service, the question has been about whether Disney stock can absorb the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) level content creation while maintaining its profitability.Source:  Maurizio Pesce Via FlickrThe success of Netflix has much to do with the powers of  Artificial Intelligence. With the technology, the company has been able to personalize movie recommendations, based on processing huge amounts of data.Netflix also has used AI for the movie-making process, say for identifying content categories, scouting for production and editing. Oh, and the technology has also been critical for dealing with the complexities of streaming video so the experience is top-notch.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the most part, Netflix has shown that algorithms can be a silver bullet in the highly creative world of original content. A Closer Look at Disney StockIn light of all this, might Dinsey be at a disadvantage?  Well, we will find out soon. The company is expected to launch its entertainment streaming service in mid-November. Its receotion will be critical for Disney stock price.I think it's important to keep in mind that the company has strong technology chops. After all, throughout Disney's history, the company has been at the forefront of innovation. Some examples include the use of audio-animatronics and monorails as well as automation systems for its films.Disney has also made some important acquisitions for tech-focused companies like Pixar and BAMTech, which is a streaming platform.OK, what about AI? Well, the good news for DIS stock is that the company has been making significant investments in this category. At the heart of this is Disney Research, which includes researchers that focus on three areas:  * AI and ML (Machine Learning): This involves the use of deep learning to unlock insights from data as well as to help with content generation.  * Immersive Technologies: This is where researchers leverage technologies to create life-like environments, such as with AR and VR.  * Robotics: This is to develop autonomous systems that can interact with people, say at the theme parks. Future Tech and Disney StockNo doubt, the research can be extremely complex. Note some of the titles of recent technical papers: &quot;Trajectory-based Probabilistic Policy Gradient for Learning Locomotion Behaviors&quot; and &quot;A Two-Level Planning Framework for Mixed Reality Interactive Narratives with User Engagement.&quot;In one of the recent papers written in partnership with Rutgers University, there was a model that converts the text of a script into animation!But the research efforts are not just theoretical, they already have had an impact. For example, the company's theme parks are essentially mini-communities that allow for experimenting with innovative technologies like Magic Bands.AI is also playing an important role in the movie-making process. By leveraging relationships with partners like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), the company has been able to measure how users react to content. For the most part, Disney's rock-solid record with feature films is really no accident.Something else: the acquisition of Hulu, from partners AT&T (NYSE:T) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), is another big tech boost. Founded in 2006, the platform has grown to 28 million subscribers and has features like AI-powered ads, which are based on IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson system. Bottom Line Disney StockBesides AI, Disney stock has various other catalysts. The movie pipeline is solid for this year, with upcoming films like Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, and the final Star Wars movie in the original trilogy. There will also likely be a lift from the Star Wars Galaxy Edge Park (at Disneyland and Disney World) and Tokyo's DisneySea.Yet the real focus will certainly be on the streaming service. And given the company's tech prowess and rich film library, it should be a game changer for the company.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-06-14,"It's difficult to categorize Nokia (NYSE:NOK) as anything but a disappointment. Nokia shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past decade. Recent performance hasn't been much better: NOK stock touched a 52-week low just last month.Source: Shutterstock The sense of disappointment goes beyond the stock price. This is a company that's offered promise repeatedly in recent years, with multiple potential catalysts for growth. The sale of its phone business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2013 brought in over $7 billion in cash, which was supposed to allow the Finnish tech company to focus on its networking business. The acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent was a supposed game-changer in driving so-called end-to-end sales.Nokia launched the Nokia 8 in 2017 to try and become a player in the smartphone business. It predicted the development of 5G wireless would be a significant driver for growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone of those catalysts have played out. Nokia stock continues to drift downward. Revenue rose 1% in constant currency last year. Adjusted earnings declined.Nokia's CEO seems to insist that this time is different -- and he may be right. But investors would be wise to keep a skeptical attitude until he finally delivers on that promise. 5G and the Case for NOK StockHistory aside, there is an intriguing case for Nokia stock at the moment. NOK is cheap, at 13x 2020 EPS estimates. The company still has more than $2 billion in net cash on the balance sheet. And 5G development is on the way - with a major competitor potentially hamstrung.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri addressed the company's 5G opportunity in an interview with Bloomberg this week. Suri said Nokia was competing well in 5G. China's Huawei, which clearly has taken share from Nokia in recent years, has been a target of the U.S. government based on national security concerns. But Suri argued that even that aside, &quot;we compete quite favorably with Huawei&quot;.As for Scandinavian rival Ericsson (NYSE:ERIC), Suri claimed that Nokia wins &quot;two-thirds of the time&quot; when going up against them. The end-to-end offering now account for roughly half the company's pipeline of opportunities. Meanwhile, 5G demand continues to rise and Suri highlighted another opportunity in industrial IoT (Internet of Things). Suri's figures suggest demand in that part of IoT may be a bigger benefit to Nokia than 5G.Listening to Suri, it's easy to believe that NOK stock might finally be ready to rise. The opportunities are real, and substantial. European countries aren't putting the same pressure on Huawei as their U.S. counterparts, but the negative press surrounding that Chinese firm surely gives Nokia at least some sort of advantage. All told, Nokia looks ready to grow. At 13x earnings, Nokia stock isn't priced as such. Q1 Earnings and the Case Against Nokia StockThere are two problems with the case here, however. The first is that Nokia's first earnings were notably disappointing, leading NOK stock to drop 10%. And the second, again, is that Nokia has made promises before -- and had opportunities on which to capitalize.To be fair, Suri told Bloomberg that the company hadn't yet recognized revenue from signed contracts -- echoing commentary from Nokia after Q1. The company still sees significant 5G-related growth coming in the second half of the year.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 But the company also admitted that full-year guidance would be tough to hit. And given the long-running credibility problems here, Nokia stock clearly has become a &quot;show me&quot; story. That's why investors sold so quickly after Q1 numbers: the fear is that Nokia is going to disappoint again. On the NOK Stock SidelinesThat risk colors the bull case for NOK stock, even at the lows. Networking is a tough business: even leader Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) trades at just 16x forward earnings despite notably better results of late. Ericsson stock has been dead money for a decade. The same is true of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR). Sure, 13x earnings for Nokia stock seems cheap … but it's not amazingly so in the context of the sector.Meanwhile, as intriguing as 5G appears, Nokia itself expects its addressable market to stay flat in 2019. Any revenue growth will have to come from market share gains and -- despite Suri's commentary and Huawei's struggles -- it's tough to have confidence in Nokia's ability to compete. It certainly hasn't done so in recent years.Nokia can prove skeptics wrong - and if it does, Nokia stock will gain. But until there's more than just optimistic talk backing up its growth potential, those skeptics, myself included, aren't changing their mind.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-18,"At one point on Tuesday, the Nasdaq was up about 2% on the day. Although the index eased off those gains going into afternoon trading, investors didn't completely take their foot off the gas.Source: Shutterstock Thanks to positive comments from President Donald Trump, the Nasdaq jumped 1.39% on the day, outperforming both the Dow Jones and S&P 500, which climbed 1.35% and 0.97%, respectively.So what did Trump say to cause such a rally? Well, the very opposite of what he said to derail the stock market rally last month. As trade-war worries flood Wall Street and wreak havoc on conference calls, the President tweeted that he, &quot;Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis sent tech stocks, and in particular, chip stocks soaring on the day. In tech, the trade war has impacted everything from customer demand to declining margins thanks to increased tariffs. Some of the industry has been able to shake off the woes -- like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- but not everyone has been so lucky. Biggest Winners in the Nasdaq TodayChipmakers stole the show Tuesday, as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) -- here's how to trade AVGO stock -- all scorched higher on the day.  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less AMD raced higher by 4.3%, while Nvidia jumped 5.4% and Broadcom rallied 4.5%. The mere idea that the trade war talks could improve was enough to send these stocks skyward. It has got many on Wall Street wondering just how compressed this group is thanks to the friction between China and the White House. If the trade-war rhetoric remains positive ahead of the G-20 summit, it's possible for this group to continue higher.That said, investors also have to be aware of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. There's only a 24% chance of a rate cut announcement at this meeting, so most investors aren't expecting one yet. But they will be looking for a more dovish stance from the Fed, particularly following the European Central Bank's accommodative stance this week, and given the fact that the futures market is pricing in a 98% chance for at least one rate cut by December.So that's something to be aware of.NAND and DRAM players were also in the spotlight. Micron (NASDAQ:MU) jumped 5.7%, while equipment makers like Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Applied Material (NASDAQ:AMAT) rallied 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively.  Click to Enlarge Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is on investors' radar too, as it gears up to report second-quarter earnings after the close. Consensus expectations call for earnings of $1.78 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion. Those estimates suggest year-over-year growth of 18.5% and 23.2%, respectively.Finally, Microsoft is shaking off any worries about the trade war as shares hit new all-time highs. MSFT closed at $135.16, up 1.74%,  while rallying almost 10% so far this month. Bottom Line on the Nasdaq TodayThe trade war is what dragged the Nasdaq from its all-time highs in early May. But a resolution is likely what will vault the index back up to them. The markets came into June in an oversold condition, but the bounce was most telling. After the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow all rallied to start the month, the bears weren't able to push it back down.That action is important, suggesting that a larger rally was brewing after some consolidation. That extension could be taking place now, but we still have the Fed to get through.Fed Chair Powell has not been the smoothest talker when it comes to FOMC events, so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts tomorrow. A dovish Fed could ignite stocks even higher, while a hawkish Fed could undo many of today's nice gains. The same rally/puke potential exists with the President's Twitter account.All said, it was a very strong day for the Nasdaq today, although Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was a noteworthy laggard.The social media giant finally announced its Libra cryptocurrency. While this was anything but a secret, it was interesting to see FB give up all of its Tuesday gains. Ending slightly lower on the day, down 29 basis points, is not what many investors had in mind given the strength in tech.The bottom line: Watch the Fed on Wednesday.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Over the past two decades, China’s Huawei Technologies Co. has come to dominate the global telecom equipment market, winning contracts with a mix of sophisticated technology and attractive prices. Its rise squeezed Europe’s Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB, which responded by cutting jobs and making acquisitions. Now, with Huawei at the center of a U.S.-China trade war, the tide is turning.Nokia and Ericsson—fierce rivals themselves—have recently wrested notable long-term deals from Huawei to build 5G wireless networks, to enable everything from autonomous cars to robot surgery. Analysts say more could come their way as Huawei grapples with a U.S. export ban and restrictions from other governments concerned that its equipment could enable Chinese espionage.“Huawei will, for the foreseeable future, face a broader cloud of suspicion,” said John Butler, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. “Nokia and Ericsson are well positioned to benefit.”In May, the European companies both won 5G contracts from SoftBank Group Corp.’s Japanese telecom unit, replacing Huawei and Chinese peer ZTE Corp. Ericsson signed a similar pact in March with Denmark’s biggest phone company, TDC A/S, which had worked with Huawei since 2013 to modernize and manage its network.Other carriers, expecting government curbs on Huawei, have started removing its equipment from sensitive parts of their systems. BT Group Plc is taking Huawei out of its network core, and Vodafone Group Plc has suspended core equipment purchases from Huawei for its European networks. Deutsche Telekom AG, which has Huawei throughout its 4G system, is re-evaluating its purchasing strategy.Nokia and Ericsson are Europe’s final survivors of a merciless winnowing of more than a half-dozen telecom equipment providersAs dozens of phone companies—including those in Canada, Germany and France—plan to choose 5G suppliers in the coming months, Cisco Systems Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. are also vying for deals. But the key beneficiaries of Huawei’s difficulties are likely to be the two Europeans, which compete directly with the Chinese company in supplying radio-access network equipment.Since last year, the Trump administration has pushed allies to bar Huawei from 5G, citing risks about state spying—allegations the company has denied. The move in May to block Huawei’s access to U.S. suppliers escalated the campaign. The company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, now predicts the U.S. sanctions will cut its revenue by $30 billion over the coming two years.Outside the U.S., security concerns have led Australia, Japan and Taiwan to bar Huawei from 5G systems. The Chinese company also risks losing meaningful work in Europe and emerging markets where countries could follow with their own limits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Publicly, executives from Nokia and Ericsson have been careful not to come off as critical of Huawei. Both manufacture in China and sell gear to Chinese phone carriers, and Nokia has a big research and development presence there. Nokia says it has already been forced to shift some of its supply chain away from China to reduce the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.QuicktakeHow Huawei Became a Target for GovernmentsInstead of piling on Huawei, the European carriers have trumpeted their 5G successes, each using slightly different metrics. Ericsson claims it has the most publicly announced 5G contracts—21—while Nokia says it has raked in more commercial 5G deals than any other vendor (42). Huawei says it has signed 46 5G contracts. A spokesman for Huawei declined to comment further about its position relative to rivals.Ericsson is “first with 5G,” after building high-speed networks for companies such as AT&T Inc., Swisscom AG in Switzerland and Australia’s Telstra Corp., said Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden. “You see that in some markets that we are attracting more customers.”Nokia is winning 5G deals “quite handsomely,” Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri told Bloomberg TV on June 10.While Suri said more carriers are likely to swap out Huawei gear in countries that have announced restrictions, the situation is less clear in Europe. “We don’t know yet the impact of specific operator plans,” he said in an interview. “We also don’t know where this geopolitical thing will end up.”Nokia and Ericsson are Europe’s final survivors of a merciless winnowing of more than a half-dozen telecom equipment providers. Bloated costs, a cyclical marketplace, cash-strapped customers, and the relentless rise of Huawei—aided by access to generous Chinese state financing—helped push the likes of Canada’s Nortel Networks Corp. and Germany’s Siemens AG out of the industry.Nokia paid some $2 billion in 2013 to buy Siemens out of a joint venture established to compete against Ericsson and Huawei. Then in 2015, it spent another almost $18 billion acquiring Alcatel-Lucent to broaden its product offering after pushing through more than 25,000 job cuts in the preceding three years. Still, Huawei’s share of the $33 billion of sales in the global mobile infrastructure market surged to 31% in 2018 from 13% in 2010, IHS Markit data show.Huawei, despite its troubles, remains a potent rival. Many phone companies in Europe deem its base stations, switches and routers technologically superior. Fully excluding Huawei and ZTE from 5G would raise radio-access network costs for European phone companies by 40%, or 55 billion euros ($62 billion), the GSMA industry group predicts in an unpublished report seen by Bloomberg. Nokia and Ericsson would have to almost double production to absorb Huawei and ZTE’s business in Europe and could struggle to meet demand, the GSMA report says.Quicktake5G and EspionageBengt Nordstrom, CEO of telecom consultancy Northstream AB, says the situation is perilous for everyone in the industry, as vendors’ budgets could be hit if Huawei faces greater restrictions. “Many component suppliers are already in a tough situation,” Nordstrom said. “They need to spend a lot of money on research, and that means they need access to the entire global market.”For carriers, swapping vendors isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. It takes about two years to plan and implement such a technology shift and install the new equipment, Nordstrom said.Both Nokia and Ericsson are working to make it easier for carriers to switch. Nokia has developed what it calls a “thin layer” of its 4G technology to connect to a new 5G system, allowing a carrier to avoid a wholesale swap of another supplier’s equipment. Ericsson also has a solution to allow a carrier to swap out only a portion of existing infrastructure, and says it can make some areas work side-by-side with Ericsson’s 5G gear.Nokia and Ericsson can agree on one thing: Claims of Huawei’s technological superiority are overblown. They note that they’re involved in the latest networks in the U.S., where carriers are rolling out 5G faster than the Europeans.“We compete quite favorably with Huawei,” Suri said, “with or without the current security concerns.”(Updates to add Nokia and Ericsson production estimate in sixth-last paragraph. An earlier version of the story corrected the ninth paragraph to reflect that Telstra Corp. is an Australian company.)&#92;--With assistance from Caroline Hyde, Kati Pohjanpalo and Angelina Rascouet.To contact the authors of this story: Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.netNiclas Rolander in Stockholm at nrolander@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, David RocksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei’s Troubles Are a Big Opportunity for Ericsson and Nokia

After barely creeping higher on Wednesday following the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting, gains grew more substantial Thursday. All three of the major U.S. equity benchmarks flirting with gains of 1%.Source: Shutterstock Geopolitical headlines, not of the tariff variety, boosted stocks as well. Oil rallied after Iran shot down a U.S. Navy drone. President Donald Trump took to Twitter calling Iran's move &quot;a very big mistake.&quot;&quot;Iran produces more than 2.3 million barrels of oil a day, about 2% of the world total and 8% of daily oil output from OPEC, and its economy is highly reliant on oil and gas exports,&quot; according to Barron's.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat is nowhere near the more than 12 million barrels per day pumped here in the U.S., but news of Iran's hostility was enough to lift Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest U.S. oil companies.When the closing bell sounded, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were higher by 0.95% and 0.8% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.94%. Exxon and Chevron were two of 26 Dow stocks in the green today and two of the top 10 performers in the blue-chip index. Other WinnersWhen geopolitical headlines involve military hostilities and the potential for escalation of those tensions, aerospace and defense stocks often respond to the upside. That was the case today as United Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UTX) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were two of the Dow's best performers.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal In addition to the aforementioned Iran controversy, United Technologies got a lift today from comments by industry executives regarding the company's heavily scrutinized $121 billion plan to acquire rival Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).&quot;Most dismissed any suggestion that the merger could trigger similar moves among players in the more fragmented European industry, noting that national loyalties and different market conditions will limit cross-border transactions on such a scale,&quot; according to Reuters.In what was something of an &quot;industrial renaissance&quot; today, each of the Dow's members hailing from that sector finished higher. The index's four industrial names were among its top six winners on a percentage basis.Each of the Dow's financial services components rose today as well. American Experss (NYSE:AXP), a name that has been highlighted here in recent days, posted a modest gain. And Visa (NYSE:V) has been one of the more impressive Dow stocks for awhile now. The credit card giant added 1.83% today on its way to a record high. That extends Visa's month-to-date gain to over 4% and its year-to-date gain to nearly 30%.Sticking with tech for a minute, each of the Dow's constituents from that sector closed in the green today, led by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which added 2.3%. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe Iran situation is worth monitoring over the next few days, particularly for investors owning any of the aforementioned aerospace or oil stocks. However, as that situation blows over, market participants will refocus their attention to monetary policy and if/when the Fed will cut interest rates.On that note, CNBC had an interesting piece out today highlighting the bullishness news of three Dow components against the backdrop of declining interest rates. Those names are Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). Of those three, only Verizon closed lower today.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-22,Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.,3 Things Under the Radar This Week
2019-06-23,"What a week! The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed over 2% last week, after the Fed cheered investors by indicating that it will cut interest rates next month. That sent tech and energy shares soaring- with the Dow climbing nearly 250 points on Thursday and reaching a record high in early trading on Friday. In short, the Dow is looking very strong right now- with the index up almost 15% year-to-date. In particular, the following five stocks are leading the pack in terms of year-to-date (YTD) performance. Here we turned to the Street to see whether these stocks still offer a compelling investing proposition. This is what top-performing analysts have to say: 1&#92;. Microsoft (MSFT)– up 35% YTDMicrosoft takes the award of best-performing Dow stock so far this year. The company has put on a remarkable sprint of over 30% year-to-date. And analysts are almost uniformly positive about the company’s outlook going forward. That’s despite the fact that the current average analyst price target of $143 only suggests upside potential of 4%. But if you take a longer-term outlook, the stock’s multiple opportunities quickly become apparent.One analyst singing MSFT’s praises is five-star KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin. He has just reiterated his Microsoft buy rating with a $143 price target. Bracelin made the call following a number of upbeat meetings with Microsoft Gaming executives. “Gaming represents a $100B+ TAM opportunity for Microsoft” commented Bracelin. “We see Microsoft Gaming as a small (9.4% of FY18 sales) but strategic growth segment where the transformation to a subscription-based model (i.e., the Netflix of gaming) could sustain healthy growth and improving margins over the next three to five years as it gains share within a $100B+ gaming industry” the analyst told investors on June 11. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss calls Microsoft ‘the best positioned firm in tech for the emerging Hybrid Cloud architectures.’ He highlights the company’s unique position as both a top 'New Stack' share gainer and the 1 'Old Stack' share gainer.And let’s not forget the savvy deal Microsoft has just struck with Oracle. The two companies announced a “cloud interoperability partnership enabling customers to migrate and run mission-critical enterprise workloads across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.” Moreover, “by enabling customers to run one part of a workload within Azure and another part of the same workload within the Oracle Cloud, the partnership delivers a highly optimized, best-of-both-clouds experience.” “Given Microsoft’s Azure is the 2 public cloud vendor in the world and Oracle is the clear 1 database vendor with a strong 2 position in enterprise applications that includes a fast-growing SaaS portfolio, we believe the two clouds complement each other well” writes Monness analyst Brian White, adding that the deal is a positive for both companies. View MSFT Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 2&#92;. Cisco (CSCO)– up 32% YTDClose on Microsoft’s heels comes networking giant Cisco Systems. Over the last three years, Cisco shares have doubled and the stock shows no sign of slowing down. Even in the last five days, shares have soared 4%. Even a ratings downgrade from William Blair analyst Jason Ader didn’t deter investors for long.The analyst cited &quot;signs of tightening demand across the IT infrastructure universe&quot; at the company. And this weaker demand environment &quot;could pressure growth in Cisco's fiscal 2020, especially when compared against unusually strong demand in fiscal 2019,&quot; the analyst said.As a result, Ader concludes that upside to consensus 2020 expectations, &quot;as well as multiple expansion, will be more challenging from here.&quot;Nonetheless, Cisco still boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. The average analyst price target stands at $59 (4% upside potential). And with the ongoing trade war between US and China, Cisco continues to look relatively attractive to tech-focused investors. “Cisco remains our top pick for investors looking at safe havens in the current environment to navigate through the trade war noise,” commented JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently. He notes that “relatively modest exposure to China and largely immune to any trade-related impacts.” View CSCO Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 3&#92;. Visa (V)– up 31% YTDCredit card and payments giant Visa continues to outperform. And now top-rated Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri has raised his V price target from $170 to $187 (8% upside potential). According to Katri, Visa benefits from a double whammy of &quot;strong secular growth tailwinds,&quot; and accelerated, ongoing monetization efforts. He is confident Visa can deliver annual growth of 10% to 15% in credit-card revenue and 20% growth in adjusted EPS over the next few years.Encouragingly, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Joseph Foresi also sees a whole ‘basket of catalysts’ for Visa stock. Note that Foresi is ranked 2 out of over 5,200 analysts - so he clearly knows what he is talking about when it comes to stock picking. Not only does the company have a leading credit card position, it also offers significant opportunities for growth internationally and digitally. “We like Visa’s opportunity to capitalize on the global conversion of cash into credit, international opportunities, and digital payment tailwinds. Visa has a basket of catalysts expanding its TAM including Visa Direct, contactless payments, & B2B to name a few” writes the analyst. “We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and its strong, recognizable international brand” the analyst told investors. View V Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 4&#92;. American Express (AXP)– up 31% YTDVisa isn’t the only credit card company delivering sizable gains. AXP is also up over 30% year-to-date. What sets AXP apart is that it is one of only a few financial service companies capable of both issuing and processing electronic payment cards. This means the company can generate revenue from interest earning products on top of network processing transaction fees.For Merrill Lynch’s Jason Kupferberg the company continues to look undervalued. He has just reinstated coverage of AXP with a buy rating with a Street-high price target of $145. From current levels this suggests shares can surge a further 17% in the coming months.He calls the company’s credit card membership program “a worthy investment which offers customers unique experiences beyond traditional rewards points.” And even though costs have been rising as a proportion of revenue, the analysts writes that he has nevertheless “been pleasantly surprised to see [American Express] strategically raise card fees to help offset these costs.”View AXP Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 5&#92;. Disney (DIS)– up 28% YTD Walt Disney Co is enjoying a wild ride so far in 2019. The company is gearing up for the launch of its highly anticipated Disney+ streaming service in November. “Disney is our top pick in the content space as we reiterate our Buy rating and raise our price target to $175” cheers Rosenblatt analyst Mark Zgutowicz. Meanwhile Loop Capital’s Alan Gould sees Disney +’s first year subscriber count topping the 10M consensus.    Plus excitement is building over the opening of its highly anticipated $1 billion theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Starting June 24, the park will be open to the public without reservations. “The segment has been a key growth driver for the company over the last few years… Given the incremental returns from investment we are encouraged the company continues to invest in this segment with Star Wars Galaxy Edge” commented Zgutowicz. As if that wasn’t enough, Disney’s 2019 blockbuster Avengers: Endgame is now the second-highest grossing movie of all-time worldwide. And now Disney plans to rerelease the movie with additional scenes- a sneaky attempt to topple box-office leader Avatar from first place according to commentators.However, Imperial Capital’s David Miller has a word of warning for investors. He has just downgraded DIS from Buy to Hold, writing: &quot;The core rationale for lowering our rating to In-Line is simply due to the fact that the stock has performed consistent with our previous Outperform rating.”“Most of the catalysts we focused on at the time of that ratings change: the film slate, the opening of the two Star Wars lands, the disposal of the Regional Sports Networks, the Disney+ analyst day, and the re-financing of the various 21st Century Fox legacy debt tranches, have either happened, or are set to happen, and at a record multiple on 2021 earnings, are pretty much built in to the stock, in our view&quot; the analyst concludes.

2019-06-24,"The big news last week was the S&P 500 blasting to a record high. Thursday's close of $2,958 officially eclipsed the previous peak notched on April 30 earlier this year and signals the end of the summer correction.At least, that's what stock bulls are hoping.History proves it's usually worth betting on continuation over reversal when record levels are reached. It certainly provides a favorable backdrop for traders seeking stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThink of all that is implied in the simple three-word phrase, &quot;all-time highs.&quot; It means people are willing to pay a higher price than ever before. It means every single participant on the planet currently long the stock is sitting on a winning position. And all those who are short are experiencing more losses than ever before. Anyone who used to own the stock regrets selling too early and anyone who has never held it certainly wishes they did.  * 7 Top S&P 500 Stocks of 2019 (So Far) Throw it all together, and you have an environment where demand is significant and supply small. In celebration of last week's record-setting action, here are three stocks to buy that are each making all-time highs.Source: ThinkorSwim  3 All-Time High Stocks to Buy: Disney (DIS)Thursday's close of $142.02 marked a new record closing high for Disney (NYSE:DIS). The mouse house is well on its way to clinching a banner year for shareholders. The upside catalysts continue to stack up. From the record-smashing release of Avengers:Endgame and the long-awaited debut of Star Wars:Galaxy Edge, to details surrounding its hotly anticipated Disney+ streaming service (set for release later this year), DIS stock has enjoyed a flurry of bullish news.Its share price is retreating just in time for today's pick. Today's 1% dip is ushering its price toward the rising 20-day and 50-day moving averages. With so many potential support levels looming beneath, the two-day drop has to be viewed as a potential buying opportunity.If you're willing to bet the stock reaches $145 by August, then buy the Aug $140/$145 bull call spread for $1.80. Your risk is limited to the initial purchase price of $1.80, and the potenial reward is $3.20.Source: ThinkorSwim  Cisco (CSCO)Purists will cry foul at Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) inclusion to today's gallery. Technically last Thursday's $57.41 close marks a new 20-year high, not an all-time record. But, I suspect there are extremely few current shareholders that owned it back during the height of the dot-com bubble. For all but the oldest of dinosaurs, this is a new high.While Friday's failed breakout bar might give us some pause in the short-term, the overall trend of CSCO stock looks fantastic. The past two months of chop have allowed Cisco shares to digest recent gains and build a base for its next up-leg.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 With an implied volatility rank of 30%, option premiums aren't really juiced enough to sell. So, we're going with a long premium play. Buy the Aug $57.50/$62.50 bull call spread for around $1.40. The risk is limited to $1.40, and the reward is $3.60.Source: ThinkorSwim  Shopify (SHOP)Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is the poster child for momentum stocks. Driven by high earnings and sales growth, SHOP stock has become a monster winner for 2019, up 135%. What's particularly impressive is the consistency of its trend. It's toeing the technical analysis line like a champ. Every breakout has seen followthrough, and every dip has been bought.Even broader market corrections like the May drop proved unable to knock the SHOP trend. Last week's rally launched the stock to a new record, but we've since seen a multi-day pullback develop. Thus far the volume has been minimal signaling a garden variety pullback and not some institutionally-driven exodus.Someday the trend will end, but if you think the good times roll for at least another month or two, then bull call spreads provide a low-cost strategy to capitalize. Buy the Aug $320/$340 bull calls spread for around $8. The risk is $8 and the reward is $12.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options positions in DIS.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Capgemini SE said it will acquire Altran Technologies SA in a 3.6 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) deal in order to win more tech clients and keep up with rivals.Paris-based Capgemini is looking to maintain its position as a major IT consultancy in a consolidating industry, as competitors such as Accenture have been building out their sales from digital projects.Capgemini’s shares rose as much as 8% in early morning trading in Paris Tuesday, the most since October 2011. Altran rose 21% to 13.9 euros, trading just below the 14 euros-a-share offer price.Analysts broadly backed the deal. &quot;We think this deal should bring strong value creation and provides scale that can help Capgemini close the valuation gap to larger rivals such as Accenture,&quot; said Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud.The 14 euros-a-share cash portion of the deal amounts to 3.6 billion euros excluding net debt of 1.4 billion euros, the companies said in a statement Monday. The offer is a 22% premium to Altran’s closing price on Friday.The proposal is a “positive step, as it looks to significantly expand into R&D and engineering, two areas becoming main growth drivers for IT-outsourcing companies,” said Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “The deal would enable Capgemini to compete more aggressively with Accenture, which generates more than 60% of sales from digital projects.”When combined Capgemini and Altran -- also based in Paris -- will be able to help clients in areas such as cloud computing, the internet of things, 5G, and artificial intelligence software, Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said in a statement.In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Hermelin added that Altran adds &quot;beautiful accounts&quot; such as Intel Corp, Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but added that the group still needed to develop its business in Asia. The combination of the two companies will result in a group with 17 billion euros in annual revenue and more than 250,000 employees.Hermelin expressed confidence on a conference call Monday that there are no antitrust issues associated with the takeover since “the market is very fragmented.”Still, the companies’ businesses do overlap, as they provide some of the same services to similar industries. Capgemini expects the deal to boost earnings per share by 25% by 2023, from 15% before the transition is completed.(Updated with CEO interview.)To contact the reporters on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net;Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Capgemini Buys Altran for $4.1 Billion to Expand in Tech

2019-06-28,"Even with the volatility this year, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still up about 25% or so. There never seems to be much downside to Amazon stock.Source: Shutterstock Now the company certainly has its issues and risks. The acquisition of Whole Foods has not been a winner and the core ecommerce segment has seen decelerating growth.There's also indications that the federal government is looking at Amazon.com as a violator of antitrust laws.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 In the meantime, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has been the source of much drama, as seen with his divorce. Although, perhaps the biggest risk for AMZN stock is that the company is involved in many different categories. Does management have the bandwidth to operate all this?Well, as we've seen with other companies like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and General Electric (NYSE:GE) that expanded well beyond their core business, it can be difficult to remain competitive. This is probably even more difficult nowadays because of the availability of the enormous of amounts of venture capital to fund innovative startups.But despite all this, I still think Amazon stock remains a pretty good choice. And to see why, let's take a look at three reasons: Amazon Stock: Multiple Growth DriversThe so-called &quot;law of big numbers&quot; is a real concern for Amazon stock. With annual revenues at $240 billion, it's extremely difficult to keep up the growth rate. Even a 10% increase would represent the revenue base of a major company!But Amazon.com's ability to play in multiple markets has turned out to be critical. If anything, this ability seems part of the company's DNA.Here's a look at just some of the markets the company is targeting, which should help keep up the long-term growth rate:  * Healthcare: In May 2018, Amazon.com acquired PillPack, a next-generation online pharmacy. The company has revolutionized the packaging and distribution of prescription drugs. While Amazon.com has been quiet about its goals, it does look like the company sees huge potential in disrupting the $500 billion market.  * Online Advertising: In the past few years, AMZN has quickly become an important player in this market. The company's massive ecommerce platform has the benefit of making a closer association between search and the purchase of goods, which of course, is a big plus for advertisers. Amazon is also working aggressively to expand its options, such as with video search ads.  * Delivery: This has been a big-expense item for Amazon.com. But the company is looking to turn this category into a business - that is, by offering freight brokerage services. AMZN already has an extensive transportation network it can leverage and there is the huge advantage of its data analytics. Amazon Stock: Artificial Intelligence (AI)AI is becoming a must-have in the tech world. To get a sense of the opportunity, look at a recent report from Gartner. It predicts that spending on AI will grow at 18% per year through 2020, reaching $383.5 billion.As for AMZN, it is positioned nicely to get an out-sized portion of the market. The most obvious illustration of this is the segment that includes Alexa and Echo systems. During the past five years, Amazon has sold over 100 million of these devices.To build on this, the company has been aggressive in creating a strong ecosystem of third-party developers (there are over 80,000 skills).AWS is another key part of the AI strategy. With this platform, it's possible to develop highly sophisticated algorithms at a low cost. For example, Amazon.com has recently launched SageMaker, which has gotten lots of traction.According to Bezos: &quot;SageMaker removes the heavy lifting, complexity, and guesswork from each step of the machine learning process -- democratizing AI.&quot; Amazon Stock: Failure Is an OptionBezos has admitted he has made many blunders. Some of them have been doozies, costing Amazon.com billions.Interestingly enough, Amazon recently recognized another one of its failures: in the online food delivery business. It closed down the business because it could not compete effectively against tough rivals like Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash.But such failures are good. Let's face it, can a company truly innovate if it is not making mistakes? I don't think so.According to InvestorPlace.com's Vince Martin:&quot;Amazon will try almost anything. As CEO Jeff Bezos wrote three years ago, Amazon is 'the best place in the world to fail.' Sometimes those efforts turn into Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business that by one estimate should be worth $350 billion in a couple of years.&quot;Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- A hedge fund run by a protege of Appaloosa Management’s David Tepper and the chief executive officer of a conservative think tank sued Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, saying $14.3 billion of bonds should be invalidated because their issuance violated the state constitution.Warlander Asset Management, a New York-based hedge fund formed by Eric Cole, and John Tillman, the CEO of the Illinois Policy Institute, said the state’s record pension bond sale in 2003 and debt issued in 2017 to pay a backlog of unpaid bills were deficit financings prohibited by the constitution. The lawsuit was filed Monday in Sangamon County circuit court.The goal of the debt limits in the state constitution “was to ensure that the state’s elected officials would act in a fiscally responsible manner -- that they would cut spending or make structural reforms when needed, rather than continually using deficit financing to ‘kick the can down the road’ for future generations to resolve,&quot; the complaint said.“The state’s elected officials have done just the opposite. They have mortgaged the state’s future to pay for the present.&quot;The lawsuit comes two months after the federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy and a group of hedge funds sought to have more than $6 billion of the island’s bonds declared null and void and shows how the island’s effort to cut its debts is reverberating in the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal-bond market. The Puerto Rico overseers want to have the debt tossed out on the grounds that it was sold after the territory breached its debt limits, a step that some analysts said could undermine confidence in a market that’s seen as a haven.Illinois officials dismissed the lawsuit, saying it was a politically motivated maneuver by small-government advocates that won’t advance in court.“It was meant to generate headlines to scare investors in the bond market for political ends before the filing is laughed out of court,’’ Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who was named in the suit, said in an emailed statement. “The markets should see this as nothing more than garbage.’’Tillman’s Illinois Policy Institute has been at the forefront of legal challenges to public employee unions and progressive taxation. The institute backed an Illinois employee named Mark Janus in his challenge to the constitutionality of mandatory union fees. In 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Janus’s favor, dealing a heavy blow to the labor movement.In 2014, the institute helped defeat a movement to amend the Illinois Constitution and replace the state’s flat income tax with a progressive income tax. Pritzker, a Democrat who took office this year, persuaded lawmakers to put a progressive income tax back on the ballot in 2020.Several layers of bond counsel and the Attorney General signed off on the 2003 and 2017 bond offerings, Emily Bittner, Pritzker’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications, said in an email.“This is simply a new tactic from the extreme right to interfere in capital markets,&quot; said Bittner. “We’re done with the far right’s dangerous financial games to pull Illinois underwater. We saw this repeatedly under Bruce Rauner, who funded and executed on John Tillman’s pathological focus to drive Illinois into bankruptcy.&quot;Swelling DebtsIn addition to Pritzker, the lawsuit names as defendants state Treasurer Michael Frerichs and Mendoza. Warlander owns $25 million Illinois general-obligation bonds issued in 2001, 2014, 2017 and 2018. Those bonds would be more secure if the firm succeeded in having the other securities invalidated, since there would be more money available to service the debt.Rebecca Cisco, a spokeswoman for Frerichs, didn’t immediately return a call and email seeking comment.Illinois has struggled for years with its debts and swelling obligations to its employee retirement system even after it sold $10 billion of bonds in 2003 in an ill-fated bid to pay down some of its obligations. Since 2000, the state’s unfunded pension liability and bond debt have grown more than 600% to more than $168 billion, according to a copy of the complaint. Its credit rating is one-level above junk by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings Inc., the worst among U.S. states.Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics, said investors shouldn’t trade based on the lawsuit. Some of the pension bonds due in 2033 were little changed Monday, yielding about 4.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“It’s when the issuer wants to invalidate the bonds where things get worrisome,&quot; he said. “The last thing the state wants to do is default on bondholders. So even if, post-miracle, this hedge fund wins its lawsuit, the state is most likely going to do right by its lenders so as to preserve market access.&quot;Article nine, section nine of the Illinois Constitution says the state may issue long-term debt only to finance &quot;specific purposes&quot; if approved by three-fifths of the legislature or by popular referendum.The state may borrow a limited amount in anticipation of revenue or to meet unanticipated shortfalls only through short-term debt, according to the constitution. In addition, the state can refinance higher-cost debt, but only if the refunding debt matures within the term of the debt that’s being retired.In 2003, Illinois used more than $2 billion of the proceeds of its pension bond issue to reimburse the state for its required contributions in 2003 and 2004, which the lawsuit says was “simply a gimmick to mask the fact that the state was using GO bond debt to fill operating deficits.&quot;About $8.85 billion of the pension bonds remain outstanding and they’re among the most actively traded Illinois securities. Major owners include Samsung Life Insurance Co., Capital Group Cos. and Dodge & Cox, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If the state ceases making principal and interest payments on the debt it could contribute an additional $13 billion to its pensions over the next 14 years, according to the complaint.In 2017, the state issued $6 billion of of general-obligation debt backed by income taxes to pay off a portion of a $15.2 billion backlog of unpaid bills that had accumulated during the previous two years, when then-Governor Bruce Rauner and the legislature failed to pass a budget.Using bond money to cover general expenses, speculate in the market, or pay past-due bills isn’t a &quot;specific purpose&quot; for incurring state debt, but rather another name for deficit financing, the complaint said.“The burden of servicing this unconstitutional debt fall on the taxpayers of Illinois, including Plaintiff John Tillman&quot; and harms holders of other GO debt like Warlander by reducing the state’s ability to service the debt.(Adds comptroller’s comment in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Martin Z.

Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.16%.In the options pits, the distance between call and put volume narrowed while overall trading levels hovered near average readings. By day's end, 16.7 million calls and 14.7 million puts changed hands.The action at the CBOE was similar, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio inching higher to 0.66. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average finally arrested its slide and rallied to 0.60.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity was a mixed bag on Wednesday (options traders zeroed in on analyst actions yesterday). Disney (NYSE:DIS) saw heavy call trading on an attempted breakout to all-time highs. Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) shrugged off a downgrade by RBC Capital Markets and rallied off of a key support zone. Finally, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) call volume soared ahead of Wednesday's ex-dividend date.Let's take a closer look: Disney (DIS)Disney shares notched a new record high close of $142.53 and are on the verge of blasting through critical resistance. Although the volume was tepid, that didn't stop traders from taking to the derivatives market to speculate on further upside. Calls dominated the session accounting for 81% of the total. Activity climbed to 117% of the average daily volume with 129,366 total contracts traded.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice The price action over the past two months has created a classic cup-and-handle pattern that is a whisker away from completion. Chart watchers everywhere have DIS stock on their radars heading into today's session. The rising 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages confirm buyers hold control of the trend across all time frames.Implied volatility slipped on the day to 23% or the 31st percentile of its one-year range. August bull call spreads offer a low risk, high reward way to capitalize on additional strength from DIS. Roku (ROKU)The bottom fell out from under Roku shares in early morning trading after RBC analyst Mark Mahaney lowered the company's rating from outperform to sector perform citing valuation concerns. With ROKU stock's meteoric 300% rise this year, a downshift in expectations is more than justified.And yet, from a charting perspective, the timing of the rating drop was ill-timed. ROKU was already 15.6% off its highs and down seven of the last eight trading sessions. And with the rising 50-day moving average fast approaching, it was time for a rebound.Buyers didn't disappoint, gobbling up the early morning weakness and pushing ROKU up 1.8% on the session.On the options trading front, the downgrade did light a fire under put demand. Total activity climbed to 115% of the average daily volume, with 87,760 contracts traded. Puts claimed 55% of the session's sum.The increased buying pushed implied volatility up to 40% or the 69th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $4.05 or 4.4%. Bull puts are my strategy of choice here.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying  Cisco (CSCO)Cisco shares entered a holding pattern in April and haven't departed since. The respite is well deserved given its 33% gain over the first four months of the year. The range has been sloppy, but yesterday's rally held a short-term support level suggesting buyers maintain the upper hand.The real reason for CSCO stock pushing so far into the options leaderboard is its July 3 dividend date. Cash flow seekers snatched up calls for short-term control of the stock to score the quarterly 35 cent payout. The dividend yield of 2.51% outpaces the S&P 500's 1.93% dividend yield, showing us that CSCO is a market-beating income generator at current prices.Options trading saw call volumes account for 84% of the 146,016 contracts that changed hands on the day.Implied volatility dipped on the day to 23%, pushing it to the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 82 cents or 1.5%. As long as CSCO stock holds $54, bull trades are the way to go.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options trades in ROKU and DIS.

2019-07-08,"Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock continues to struggle. Amid its most recent earnings disappointment, Nokia stock has fallen back toward the $5 per share level.Source: Shutterstock This price action merely keeps Nokia stock in the range in which it has traded for more than two years. However, the recent price action, as well as political factors, help to make it a more appealing equity for income investors.Nokia is no stranger to transformation. Nokia lead the market in cell phone sales before Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone made its phones obsolete. Also, the company began as a pulp mill in the 19th century and even made toilet paper as late as the 1960s. Given that change, the move from cell phones to 5G telecom equipment does not seem that dramatic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, making the transition to a new industry and translating that into stock gains remain two different propositions. Here, NOK has stumbled amid stagnant stock growth and a huge earnings miss that has taken Nokia stock back to the $5 per share range.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 In terms of stock growth, I think my colleague Luke Lango correctly pegged NOK as a &quot;show me proposition.&quot; It still trades more than 80% below levels Nokia saw in its glory days before smartphones hit the market. Moreover, despite leading the way in 5G equipment, it has generated anemic revenue growth. Decline Boosted Nokia's payoutThat said, Will Ashworth has also pointed to the bright dividend prospects. The current 29-cent per share dividend yields over 5.6% as of the time of this writing. This greatly exceeds the payouts of peers such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), both of whom have seen higher stock price growth than NOK over the last two years.I see a case for income-oriented investors buying NOK at these levels. The stock has traded in a range for the last 2.5 years. Earnings growth will provide the needed cash to maintain the payout. Also, while it does not sell at the absolute low point of this approximate $4 per share to $7 per share range, I see only limited downside. Nokia and the Trade WarMoreover, to Lango's point, NOK could get its chance to &quot;show me&quot; thanks to the U.S.-China trade war. Its domicile in Finland may work to the company's advantage. China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) had signed contracts with both Nokia and Ericsson for 5G equipment before negotiators announced a recent truce. Despite the dominance of China-based Huawei In that country, this shows that Chinese companies still want to establish relationships with key Western 5G vendors.Also, I think the on-again, off-again restrictions on Huawei could still help bring more business to NOK. The tenuous nature of the sanctions keeps Huawei under a cloud of uncertainty. Despite this change of heart, the Trump Administration could re-impose sanctions on Huawei at any time should trade talks break down.Communications firms can avoid this risk by choosing a vendor like Nokia. Although some companies will choose Ericsson, having one less competitor still helps NOK. While it still has much to prove, NOK appears well-positioned for dividend investors from both technological and political perspectives. The Bottom Line on Nokia StockNOK stock appears well-positioned to deliver returns for investors thanks to its dividend and the current political climate. Yes, other equities such as Cisco and Ericsson have delivered higher stock price growth in recent years.Still, the latest drop in NOK to the $5 per share range has taken its dividend yield above 5.6%. At nearly triple the S&P 500 average, this makes Nokia stock attractive to investors who need to generate cash.Furthermore, its base of operation in Finland keeps the company at arms-length from the U.S.-China trade war. Not only can it attract business in China, but it should also win clients in other countries from those fearful that Trump will again impose sanctions on Huawei.With a generous cash return now and possible stock appreciation coming later, NOK can serve investors well on two fronts as it helps to bolster the world's move into 5G.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Overall, these were not bad losses by any stretch. But the recent scuffling by stocks indicates there is some level of importance around Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony, which kicks off tomorrow.&quot;Focus this week will be on Fed chief Jerome Powell's remarks at his two-day testimony before the Congress, starting Wednesday,&quot; reports Reuters. &quot;Also due on Wednesday is the central bank's June policy meeting minutes.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs has been noted in this space, market participants are pricing in the following Fed facts: no interest rate cut this month and no cuts totaling 50 basis points this year. Hope burns eternal for a rate reduction of 25 basis points, but Powell's two-day testimony and the June meeting minutes could indicate otherwise.In late trading, just 12 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green and none of that dozen had gains in excess of 1%. Tuesday's big winner was Merck (NYSE:MRK), which added 0.98% after the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;accepted for review six supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to update the dosing frequency for KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, to include an every-six-weeks (Q6W) dosing schedule option,&quot; according to a statement.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half The company is seeking &quot;KEYTRUDA indications in melanoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma,&quot; it said in the release.

Troublemakers on Dow Jones Today3M (NYSE:MMM), already one of the Dow's worst-performing components this year with a double-digit loss, was one of the index's worst offenders Tuesday, sinking 1.99% following an analyst downgrade. RBC Capital Markets cut its rating on 3M to &quot;market perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; while slashing its price target on the industrial conglomerate to $176 from $207.Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which was one of the Dow's worst performers yesterday, continued that ominous trend today, shedding 1.52%. The stock's year-to-date gain has all but withered while shares of primary rival AT&T (NYSE:T) are higher by almost 18%.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to buy Acacia Communications Inc. for about $2.6 billion, the technology giant’s latest acquisition as it seeks technologies to meet customer demand for more robust networks.The San Jose-based company will pay $70 a share, a 46% premium to Acacia’s closing price on Monday, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. The purchase price is about $2.6 billion on a fully diluted basis net of cash and marketable securities, and the deal is expected to close in the second half of Cisco’s fiscal 2020 year.Cisco, whose equipment makes up the backbone of the internet and corporate networks, has recently rekindled growth by revamping existing products and adding new software and services under a corporate makeover by Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins. In May, the company gave a bullish sales and profit forecast for the current period, a sign that corporations continue to spend on computer networks despite the trade dispute between China and the U.S.“Bringing Acacia’s high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) technologies in-house allows Cisco to better compete with peers, such as Ciena,” said Woo Jin Ho, senior technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Acacia’s stock surged 35% to $64.91 Tuesday in New York, while Cisco shares were little changed at $56.34. Cisco’s stock had climbed 30% this year through Monday’s close and has doubled in the past three years. Acacia went public in May 2016 at $23 a share and its stock surged that year to more than $120.Cisco’s latest acquisition makes chips and machines that help translate optical signals into electronic data. Acacia’s products are used to speed the flow of information around data centers and telecommunication networks.The new capabilities may help Cisco make more headway selling gear to hyperscale data center owners such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, the company said in a presentation. That’s an area where Cisco has struggled to win sales. If it doesn’t grab share in the market for optical systems, the expense of developing the components may prove burdensome and force it to keep selling to Acacia’s existing customers, many of whom are its competitors, according to Dell’Oro Group analyst Jimmy Yu.During a conference call after the deal’s announcement, analysts questioned whether that will be possible as those competitors may balk at buying from Cisco. Acacia’s customers include Nokia Oyj, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., and Cisco accounts for about 18% of its revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis.Bill Gartner, the head of Cisco’s optical business, said the deal allows the companies to more closely integrate their technologies and offer customers simpler solutions.“We feel like having this technology in-house is the best way to do that,” Gartner said.Under Robbins, Cisco has made a series of acquisitions aimed at bringing in software and services that will ease the company’s dependence on hardware. He’s trying to build more predictable, recurring revenue by offering customers the ability to remotely manage and monitor their networks in order to make them more efficient and secure.Robbins has said that transformation will take time as many of the new offerings require customers to shift to newer hardware that will support advanced functions and services.Cisco’s status as the biggest maker of routers, switches and other gear for connecting computers means its earnings are seen as a broad indicator of corporate spending plans. The company gets only a tiny percentage of sales from China, where it’s been largely locked out of the market, and in one way may be a beneficiary of the ongoing trade dispute, which includes U.S. government attempts to block purchases of equipment from one of its biggest rivals, Huawei Technologies Co. Still, if business spending is hindered by an overall economic slowdown caused by trade uncertainty, Cisco’s sales could feel a hit, analysts have said.(Updates with description of Acacia’s technology in the sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Peter Elstrom.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Buys Acacia for $2.6 Billion to Add Optical Technology

Buying the company gives Cisco intellectual property it can use to keep selling gear to both the Cloud Czars and their retinue, the co-location sites, telcos and scaled enterprises that are constantly demanding more speed from their connections.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut is this an offensive or defensive move? Fighting HuaweiOf all the large U.S. tech companies, none is as much in the crosshairs of China's Huawei as Cisco.Huawei was the main target for President Donald Trump in the China trade war, but this week's relaxation of those sanctions means its lower-cost networking gear is back in the frame, at least for international buyers.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 The companies I call the Cloud Czars -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- are always focused on cutting costs in their data centers, where capital spending now costs $100 billion per year.Low-cost, commodity hardware built with open-source standards always has an advantage in this market, against any proprietary solution. Huawei sales have risen nearly 10-fold in the last decade.As the relationship between Huawei, with its low costs, and U.S. companies thaws, Cisco needs control of patented technology to stay relevant. The result has been a buying spree. It bought Duo Security last year for $2.35 billion in cash and stock; then chip maker Luxtera for $660 million in cash and assumed equity; and, now, Acacia. Cisco Stock Is Not CheapIndustry analysts and market analysts all approve this strategy, which is why Cisco is a hot stock.At around $57 per share, Cisco has a market cap of $244 billion. By some metrics, the price is still reasonable --  the trailing price-to-earnings ratio is under 20, and it offers a 35-cent quarterly dividend yielding 2.5%. But until this year, Cisco was considered a dividend aristocrat, not a growth play.As one analyst (OK, it was me) wrote last year, &quot;boring can be beautiful.&quot;  Even in May I called Cisco a conservative tech investment, suggesting you just put it in your pocket and let time work its magic.That article was published soon after I took my own advice and stuck some Cisco in my own retirement account, at about $51.40 according to my bookie. (OK, it was my broker.) I'm up 10% in three months, plus there's that dividend, still better than the 2.07% yield on a 10-year government bond. The Bottom LineCisco is still Cisco. It's not BeyondMeat (NASDAQ:BYND). This is not 1999. My red beard is not coming back.The moves CSCO stock has made in the last year, and the moves it will continue to make, are primarily defensive in nature. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins knows that, as hardware becomes software, maintaining a proprietary edge against low-cost solutions remains essential.That's going to cost money. Cisco is spending money. It had nearly $25 billion in cash and short-term securities in the bank as of March. Acacia represents just over 10% of that cash, a small price to pay for protecting its exposed flank.Just be aware. That flank remains exposed.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The pattern has formed inside a former support area comprised of key Fibonacci levels which failed this past spring and have turned into staunch resistance.The MMM Stock TradeWith shares already confirming the pivot high within the bear flag and stochastics forming a bearish crossover from neutral levels, MMM stock looks like a short today. I'd suggest a stop loss of 8% to contain potential losses and smartly exit if resistance is overcome. Optimistically though, a profitable trend for bears could put shares back toward the 2016 lows near $125. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar is our next Dow Jones stock to short. CAT stock is already showing relative weakness this year. But if a weekly price chart showing lower highs and a couple bullish trend failures since late last year have any say, conditions are going to get worse.Bearish operators also have a nice spot to short this Dow Jones stock with limited risk and potentially outsized rewards. Following June's rally, shares have formed a pivot top within a countertrend rally against resistance.The CAT Stock TradeMy recommended strategy in CAT stock is to wait on a short through last week's topping candle low of $133.22. That price confirmation should also help a stochastics set-up that's currently on the cusp of turning lower and signaling a bearish crossover.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half For this Dow Jones stock short I'd suggest a 9% stop and size the position accordingly. Similar to MMM stock, this exit limits losses and closes the position if pattern resistance fails. On the downside, I'd look to take partial and much larger profits on a test of last year's corrective low near $110. Apple (AAPL)Apple is our third and final Dow Jones stock to short. AAPL stock's gains this year are nothing to sneeze at, but a second lower high pivot on the weekly view doesn't look good. And with price action set against a former trend line, the current cycle's 76% resistance level and a mostly favorable-looking stochastics position, an AAPL short looks even better.The AAPL Stock TradeWith Apple stock confirming a pivot high this week as shares moved through $200.65, shares could be shorted today while using a stop-loss above the pattern's candlestick high of $205.08.But I'd wait.Since this Dow stock finished Tuesday modestly above the short signal price, I like placing Apple shares on the radar for shorting on a bearish re-cross of $200.65 for additional confirmation. The entry is also contingent on last week's high remaining intact and of course, using it for keeping risk well-managed off and on the price chart.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-15,"Last week's gallery on breakout stocks to buy delivered big-league profits. So we're returning to the well for three more candidates that boast price charts brimming with potential.This week's targets are inspired in large part by the S&P 500, which closed at a new record high of $3,013.77 on Friday. Nothing brings buyers to the yard like a major index touching its highest price in history. It reveals optimism and a risk-on attitude.Last week's demand surge was aided in part by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress that all but confirmed the market's expectation for a rate cut at the upcoming July 31 meeting. Betting markets peg the odds of a quarter-point cut at 72% and a half-point cut at 28%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Without further ado, check out these three breakout stocks to buy. 3 Breakout Stocks to Buy: Cisco (CSCO)Source: ThinkorSwim Friday's rally for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) succeeded where its predecessor did not. Last month's breakout attempt over $57.50 was met with rejection and sharp selling. Friday's bid, however, powered through the ceiling and closed at a new 52-week high.With the gain, CSCO stock officially ended its three-month consolidation zone and signaled that the next stage of its uptrend is upon us. I'd use $60 as the first upside target. It would take a break below the 50-day moving average at $55 to invalidate the bullish backdrop. So until then, the path of least resistance is higher.At 41%, the implied volatility rank is fiddling in the middle of its range. Couple that with earnings coming over the next month, and I think bull call spreads are the way to go.Buy the Sep $57.50/$60 bull call spread for around $1.20. Home Depot (HD)Source: ThinkorSwim Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was one of the best stocks on the board Friday. The retailer surged 2% on heavy volume to a new all-time high. On the technical front, there's nothing not to like about its price action. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages are trending higher to confirm buyers' dominance of the short- and intermediate-term trends.A few accumulation days have cropped up over the past two weeks to signal institutions are wading into the waters. As far as options go, implied volatility is in the basement revealing an utter lack of uncertainty in the stock. That means prices for derivatives are dirt cheap. Long calls and call spreads offer great low-risk, high-reward bets right now.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond If you think the good times continue to roll, then buy the Sep $220/$230 bull call spread for around $3.75. Spotify (SPOT)Source: ThinkorSwim Last week's rally ushered Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) to the cusp of a clear breakout zone. In fact, SPOT stock looks better than at any time since last year's IPO. This summer's recovery pushed shares of the streaming music service back above all its major moving averages for the first time.The base built throughout 2019 should serve as a solid foundation to build an uptrend from if buyers decide to press their advantage here.If SPOT can clear $155, look for a run toward the next ceiling of $170. To capitalize, buy the Oct $160/$170 bull call spread for around $3.30.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-16,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a fundamentally flawed index in terms of how it's weighted -- choosing to use price rather than the market cap -- but in terms of what companies are in the index, the Dow Jones can't be beat. Dow Jones stocks represent the &quot;Bedrock of America&quot; and some of the most important companies on the planet. There's a reason why financial media still quotes the close and movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.However, some of the thirty Dow Jones stocks are better than others. This is especially true when looking at what names will still be in the index down the road and continuing to lead in the world of business.Some Dow stocks feature very forward-looking businesses models and operations. It's these firms that will still be alive and kicking far into the future. And it's here that investors can score on some future potential and the gains and dividends that come with it. In the end, while the Dow is still important, but some stocks within the index are just better than others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills With all of that said, you might be wondering: Which Dow Jones stocks have the best long-term potential? Here are three of the best stocks to buy from the index. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to long-term bets with the Dow Jones stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) has to be at the top of the list. The firm is one of the biggest plays on the continued shift toward a cashless society. And as one of the oldest and largest names in the space, V continues to dominate as we reach for plastic rather than cash.The reason is Visa's business model. The firm functions as a toll-road and collects fees from merchants, banks and other institutions every time someone uses a credit or debit card. V simply operates a secured payment network and moves money from one account to another. So, despite having a Visa logo on your credit card, V itself isn't issuing credit or lending you money.This middleman position is incredibly important for the future. More transactions continue to hit Visa's network. Over the first three months of the year, Visa processed more than 47 billion transactions. This was a 9% year-over-year jump and it's only growing further. With online commerce and fewer people using cash, Visa will be the dominant force going forward. The firm also continues to make inroads into additional services to keep upstarts like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) at bay.The best part of all of this is that V features very fat margins and amazing cash flow growth. More transactions on its network simply mean bigger profits for the firm. And it continues to share those profits with its investors -- growing its dividend by 850% over the last decade.The future cashless society will run on Visa. That fact makes one of the best Dow stocks to buy for the long haul. Disney (DIS)Source: Shutterstock Let's be honest, as long people have children, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is going to be making money hand over fist. And lately, DIS has plenty of reasons to underscore that fact.For one thing, its buyout of 21st Century Fox created a media powerhouse. This brought many major movie and T.V. franchises under one roof. And if anybody can monetize that content through a variety of channels, it's Disney. And one of those ways will be its new streaming services.Disney has already begun pulling its shows and movies from rival streaming services in order to make them exclusives to its new Disney+ service. That's big because the vast of streaming is kids programming. With the complete Disney, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar movie libraries as plenty of its original programming content from the Disney Channel, Disney+ will be the go-to channel for parents looking for entertainment.When you combine with the firm's new moves in its park and recreation divisions -- such as Star War's Galaxy Edge -- as well as continued movie development from its studios, there's a lot to like about DIS stock for the long haul. And we've already begun to see those results. Just take a look at Disney's record second-quarter earnings. Those great results don't even take into account streaming yet.  * 7 ETFs With Oodles of Diversification For investors, DIS stock is a perfect blend of growth for the long haul. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock These days, that famous scene in The Graduate wouldn't be about plastics, but about the cloud. Cloud computing, networking, the app economy continues to reshape how businesses and consumers do, well, everything. Which is why Dow Jones stock, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to be an amazing long-term pick.CSCO's bread-n-butter remains networking and communications equipment. It still builds all the switches routers, modems and other guts needed to make modern data centers and the internet/cloud computing function. This isn't a bad business to be in as data center demand continues to grow. Analysts at Jones Lang LaSalle estimate that data center demand will double by 2021 as cloud adoption grows. That will send plenty of money Cisco's way.But the ace up Cisco's sleeve has to be its newfound focus on services and software.The firm now offers plenty of tangential products designed to go along with networking. They can not only build you a network but secure it, offer data analytics and other similar products to look after this equipment. These services often come with long subscription times and very fat margins. It's here, that CSCO has quickly become a cash cow and one of the best dividend stocks in the technology sector.Its approach on both equipment and services sales, coupled with rising overall data center demand, CSCO has the goods to keep growing far into the future.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"Cybersecurity stocks and the related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are on torrid paces this year. The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK), the oldest cybersecurity ETF on the market, is up nearly 24% and a confluence of factors bode well for continued upside among stocks residing in this corner of the technology sector.Earlier this month, cybersecurity stocks and ETFs like HACK surged on news that semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is continuing its quest to diversify its product mix away from chips by acquiring cybersecurity purveyor Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC).While many investors may prefer traditional, diversified technology ETFs to cybersecurity fare, there are sound fundamental reasons to consider cybersecurity ETFs for the long haul. After all, cybersecurity ETFs provide exposure to one of the truly riveting exponential growth trends on the market today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;In 2004, the global cybersecurity market was worth $3.5 billion -- and in 2017 it was expected to be worth more than $120 billion. The cybersecurity market grew by roughly 35X over 13 years entering our most recent prediction cycle,&quot; according to CyberSecurity Ventures. &quot;Worldwide spending on information security (a subset of the broader cybersecurity market) products and services exceeded $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4 percent from 2017, according to Gartner, Inc. For 2019, they forecast the market to grow to $124 billion, and $170.4 billion in 2022.&quot;  * 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Keep on Your Radar In addition to HACK, here are some other cybersecurity ETFs to consider. iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK)Expense Ratio: 0.47%, or $47 annually per $10,000 investedThe iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) is just over a month old, making it the newest cybersecurity ETF, but it has a feather in its cap: it is also one of the cheapest cybersecurity ETFs on the market. This rookie fund tracks the NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index and holds almost 40 stocks with Symantec being its largest holding.While IHAK is a new cybersecurity ETF, it is one with potential for patient investors and one that may just be at the right place at the right time.&quot;The unprecedented cybercriminal activity we are witnessing is generating so much cyber spending, it's become nearly impossible for analysts to accurately track,&quot; notes Cybersecurity Ventures. &quot;We anticipate 12-15 percent year-over-year cybersecurity market growth through 2021, compared to the 8-10 percent projected by several industry analysts.&quot;At the industry level, IHACK features exposure to providers of cybersecurity hardware, software, products and services. BlueStar Israel Technology ETF (ITEQ)Expense Ratio: 0.75%The BlueStar Israel Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:ITEQ) has gained some acclaim for being an excellent way of bringing international diversity to technology investing. While ITEQ is positioned as a diversified technology fund, it is also very much a cybersecurity ETF because Israel is one of the world's leaders when it comes to cybersecurity services and software.&quot;Investments in cybersecurity firms in Israel crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2018 as interest by foreign investors surged, a January report by Start-Up Nation Central, which tracks Israel's tech industry, showed,&quot; reports The Times of Israel. &quot;Israel's cyber industry is second only to that of the US, taking 20 percent of the overall venture-backed cyber investments worldwide, according to an analysis of PitchBook and Start-Up Nation Central databases.&quot;  * 7 Best of the Best Fidelity Funds to Buy ITEQ's technology focus is a difference maker. The quasi-cybersecurity ETF is up nearly 28% year-to-date, nearly double the returns of the MSCI Israel Index. First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR)Expense Ratio: 0.60%The First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR) was the second cybersecurity ETF on the scene, and, today, the fund has nearly $1 billion in assets under management. CIBR, which turned four years old earlier this month, follows the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index. CIBR holds 44 stocks with a median market value of $3.26 billion, indicating the fund tilts toward smaller mid-cap fare.That said, this cybersecurity ETF is home to some large-cap technology names, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). Five industry groups are represented in CIBR, but the fund devotes over 56% of its weight to software makers. That is a good thing due to the rapid growth expected in the cybersecurity software market.Additionally, many cybersecurity software makers are linked to cloud computing, another fast-growing tech segment. Due to the intersection of cloud computing and cybersecurity software, many of the companies operating in this sphere are appealing acquisition targets for larger, cash-rich technology companies. With software powering cybersecurity growth, CIBR remains a practical, long-term option among cybersecurity ETFs.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc., whose shares plunged after it reported the worst drop in U.S. users since 2011, is looking for new subscriber growth in India, a rapidly expanding streaming market. Trouble is, so are a raft of ambitious local players with cut-rate programming packages.Already wrestling with global giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Amazon.com Inc., Netflix now also contends with broadcasters and Bollywood powerhouses allied with billionaire-backed wireless carriers, who are luring users with free offers or as low as 40 cents a month. That tactic has put them directly in the India growth path of the world’s largest paid online streaming service.The intense competition could derail Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s goal of 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times Netflix’s estimated subscriber base there this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China. The second-quarter loss of 130,000 users in the U.S., reported Wednesday, makes winning in India all the more pressing.Netflix shares fell 10%, the most in three years, to close at $325.21 in New York trading Thursday. That knocked about $16.3 billion off its market value.With a growing number of smartphones and a surge in the use of broadband, India has become a battleground for streaming services. Cisco Systems Inc. has estimated the country will have 829 million smartphone users by 2022, from a projected half a billion this year.“We are seeing a nice, steady increase in engagement with Indian viewers that we think we can build on,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “Growth in that country is a marathon. We’re in it for the long haul.”India’s video-on-demand market could grow to $5 billion by 2023 from $500 million last year, estimates researcher Boston Consulting Group. Paying subscribers will probably rise to as many as 50 million, while users of advertising-supported video-on-demand will reach 600 million, BCG predicts.Netflix has amassed more than 150 million subscribers worldwide, giving it the largest paid customer base. The U.S., Brazil and Canada are three of its largest markets, while Australia is the company’s biggest success story in the Asia-Pacific region. India differs from most of these markets, however, in its population’s sensitivity to price.The Los Gatos, California-based firm has responded to competition in India by offering a mobile-only service at less than half the typical subscription price, and by raising spending on local content faster than in any other market.While it’s still lagging behind Amazon Prime and Disney’s Hotstar, the price cuts are helping it outpace the growth of its biggest rivals, while raising questions about sustainability and margins. Hotstar built its base by streaming cricket matches that are wildly popular in the former British colony.Netflix will probably almost triple subscribers in India this year to 4.1 million, within striking distance of Amazon Prime’s 4.4 million, according to estimates by researcher IHS Markit. That’s faster than Amazon or Hotstar Premium, two of Netflix’s biggest competitors. Some other estimates put Netflix’s base in India at between 1 million and 2 million. The company doesn’t provide data for individual markets.“Netflix is in a land grab to capture as many subscribers as possible, whatever the price,” said Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. “The less they charge, the more cash they are likely to burn.”The company spooked investors Wednesday with a report that it lost subscribers in the U.S. and signed up only 2.8 million internationally in the three months ended June, roughly half its own prediction.It also reported its 20th quarter of negative free cash flow as it spends on adding content and replacing series and films being pulled from its platforms by competitors like Disney.While Netflix is speeding up its investment, Indian rivals including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and Balaji Telefilms Ltd. are betting on bundling their content with mobile phone services. The TV network and Bollywood producer are allying with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio wireless service and Bharti Airtel Ltd., two of the country’s three biggest carriers, to offer decades of content to subscribers.Free AccessZee, parent of the country’s largest private broadcast network, offers movies, exclusive TV content and more than 90 live channels on its ZEE5 platform with content across 12 languages for as little as 70 cents a month. Partial access to the platform is free to subscribers of mobile phone carrier Bharti Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Mittal. Users of Airtel’s plans priced at $7.25-a-month or more get full access to ZEE5 free.Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which elbowed its way into the country’s mobile phone business three years ago with free calling and low-priced data services, has jumped into film and TV streaming, including a tie-up with Balaji Telefilms.Sunil Lulla, chief executive officer of Balaji Telefilms, said the company’s service ALTBalaji is focused on producing exclusive content in Hindi, the country’s most-used language.Other local entrants in India’s OTT, or “over-the-top,” market include Disney’s Hulu, Sony Corp.’s Sony LIV, Network 18 Media & Investments Ltd.’s Voot and Bollywood filmmaker Eros International Plc.’s Eros Now. *Mobile-only subscriptionSource: Counterpoint Technology Market ResearchNetflix’s global rival Amazon is also counting on India for growth and is prepared to take time to draw users.“We have a very long-term view for India, with a billion film-crazy people,” said Gaurav Gandhi, director and head of business for Amazon Prime Video, India. “In the next four to five years, there will be more screens connected to the internet and we are looking at distributing across all platforms with personalized and quality video content at affordable prices.”Pricing will also be crucial for Netflix. After introducing a promotional offer of about $3.65 a month for mobile-only users, Netflix decided to make the lower price permanent as “an opportunity to broaden access to the service,” Greg Peters, chief product officer, said Wednesday.Torrent Downloads“Pricing is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Hanish Bhatia, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet. Two to three years back, everybody relied on torrent,” the free protocol that lets users share and download films and TV shows without paying for them, Bhatia said.Netflix didn’t disclose how much it’s spending on local content in India. It did announce the addition of five series, two of which are being produced by superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma.“Netflix wants to have one big original, almost like a new Bollywood movie, coming out every month,” said Mihir Shah, vice president (India) at Media Partners Asia, a consulting firm. “In India, people pay for Bollywood. Netflix is hoping that if people are willing to pay $10 to watch a movie together as a family, they will also subscribe.”(Adds names of more local rivals in 19th paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: P R Sanjai in Mumbai at psanjai@bloomberg.net;Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net;Sheryl Tian Tong Lee in Hong Kong at slee1905@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Nagarajan at samnagarajan@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Dave McCombs, Jodi SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Netflix’s Indian Ambitions Face a Wall of Cheaper Rivals

2019-07-23,"U.S. telecommunications companies are pushing the Trump administration to move quickly on applications seeking exemptions to Huawei's blacklisting, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.  ""Their only real ask was that as we've opened up the non-national security aspects of selling equipment to Huawei, that we can speed it up a little bit, that the Commerce Department will process applications so they can speed things up,"" Kudlow told Fox.  Kudlow made the comments one day after executives from a number of top tech companies attended a meeting at the White House to discuss the issue.",U.S. tech cos asking White House to speed up Huawei exemptions process -Kudlow
2019-07-23,President Trump has previously said selling technology to Chinese technology conglomerate Huawei is a threat to U.S. national security.,Huawei’s Santa Clara R&D arm is laying off hundreds of workers amid Trump’s trade war with China
2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are moving closer to their first face-to-face trade negotiations in months, with a meeting between tech chief executives and President Donald Trump on Monday marking another step toward easing a ban on sales to China’s Huawei Technologies Co.The White House invited many of the U.S.’s biggest technology companies to discuss economic issues including a possible resumption of sales to Huawei. Trump and senior administration officials met with CEOs from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Broadcom Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp., Micron Technology Inc., Western Digital Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., according to White House spokesman Judd Deere.Deere said the CEOs had requested &quot;timely&quot; decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei and Trump agreed. National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow told reporters Tuesday that the meeting was positive and cited it as one reason he’s optimistic that in-person talks with China are likely to resume soon.The meeting between government officials and U.S. technology leaders may assuage Chinese concern that one of its largest technology companies is under existential threat from a blacklisting. But lawmakers and others in the administration who oppose any relief for Huawei could stymie any tentative progress in resolving a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.Negotiating MissionChinese state media on Monday hailed signs of progress on Huawei as part of what it called efforts to display “sincerity and goodwill’’ by both sides. Any easing of restrictions on Huawei is expected to be met with a resumption of Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural commodities.“We expect, we hope strongly that China will very soon start buying agriculture products, number one as part of an overall deal and part two as a goodwill gesture,&quot; Kudlow said. “So I’m going to strike a note of hopefulness, and I think we will see the ag purchases come on soon.”The moves, which followed a meeting between Trump and China’s Xi Jinping in Japan late last month, are meant to clear the way for a trip to China by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as soon as next week.Such a trip would mark the first high-level negotiating mission to China since talks broke down in May.Business PerspectiveKudlow and Mnuchin led the meeting Monday, which also included Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Lighthizer attended as well, according to people familiar with the gathering. It was called to inject a business perspective into a debate that has often been driven by an intelligence and national security community eager to see an outright ban on Huawei, one of the people said.Xiaomeng Lu, international policy manager and head of the China practice at Access Partnership, said the meeting is an opportunity for U.S. companies to demonstrate how resuming sales to Huawei’s consumer business can help American corporations innovate better and outperform the Chinese telecoms giant in the long run.Trump will very likely face backlash from Congress if he chooses to allow shipments to the Chinese telecoms giant, especially after the Washington Post Monday reported that the company helped build North Korea’s 3G network in a potential violation of U.S. export control laws.Legislative Push BackMany U.S. lawmakers, including hawks in Trump’s own party, are opposed to the president’s approach on the issue and have made the case for a complete decoupling of supply chains that would cut off Huawei from American components.“At every turn, we learn more and more about what a malign actor Huawei is,” Senators Tom Cotton and Chris Van Hollen said in a statement following the Washington Post report. The revelation underscores Huawei’s serial violations of U.S. law, they added, saying it’s crucial Congress pass legislation they’ve sponsored.A spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversaw the blacklisting of Huawei in May, declined to comment.Semiconductor TechnologyMost of those invited are suppliers of technology to Huawei, one of the biggest makers of smartphones and computer-network equipment. The chipmakers in particular have said that a blanket ban on doing business with the Chinese company may do more harm than good to U.S. national security.Many of the components they supply to Huawei can be easily obtained from companies elsewhere and jeopardizing their access to their biggest market risks cutting them off from revenue that’s vital to investing in their ability to maintain the U.S.’s lead in semiconductors, they’ve argued.Intel said in an emailed statement after the meeting that the company appreciated the opportunity to share its “perspective on economic issues, including how the current trade situation with China impacts the critical US semiconductor industry.&quot;Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company appreciated the opportunity to meet and stressed that &quot;open and fair trade are essential to ongoing U.S. technology leadership.&quot;Chinese companies, meanwhile, have begun asking U.S. exporters about buying agricultural products and also applied for exemptions from China’s retaliatory tariffs on the goods, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.The Chinese government met Friday with domestic soybean buyers about a plan to purchase more U.S. supplies, according to people familiar with the situation. That could include waiving China’s retaliatory tariffs, but details have not been decided yet, the people said.Face-to-FaceWith China’s top leadership likely to be out of Beijing from early August for their annual seaside conclave, people close to the talks say there is a narrow window for face-to-face meeting in the coming two weeks. Mnuchin, Lighthizer and their Chinese counterparts talked by phone last week for the second time since the two nations’ presidents met.Separate to the possible agricultural purchases, China announced Saturday new measures to further open up the nation’s financial sector to foreign investors. Foreign companies will be able to take a stake in or control entities including wealth management units of commercial lenders, pension fund managers and currency brokers.The changes weren’t announced as directly related to the trade talks with the U.S., but American criticism of China’s protection of various domestic markets is a core issue in the ongoing trade tensions.(Updates with Kudlow comment in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Miao Han, Justin Sink, Laura Litvan and Mark Milian.To contact the reporters on this story: Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.net;Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Alister BullFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Agrees to Timely Decisions on Huawei as China Talks Near

2019-07-24,Wall Street is continuing its dream run in 2019 despite a sudden collapse of trade negotiations between the United States and China What is more important is that the primary driving force of the market s bull run is the technology sector which was likely to be affected the most by,6 Tech Stocks to Buy Pre Q2 Earnings on Trade Talk Prospects
2019-07-24,"Second quarter earnings are coming in above expectations. Nearly 80% of S&P listed companies reporting EPS above their estimates, but that may have as much to do with a lowered bar as real growth. Only 28% of reporting companies have beaten their targets on revenue growth, an ominous sign for the US economy as a whole.At the same time, there are still stocks offering high returns, even in this climate. We’ve found three that have beaten the S&P 500’s year-to-date growth of 19.9%, and are showing potential for further gains. The reasons vary for their upbeat forecasts; here, we take a closer look at each stock’s current position and check in to see what the Wall Street analysts have to say. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)Cisco occupies a business niche that is almost guaranteed to generate high profits: it is the premier supplier of computer networking hardware. It has also shown 33.2% share price growth year-to-date, well ahead of the S&P 500. On August 14, Cisco will report earnings for its fiscal Q4 as well as is FY2019. EPS is expected at 75 cents, 15% higher than last year’s Q4 and 5.6% higher than Q3. In the past four quarters, CSCO has averaged a positive earnings surprise of 2.96%.The company’s profitability underlies its strong buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is derived from 15 buys and 5 holds assigned in the past three months. CSCO’s $59 average price target represents a modest 3.2% upside from the current share price of $57, but as we’ll see below, there may be room for further growth.Cisco has been making good use of its profits. Earlier this month, Cisco management finalized a $2.6 billion agreement to purchase Acacia Communications (ACIA). Cisco will pay $70 per share for Acacia, and in return will bring Acacia’s high-speed digital signal processing technologies into Cisco’s product line.Writing after the Acacia acquisition was announced, Merrill Lynch analyst Tal Liani said, “…the deal will expand Cisco's switches and routers through adding new use cases and target markets.” Liani set a price target of $62, suggesting an upside of 7.4%Liani was not the only analyst to voice approval of the acquisition. JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee said that the Acacia purchase “presents a very strong strategic rationale in expanding and strengthening Cisco's core optical portfolio.” He rates Cisco a buy, with a $60 price target. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)Costco is the popular membership-only warehouse club store that has created what financial blogger Luke Lango describes as “an offline version of Amazon (AMZN).” The retailer builds on the loyalty of its 100 million strong member base, rewarding customers with bulk deals on staple goods and competitive pricing on most everything else, and getting in return a 90% resubscription rate and customers with a habit of shopping frequently and buying a lot in every visit. It’s a successful model, and in Lango’s words, “will continue to power healthy results for the retailer for the foreseeable future.” Those results are clear from COST’s 37.5% gain in share price this year.One side effect of Costco’s rapid price increase is that the stock actually shows a net downside right now, compared to the average price target. Shares are selling for $280; the average analyst price target is $275. Recent reviews, and price target revisions, suggest that Wall Street is reevaluating COST’s potential.Typical of the new ratings is Kate McShane’s buy. The Goldman Sachs analyst opened new coverage of COST on July 11, describing its club model as offering “the best attributes within retail.” She set a $290, price target, giving the stock a 3.5% upside from today’s price.In the past week, two additional analysts have raised their existing targets for the stock. Robert Ohmes, of Merrill Lynch, pointed out continued consumer spending growth at Costco, especially among lower income customers. Based on increased consumer spending, Ohmes set a $310 price target for COST, suggesting a 10.6% upside. And writing from Raymond James, Budd Bugatch stands by his earlier comments on Costco – back in June, he said, “[E]ven though the stock’s valuation has increased, there is still a pathway for further upside, earnings growth and market share gains through U.S. and international club openings over the next several years.” His revised target of $300 indicates a 7% upside for COST shares.Costco is currently in the middle of its fiscal Q4, historically its best quarter for earnings. The company will report on October 3, and is expected to show EPS of $2.52. This is 6.8% higher than last year’s Q4.  Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN)Of the stocks in this article, Axon has shown the highest growth – an eye-catching 51.3% year-to-date, well above all three major stock market indexes. It’s no wonder that the company has been growing; its flagship product is the Taser less-than-lethal electric weapon, for both law enforcement and personal defense use, and subsidiary products include a line of body cameras marketed to police agencies. In today’s highly charged social/political environment, these devices are in high demand. As a result, Axon has seen revenue grow in every quarter since 2012 – a record any company would envy. At the same time, however, quarterly EPS has been erratic. Heading to the company’s August 6 fiscal Q2 report, earnings are expected at 6 cents per share, down from both last quarter and the year-ago quarter. This is while the company’s Q1 report raised full-year revenue guidance to $495 million.Axon has not been without controversy. During the company’s lifetime, it has dealt with numerous patent litigation matters, along with royalty and penalty issues. In the most recent such case, a patent suit by competitor Digital Ally was dismissed in a US Court of Appeals. After the decision, Needham analyst Scott Berg restated his buy rating on the stock, and set a price target of $80. He said, “Although we expect Digital Ally will appeal this decision, our industry work suggests a patent decision at this level is difficult to overturn. We believe any future impact to Axon of an appeal for this judgment would likely be limited to additional legal costs versus the potential for a large penalty and royalty payments.” His price target suggests an upside of 20%.Also last month, JPMorgan’s Mark Strouse raised his price target by 11%, to $81, on strong estimates for fiscal year 2021. He notes, “[We] expect the company's revenue growth to remain elevated through fiscal 2021 and for margins to continue to expand, consistent with management's long-term targets.” Regarding product and marketing expansion, Strouse added, “[We] believe AB3's live-streaming LTE capability could allow Axon to penetrate adjacent markets such as EMS and fire departments.” Strouse’s $81 target indicates a 22% upside to the stock.Axon holds a moderate buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 5 buys and 2 holds given it in the past three months. The stock’s current share price of $66 and average price target of $74 suggest room for an 11% upside.",3 Growing Stocks Beating the S&P 500

It's a testament to the company's leadership and vision that it has been able not only to survive but compete.Today, its client list hosts many big names in a variety of industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsXLNX started the year strong and nearly doubled its July 2018 price by May. But then the next round of the Chinese trade war happened. That took tech stocks down sharply.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Wall Street doesn't like uncertainty. Not knowing they could sell chips to Chinese firms like Huawei and others created a lot of uncertainty. What's more, these are growth stocks. When one of the largest markets in the world is taken off your business list, it has significant implications.Planning around something like that is difficult. It's like rigging a ship for a hurricane but not knowing if the storm is going to be a glancing blow or a direct hit. Your contingency plans will slow you down regardless of the outcome.So, the market adjusted its expectations. And by June, it looked to be clear sailing, at least for a little while, as the Trump administration allowed some chip sales to China and both countries went back to the negotiating table.That doesn't mean there's no threat, but the sector is back under full sail. XLNX Stock Back on Path of GrowthFor XLNX in particular, this has helped revive its performance. In the past year, the XLNX stock is up 86%; year-to-date the stock is up 50%. What's more, the trailing PE on the stock is sitting around 36, so it's not even fully valued here, giving it plenty of headroom.And given the fact that it could be back on its growth path soon, that growth could come fast, especially as other sectors begin to tire in this environment.Moving forward, XLNX is a key player in very high-growth, strategically oriented sectors.In telecom, XLNX is key supplier Apple (AAPL) and there is a lot of buzz that its new generation of iPhones may revive its tiring line.In the data center world - cloud computing, big data, data warehouses, etc. - its strength with Hewlett Packard (HPQ), HP Enterprise (HPE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) means it will be at the center of this massive and ongoing trend. This potential market is supposed to triple in the next three years or so.It's also a big player in the smart car space, with chip designs focused on driver assist systems. The concept is more complex than it sounds. But suffice it to say that in a connected world where XLNX chips are in the cars and in data centers, the leverage will be a compelling selling point to major smart car infrastructure firms.XLNX stock gets an A rating from my Portfolio Grader.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-08-01,"Most Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) shareholders apparently cheered Cisco's acquisition of optical communication technology  company Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA),  as the already-overbought Cisco stock rose following the announcement of the deal. It's possible that many of those investors, however, don't fully understand the significance of the transaction.Source: Shutterstock The networking giant will bolster the breadth and depth of its fiber optic tech portfolio by officially making Acacia, which was already a CSCO supplier, part of the Cisco family.It's a development that merits a look beyond simple explanations, though, even for the non-tech layperson who happens to hold Cisco stock. Although the deal won't immediately boost Cisco stock price, the transaction sets the stage for Cisco stock to rally beginning in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another Smart DealCisco CEO Chuck Robbins has made clear since he took the helm in 2015 that Cisco would use what's now a $35 billion war chest to invest in bolt-on businesses. And that's what he's been doing. Shortly before the $2.6 billion offer was made to Acacia, Cisco announced its intent to acquire Sentryo. In January, it bought Singularity Networks. In 2018, Cisco acquired six companies.The Acacia deal is another big step down a mostly-underestimated path that Cisco is already traveling, though. With Acacia,  CSCO now has something it can offer network operators that will have to use fiber optic solutions to handle the massive data loads which the advent of 5G connections will create.In short, Acacia's wares, known as coherent optical interconnect products, facilitate so-called long-haul optical communications that can travel thousands of miles.Acacia's products are the perfect complement to Cisco's large-scale networking portfolio, though they also bolster the &quot;inside the data center&quot; optical networking technology that CSCO obtained through last year's acquisition of Luxtera. Coherent Technology Is the Inevitable FutureCoherent technology is a vague term used to describe using light-based signals to communicate at 100G speeds (and beyond) for long, long distances.Cisco didn't invent it, exactly. Arguably, it was smaller rival Ciena (NYSE:CIEN) that laid the ground work for long-distance fiber optic communications a decade ago. Ciena hasn't been able to commercialize the technology the way Cisco appears it will be able to, however.5G wireless speeds are set to effectively be three to four times faster than 4G connections, though in practical theory, they could be ten or twenty times faster. That makes 5G a potential alternative to wire-based internet communications.For perspective, Cisco forecasts that global coherent traffic will reach 13.2 exabytes per day in 2022, up from 4.1 exabytes per day in 2017. 5G devices will spur much of that new traffic.The catch is that radio signals can only travel so far, and cross-country communications can't be handled by radio. They have to be carried by a physical line at least some of the way. Fiber optics, or optical networking, are the only way to do that. And to make optical networking feasible, many 100G-capable fiber optic lines will have to be laid down. That, of course, is where Cisco's coherent technology will come in. Looking Ahead for Cisco StockThe coherent optical technology hardware market is expected to be worth $70 billion by 2026, according to Acumen Research and Consulting. That's more revenue than Cisco produced over the course of the past four reported quarters, pointing to a tremendous growth opportunity and a huge potential positive catalyst for Cisco stock.Current and prospective owners of Cisco stock may not want to celebrate just yet, however. Other players are gunning for a piece of that market. The aforementioned Ciena is one of them. NeoPhotonics (NYSE:NPTN) is another. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) is still another.Only a handful of players can offer a soup-to-nuts solution, though.Jimmy Yu, vice president and industry analyst for the Optical Transport program with Dell'Oro Group, explains: &quot;Once Cisco concludes this acquisition, four optical system vendors will have in-house capability for developing and producing the key components for coherent line cards. The four system vendors are Cisco, Ciena, Huawei, and Infinera.&quot;Of the four, Cisco stands out as the one most operators are willing to bet will be around and available into the future, with the least risk of running into  political turbulence. That's good news for CSCO and Cisco stock price.The 5G-driven growth of Cisco's coherent technology arm may not materialize until next year, but given its potential, Cisco stock could plausibly start to reflect that opportunity this year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-02,"Nokia (NYSE:NOK) showed some progress in its second-quarter report last week. It even briefly boosted NOK stock: shares climbed 10% after Thursday's release. But in the last week, Nokia stock already has given back roughly half those gains.Source: Shutterstock It's not terribly hard to see why that is. Traders responded well to the company's headline beat. But investors are more cautious, and with good reason. The Q2 report follows a first quarter release that was much weaker (NOK stock actually fell 10% after that report). Full-year guidance was reaffirmed -- and so were the risks to that guidance.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now More broadly, as I detailed in June, Nokia has disappointed several times before. The 5G opportunity might be different, but investors would be forgiven for not wholly trusting the company just yet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q2 and First Half Nokia EarningsTraders likely focused on the headline numbers here, which look strong, at least relative to expectations. Adjusted EPS of €0.05 came in €0.02 ahead of consensus. The top-line performance was more impressive: revenue rose 7.2%, about five points better than the Street projected.But that beat doesn't necessarily suggest that Nokia stock is getting back to growth. The company explained a soft Q1 as driven in part by contracts which were signed in the quarter, but didn't contribute to revenue until Q2. That timing -- somewhat -- explains the difference in how the two quarters were viewed.Taking the first half as a whole, the news hardly seems spectacular. Revenue, in constant currency, grew just 2% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit fell 32%. And Nokia burned a whopping €2.5 billion (about US$2.75 billion) in cash. The performance so far doesn't necessarily suggest that Nokia has turned the corner. Optimism Toward NOK StockThat said, Nokia stock probably deserved some gains after the quarter -- if only due to a sort of relief rally. After Q1, it seemed unlikely that Nokia would meet its full-year EPS guidance. The consensus estimate was below the low end of the company's range. The Q2 beat gets Nokia back on track toward at least clipping the low end of the range.That's important for two reasons. First, it re-establishes some level of credibility for Nokia. Again, this is a company that has disappointed repeatedly. It sold its phone business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for US$7 billion in cash, which turned out to be a great deal (and a disaster for Microsoft). Six years later, NOK stock trades basically where it did after it soared on that deal.In early 2016, Nokia took control of Alcatel-Lucent via tender offer in a supposedly transformative acquisition. Nokia stock has declined since that deal was closed (and since it was announced the year before).The opportunity now comes from enormous cost-cutting -- some €500 million in savings next year -- and 5G. Nokia needs to capitalize this time, and Q2 is a modest step in that journey.Secondly, it's 2020 earnings that really matter for Nokia. Thanks in part to those cost cuts, Nokia is projecting a big step up in profits next year. Adjusted EPS is guided to rise from €0.25-€0.29 this year to €0.37-€0.42 next year. The 2020 target makes NOK look cheap: about 12.5x earnings at the midpoint of that guidance.Basically, if Nokia hits next year's target, Nokia stock is going to rise. If it doesn't, NOK at best stays dead money. The company still wrote in its release that guidance &quot;puts significant pressure on execution in the second half.&quot; But Q2's performance at least gives the company a chance of reaching its guidance for this year. That's a step in the right direction for the company, and a reason to see a bounce in the stock. Will 5G Boost Nokia Stock?There's one more piece of good news worth highlighting. Again, cost cuts should help margins and 5G should drive growth. The question is whether, with China's Huawei facing security concerns, Nokia can outperform rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) in 5G. Early returns look good.In fact, CEO Rajeev Suri said on the Q2 conference call that of the existing Nokia 4G LTE customers who have chosen a 5G supplier, every one of them has chosen Nokia. That suggests early strength in 5G -- and a nice base for growth going forward. It's another reason to see the report as bullish for NOK stock.Personally, I'm not quite ready to jump on board. One quarter doesn't change execution concerns, particularly with the company itself still saying guidance is at risk. With the exception of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the networking space has been a difficult one for companies and investors (Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), for instance has traded sideways for years now). 5G growth is important, but it's going to be offset by 4G losses.There's still a lot left for Nokia to prove. But give credit where credit is due: the company at least took a solid step forward last week.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-02,"It takes more than a day for stocks to work through President Donald Trump's trade tweets, explaining why losses that arrived yesterday stretched into Friday.The president's Thursday tweet storm arrived late in the session. It may not be surprising that some of the stocks residing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average most sensitive to tariff antics really slumped today after closing lower on Thursday.The Nasdaq Composite, home to a slew of technology companies feeling the pinch of the latest tariff threat, lost 1.32% today while the S&P 500 closed lower by 0.73%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.37% to close the week with about two-thirds of the blue-chip index in the red today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now The impact of previous tariffs has been felt in multiple corners of the economy. So much so that data confirms China is no longer the biggest trading partner of the U.S. In a report out today, the Commerce Department said American exports to China slumped 18% in the first half of the year and that China is now the third-largest U.S. trading partner behind Mexico and Canada.It's unlikely that China will be regaining that top spot anytime soon, but it is probable that tariffs mean more pain for some of the following Dow stocks. Just Don't Do ItFor Nike (NYSE:NKE) investors, tariffs are very much a case of &quot;just don't do it&quot; as highlighted by the stock's 2.16% tumble today, putting it among the worst-performing Dow names for the day.The good news: today's slide in shares of Nike may be a case of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater. While the company has significant China exposure, it may be be able to endure another batch of tariffs without much pain for investors.&quot;Nike, the world's largest shoemaker, has a sizable 23% exposure to China. Surprisingly, the consensus on Wall Street is that the athletic apparel giant won't suffer from the new tariffs,&quot; according to CNBC. Dow Losers: Technology, Of CourseThe technology sector, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, is a predictable victim of the China trade spat because American tech firms either source components in China, depend on that country as a major end market, or both. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) slipped 3.86% today, making it the worst-performing name in the Dow. Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) was another tech stock taken to task, losing 2.12%.Weak price action in Apple today makes sense because the company has significant exposure to China, where many of Apple's most important products are made and sold. Of the many negative effects of tariffs, one includes that companies have to pass higher costs onto consumers. That often triggers reduced demand. Some analysts are already speculating that the new tariffs could pinch Apple.&quot;If Apple passes through the 10% tariff to consumers we could see a hit to iPhone demand by roughly 6 million to 8 million iPhones in the U.S.&quot; over the next 12 months,&quot; said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Bottom Line on the DowUnderscoring the need to play some defense over the near-term, just 10 Dow members closed higher today and only two of those names would not be considered defensive stocks. Obviously, most Dow members can be considered multi-national companies with significant export and China exposures, but there are ways to skirt trade troubles at the sector level (banks and healthcare to name a pair).Adding to the domestic focus conversation, it is relevant to state that nearly a third of the Russell 2000 reports earnings next week, notable because U.S. small-cap companies are heavily focused on their home market, not China.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-02,"In my 10X Innovation Summit, I address most of the practicalities of buying stocks with 10X profit potential. The topic I would like to explore now is what happens AFTER you buy. In other words: when to sell a stock, if you want the maximum profit from your investing ideas.Let me show you how by example.Since 10X gains are usually derived from huge, world-changing megatrends, we'll look back at one of the biggest in recent memory: the rise of the internet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsImagine it's the early 1990s, when the internet was first being introduced. The more you learn about it, the more possibilities you discover.You start to see how one day we'll be doing just about EVERYTHING online -- work, shopping, socializing, education…you name it. And you become eager to invest in this phenomenon.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now As one of the few to understand the Internet Revolution in its very early days, you would know the select few stocks to buy.You'd buy some Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which supplied the actual gear these networks run on -- basically, the &quot;plumbing&quot; of the internet.You'd buy some Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, too. After all, in the 1990s, no one gets on the World Wide Web without their personal computers (PCs). Maybe you'd also pick up shares of another PC manufacturer: Dell Computer (NYSE:DELL).Within a few years, you'd have joined the ranks of the &quot;dot-com millionaires.&quot;$1,000 in CSCO stock would be worth $1,264,000 after less than 10 years! With MSFT stock and DELL stock in the mix, too, you'd end up with several million dollars.But there's just one catch: None of these stocks went straight up. In fact, no stock does -- especially in its early stages.Here's how CSCO stock would have looked a year into your investment:Not many people would have stuck around after that sheer drop in March 1991 -- when several months of gains were erased in days.But then, not many people would have enjoyed the meteoric rise CSCO then saw over the next four years:As you see, that initial drop ended up just being a blip. (It wasn't even the sharpest correction CSCO stock ended up making, on its way to glory.) But no one knew that at the time!No one but you. Because you knew exactly WHY you were investing in CSCO. Namely, to cash in on the Internet Revolution. And that was just getting started. Therefore, you knew CSCO stock was just getting started, too, as a money-making investment.So, if you'd cashed in after one year, you'd have made a modest profit on CSCO stock.But if you'd cashed in a few years later - once the internet was becoming more fully adopted in businesses and households - that's how you'd have turned $1,000 into $1,264,000.The biggest winners tend to work just like that. Another example I give in the 10X Innovation Summit of when to sell a stock (and when NOT to) was Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Believe it or not, AMZN is sitting on a 2,700% gain! (I bet you can believe it, since Amazon has just about taken over the whole world, at this point.) But like CSCO, no one just woke up one morning to 2,700% profits on AMZN. It took 10 years.Sure, AMZN stock had plenty of good years, on the way to that 2,700% gain -- but it had bad years along the way, too.Here's me during my 10X Innovation Summit presentation, showing the last 10 years of AMZN's returns. As you see above, if you invested in AMZN, you had to take the good with the bad. And you had to have faith that, in the end, you'd come out 10X ahead. (In this case, you'd have made much more than that!)But letting your investment ride can be one of the hardest things to do.Just ask Peter Lynch, a legend on Wall Street who once managed Fidelity's mammoth mutual fund Magellan.One of Lynch's most famous quotes had to do with what he regretted most in his career: &quot;I always sold stocks way too early.&quot;I'm sure you can relate. I certainly can.I felt the same way about my investment in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stock. When to Sell a Stock: My &quot;Peter Lynch Moment&quot;Intuitive Surgical was one of the first stocks I bought for clients, back in 2004. It wasn't widely known, but the company was a pioneer in the brand-new field of surgical robotics. So, it fit a major theme for me: next-generation healthcare. We bought around $15 per share - and within a few weeks, it was at $20!I went ahead and sold ISRG, and we took that profit to the bank. And you know what? My clients were happy with that. It was a 30%+ return in a short time. But guess what? ISRG stock is up to $525 today. (And that's even after a 3-for-1 stock split.)I wished I'd been less focused on possibly losing the gains we had…and more focused on why ISRG was a good investment, long-term.

2019-08-04,"Goldman Sachs has just revealed a valuable investing strategy that’s worth keeping a close eye on in the coming months. The firm is now recommending stocks with the fastest expected return-on-equity growth (or ROE). That’s because market upside is increasingly limited from current levels, says Goldman Sachs. “We forecast flat S&P 500 margins through 2020, with risks tilted to the downside. ... Amid concerns about the growth and profitability outlook this year, investors have assigned a premium to companies able to expand ROE,” the firm’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin said. He directed investors to the firm’s basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest consensus estimates of ROE growth. This basket is already proving its worth and is currently beating the index by 5 percentage points year-to-date. In essence, ROE reflects the return a company generates on capital that is owned by the shareholders.“The basket typically outperforms in weakening growth environments as investors assign a scarcity premium to firms that are able to expand ROE despite index-level headwinds,” Kostin told investors. So with this outlook in mind, here are five stocks that feature on the firm’s ROE basket list:  1&#92;. Under Armour (UA)Athletic apparel retailer Under Armour has had a volatile time recently. Shares plunged 20% after the company reported disappointing revenue, on weaker-than-expected North American sales. Rising trade tensions haven’t helped either, although shares are still trading up 23% year-to-date.Don’t give up yet, says top Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jim Duffy. He has just reiterated his buy rating on the stock with a $30 price target (56% upside potential). He remains adamant that the bullish investing thesis ‘remains in-tact’ and advised investors to focus on UA’s ‘green pasture opportunities’ and ‘capacity for margin improvement and multi-year earnings power’. “Bears will cling to concerns over growth in North America… [but] we remain confident that Under Armour is building a healthier revenue base in North America, upon which it can grow more meaningfully in future periods, and continue to believe North America revenue can accelerate into 2020 and beyond,” Duffy wrote. Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez also focuses on the long-term picture: “With Under Armour in the early stages of its five-year plan, choppiness quarter-to-quarter is not unexpected,” he wrote. The analyst upgraded UA from Hold to Buy back in April, stating at the time “Under Armour has grown up, with a renewed focus on driving profitability and return on invested capital.” From the Street’s top analysts, UA shows a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus. That’s with 3 buy ratings vs 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $26 (35% upside potential).  2&#92;. Apple (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is another key stock highlighted by Goldman Sachs for its ROE potential. Investors rejoiced as Apple reported excellent 3Q:FY19 results and served up a strong outlook.  Although the iPhone portfolio continued to struggle in the quarter, Apple grew its non-iPhone revenue by 17% with notable strength in Wearables and further progress in Services. Following the quarter, five-star Monness analyst Brian White increased estimates, while raising his 12-month price target from $245 to $265 (30% upside potential). “We found the tone of the call upbeat with Apple serving up a strong outlook and voicing enthusiasm around the innovation pipeline” cheered White. He also noted that the launch of a 5G iPhone in 2020 has the potential to drive a healthy upgrade cycle. Meanwhile Daniel Ives tells investors not to panic about President Trump’s latest tariff tweets. While AAPL remains the &quot;poster child&quot; for the US/China UFC trade battle, “seeing the forest through the trees the fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable in our opinion” Ives said. Best performing analysts score the stock a ‘Moderate Buy.’ In the last three months, AAPL has received 12 buy ratings and 8 hold ratings. These 20 top analysts have a $228 average analyst price target, indicating 12% upside potential for AAPL stock.  3&#92;. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Worldwide IT leader Cisco has just announced a $2.6 billion deal to buy high-speed optical components maker Acacia Communications. The acquisition should reinforce Cisco’s position as the leader in enterprise networking, enthuses five-star Robert W Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver. “With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic” explained Cisco’s executive VP, David Goeckeler. He added: &quot;The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers’ most demanding requirements.”However, as Ruykhaver points out, the deal will have to go through the standard regulatory process, which includes a Chinese review. He has a buy rating on the stock and $57 price target. Even though Emerging Markets (~20% of revenue) continues to be an area of inconsistency, the analyst believes Cisco remains very well positioned. That’s as the company makes important strides towards a recurring revenue model, which today account for 30% of the company’s revenue.Like Apple, Cisco shows a Moderate Buy consensus with 12% upside potential from the $60 average price target. Twelve top analysts have published buy ratings on the stock recently, with 5 analysts staying on the sidelines.  4&#92;. Sempra Energy (SRE)Serving approximately 40 million consumers worldwide, California-based Sempra Energy focuses on electric and natural gas infrastructure. RBC Capital’s Shelby Tucker has a buy rating on Sempra with a $145 price target. He made the bullish call despite the company’s recent earnings miss, noting that Sempra maintained its guidance for full year 2019.“The main driver of the miss to our estimate comes from weaker-than-expected results at SoCalGas and the Texas utilities, partially offset by stronger performance at Sempra LNG. Despite the miss, SRE has reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.70-$6.30” noted Tucker. Only a couple of analysts have published recent ratings on Sempra stock- with the consensus working out at Moderate Buy. Their average price target works out at $147 (8% upside potential).  5&#92;. Global Payments (GPN) Last but not least comes fintech giant Global Payments. The stock is buzzing right now following solid earnings results. Analysts responded with a wave of positive sentiment and price target hikes. Notably, SunTrust analyst Andrew Jeffrey raised his price target to $190.00 (from $175), while Susquehanna’s James Friedman now has a Street-high price target of $200.00 (up from $170 previously).“The quarter represents yet another beat-and-raise as Global Payments continues to deliver upside on both the top and bottom-line, and we view the updated FY19 targets as likely conservative based on our belief that there is margin upside for the [fiscal year] even beyond the upwardly revised margin outlook,” wrote Jefferies’ Trevor Williams, who rates the stock a buy with a $190 target price. “While the bar for the quarter was relatively high given the run in shares, we think that the results will be enough to sustain the momentum in the stock.” What’s more the massive $21.5 billion merger with Total System Services (TSS) is now fast-approaching. “Importantly, the TSS merger is set to close as early as the beginning of 4Q19 and preliminary work has led to mgmt. being incrementally more confident in delivering and potentially exceeding targets” commented Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane on July 31. Out of all the stocks highlighted by Goldman Sachs, GPN is the only stock with a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Indeed, 14 of 15 top analyst ratings in the last three months are a ‘buy.’ Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $180 suggests 11% upside potential lies ahead.

2019-08-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart plans to start a free Indian video streaming service in coming months, escalating a fight with Amazon.com Inc. by borrowing its arch-foe’s tactics.India’s biggest online retailer plans to roll out video streaming for members of its Flipkart Plus loyalty program by September ahead of the peak Diwali shopping season, people familiar with its plans said. The service is currently in beta mode, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal strategy.Flipkart Online Services Pvt is getting into a red-hot market but playing catch-up by taking a page from Amazon’s playbook. The U.S. retailer’s Prime Video service had for years proven instrumental in retaining shoppers and attracting new ones. A streaming offering could help level the playing field with Amazon, which for years has devised award-winning shows such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel for global audiences.Flipkart won’t initially produce originals -- a route that’s proven costly for online platforms including Netflix Inc. -- and instead license content from the likes of Walt Disney Co. and local studios such as Balaji Telefilms, the people said. In-house content could come later, they added. The news was reported earlier Monday by Money Control.In a departure from Amazon Prime, Flipkart Plus video-streaming will come free just like its no-subscription fee loyalty program. Flipkart shoppers can become members by amassing 300 “super coins,” at a rate of 2 for every 100 rupees ($1.40) spent on its platform. Users can exchange those tokens for items from flight tickets and food delivery to car rentals and music streaming subscriptions. And, again unlike its rival, the Indian company doesn’t automatically offer deals on shipping, with free delivery limited to only very few products.Flipkart Plus launched its rewards program in 2018 when Amazon Prime was already an established presence in India, boasting original shows and a library of Bollywood and regional language films to go along with international fare. The service costs 999 rupees annually or 129 rupees a month.Walmart paid $16 billion for control of Indian e-commerce pioneer Flipkart in 2018, acquiring pole position in one of the world’s fastest-growing arenas. Unlike giant markets such as China that’re largely closed to foreign operators, India is the frontline of a battle between the world’s largest online retailers.The country has also become a battleground for global streaming giants from Netflix to Disney-owned Hotstar. They’re drawn by a market that could hit 829 million smartphone users by 2022, compared with about half a billion now, according to Cisco Systems Inc. estimates. The $500 million Indian video-streaming market could grow to 10 times that size by 2023, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group last year.To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, ;Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Walmart Takes on Amazon With Free Streaming Video in India

2019-08-06,"Remembering the old adage about stocks falling faster than they rise, investors should be dismayed that Tuesday's rebound did not recoup all of Monday's losses. However, the reasons behind the Tuesday bounce back are, arguably, flimsy.For example, one of today's catalysts was China saying it will not let the yuan depreciate further. That helped for today, but some market observers believe there are trust issues that need to be resolved when it comes to the U.S. and its dealings with China. Another reason equities surged today is the belief that the trade war cannot get much worse. That's a belief rooted in hope, not empirical evidence.Still, the Nasdaq Composite added 1.39% on Tuesday while the S&P 500 rose by 1.31%. Following a day in which all 30 of its components finished in the red, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a Tuesday gain of 1.22%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of today's Dow winners were of the predictable variety and that is OK. Nike (NYSE:NKE) one of the more tariff-sensitive names, jumped 2.95% today. If trade tensions ebb, the athletic apparel maker is likely to recoup some of its recent losses and then some as market participants realize Nike is much more than a China story.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Dow tech names, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), the latter of which is highly tariff-sensitive, finished higher today. Analysts are calling attention to the fact that while the trade war is not good news for Apple, the company is prepared for it. Those preparations may not be factored into Apple stock.&quot;Apple has planned ahead for the protracted trade war and should be able to offset the costs even with higher import costs,&quot; said TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Dow Today: Boeing's BackUnfortunately, I don't mean that the stock is back, though shares of Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) gained 0.47% today. I mean that the Dow's largest component is back in this space. Boeing's recent slide, one that has seen the stock tumble 7% over the past month, has the shares residing below its key moving averages, prompting some questions about the stock's technical health.&quot;The 50-day moving average price of Boeing shares also dipped below the 200-day moving average in June--a signal technical traders will look at for signs of a shift in investor sentiment,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;When the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, it is a sign that a stock has positive momentum and that good news is propelling shares higher.&quot; Dow After The BellAs I noted yesterday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports quarterly results today after the close of U.S. markets. The stock gained 2.64% today in advance of that update. For its fiscal third quarter, Disney is expected to earn $1.72 a share on revenue of $21.4 billion. A year earlier, the company earned $1.87 a share on revenue of $15.4 billion.Disney has a history of retreating immediately following its earnings reports. If history repeats, that could be a buying opportunity in the entertainment giant's shares because the stock closed more than 10% below the average analyst price target today. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodaySomething interesting about China's effort to devalue its currency: the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, is lower by a third of percent over the past week.Behind the scenes, China was likely hoping that its yuan devaluation efforts would send the dollar soaring, further crimping U.S. exporters, but that has not yet materialized. Even if the greenback gains strength on the back of the trade war, that is an impetus for the Federal Reserve to get involved and lower interest rates again, also known as good news for stocks.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-07,"The stock market is in selloff mode right now. The only two things the market cares about -- the trade war and interest rates -- aren't progressing as hoped. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated over the past few days, with U.S. President Donald Trump implementing new tariffs on more Chinese goods, and China responding by playing currency manipulation games directly aimed at hurting the U.S. At the same time, the Fed has expressed a more hawkish than expected tone with respect to future rate cuts.In response, stocks -- which marched 10% higher in June and July to all-time highs without ever retreating more than 2% -- have dropped 5% through the first few trading days of August.In the big picture, this sell-off is nothing more than a bull market gut check. It will ultimately pass and soon. By the end of the year, stocks should be materially higher than where they are today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent round of tariffs is just a Trump chest puff in order to get the Fed to lower rates more aggressively. It will work. Renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China will create more economic cross-currents, which will force the Fed to cut rates more aggressively. Once those rates go lower, Trump will probably pull some of these tariffs off the table because he doesn't want the trade war to get out of hand ahead of the 2020 election. China will stop playing currency manipulation games because they, too, don't want things to get out of hand since trade with the U.S. accounts for a significant chunk of their economic activity.Net net, by the end of the year, you will have reduced trade tensions and lower rates. That's a winning recipe for stocks, especially growth stocks which thrive in a low rate environment.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip As such, growth stocks look like a good buy on this recent dip. By extension, growth ETFs also look a like good buy on this dip. Thus, let's take a look at six growth ETFs which look good for a second half 2019 rebound rally. First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 21%Percent off 2019 Highs: 8%The Big Idea: Cybersecurity spend globally will continue to rise, implying sustained big growth potential for cybersecurity companies, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world's most important cybersecurity stocks.Key Holdings: Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA)For the past several years, I have employed a saying which broadly encompasses the bull thesis on cybersecurity stocks: another day, another hack, another reason to buy cybersecurity stocks. Long story short, companies are increasingly accumulating data on their customers and storing that data in the cloud. This data is extremely valuable and often very personal. But because it's in the cloud, it is subject to being stolen by hackers. Thus, enterprises need to keep spending big on cybersecurity solutions to secure all that data, and the more hacks that happen in the world, the more companies will double down on cybersecurity spend to avoid such hacks.This is exactly what has happened over the past several years. Every company in the world is collecting and storing more data. But all that data keeps getting compromised. In 2016, Adult Friend Finder, Yahoo and Uber (NYSE:UBER) were the victims of big hacks. In 2017, it was Equifax (NYSE:EFX) and Verizon (NASDAQ:VZ) and in 2018, it was Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and Chegg (NASDAQ:CHGG). So far in 2019, the headline hack has been the Capital One (NYSE:COF) data breach, which exposed info on more than 100 million Capital One customers.As all these hacks have happened, cybersecurity companies have broadly benefited from consistently huge revenue growth. Palo Alto Networks reported 28% revenue growth last quarter. Fortinet was up at 18% revenue growth last quarter. Splunk? 36%. Okta? 50%. Even further, the whole industry has high gross margins, so big revenue growth is paving the path for huge profits at scale one day.Nothing about this secular growth narrative changes because of the trade war. Instead, the lower rates go, the more the lofty valuations underneath cybersecurity stocks will be justified. As such, the First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR) -- which is a collection of the market's most important cybersecurity stocks -- should rebound in a big way from today's 8% selloff and head significantly higher into the end of the year and over the long run. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 17%% off 2019 Highs: 9%The Big Idea: The cloud is the future of all enterprise workloads, yet only 20% of such workloads have migrated to the cloud, paving the path for sustained huge market growth in the long run -- and this ETF gives you exposure to the world's most important cloud stocks.Key Holdings: VMWare (NYSE:VMW), Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)In the enterprise world, the cloud is the future of everything. Every single enterprise workload -- from crafting an email to creating a spreadsheet and everything in between -- can and should be done in the cloud, given the cost and convenience advantages of cloud-hosted solutions over on-premise solutions. After all, are we really going back to the era of flash drives?As such, the inevitable outcome here is that, eventually, 100% of enterprise workloads will be performed in the cloud. Today, only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud. Thus, this secular cloud growth narrative is only one-fifth done.And that's just the enterprise side of things. Consider that consumers are also increasingly pivoting to the cloud - think Office 365 or Adobe Photoshop. That's an entirely separate yet also very large growth vertical which should keep the entire cloud market on a secular uptrend for the next several years.Consequently, the big growth rates across this industry are here to stay. As they do stick around, cloud stocks will rally and that will drive the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF(NASDAQ:SKYY) significantly higher in the long run.  * 9 Catalysts That Will Drive Chinese Biotech Stocks Much Higher Near term, escalating trade tensions will have a negative impact of enterprise investment levels, which could temporarily weigh on cloud growth rates. But as mentioned earlier, these escalating trade tensions will inevitably cool, meaning that any weakness here and now will be short lived. Instead, the more important implication is that falling rates will keep cloud stocks on a medium-term uptrend. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 22%% off 2019 Highs: 8%The Big Idea: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks are winning investments, and this ETF gives you broad exposure to the world's best SaaS stocks.Key Holdings: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Microsoft and SalesforceThe best way to look at the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV) is as a slightly expanded version of the Cloud Computing ETF. When buying IGV, you get the best cloud stocks, plus other SaaS stocks which are supported by similar secular adoption tailwinds and favorable margin profiles.The big holdings here include Adobe, ServiceNow, Autodesk and Salesforce. What do all these companies have in common? Huge revenue growth, with a majority of that revenue coming from steady subscription models. Big gross margins, which is the result of selling low cost software. And rapidly expanding operating margins, a byproduct of huge revenue growth driving positive operating leverage.Put those three things together and each of these companies is either currently or has the potential to produce huge profits.In other words, the core fundamentals underlying IGV are very strong. Those fundamentals are hardly deterred by the trade war. Yet the ETF is 8% off its 2019 highs. This drop will inevitably pass, especially with rates dropping and IGV will roar higher from here into the end of the year. Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 10%% off 2019 Highs: 15%The Big Idea: The automation trend is choppy, but within the next decade, automated technologies will go from niche to mainstream adoption, implying big growth potential for robotics and automation stocks in the long run -- most of those winning stocks are packaged into this ETF.Key Holdings: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT)Of all the ETFs on this list, the Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO) has been the worst performer in 2019. Every other ETF on this list is beating the market year-to-date, with gains in excess of 14%. ROBO, on the other hand, has under-performed the S&P 500 in 2019, rising just 10% year-to-date.This underperformance won't last for long. The automation trend is admittedly choppy. Technology isn't quite there to justify enterprises spending big on automation… yet. Meanwhile, negative robot stigmas remain in the consumer world, so things like self-driving and robotic vacuum cleaners remain niche… for now.These are temporary phenomena. Eventually, technology will get to a point where automated technologies are good enough (and their value so compelling) that enterprises will pivot wholesale to adopting these technologies. At the same time, there will come a point where things like self-driving have enough evidence of success that consumers will start to trust them in bulk.In other words, it's only a matter of time before the automation wave changes our entire society. When it does, robotics and automation stocks -- like Nvidia, Zebra, Intuitive Surgical and Rockwell -- will soar. All of those stocks are packaged into the ROBO ETF, meaning that ROBO has huge potential long term.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now The trade war is just a hiccup in the secular automation growth narrative. As such, with ROBO down 15% due to trade war noise and near-term growth concerns, now looks like a compelling time to buy into this secular growth ETF. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 20%% off 2019 Highs: 7%The Big Idea: E-commerce and digital services are the future of the consumer economy, and this ETF gives you exposure to all of the most important e-commerce and digital services stocks in the U.S.Key Holdings: Wayfair (NYSE:W), Etsy(NASDAQ:ETSY), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Chegg and AmazonThe internet has connected the world in ways that it's never been connected before. In so doing, it has enabled a new digital economy to emerge, which leverages this unprecedented connectivity to allow consumers to essentially do anything from their computers or phones. Need to buy something? Go on the Amazon app. Need to study something? Go to Chegg.com. Want to sell something? Create an account on Etsy.Pretty much every consumer interaction can now be replicated online. Consumers like this. It's more convenient. They don't have to go to the store to shop. They don't have to go to the library to study.Yet, e-commerce still only represents 10% of total retail sales in the United States, which is considered one of the more deeply e-retail penetrated markets in the world. As such, there's still plenty of room for growth left here, the sum of which should drive e-commerce and digital services stocks -- and the Amplify Online Retail ETF (NASDAQ:IBUY) -- materially higher in the long run.IBUY is presently 7% off its 2019 highs because of this fear that escalating trade tensions will disrupt the global consumer economy and in turn, weigh on e-retail growth rates. That could happen. But things would need to get a lot worse. At present, the U.S. consumer economy is still firing on all cylinders, thanks to sustained healthy labor conditions. The same is true for many other important consumer economies across the world.Consequently, near term weakness in IBUY looks like a long term opportunity. This high-growth ETF should rally into the end of 2019 and over the long run. ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 35%% off 2019 Highs: 6%The Big Idea: The consumer economy is becoming increasingly digital, and as it does, that means payments are becoming increasingly digital, too -- this growth ETF gives you exposure to all the stocks which are powering this global secular pivot to e-payments.Key Holdings: Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), Square (NYSE:SQ), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and PayPalE-commerce is just one part of the digital economy growth narrative. The other part is e-payments. That is, as consumers increasingly pivot into the digital economy, they are simultaneously adopting non-cash payment methods which support digital transactions.In plain English, this translates into &quot;consumers are ditching cash for non-cash payment methods, like cards and e-wallets, because they support digital transactions, which are becoming an increasingly big part of the consumption pie&quot;. This dynamic will persist for the foreseeable future. That means big growth for companies which provide these non-cash payment methods. Such companies include Mastercard, Visa, Square and PayPal. All four of those companies reported payment volume growth of 9% or better last quarter.The Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NASDAQ:IPAY) takes all of these non-cash payment processor stocks and packages them into one asset. Presumably, then, as these stocks all rise concurrently over the next several years with the non-cash payments pivot, IPAY will rise, too.  * 3 Steps Every Investor Should Take Before the Next Stock Market Crash The near term outlook is equally rosy. As is the case with IBUY, IPAY has dropped over the past few trading days over concerns that escalating trade tensions will dampen global consumer enthusiasm. But this isn't happening yet. It will take a lot more for this to happen. Trade tensions are more likely to cool going forward, than they are to heat up. As such, the outlook for payments stocks to rally into the end of 2019 is favorable.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PANW, SPLK, OKTA, UBER, CHGG, NFLX, AMZN, MSFT, ADBE, PYPL, V and SQ.

Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) were up firmly as well, with the former gaining more than 5% after the market closed thanks to record-breaking revenue underscored by raised guidance.There were just too many names like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), though, holding the market back. BofA shares fell a couple of percentage points for no particular reason. Traders are simply concerned about the broad impact of a slowdown, and the rate-cut's potential toll on bank earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered However, headed into Thursday's action, it's the stock charts of NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), D. R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that deserve the closest looks. These are the names closest to critical tipping points, and could be trade-worthy. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Like most other stocks, and tech stocks in particular, Cisco Systems has been beaten up over the course of the past couple of weeks. Already vulnerable to profit-taking, it took little effort to pull the rug out from underneath it and drag CSCO stock under a couple of key moving average lines.That selling came to a halt at a suspiciously encouraging level though. While it's possible more breakdown could be ahead -- and it would be devastating -- the right backdrop could catapult this name higher again in a hurry.  Click to Enlarge  * The floor in question is around $51.20, marked in red on both stock charts. That's where shares bottomed in May, and where the white 200-day moving average line is now.  * Although support has taken shape, there's still danger ahead. The bearish volume is swelling. That's evident on the daily chart, though the weekly chart's falling, sub-zero Chaikin line points to the same undertow.  * Should the floor around $51.20 break, the next most likely support area is just above $40, where Cisco made a couple of key lows last year. D. R. Horton (DHI)The residential construction market is seemingly on the ropes. Home-price appreciation is slowing, and purchases are trending lower. Starts and permits are waffling as well. It doesn't feel like any homebuilding stocks should be doing well.The fact that D. R. Horton is not only surviving but thriving in such an environment, however, speaks volumes about the fact that things may not be as they seem. In fact, an already bullish DHI stock just worked its way into an even more bullish situation.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale   *   Click to EnlargeThe 2018 pullback from D. R. Horton shares, stemming from slowdown worries, has clearly been reversed. In fact, the upside-down head and shoulders pattern suggests DHI just started another bullish leg.  * On the daily chart, shares have repeatedly found support at the gray 100-day and purple 50-day moving average lines. Most of those instances are highlighted.  * Although arguably overbought in the near-term, the volume surge behind the buying in recent days, against a bearish tide, confirms the break above the neckline comes packed with at least a healthy degree of interest. NRG Energy (NRG)In late June, NRG Energy was featured as a name with quite a bit of upside potential. It had just completed a three-bar pattern, indicating a transition from a net-bearish to a net-bullish condition, and there was a massive amount of ground to reclaim.NRG stock even started to reclaim, but that effort petered out fairly early in July. It's what has happened in the meantime -- and yesterday in particular -- that suggests NRG Energy shares are just one more rough day away from stalling their way into a nosedive.  *   Click to EnlargeThe shape of Wednesday's bar is the red flag. It's a tall bar that widely engulfs Tuesday's action, and points it back into the wrong direction. The high-volume, intraday reversal is a hint of what traders think.  * Bolstering the bearish case is how well, and persistently, NRG stock found technical resistance at its purple 50-day moving average line during the latter half of July, and again on Wednesday.  * As the weekly chart shows, this is all just part of a breakdown of an uptrend that had been in place since early 2017. There's not any real technical support again until the $30.30 area.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-08,"Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock saw a brief pop last month thanks to an earnings beat … but can that move in NOK stock last much longer?Source: Shutterstock The release of second-quarter financials on July 25 boosted shares from $5.18 per share up to $5.60 per share. However, since then, Nokia stock has fallen back to about $5.40 share.Increased demand for 5G technology helped improve sales 7% year-over-year. But the company continues to post net losses due to restructuring and impairment charges. With a turnaround still in progress, is NOK worth a buy today?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the company has positive catalysts in the works, Nokia has missed the mark many times in the past. Let's take a closer look, and see if there is additional upside for Nokia stock. NOK Earnings: A Deeper LookThe company's financials are clouded by goodwill impairment and amortization charges. This is primarily related to the company's 2016 merger with Alcatel-Lucent. There are also restructuring charges related to their cost savings plan. With this in mind, let's take a look at the company's adjusted earnings. Adjusted (non-IFRS) operating profits exclude these charges. This provides a clearer picture of Nokia's operating performance. Non-IFRS operating profits were up 35% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) of 0.05 euros were up 67% from the prior year's quarter.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% With annual cost savings of $700 million euros anticipated by 2020, the company has runway to improve operating margins. In terms of organic growth, the 5G revolution provides plenty of gas to grow revenues. Nokia's full-year outlook projects adjusted EPS of 0.25-0.29 euros. The company anticipates additional earnings growth in 2020, with projected adjusted EPS of 0.37-0.42 euros/share for next year.As InvestorPlace contributor James Brumley pointed out last month, Nokia has been landing 5G contracts left and right. NOK has signed over 42 end users, including China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and Sprint (NYSE:S). But the company still needs to execute. This presents a material risk for NOK stock. The company has set up high expectations. If they fail to deliver, new opportunities could dry up, sending NOK shares lower.There are additional risks to consider. As 5G reaches critical mass, competition will likely heat up. The U.S.-China trade war could accelerate, negatively impacting Nokia's business in both countries. But what does this mean for investors entering Nokia stock today? Can they enter the stock at a discount, or will they have to pay a premium? Let's take a look at the valuation of NOK stock, and see how it stacks up to peers. Nokia's ValuationNOK stock currently trades at a trailing twelve month Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 10.1. This is a slight discount to competitors such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which trades at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.8. Nokia stock also trades at a discount other telecom equipment manufacturers. LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), for example, trades at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.6; Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) trades at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.7.It is important to note that NOK has lower EBITDA margins. The company's EBITDA margins are 11.4%, which pales in comparison to both Cisco and Motorola Solutions. Cisco has EBITDA margins of 30.8%. Motorola Solutions has EBITDA margins of 26.2%. However, the company's operating margins are in line with LM Ericsson, which has an EBITDA margin of 9.8%.But is this discount warranted?Nokia has dropped the ball many times in the past. This under-performance has burned contrarian investors trying to call a bottom. Is the 5G revolution Nokia's &quot;this time it's different&quot; moment? The company faces many risks in executing the 5G rollout. But much of this negative sentiment is priced into shares, as seen by the discount to peers. This means investors could see tremendous upside if the company's 5G sales meet expectations.Nokia stock presents a high risk/high return opportunity for investors. But does this make the stock a screaming buy? While the company's future prospects are not set in stone, the positive catalysts in play make this opportunity a strong buy for long-term investors.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale  Bottom Line on NOK StockNokia releases third-quarter earnings in late October. This gives investors several months to enter a position in NOK stock before additional information makes the bull case (or bear case) for shares. NOK trades at a discount to peers. If they can execute 5G successfully, the company's fortunes could materially improve. This would be a shot in the arm for Nokia stock.As it stands now, what's the play with NOK?In the short-term, investors may be not see upside. Shares will likely trade sideways, pending new developments on the 5G front. However, long-term, Nokia may be the right contrarian play in the telecom space. For investors looking for speculative opportunities in large-cap stocks, Nokia stock may just be a buy.As of this writing, Thomas Neil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-09,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Source: Shutterstock Earnings season might be nearing an end, but there are still a few enormous earnings reports on the calendar next week. They represent another test for a broad market still down 3%+ from recent highs. So far, earnings have been solid. Factset Research reported that of the 77% of S&P 500 companies reporting, an impressive 76% beat earnings estimates; 59% posted revenue ahead of expectations. Both figures are roughly in line with trends over the past few years -- during which time U.S. equities have continued to gain. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, the weakness seen of late hasn't come from disappointing earnings. Rather, it has been external factors that have spooked investors. The Federal Reserve didn't cut rates as fast as hoped. The trade war has ramped up.  Those external worries will hang over several key earnings reports next week. That creates a test for the market -- and a way for investors to gauge where the market as a whole might be headed over the rest of the year. Tech giants Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) both report, yet might not be among the companies most likely to move markets next week. Instead, it's going to be the companies most exposed to trade issues, in particular, that likely will garner the headliness. A Chinese giant will give its take on trade, while its numbers might show the health of its country's economy. The largest retailer in the U.S. -- with large exposure to now-increased tariffs -- will show if the American consumer is willing to keep spending up. And yet another leader, in a still-nascent sector, will test investor appetite for risk.  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered It might appear like earnings season is over, and in terms of the number of companies reported, that might be the case. But make no mistake: these three earnings reports could impact the entire market.  Earnings Reports to Watch: Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, August 14, after market close Marijuana stocks have fallen steadily in recent months. And the most valuable company in the space, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), has not been immune. CGC stock has fallen over 35% from late April highs.  Earnings on Wednesday afternoon give Canopy Growth a chance to reverse its slide and potentially boost the sector as a whole. Most companies have disappointed lately, including Canopy itself, whose fiscal Q4 earnings in June were seen as underwhelming. But Aphria (NYSE:APHA) gave the sector a boost with a blowout quarter last week. Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) posted a strong quarter on Thursday, though a post-earnings slide doesn't bode well for the expectations facing Canopy next week. All told, as I wrote on Wednesday, Canopy needs a huge earnings report. The selloff in CRON seems to confirm that sentiment. At this point, strong results would help not only CGC stock, but could change the narrative around the entire industry. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, August 15, before market open It will be interesting to see how much fiscal first-quarter results from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) even matter. As I've noted before, the battle lines on BABA stock are pretty well set. Bulls see an enormous opportunity to own the e-commerce leader in a fast-growing market. Bears see questionable governance, concerns in the ownership structure and a domestic economy set for a &quot;hard landing&quot; at some point. Q1 numbers likely won't be enough to move to either side of the debate. Indeed, even after a big headline beat with Q4 earnings in May, BABA stock continued to slide.  But post-earnings commentary will be closely watched. Can Alibaba calm investor worries about the impact of the trade war on the Chinese economy? If it can, BABA stock can rally -- and it can bring other Chinese issues along with it. Still, at this point, in a suddenly jittery market, that seems like a lot to ask.   * 7 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for Sunny Long-Term Returns And a selloff that follows strong numbers might suggest that investors are heading to the sidelines when it comes to China. That would be a negative signal not only for the likes of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), but China-heavy U.S. companies like Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE).  Walmart (WMT)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, August 15, before market open Retail earnings season kicks off next week, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) the report likely to get the most attention. The company's omnichannel transformation led WMT stock to all-time highs last month. But it has pulled back amid higher tariffs, which should impact pricing, and potentially margins, for the retailing giant. Department stores Macy's (NYSE:M) and JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) also report earnings next week -- and there, too, commentary on tariffs will be closely watched. Strong numbers and an optimistic outlook could drive optimism toward the entire sector as more reports roll in over the following weeks.  But downside guidance -- particularly from Walmart -- could mean there are signs of trouble in U.S. consumer spending. If that's the takeaway from early retail earnings, the ripple effects will extend well beyond the sector. As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-09,"Lately it seems that the turnaround in General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock is on track, but should we believe the hype? The decision is actually quite easy for General Electric stock investors.Source: Shutterstock Since hitting an intermediate peak a bit over three years ago on the heels of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, General Electric continues to demonstrate the once-mighty industrial blue-chip is on the mend. The company's Q2 earnings confessional at the end of July is proof of that.In a nutshell, General Electric delivered a profit and revenue beat for its second quarter, while raising its full-year profit forecast by a nickel to a range of 55 cents to 65 cents per share. The company also offered upwardly revised free cash flow guidance and noted improvements and signs of stabilization in its sluggish power business, which has been a formidable Achilles Heel for GE stock's turnaround story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street's reaction to the report though, proved skeptical. After taking shares to a fleeting marginal five-month high, it has been all downhill. General Electric stock is off roughly 12% and near its three-month lows just several sessions past the earnings event.  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered So, what are today's investors to believe, the quarterly report and GE's update on its business situation? Or is the weak response on the General Electric stock chart to be respected? It's our observation it's time to embrace a turnaround off and on the price chart with shares now strategically positioned for bullish investors. General Electric Stock Daily ChartDespite enjoying a year-to-date gain of around 23%, which rivals its former Dow Jones constituents Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), it hasn't been an easy ride for GE stock bulls. Shares were up as much as 55% in late February. And over the past few months there have been plenty of occasions filled with despair and hope as shares have meandered laterally.In the here and now though, it would be very hard to argue against General Electric stock's bullish positioning. Technically, shares have formed and confirmed a higher low pivot that's nestled across the longer-term 200-day simple moving average. GE's stochastics are also oversold and mostly conducive of buying this past week's pullback into trend support.Ultimately, GE stock offers a low-risk foothold into shares with the potential for outsized returns. If you see the company's turnaround as the real deal and another about-face readying within GE stock's uptrend, a quarter risked is either a great investment or certainly a well-conceived and smart exit strategy.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-12,"China continues affecting global markets in a variety of ways. Today, long-running protests in Hong Kong are being viewed as one of the reasons for another glum performance by U.S. equities.Here's some backstory: Protests have been running for over 10 consecutive weeks in Hong Kong and stem from legislation on mainland China that would provide for the extradition of criminals captured in Hong Kong to China where they would face stiffer punishment. On Monday, protests lead to the cancellation of flights in and out of Hong Kong's airport, one of the busiest in the Asia-Pacific region.For investors in the U.S., the Hong Kong protests are relevant because they are against the backdrop of the U.S.-China imbroglio. China is likely to focus more on cleaning up its own backyard over the near-term than making nice with the U.S. That is concerning for riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now &quot;With Hong Kong protests challenging Beijing's authority and President Xi Jinping's focus, China might not back down in the trade battle when it wants to project strength,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;In a note on Monday, Goldman Sachs says the equity market has priced in a likelihood of a U.S.-China deal at just 13%, down from nearly 80% in April (before talks were scuttled in May). Goldman economists don't expect a trade agreement before the November 2020 U.S. presidential election.&quot;And thus, the Nasdaq Composite slid by 1.20% today while the S&P 500 lost 1.23%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.49% to start the week. Pre-Earnings JittersEarnings season is mostly in the rear view mirror, but there are some Dow components reporting this week and those names were sinking along with the broader market Monday.For example, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest U.S. retailer, lost 2.07% ahead of its Aug. 15 earning report. Analysts are expecting the company to earn $1.21 per share for its most recently completed fiscal quarter, down from $1.29 a share a year earlier.In theory, Walmart should be a valid shelter from the storm play because it's classified as a consumer staples stock, a highly defensive sector. However, the stock is lower by 7% this month because retailers, no matter how large, have significant tariff exposure and they will be forced to pass those higher costs onto shoppers.Shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) lost 1.86% today, extending the month-to-date slide to over 8%. The networking gear giant reports earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 14 with Wall Street expecting EPS of 75 cents, up from 65 cents a year earlier.Earlier today, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $62 price target on Cisco. The analyst &quot;says Cisco's 'accelerating top-line momentum'--driven by product cycles in campus switching and security--as well as a coming product tailwind in Wi-Fi equipment, 'will allow the firm to offset macro headwinds,'&quot; reports Barron's. Pfizer Failure Hurts DowShares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), the largest U.S. pharmaceuticals stock, slid 2.64%, ranking as the fourth worst-performing member of the Dow today. Pfizer is down more than 15% month-to-date, belying its normally defensive reputation. There are reasons for long-term investors to like Pfizer stock. Actually, lots of reasons. The yield of almost 4% is hard to ignore in this environment, but Pfizer's chart is a mess, indicating better pricing could be available soon. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayThe following factoids are brief, but are revealing about the current state of affairs for equities. It is only slight hyperbole to say everyone is piling into gold and gold ETFs and it is no exaggeration to say major banks are raising price targets on bullion.And while stocks with the low volatility designation (real estate, utilities, etc.) are looking expensive, data suggest investors don't care. Over the past 90 days, the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPLV) has taken in $1.02 billion in new assets, nearly quadruple the amount of the issuer's second-best ETF over that same period.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-13,"Editor's note: &quot;5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.If you're like me, the current bout of trade-induced volatility isn't sitting too right. And while swings and bear markets are a part of investing, the kind of big plunges we've recently seen does make for some sleepless nights. Which is why the best stocks to buy could be America's blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks don't necessarily have a formal definition, but they are generally stable and well-established companies. Blue-chip stocks are typically household names with billions in revenues and steady rising profit profiles. Often, they share the wealth with their investors via rich dividend and buyback programs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The best part is that investors can count on blue-chip stocks to help them get through periods of malaise and bear markets as they tend to be less volatile than let's say, smaller growth stocks. To that end, with the markets starting to feel a bit shaky, blue-chip stocks could be the best way to position your portfolio in the upcoming months.But which blue-chip stocks make sense to buy? Here are five that could help you get through the next few months and an upcoming bear market. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The technology sector is often seen as a growth element for a portfolio. However, the sector does feature plenty of blue-chip stocks that produce mountains of cash flows, steady dividends, and rising profits. Case in point, former dot-com darling Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).Source: Shutterstock After building the internet and networking with its focus on switching gear and routers, CSCO made the smart pivot into services and reoccurring revenues. It basically created the model that many tech firms have copied.And in doing that, Cisco has become a cash generation machine. Last quarter alone, the firm managed to produce more than $3.5 billion in free cash flows.The best part is that CSCO continues to share that cash with investors. The firm recently raised its dividend by 6% and added another $15 billion to its authorized buyback program.And yet, more could be in store for Cisco. The firm continues to add new capabilities to its services platform and recently unveiled new conversational A.I. to its interfaces. Adding in continued data center demand as well as the pending 5G upgrades and Cisco continues to look great.For investors looking for a strong tech sector blue-chip stock, Cisco has to be your top pick. Merck (MRK)The steadfastness of the healthcare sector makes it a prime place to find plenty of blue-chip stocks. And one of the best could be pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK).For starters, MRK features a wide portfolio of current and former blockbuster drugs, vaccines and other therapies. This huge portfolio continues to drive profits and cash flows at the giant. But MRK isn't resting on its laurels. A few years ago, Merck made the shift into newer biotech and advanced cancer-fighting medications. That has turned out to be the right move.MRK's Keytruda has quickly become the go-to medicine for a variety of lung cancers and sales going through the roof. Last quarter alone, the company reported more than $2.2 billion in Keytruda sales.That double-digit growth has allowed Merck to up its total forecast and guidance for the entire year.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The growth of Keytruda could continue. Merck has begun several trials looking to use the drug in other indications. This could provide even more cash flowing Merck's way. Considering the growth of its cancer portfolio and the rest of its steady drug options, Merck is looking like a great buy for the long haul.In the end, MRK's 2.5% yield and continued growth make it a powerful blue-chip stock for any investor. American Express Company (AXP)One of Warren Buffett's favorite blue-chip stocks happens to be American Express (NYSE:AXP). And the Oracle of Omaha isn't wrong to own it. The financial powerhouse has continued to thrive in the rising economy and has a lot to offer investors.Source: Shutterstock AXP is kind of a weird bird. Like its rivals, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) (two blue-chip stocks also worth owning), American Express operates a secured payment network and acts as a toll road when customers swipe their cards. Here, Amex scores a hefty fee.The firm's discount revenue rate was last quarter was 2.37%. Basically, for every $100 spent on its cards, $2.37 flowed back to AXP. All in all, last quarter, American Express pulled in more than $6.2 billion in revenue from these operations.Secondly, unlike V and MA, American Express is an issuer of its cards. Because of this, it's able to score hefty membership fees, interest and creates a leverage effect for its profits. Moreover, Amex's entire M.O. is about rewards and its partners pay the credit issuer plenty of fees to get their products/offers onto AXP's platform.The best part is that AXP tends to focus on the higher end of the credit spectrum. This removes many of the uncertainty and issues with offering loans and reduces default rates.All of this has made American Express a powerhouse in the financial sector. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Sixty-three years. That's an amazing streak for any firm to consistently raise its dividend. But for blue-chip stock Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), it's just par for the course. The secret lies with the firm's massive and irreplaceable moat.Source: Shutterstock There's a good chance that you've never walked into one of GPC's locations, but your mechanic has. Under the NAPA banner, the firm operates one of the largest networks of auto parts and industrial distribution locations in the nation.Those 9,250 locations are located pretty much everywhere, and that's key. Auto parts are generally a &quot;need it now&quot; sort of item and are pretty much immune from the whims of online sales.Because of this huge network, GPC and NAPA are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to getting parts to body shops, mechanics and service centers. This has been beyond good for GPC's bottom line over the years. In its 90-year history, sales have increased in 85 of those years.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What This streak was continued last year as GPC recorded more than $18.7 billion in revenues. Analysts predict that revenues will jump by about 4% this year. Naturally, those sales have turned into profits and a long streak of dividend increase for investors.This consistency has made GPC one of the best blue-chip stocks to own for the long haul. Coca-Cola (KO)When it comes to blue-chip stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) could be the bluest. Its brand is worldwide and is enjoyed millions of times daily. This has allowed KO to pay a constantly rising dividend for the last 55 years and provide plenty of ballast to a portfolio in markets just like today.Source:  Chris Nielsen via FlickrAnd there is still growth to be had.Coke has moved into new beverage categories as tastes have changed. Sparkling water, juices, teas, and other healthy drinks are now on a menu at the firm.And these items continue to grow, with revenues for these products now accounting for about half of KO's total pie. Meanwhile, KO has improved margins via new packaging designs and sizes. Adding in some tech -- such as its Arctic Coolers and Freestyle machines -- and Coke seems to be winning the beverage wars.The proof is in the pudding. Continued product mix development has resulted in a big 5% jump in revenues last quarter. Likewise, earnings saw a big surge and KO has managed to produce roughly $6.28 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.Yes, KO is boring. But that's what exactly what investors should be looking for in a blue-chip stock. Consistency, with a touch of growth. If that doesn't describe Coca-Cola, then I don't know what does.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-08-13,"(Bloomberg) -- An Indian startup that aims to use artificial intelligence to deliver faster and more personalized customer support for corporate clients is raising $51 million in funding from investors including March Capital Partners and Chiratae Ventures.Uniphore Software Systems Pvt, based in Chennai and Palo Alto, Calif., plans to use the emerging technology to change the labor-intensive business of call centers, displacing workers with machines. Former Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Chambers’ JC2 Ventures owns about 10% of the startup. Existing backers also include Analog Devices Inc. founder Ray Stata and Infosys Ltd. billionaire co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan.Umesh Sachdev, 33, founded the company in 2008 with his engineering classmate Ravi Saraogi. They are competing with technology giants like Google, Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. as well as at least a dozen AI startups to automate the $350 billion call center industry, helping agents deliver more useful support while decreasing the number of infuriating and ineffectual experiences.“This is one of the largest rounds in an area of deep tech already seeing a lot of investor activity,” CEO Sachdev said in a telephone interview. “It represents the coming of age of conversational AI.”He declined to reveal the startup’s valuation, but said it is “one step away from turning into a unicorn,” the tech industry’s term for a value of $1 billion or more.Voice bots and automated messaging systems are already changing the world of call centers, and experts reckon the majority of human workers will be driven to obsolescence by artificial intelligence. By 2021, about 70% of organizations will integrate AI to assist employee productivity, researcher Gartner Inc forecast earlier this year.Using messaging apps, chatbots and speech-based assistants, so-called conversational artificial intelligence automates communication and delivers personalized experiences. “Virtual agents are gaining ubiquity via smartphones and messaging platforms to support customer care, marketing and employee efficiency,” said Dan Miller, the lead analyst with Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Opus Research.Sachdev estimates that the U.S. alone has 3.9 million call center workers and those numbers will steadily diminish as companies adopt new technologies. “Humans will shift from taking mundane calls to enhancing knowledge and teaching AI what is the good answer and how to resolve issues,” he said.Uniphore will use the funds to hire talent, invest in research and development and accelerate expansion, particularly in its primary market in North America. The startup plans to increase its engineering and development operations to 200 employees in India by the year end, while another 60 will be based in the U.S. and 40 in Europe and Asia Pacific. Its customers include BNP Paribas SA, Genpact Ltd., NTT Data Corp., and PNB MetLife.“Indian entrepreneurs are going from slow-followers to fast-innovators,” said Chambers in an interview earlier this year, explaining why he’s backing Uniphore. “I see a young breed of founders who are hungry for a piece of the future.”To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",33-Year-Old Founder Raises $51 Million to Add AI to Call Centers

2019-08-14,"It was a wicked Wednesday as stocks tumbled amid mounting concerns that some major global economies, including the U.S., are flirting with recessions. Adding to the recession concerns, there was another instance of yield curve inversion today.For those not familiar with the vernacular, yield curve inversion is an instance of 10-year Treasury yields dipping below those on 2-year notes. This has happened several times this year. Over the course of history, such inversions have proven to be reliable harbingers of looming economic contraction.Speaking of contracting, that's exactly what Germany's economy, the Eurozone's largest, is doing which adds to risk-off pall cast over global equity markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul &quot;Germany's economy shrank 0.1 percent from April through June and has been treading water for the last year, the government's official statistics agency said. Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted that the economy will shrink during the current quarter as well, meeting the technical definition of a recession,&quot; reports The New York Times.Here in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.02% while the S&P 500 sank nearly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.05%.In the category of &quot;what a difference a day makes,&quot; yesterday I had the privilege of saying that all 30 Dow stocks traded higher. Today, I'm sad to report that in late trading, all 30 Dow components were in the red. Dow Winners In Short SupplyToday was one of those days when it's more about highlighting the best of the worst Dow stocks, not the biggest winners, because there weren't any winners to speak of. In late trading, just five Dow members were sporting losses of less than 1%.One of those names was Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The nation's largest retailer reports earnings tomorrow and in what could prove to be some much-needed good news, analysts are speculating that if Walmart beats, it could boost guidance.&quot;E-commerce sales performance in the U.S. will be closely watched. Telsey Advisory estimates a 37% year-over-year gain, which would match the first-quarter growth. Bank of America is looking for a 35% advance, and Tesley predicts a rise of at least 30%,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;In addition, analysts may have lingering questions around tariffs, even as the Trump administration said Tuesday it will delay until mid-December the 10% tariff on some Chinese products.&quot;I recently explored the long-term potential of Walmart's e-commerce efforts here. Consumer Staples Hold UpAs for the other members of today's least-bad group, a couple of those were consumer staples names, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Given the risk-off tenor to the day, it wasn't surprising to see these stocks hold up, relatively speaking.However, there may another force at play. Historical data suggest that after yield curve inversion, the best-performing sectors are utilities and consumer staples. However, those historical anecdotes are not always all-encompassing. Just look at Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), shares of which slid 5.01% today. Dow Warning SignsCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports earnings after the bell today, but some investors departed the name in advance of that report as highlighted by the stock's 4% tumble today. Laboring around the $50-$51 area, this report is critical for Cisco's near-term fortunes. A move to the mid-$40s seems almost as likely as jump to the mid-$50s.There is also growing sentiment that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the Dow's best stock in August and one of the index's top performers this year, could be ready to decline, but that seems to be a technical bet, not a commentary on the stock's underlying fundamentals. DJIA Bottom LineI cannot confirm that a recession is imminent and it should be noted that the yield curve inversion, while reliable, is not 100% accurate. Nor am I glossing over the weakness in stocks, but historical data also confirm that the third quarter (August in particular) is usually unkind to equities.Perhaps the best strategy for the rest of this month and into September is to keep some cash on the sidelines and wait for more attractive opportunities to come available, particularly if the best defensive sectors can do is decline less than their high beta counterparts.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-14,"What a beating bulls are taking on Wednesday. Just a day after the markets were jumping higher on delayed tariffs, they're down much more as the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield curve inverted. Let's look at some top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)Almost a year after falling apart, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is still trying to find its footing. Shares are dangling by a thread at $148, a level that marks the August lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul Below this level immediately opens up NVDA stock to a possibly decline down to $144. Below that and the support range between $130 and $135 is on the table.If $148 holds, bulls will need to see Nvidia reclaim the 50-day and 200-day moving averages near $159 and $162 before shares look better on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Alphabet (GOOGL)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is perched in a precarious spot. The stock is resting right on uptrend support (blue line), which has been in place since the June lows.If support holds, look to see that GOOGL reclaims the 20-day moving average and 38.2% retracement. If it fails, Alphabet looks attractive near $1,140. There it will have the 50% retracement, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages just below.If the stock really craters, a dip into the $1,000 to $1,020 area has been a good buy zone for GOOGL. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Cisco (CSCO)Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is sitting in a very right-or-wrong position as range support sits between $50 and $51. It helps that the 200-day moving average is at $50.60 as well. The 38.2% retracement is just above this mark as well.See what I mean? Either support holds and Cisco bounces, or it fails and lower prices will be ushered in.Below this range could trigger a decline down to the 50% retracement near $49.25-ish. Below that and the 61.8% retracement near $47 could be in play.If support holds, a bounce up the 20-day moving average is the first upside target, while the 50-day moving average is the second target.Making it all that much trickier? Cisco reports after the bell. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: The RealReal (REAL)The breakdown in The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) showed itself a few days ago, when support gave away as downtrend resistance was squeezing it lower. Wednesday's 15% post-earnings beating only worsens the loss, as REAL is now well below its $20 IPO price.From an investment standpoint, perhaps investors may start to find The RealReal attractive. From a trading perspective, it's anything but.Bulls need to wait for a reversal to take place in REAL. Ideally, shares will trade below the daily low and reverse higher, closing above those prior lows. A higher open that fails to take out the lows makes the rally somewhat suspect, but not impossible.Give this one some more time to set up if you're trading it, particularly in this current environment. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Talend (TLND)Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) has been a beast on Wednesday, rallying 1% in the face of a big market decline.Shares continue to trade really well this month, gapping up over downtrend resistance (purple line), and maintaining above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.A close over $40 likely kickstarts a rally up to the 200-day moving average. If short-term uptrend support fails (blue line) and TLND trades below $38, look for moving average support to buoy the name.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-14,"The wait for Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock to gain traction continues. A second-quarter earnings and revenue beat sent its shares surging higher. However, Nokia stock has almost fallen back to the $5.20 per share level where it traded before the company released its quarterly report.Source: Shutterstock NOK can benefit tremendously from the adoption of 5G. But until the company delivers profits and increases investors' confidence, Nokia stock will struggle. Reinvention, Low Valuation Have Not Helped Nokia StockThanks to its purchase of Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Nokia has reinvented itself as a telecom-equipment maker. Consequently, Nokia's equipment has helped facilitate the transition to 5G service. While NOK's reinvention should have helped Nokia stock, that hasn't been the case so far.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn January 14, 2016, the day of the Alcatel deal, Nokia traded at an adjusted price of $6.39 per share. Today, Nokia stock sells for around $5.22 per share, meaning that NOK has lost more than 16% of its value in the last 3.5 years.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul After the downturn, NOK is a reasonably-priced stock. The decline has taken its forward price-earnings (PE) ratio to about 13. Analysts' average estimate predicts that Nokia's profit won't rise this year. However, the average estimates  call for an earnings increase of 51.9% next year and average annual profit growth of 23.9% over the next five years,  as more consumers and businesses begin to use  5G.Unfortunately, NOK stock has burned investors before. Of course, Nokia was blindsided by the advent of the smartphone. I have recommended NOK repeatedly, only to always see it fail to gain traction. Those who listened to me have collected a dividend, but Nokia stock has not delivered  a sustained rally. Can Nokia Stock Finally Recover?So what will boost Nokia stock? InvestorPlace contributor Thomas Niel believes NOK will not move much in the near-term. However, he also thinks &quot;new developments on the 5G front&quot; could turn into the catalyst Nokia needs.But telecom companies  can turn to equipment makers besides NOK, including  Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR).NOK traded above $60 during the height of the dot-com bubble. It surpassed $40 per share in 2007 when its share of the cell phone market was 49.4%. That year, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduction of the iPhone pushed NOK into a descent from which it never recovered. As a result,  confidence in Nokia has dropped. The company will need to restore that confidence if it wants to spark  a recovery in NOK stock. Should Investors Buy NOK?I see no evidence that Nokia will become the leader of the telecom-equipment sector. Most other investors probably feel the same way For this reason, NOK stock has traded between the high-$3s per share and the high $8s per share range since 2013. Given this pattern, investors can probably forget about NOK stock reaching $40 or $60 anytime soon.However, once 5G is adopted more extensively, Nokia stock could break out of its current range. Historically, NOK has traded at an average P/E ratio of 25.3.  If NOK meets analysts' average 2019 EPS estimate of 27 cents, and its PE multiple rises to its historic average of 25.3,  NOK stock price would reach $6.83. If its 2020 EPS reaches the average estimate of 41 cents per share, and its PE ratio rises to 25.3,  the stock price would reach $10.37.If NOK, boosted by the 5G revolution  finds a way to beat the average estimates,  the long-awaited recovery of Nokia stock could finally materialize.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-15,"A day after stocks were slammed, the major U.S. equity benchmarks struggled for direction Thursday. After some of the volatility investors have recently been coping with, today's lethargy was arguably a welcomed respite.If anything today's action was surprisingly positive when considering trade tensions are still commanding headlines. Earlier this week, there was some thawing in trade hostilities when the U.S. pledged to back off imposing tariffs set to go into effect in early September until mid-December. Additionally, it looked like the U.S. and China would at least entertain good faith talks ahead of negotiations slated to commence in a couple of weeks.However, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said today that China can seek sanctions against the U.S. for tariffs already being applied to Chinese imports. Predictably, the U.S. doesn't agree with the WTO and is vowing to appeal the ruling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall China is not being shy about its plans to retaliate against the U.S. should any new duties against its goods be applied next month, so trade does remain a pivotal factor for investors to watch in the coming weeks.With those factors in mind, the Nasdaq Composite losing 0.09% and the S&P 500 adding just 0.25% were performances that weren't too shabby. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 0.39%, but again, that's OK given recent showings. Dow Earnings StoriesEarnings season is in its latter stages, but there were a couple of notable reports out today from Dow components. Starting with the better of the two, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) surged 6.13% on volume that was more than double the daily average, after the largest U.S. retailer reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.27, beating Wall Street's forecast by five cents.The company also said same-store sales rose 2.8%, beating the estimate of 2.07% growth. Importantly, there was some good news on the online front, too.&quot;Online sales surged 37%, in line with the previous quarter's increase and higher than the company's expectation of 35%,&quot; according to Reuters. &quot;Walmart's online expansion has come at a cost to profitability and losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.&quot;While Walmart was one of the Dow's best performers today, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of the worst, slumping 8.61% on volume that was more than double the daily average in what was one of the stock's worst intraday showings in several years.Cisco gave tepid guidance for the current quarter, prompting a spate of bearish responses by sell-side analysts. At least three analysts lowered price targets on Cisco, with one warning the company may need to rein spending on stock buybacks unless it wants to take on more debt. DJIA Bottom Line: Glimmers of HopeI'll repeat what I frequently say, that being that one decent day or not-so-bad day doesn't make a trend, but there some positive vibes to consider. For one, none other than Warren Buffett continues piling into bank stocks, a group that has been battered in recent weeks.That's relevant in this space because financial services account for 15% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index's third-largest sector weight behind technology and industrials.Second, consumer data in the U.S. remains buoyant, arguably too buoyant to signal an imminent recession. Yes, inverted yield curves cannot simply be glossed over, but nor can consumer spending, and its current pace, consumer data isn't flashing recession warning signs. Just two of the Dow's consumer-sensitive stocks closed lower today and one of those was Walgreens Boost Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a name that has been a dog and locked in a bear market for much of this year.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-15,"It's no shocker, but Thursday has been another volatile trading session. Following Wednesday's action -- where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3% -- it was a mixed session in the stock market today. It wasn't exactly the rebound that bulls were hoping to muster given the massive declines experienced a day prior.The stock market got off to a quick rally on the day, took an afternoon spill and then regained its footing. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) rallied roughly 0.4%, the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) was mostly flat and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) finished higher by about 0.6%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Movers in the Stock Market TodayShares of Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) erupted almost 70% to just over $14 after it was announced that VMWare (NYSE:VMW) intends to acquire the company at $15 per share. The interesting thing is that VMW -- which is down about 7% on the announcement -- is trying to get Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) to exchange its B shares for A shares.General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock fell quite a bit on the day, although recovered off its lows. Shares finished lower by over 11% after a whistleblower called GE &quot;meritless&quot; for hiding financial problems. Accounting issues are never a good sign, and it's no wonder investors sold the stock as a result. However, management has already disputed the claim, calling it market manipulation.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) took it on the chin Thursday, falling over 8% after disappointing quarterly results. While earnings and revenue results came in ahead of expectations, guidance came up a bit short. The stock blew through all sorts of significant support levels, leaving CSCO stock flailing in no man's land. Macro headwinds continue to create problems for U.S. companies and Cisco is the latest one.Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) initially jumped 5% in early Thursday trading. However, the stock closed higher by about 3% after a late-session jump. The action comes after Alibaba reported a top- and bottom-line beat and showed strength in its underlying business. Analysts liked the quarter too, praising the results and maintaining price targets significantly above current levels.(Here's how to trade Alibaba, by the way).What Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) investors would give to have the same post-earnings reaction as Alibaba. Shares are getting crushed Thursday, down about 15% after an earnings and revenue miss. A loss of $3.70 per share took investors by huge surprise, thanks to extinguishing warrants with Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ).However, management did not provide an adjusted earnings result, causing concern and confusion among investors. Revenue came up short too. It was a lose-lose report and now shares are at their lowest point since the start of 2019.The demand for bonds remains intense, as the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) continues to press higher. The ETF hit a new 52-week high on Thursday and the upside volatility continues to cause investor concern in the equity market in the short term. Key Levels to Watch  Above is a chart of the SPY ETF, representing the S&P 500. With Thursday's afternoon decline, the August lows near $281.72 were almost tested. Buyers stepped in early enough to prevent it, but many traders are hesitant to buy without the SPY not testing the 200-day moving average.A test of the 200-day would &quot;clear the air&quot; for a lot of investors, so to speak. It would also give investors a pullback down to the 38.2%. Seeing how SPY reacts to this level would help investors gauge what type of environment we're working with.The 20-day is now below the 50-day moving average, indicating that the short-term trend is now more bearish. If the August lows hold, see if the SPY can reclaim the 100-day moving average (not shown above) at $239.40.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. plummeted the most in almost six years after the company gave a lackluster sales forecast, indicating the U.S.-China trade dispute and a slowing global economy are leading customers to delay updates of their computer networks.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins is trying to turn Cisco into more of a software and services company, but the transformation is being stymied by the trade war and its impact on corporate spending. The company still gets the majority of sales from machines that are the backbone of the internet, making it an economic bellwether. The CEO said some customers are showing more caution because of escalating trade tensions.“They’re just hedging their bets relative to some resolution on this stuff,” Robbins said. “We did see in July some slight early indications of some macro shifts that we didn’t see in the prior quarter.” Robbins said Wednesday.Cisco shares declined 8.6% to $46.25 at the close in New York, the biggest single-day fall since November 2013. It was the worst performer Thursday on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Even with Thursday’s drop, the stock has gained 6.7% this year.Cisco said sales in the fiscal first quarter will be flat to an increase of as much as 2% from the period a year earlier. That implies revenue of as little as $12.9 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $13.4 billion. Adjusted profit will be 80 cents to 82 cents a share, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement.In the fourth quarter, which ended July 27, total orders were unchanged. Emerging markets bookings were down and the Asia Pacific region saw a decline of 8%, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said on a conference call with analysts.While Cisco gets less than 3% of revenue from China, business there has dropped “dramatically,” Robbins said. State-owned enterprises and some Chinese telecom providers that had used small amounts of Cisco machinery are not interested in bids from the company amid the current trade tension, he explained.Fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.2 billion, or 51 cents a share, from $3.8 billion, or 81 cents, a year earlier. Revenue was $13.4 billion, a seventh quarterly expansion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 83 cents a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 82 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Orders in the Americas and Europe increased, albeit slowly. Bookings from service providers, such as telecom and cable-TV operators, slumped 21%, while government and commercial customers sought more gear than they had a year earlier, Cisco said.Cable companies aren’t buying new equipment -- instead, they’re trying to wring as much life as they can out of their existing gear, Robbins said in an interview. The phone-service providers are spending on consumer 5G, or fifth generation, networks. These customers will shift investment to Cisco’s gear, which lives in their data centers, when they’re deploying business services on those new networks that require greater traffic management, he said.Robbins said he sees little need for concern that the overall economy is about to drop.“There’s a lot of geopolitical dynamics, and I’ve said multiple times that I’ve been shocked how well the macro has held up,” he said. “In most of the world it wasn’t terrible at all. I would not make it a broad-based assertion yet.”In the recent period, Cisco’s hardware business generated sales of $7.88 billion, a gain of 6%. Applications, its software unit, was up 11% at $1.49 billion and security revenue jumped 14% to $714 million.Cisco is the biggest maker of routers, switches and other gear used to connect computers. The company gets a tiny percentage of sales from China, where it’s been largely locked out of the market. Almost 60% of revenue comes from the Americas region.Under Robbins, Cisco has made a string of acquisitions to build a software and services business. Earlier this month, it announced plans to buy closely held Voicea, a maker of software that provides real-time transcription and voice search capabilities.Cisco is still buying hardware companies, too. In July, it agreed to acquire Acacia Communications Inc. for about $2.6 billion, gaining chips and machines that help translate optical signals into electronic data.(Updates with share price in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Falls on Lackluster Sales Forecast Amid Trade Concerns

2019-08-15,"Yesterday the stock markets fell 3% on headlines, and that is always a time to find great stocks to buy on dips. The stock markets have been in headline trading mode for months. This week we got several reminders of that -- and of how excellent homework can fall hostage to surprise headlines.First there were China currency threats, then videos of the protests in Hong Kong. Just when the markets recovered from those, yesterday the stocks fell off a cliff on the news that the yield curve had inverted. This merely means that the two-year treasuries yield more than the 10-year. Consensus is that once that happens, a recession is likely to follow within 12 to 18 months.The reasoning there is that banks borrow on short-term rates to lend on longer-term rates. So if it is more expensive for them to do this, then banks would stop lending. Consequently, businesses could not borrow to grow and consumers would buy fewer houses, etc.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut there is also growing consensus that this time it's different. The global bond market makeups have never been like this. They have changed dramatically in the last few years, as now we have a giant chunk in negative territory.My point is that there are no real experts here on the subject, so it's best to stick to what we know. There are good stocks to buy on this dip just based on their own profit and loss statements, balance sheets and charts. Today I concentrate on three that qualify as a good knives to catch on dips like this one. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall This is not to say that these are the only three stocks I would pick. There are hundreds of great companies getting punished for no fault of their own. Caution is warranted though. For example, last night Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported and the stock fell on the headline. Although it too can be a good entry point, CSCO management gave us some reasons to doubt its stock for at least for a few more days.Google, Apple, and J&J had no incremental bad news this week yet their stocks are falling fast. Stocks to Buy on the Dips: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com The proof is in the pudding, and owning GOOGL stock has been very profitable over the years. I remember the days when I discussed entry around $90 per share, and that was before the split.Alphabet stock here is not bloated from a valuation perspective. It sells at a reasonable 24 trailing price-to-earnings ratio and 5 times sales. In addition, it has $130 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and little debt.GOOGL stock has the support of its business model. This is a company that dominates one of the strongest trends of going online. So it has at least one massive cash cow and many others developing -- mainly YouTube and its autonomous car subsidiary Waymo. Both still have tremendous income potential.Moreover, Alphabet has a fortress of balance sheet which allows it to hunker down in case the difficult times do hit. It can then finance evasive actions that are necessary in order to defend its business or its stock.It is also important to note that so far, Alphabet has done minimal financial engineering to prop up the GOOGL stock prices. This could be an incremental bid into the GOOGL stock. Apple (AAPL)Source: Apart / Shutterstock.com Apple is a stock that almost always gets less respect than it deserves. I, too, am guilty of dissing its current management for their lack of innovation. Maybe it's the wow factor we are missing.My criticism of the leadership doesn't mean I don't like the company fundamentals. In fact, this is a bulletproof stock in the long run. It has an incredible profit and loss statement, and a decent balance sheet. I say only decent even though they have a ton of cash on hand because since Tim Cook took it over, he piled on the debt.The excuse was that it is cheap to borrow and the returns that they get from their performance justifies the actions. I don't agree but that's a difference of opinion. I would have rather see them use the cash to buy new income streams like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) does.Nevertheless for the long-term, the Apple business model is still an incredible one. It has an unbelievably loyal clientele who almost never complains about price. Moreover it is making the shift into the new way of doing business, which is subscription models. For that, they have a huge base of current users and it would be as easy as turning on a faucet.This makes AAPL stock less sensitive to the unit sales. It is no longer an iPhone company for now. The important part is that they continue on this journey while they find new ways to monetize  clients.Meanwhile Apple stock recently had a few sharp drops. But Tuesday 5% rally was emphatic to erase them. Yes, they gave half of it back the next day, but AAPL stock, unlike the market, did not trend down all day. It's almost as if investors decided it had hit a short-term balance level.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul If I'm buying Apple stock here, my goal is not to profit in a week. This is a long-term core holding for any portfolio. Since they don't ring bells at tops and bottoms, I consider this a decent opportunity to buy Apple stock on the massive stock market uncertainties. AAPL sells at a 17 trailing P/E and 3.5 times sales. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com This has been a household name for more than a century. JNJ stock -- and the company -- are proven winners. They continue to flourish through all prevailing trends. Sure they've had their fair share of headline scares, but over the years it's almost inevitable, especially for consumer companies.So this is where homework is crucial. JNJ stock sells at a 22 trailing P/E and 4.2 times sales. This is not cheap, but it's not bloated either. Over the past five years, JNJ stock teetered around $125 per share. So as it falls into this area again, these zones are usually support because bulls and bears will fight over them again.There is technical risk. If JNJ loses that pivot level then it could retest $115 per share. Although it is not a forecast, it is a bearish scenario that exists below.I cannot confirm that JNJ stock is as cheap as it's going to be. But I can confirm that it probably won't matter. In the long run, I am confident that holding Johnson & Johnson stock is likely to have more upside potential than downside risk from these levels.The idea of buying stocks on dips is almost never going to be perfect. But here's an emphatic statement: If the stock markets are higher in the future then so are GOOGL, AAPL and JNJ stock.Nevertheless, since we still have a slew of geopolitical risk booming, I don't enter trades in full size today. It is always best to take positions in tranches, which leaves room for adjustments wherever necessary.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.73%.Yesterday's panic in the options pit resulted in eye-popping activity. Put trading rocketed to the moon with 27.6 million contracts traded. Calls were left in the dust but still saw above-average volume at 23 million contracts for the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSimilar action at the CBOE drove the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.84 -- its second-highest reading of the year. The 10-day moving average jumped to a new high for 2019 at 0.76.Options traders zeroed in on earnings reports yesterday. Macy's (NYSE:M) plunged on terrible results and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is aiming for a large down gap after a sad showing of its own. Elsewhere, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) saw heavy options trading during yesterday's swoon.Let's take a closer look: Macy's (M)Macy's shares plunged 13% yesterday after delivering yet another disappointing earnings report. The dismal data weighed heavily on the entire retail sector driving the S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) down just under 4% on the session.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul For the second quarter, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based department store saw earnings per share down over 50% year-over-year to 28 cents. Revenue came in at $5.55 billion. Both measures missed analyst forecasts, and the ire of disgruntled traders was on full display.M stock is now down 77% from its 2015 peak. Its price trend is bearish with descending moving averages across the board. Any time signs of a bottom emerge, an earnings announcement inevitably arrives to upend everything. Heed the message of the chart and steer clear of bullish plays.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts on the day. Activity swelled to 830% of the average daily volume, with 190,069 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 57% of the session's sum.Implied volatility remains lofty, despite a small post-earnings volatility crush. At 51% it sits at the 70th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 54 cents or 3.2%. Cisco (CSCO)Cisco Systems shares fell 7% after hours following an underwhelming earnings report of its own. Weakness in China was partly to blame for the company's disappointing forward guidance. For its fiscal fourth quarter, the technology giant posted earnings of $3.6 billion, or 83 cents a share, on revenue of $13.43 billion. Both measures topped analyst estimates, but investors found the company's forecasts worrisome.With this morning's drop, CSCO stock will open just under $47, well below its 200-day moving average. The sucker punch is giving back much of this year's gains and places Cisco deep into correction territory. Until the trend turns, rallies are suspect, and sellers hold the upper hand.On the options trading front, traders favored calls ahead of the report. Total activity jumped to 572% of the average daily volume, with 214,998 contracts traded; 73% of the trading came from call options alone.The options board was pricing in a move of $2.76 or 5.5%, so this morning's 7% plunge exceeds expectations and will deliver profits to long volatility strategies like straddles and strangles. Bank of America (BAC)The specter of a recession continues to hamper bank stocks. An inverted yield curve and plunging bond yields create a toxic backdrop for stocks like Bank of America. Its shares fell to a seven-month low amid massive distribution on Wednesday. Its peak-to-trough drawdown is now -15%, and BAC stock is on the verge of breaching a key support zone.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy Now for the Future While the stock is becoming desperately oversold in the short run, future bounces are born to be sold. There's simply too much overhead resistance at this point to comfortably bet on buyers.On the options trading front, calls proved more popular than puts despite the nasty price puke. Total activity popped to 251% of the average daily volume, with 640,676 contracts traded.The increased demand drove implied volatility up to 35%, pushing to the 54th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares sank on Thursday, after the company gave a first-quarter outlook that was below expectations, pressured by macroeconomic headwinds, including the U.S.-China trade war.The Chinese market was seen as a major factor behind weakness in service-provider orders, and Morgan Stanley wrote that “outsized” macro headwinds “were too much to provide much opportunity for upside.” The firm was one of at least six to trim its price target on the stock.Shares fell as much as 8% in its biggest one-day percentage loss since May 2017. Closing with a decline of that magnitude would represent Cisco’s worst session since November 2013, according to historical data compiled by Bloomberg. At current levels, Cisco is trading at its lowest level since February, and it has dropped more than 18% from a peak in July.Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:Morgan Stanley, James Faucette“The outsized headwinds” in service-provider orders, along with weakness in China and other emerging markets, “were too much to provide much opportunity for upside” to the quarter.The current valuation is “appropriate.” While the macroeconomic environment is worsening, Cisco’s cash flow gives it flexibility to make acquisitions or return cash to shareholders.Equal-weight rating, price target trimmed to $49 from $51.Jefferies, George NotterInvestors are likely “over-estimating the size of the negative top line growth inflection.”“Cisco has traditionally been very conservative when they’ve reduced expectations,” and historically, “upsets relative to consensus have been followed by several quarters of outperformance.”The outlook “likely contains a healthy dose of conservativism,” but there isn’t much “octane” in the stock right now.Buy rating, price target lowered to $54 from $62.JMP Securities, Erik Suppiger“Orders were flat Y/Y, the worst performance in two years.”About 70% of the company’s software revenue was generated from subscriptions, “suggesting that the company is executing on its strategy of becoming a provider of software and services.”Market-perform rating.Piper Jaffray, James FishThe results were “fine overall,” although the softness should extend into the first quarter.“Cisco is executing better than other vendors in this current macro-downturn,” and Piper is “cautiously optimistic Cisco can manage the macro.”The post-earnings sell-off looks “slightly overdone.”Overweight rating, target trimmed to $55 from $58.UBS, John RoyThe company’s fundamentals are strong despite the weak first-quarter outlook.Buy rating, price target lowered to $58 from $61.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“The company’s global IT exposure can’t dodge weakening macroeconomics, despite solidly carrying out its business-model transformation toward a healthier mix of software and recurring sales.”&#92;-- Analyst Woo Jin Ho&#92;-- Click here for the research(Updates stock and chart to market open)To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Courtney DentchFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Has Worst Day in Two Years as China Weighs on Outlook

2019-08-20,"Usually, a headline like that would spell doom for stocks, but that wasn't the case Monday. Major U.S. equity benchmarks rallied even as President Donald Trump had some, shall I say, &quot;words of encouragement&quot; for the Federal Reserve.&quot;The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well,&quot; said the president on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). &quot;If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!&quot;President Trump has a long history of moving markets via Twitter, but that wasn't necessarily the case Monday when it comes to the dollar, which he has long complained is too strong. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP), which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, closed modesty higher and just a third of a percent below its 52-week high. UUP is up about 2% this month, indicating Fed rate cuts aren't always the elixir to quell a strong dollar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Despite the dollar firming again today, the plenty of export-sensitive sectors and individual names rallied, helping the Nasdaq Composite to a gain of 1.35% while the S&P 500 added 1.21%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the week higher by 0.96% with just two of its 30 components finishing lower on the day. Be Careful With These Dow WinnersTwo of the best performers in the Dow today may require some caution. Sure, it was nice to see Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rally after the network gear maker was drubbed last week following disappointing guidance on its earnings call, but Monday's bounce may be one of the dead cat variety.Similar caution may be warranted with chemicals maker Dow (NYSE:DOW), which was the second-best Dow stock today behind Cisco. Again, it's nice to see a cyclical, tariff-sensitive name in the green today, but the stock was downgraded last Friday to &quot;neutral&quot; by Bank of America Merrill Lynch with that bank also paring its price target on Dow shares to $44 from $55.Of the 17 analysts rating shares of Dow, just six have &quot;buy&quot; ratings on the name while 11 have the equivalent of a &quot;hold&quot; on the stock. DJIA Earnings NoteI've been mentioning The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) recently because the company reports earnings tomorrow, and today's gain of 2.11% suggests trades were buying the name in advance of that report. There was some elevated options activity in Home Depot today, too, but history suggest traders should be careful with the home improvement giant post-earnings.&quot;Looking into HD's earnings history, the stock has closed lower the day after earnings in all but two of the past eight quarters, though the reaction to Home Depot's most recent report in May was positive,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. &quot;Over the past two years, the shares have swung an average of 1% the day after earnings, regardless of direction. This time around, the options market is pricing in a larger-than-usual 6% swing for Tuesday's trading.&quot; Some Good Dow NewsI've mentioned a few times this year that alternative energy stocks and ETFs are really weighing on the traditional energy sector, so with that in mind, it was nice to see Chevron (NYSE:CVX) jump 1.68% today on some bullish analyst chatter. Barclays started coverage of Chevron today with an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and a $145 price target. That price target implies significant upside from today's close just under $118.&quot;Chevron is well positioned to both return significant free cash flow to shareholders and fund its…compound annual growth rate guidance,&quot; according to the bank. Dow Jones Bottom LineIn addition to the aforementioned Twitter action by President Trump, today's upside was the product of familiar themes: expectations that more Fed rate cuts are coming and that the U.S. and China might be able to make some headway on the trade front.Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell speaks in Wyoming late this week, so it's safe to say all eyes and ears will be on that speech regarding rate cut clues.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21,"The S&P 500 enjoyed a nice rally during the first half of this week thanks to the bullish performance of technology stocks. Though it pulled back yesterday, the index managed to close above 2,900, which we think is a good sign.Because tech companies generate so much revenue in China, these stocks have been especially sensitive to trade negotiations between the United States and China. So, when the Trump administration started hinting at improvements in trade negotiations this weekend, traders started buying stocks in the tech sector again.This move back into tech stocks has been good for our long stock position in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), but we don't expect it to reverse its bearish downturn yet. It will take a more than a noncombative tweet from the president to convince Wall Street to buy CSCO with both fists again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn fact, the news on trade is still somewhat mixed. The White House is apparently considering reversing some of the tariffs on Chinese goods, but the president has also said he's &quot;not ready&quot; to make a trade deal yet.But that's just fine by us. The price action on CSCO gives us a great opportunity to generate some instant income by selling a covered call, and there's a high likelihood we can do the same thing again next month. Dropping After EarningsCSCO dropped through support just above $51 after the company reported worse-than-expected earnings on Aug. 14. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of $0.73 per share, but CSCO only reported earnings of $0.51 per share, missing estimates by $0.22.This drop completed the formation of a &quot;symmetrical triangle&quot; bearish continuation pattern and confirmed Wall Street was ready to take some profits off the table after a multi-year bullish run for the stock.Daily Chart of Cisco Systems (CSCO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewAfter dropping, CSCO seems to have found solid support just above $46. The stock bounced up off this support level previously in early February. The support bounce we have seen so far is great, but we don't think it is going to be strong enough to completely fill the bearish gap that formed after the earnings miss. A Deceptive ChartNow, if we were just going to be holding onto the stock and doing nothing else, this chart might look a little depressing. However, since we're only holding the stock so we can sell covered calls against it and generate income, this chart looks amazing.Why? It gives us the perfect price level to set our strike price for our covered call.As we work with CSCO in our portfolio, we want to be able to generate instant income using the stock, but we don't want the stock to be called away from us yet. The only way the stock will get called away from us is if the stock price rises above our strike price and the call option buyer decides to exercise the option.So, if we can find a strike price the stock is unlikely to rise above -- but low enough to offer an attractive premium -- we have a high likelihood of being able to hold onto our shares of CSCO once the option expires worthless. That will then leave us in a position to generate even more instant income by selling another covered call against CSCO.Looking at the chart of CSCO, we don't think the stock is going to rise back above the former support level at $51 anytime soon. Instead, we think this price level is going to hold as a solid resistance level in the short term. That means it's a great price level to use for our strike price.To find out which CSCO covered calls we're selling--and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades--sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.InvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

2019-08-21,"Following Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) mixed earnings and decisive crowd disappointment, the time and place to take action and buy CSCO stock is looking more opportunistic than not both off and on the price chart. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Last Thursday affirmed an important pivot for Cisco Systems. A fourth-quarter earnings report showed the tech giant has shifted from a decelerating hardware networking business model to one that's capitalizing on growth markets from hybrid-cloud computing, to security and software subscription plans.By the numbers, CSCO stock delivered a two-cent earnings beat on profits of 83 cents per share. Sales of $13.43 billion grew by 6% and narrowly topped forecasts of $13.4 billion. But looking forward, Cisco's transition did find push-back from Wall Street.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCiting challenges in the company's service-provider orders and weakness in China, Cisco offered subdued year-over-year sales guidance of 0%-2% growth. The company also announced modestly lower earnings of 80 cents to 82 cents versus consensus estimates of 83 cents per share of CSCO stock.And for their part, investors did more than just listen to what Cisco's CEO had to say.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill The muted outlook caused an abrupt pivot in CSCO stock. Shares tumbled 8.61% while cratering below the 200-day simple moving average for the first time since the broader market's correction late last year. Still, the immediate disdain for Cisco shares is shaping nicely for other bullish investors when looking at the monthly view of CSCO stock. CSCO Stock Monthly ChartIf you're unbothered by technical alarm bells warning of CSCO stock now being in bear territory, there's actually a good deal to be upbeat about. The post-earnings pressure has shares testing the upper boundary of a key support zone within Cisco's existing uptrend. And in our view, that's worth monitoring for a future purchase in CSCO stock.Specifically, Cisco is challenging prior price resistance from a congestion pattern built during 2018 which successfully launched shares past the 62% retracement area from the Dot.com crash in 2000. In conjunction with trendline supports and key Fibonacci levels tied to cycle lows from 2011 and 2016, the importance of this zone from roughly $39-$48 for CSCO stock bulls can't be denied.What also can't be repudiated is the width of Cisco's support zone is prohibitively wide. The $9 width is nearly 20% from the lower boundary of $39 to the upper edge near $48. But the solution to this problem is simple enough. For investors looking to buy CSCO as it tests this technically important price area, drill down the trade entry to the weekly chart.Bottom line, investors using this strategy may wind up giving up a bit of performance versus the daily chart. Without the ability of hindsight, we simply don't know the answer to that. However, by purchasing a confirmed reversal candlestick on the weekly chart, traders are more likely to avoid last week's daily bearish pivot -- which could turn into a deeper and more opportunistic correction still well-backed by CSCO stock's big picture.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Globalfoundries Inc. sued larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for using its patented chip technology and requested a U.S. trade agency impose import bans that could roil the market for crucial components of a huge swath of electronics, including the iPhone.The U.S.-headquartered chipmaker, which like TSMC manufactures semiconductors for other companies, on Monday filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington, as well as civil lawsuits at federal courts in the U.S. and Germany.The complaints cite TSMC and customers including Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Xilinx Inc., Nvidia Corp. and their device-maker customers including Cisco Systems Inc., Google and Lenovo Group Ltd. TSMC makes chips designed by companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that are then used in devices including Apple iPhones, Lenovo laptops and Cisco routers.The broad-ranging legal assault threatens to disrupt the supply of everything from smartphones to personal computers to vital infrastructure like switches and routers that are the backbone of the internet. It highlights the importance of TSMC as a maker of the components that keep modern electronics running. It also comes at a time when the worldwide supply chain is being disrupted by a trade dispute between China and the U.S.TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun said her company hasn’t been served with any court papers and it isn’t familiar with the details of the suit.&quot;TSMC has always respected intellectual property and we have developed all our technologies by ourselves,&quot; Sun said.Globalfoundries is positioning the case as U.S. and European inventions being illegally used by an Asian company that has an increasing stranglehold on crucial parts of the technology industry.“Someone had to do something, the world needs a competitive semiconductor industry,” said Sam Azar, senior vice president of corporate development at Globalfoundries. “We’re using courts in the U.S. and Europe that care about protecting manufacturing.”Globalfoundries has factories in upstate New York and Dresden, Germany. Its headquarters is in Silicon Valley. The closely held company is owned by Mubadala, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.Globalfoundries, like other so-called contract chipmakers, has struggled to keep pace with TSMC whose factories are now rated the best in the industry. The U.S.-based company is seeking &quot;substantial&quot; damages from its Taiwanese rival which it alleges is using Globalfoundries’ technology to help it win tens of billions of dollars of sales, it said in a statement.German courts work quickly, and are known for ordering a halt of imports of products even before litigation is completed to protect patent owners. The ITC in Washington, which protects U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, also has a reputation for speed, with investigations completed in 15 to 18 months. It has the ability to block products entering the world’s largest economy. It has occasionally opted not to do that if it decides a ban would be counter to the public’s best interest. The American civil suits, filed in federal courts in Delaware and Texas, would take longer but could result in large damage awards.Throughout the complaint, Globalfoundries cited products including iPhones, AirPods, Apple TV and iPad models. It also mentioned Cisco’s switch boxes as using infringing chips and Lenovo computers that are based on Nvidia graphics chips.Globalfoundries argued that a ban would not hurt consumers because Samsung Electronics Co. is a licensee and other companies such as Sony Corp., LG Electronics Inc. and Vizio Inc. are not included in the litigation. That means there will be an adequate supply of smartphones and other consumer electronics, it said in the court filings. Samsung and Globalfoundries had a chipmaking technology partnership.The patents Globalfoundries is asserting cover the fundamentals of how semiconductors are manufactured. Some are U.S. patents and others are European covering esoteric but important areas like “structures of and methods and tools for forming in-situ metallic/dialectric caps for interconnects.” They involve the most advanced technique, called 7 nanometer, that TSMC is currently using.Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries announced a year ago that it would halt development of 7-nanometer chips and focus on more mature technology as the company struggles to match TSMC’s annual capital expenditure of some $11 billion.Globalfoundries’ Azar said his company wants TSMC to stop using the patented technology, which will be difficult to work around, or ask for a license and pay for the right to continue using the inventions.Companies like Apple, Cisco and Nvidia are named in the complaints because TSMC doesn’t import the chips or sell them to consumers; the only way to stop the chips from entering the U.S. and Germany is to block the products that use them.Trump Aides Say He Has Power to Force Companies From China (2)Global Foundries filed the complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a tweet on Aug. 23 saying American companies “are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.” His administration claims he has the authority to impose such an order though trade experts disagree.(Updates with Samsung and other companies not included in the litigation in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Globalfoundries Sues TSMC; Seeks Import Ban on IPhone Parts

The earnings release on Aug. 15 met analyst expectations. But with next-quarter guidance projecting minimal growth, investors are having second thoughts on the future of CSCO stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With this in mind, is CSCO a buy? The stock trades at a fair valuation. But with geopolitical risks like the U.S.-China trade war and anticipated declines in share buybacks, it may be tough to find upside. Let's take a closer look at the present and future performance of Cisco stock. A Closer Look at Cisco StockAs mentioned above, CSCO announced earnings on Aug. 15. Sales for the quarter ending July 27 were up 6% year-over-year, with full-year revenue up 7% from the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth was driven by the company's Security (up 14%), Applications (up 11%) and Infrastructure (up 6%) units. Software-as-a-service style software subscriptions now make up 70% of total software revenue. But the company does not anticipate high growth in the next quarter. CSCO projects 0%-2% year-over-year revenue growth and earnings per share between $0.64-$0.69.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHow about the elephant in the room (the U.S.-China trade war)? Sales in China were down 25%. As the trade war continues to accelerate, revenue decline could continue. Any year-over-year decline in total revenue would materially impact Cisco stock.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow In light of this, what positive catalysts are in the pipeline for CSCO stock? CSCO recently concluded a buyback plan initiated back in FY18. During that time frame, the company bought back $32.6 billion worth of Cisco stock. The company plans to continue to return capital to shareholders, albeit with a lower level of buybacks. The company plans to devote at least 50% of free cash flow to both share buybacks and dividends. Net of capital expenditures, the company has up to $14.9 billion a year in cash flow. Subtracting $6 billion per year in dividends, this leaves  about $8.9 billion max for buybacks. Can Acquisitions Help CSCO Move the Needle?CSCO has $33.4 billion in cash on hand. With the company stepping off the gas pedal for buybacks, acquisitions could be their key to growth. The company announced a deal to buy Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA) in July. As InvestorPlace's James Brumley discussed Aug. 1, this proposed $2.6 billion deal solidifies CSCO as a 5G hardware supplier. Acacia's products help facilitate long-distance transfer of massive data loads.Once 5G reaches critical mass, CSCO will be in the thick of it, supplying hardware to keep the data flowing across the globe.CSCO has made additional bolt-on deals since 2018. As Brumley discussed, the company has acquired Sentryo, Singularity Networks and six other companies. These bolt-on deals take just a few billion, tops, to execute, leaving plenty of runway for CSCO to grow via mergers and acquisitions. But does the current Cisco stock valuation price in this opportunity?Let's take a look at how the stock's valuation stacks up to peers. Cisco Stock Is Undervalued to PeersCSCO stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.1. The company's current enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is 11.7. Here are the current valuation ratios of some of CSCO's closest peers:  * Ciena (NYSE:CIEN): forward P/E of 16, EV/EBITDA of 13.4  * Motorola (NYSE:MSI): forward P/E of 20.1, EV/EBITDA of 17.3  * Nokia (NYSE:NOK): forward P/E  of 12, EV/EBITDA of 9.5  * LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC): forward P/E of 15.8, EV/EBITDA of 11.1On a P/E basis, CSCO stock trades at a discount to the aforementioned peers. On an EV/EBITDA basis, Cisco stock trades in line with its larger peers NOK and ERIC. I believe this is a fair valuation for CSCO stock. While the company could jump start growth via its bolt-on acquisitions, the company's weak short-term guidance is a concern. Coupled with the China risk, I can see CSCO stock falling further. Other legacy tech companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and International Business Machine (NYSE:IBM) trade at forward P/E ratios around 10. I could easily see CSCO stock fall to that valuation level. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockThe China situation has taken a toll on Cisco stock. The company's China operations are just a small part of the business. But if sales continue to fall, the company will have a hard time even meeting its low-ball guidance next quarter. Relative to peers, Cisco stock trades at a fair valuation. But with the growth issues, I can easily see CSCO stock start to trade at a lower valuation.So what's the bottom line? Investors should wait out the China situation. Additional Chinese sales declines could push the stock further down. But long term, the company's mergers and acquisitions strategy could help resurrect growth as 5G becomes the standard. Wait for the trade war to reach its nadir before entering CSCO stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"Earlier this week, stocks rallied on encouraging comments from President Donald Trump about trade talks with China. Of course, the rally was nice, but it was accompanied by doubts, confirmed by some Chinese media, that the president hadn't actually talked to anyone in China about cooling off the long-running tensions.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, that confirmation emerged today that two sides are indeed discussing trade and that helped stocks focus on something other than the second-quarter GDP revision, was pared down to growth of 2.1%. There was some good news in that GDP report that indicates the oft-discussed recession isn't as imminent as previously thought.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Second-quarter consumer spending surged 4.7%, above the 4.3% forecast in July, good for the best reading in five years. That coupled with the trade talks sent the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.48% while the S&P 500 gained 1.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average got in on the fun with a Thursday gain of 1.25%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 25 of the 30 Dow members were trading higher, indicating broad-based strength in the blue chip index today. Tech TalkAs always, it's good to see technology stocks lead a rally. That was the case today with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gaining 1.89%. Already one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow this year, Microsoft was boosted today by some positive analyst commentary with Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives reiterating an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the shares, citing strength in the Azure cloud business.&quot;We are bullish on MSFT over the next year given our thesis that Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out within the company's massive installed base,&quot; said Ives in a note.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another solid Dow technology performer today, adding 1.69% after the company announced a Sept. 10 event to reveal the latest iPhone.&quot;Apple typically puts new iPhones on sale within two weeks following their launch and rolls out the accompanying software update a few days after showing off the devices,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;The new iPhones will be key to Apple's holiday quarter.&quot; Careful With This BounceCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the best-performing member of the Dow today with a gain of 2.69%, not a surprising move given this stock's level of tariff sensitivity. There are still some structural issues in the industrial sector and President Trump's willingness to rapidly reverse course on trade has previously punished cyclical names like Caterpillar.Another bounce I'd caution on is that of the financials, particularly on a day when Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), formerly though not currently a Dow component, was hit with a downgrade due to rising concern about net interest margins. That is not a scenario that's specific to BAC shares. Dow Jones Bottom LineI wanted to save this for tomorrow, the last trading day of the month, but I'll roll it out today. Historically, September is the worst month of the year for stocks with the S&P 500 averaging a September decline of 1.1% over the past two decades.However, a couple of Dow stocks are among the best S&P 500 performers in September over the past decade. Those names are Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Plus, with tech increasingly representing a geopolitical flashpoint, CSCO should enjoy strong government support.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com However, these positive fundamentals currently clash with technical pressures. Despite a strong and relevant business, CSCO stock has been unable to avoid the fear resulting from potholes such as worrying economic metrics and the ongoing (and escalating) U.S.-China trade war.Cisco stock is starting off September in a cloud of pessimism. In the prior month, shares lost more than 15% of their market value. As a generally stable and dividend-bearing equity, such a loss is certainly an eyesore.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be fair, the company is doing all it can to avoid the red ink. For example, in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, CSCO produced a beat on both the top and bottom line. Against a per-share profitability target of 82 cents, the company delivered 83 cents. For the consensus revenue estimate of $13.38 billion, actual revenue came in at $13.43 billion.Unfortunately, management disclosed that China revenue was down 25% on an annualized basis for Q4. Adding to the already acute trade war fears, CEO Chuck Robbins admitted, &quot;What we've seen is in the state on enterprises … we're just being -- we're being uninvited to bid.&quot;With management's downgrade for both earnings and revenue in fiscal Q1 2020, Cisco stock had nowhere to go but down.At the same time, the underlying narrative hasn't changed for CSCO stock. How then should investors respond to the market carnage? The Longer-Term Bull Case for Cisco StockInvariably, anybody looking at the fallout in the CSCO stock price without the full context will hesitate. With the broader indices also flashing warning signs, it doesn't seem like an ideal time to jump in.However, such logic, although understandable, ignores the longer-term bull case for Cisco stock. And as you might expect, this positive narrative focuses on the 5G network.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off At this point, everybody and their grandparents have heard of 5G. What makes Cisco stock stand out is the firm's underlying cohesive approach to the technology. As even their own website declares, if you can't monetize the innovation, 5G is merely a different cog in radio frequencies.To that end, I appreciate management's directed acquisition strategies, including their plan to buyout Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA) for $2.6 billion. In its native form, Acacia specializes in &quot;disruptive&quot; high-speed communications technologies. Particularly, Acacia is known within the networking industry for optical interconnect solutions.Under the current technological landscape, high latency (or the time to transfer data from sender to receiver) and power consumptions represent major challenges. This is especially the case for data transmissions over long distances.With areas such as cloud computing, data centers and video conferencing demanding lower latencies, an Acacia acquisition makes sense for Cisco and CSCO stock. Certainly, it gives the tech firm a competent, practical advantage in the 5G rollout.And whether it wants to or not, Cisco plays a pivotal role in U.S. national interests. Increasingly, our geopolitical rivalries with China and Russia are evolving from kinetic concerns to digital ones. As such, you can expect the federal government to ease up on its aggressive stance against big tech. Technical Pressures Weigh on CSCO StockHowever, Cisco stock isn't an easy bull argument to make because of the trade war. With national pride and political credibility at stake, neither side has demonstrated a willingness to concede.Plus, we've already seen the devastating impact that the economic conflict had on CSCO. A 25% reduction in regional revenue is nothing to scoff at. The volatility is very concerning from a technical sentiment perspective. The initial wave of selling pressure that began in late July dropped CSCO stock below the 50-day moving average. Later, the earnings disappointment plunged shares below their 200-day moving average.Right now, CSCO is in a no man's land. Given the overriding pessimism in the broader markets, I believe shares risk falling first before picking back up.But if Cisco stock does drop to levels near what we saw early this year, I think it's an opportunity. As I mentioned above, Cisco is simply too important to the rollout of next-gen technologies. That should help mitigate volatility as we close out this year and head into the next.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03,"Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock was having a fairly good year -- until a couple weeks ago. Cisco's fiscal fourth quarter earnings report had some ominous details. The result was that CSCO stock had its biggest drop in about six years -- 8.6%. Cisco stock also fell ahead of earnings, for a total drop of 12.3% in two sessions.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since then, the shares have remained depressed, even though the overall markets have staged a nice rally.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September So let's take a look at the quarter. On the positive side of things, CSCO reported its strongest growth on the top line in about six years, with revenues up 6% to $13.4 billion. There was actually strength across all the main businesses like switches, routers and other networking equipment. The security unit also remained strong, with sales up about 14% to $714 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the meantime, CSCO continues to invest heavily in its M&A. The biggest deal was for Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA), for $2.6 billion. The company is a fabless semiconductor operator that is focused on high-speed interconnect offerings. The deal certainly looks like a synergistic fit and should help with growth.There have also been a variety of smaller deals. For example, Cisco has acquired Voicea, which has a real-time transcription service for meetings. Then there was the acquisition of CloudCherry, a provider of technology for customer experience management. At the core of this is advanced predictive analytics and machine learning. So What Was the Bad News?Okay, so why did Wall Street sell off Cisco stock? Well, the guidance was not encouraging. The current quarter is likely to see revenue growth of 0% to 2%, while the Street was looking for 3% (the company does not provide full-year guidance). CSCO also expects earnings to be below forecasts.As the global economy has come under pressure, Oracle's sales to service providers have decelerated. Let's face it, such purchases can easily be delayed whenever there is economic uncertainty. Keep in mind that other suppliers of large technology equipment -- like NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) -- have also reported disappointing results.For CSCO, there could be further problems as competitors like Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) get more aggressive on pricing to pick up new customers In other words, Cisco's margins could be vulnerable.Next, the situation in China remains a nagging issue. On the earnings call, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins noted that sales to providers in the country have taken a big hit (down a grueling 25%). Note that it appears that the company is not even being invited to bid on new projects!It's not clear how long this will last. But given that there has been little substantive progress on trade talks, the problems in China could persist for some time. Bottom Line on Cisco StockWith the drop-off in Cisco stock, the valuation is now at reasonable levels. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at roughly 13x. The dividend is also an attractive 3%. This is actually among one of the highest in the tech industry.CSCO also should continue to generate strong cash flows. For fiscal 2019, they came to a hefty $15.8 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There is about $33.4 billion in the bank.So for now, there may be a floor on CSCO stock, as the bad news seems to be factored in.  On the other hand though, this does not mean there will be much upside either from current levels.  There are few headwinds on the horizon. Rather, with the global economy in flux, there could easily be some more negative surprises.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now So for the time being, there should be no rush to get into CSCO stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-09-03,"For years, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has offered declining revenue but decent earnings per share that were boosted by the company's voracious appetite for buying back its own stock. While buybacks are often applauded, Wall Street eventually saw through that act and demanded more from IBM stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Up nearly 19% year-to-date, it's fair to say IBM stock is on the mend, but not all the way back. Highly creative and nimble technology companies are often viewed as &quot;transformative.&quot; While that label probably doesn't apply to IBM, Big Blue is undergoing a transformation aimed at rejuvenating the company's growth and boosting IBM stock price.Analysts are mostly bullish on the company's recently closed acquisition of Red Hat and see the deal as a potential bullish catalyst for IBM stock price. Of course, the company paints a bullish picture of the deal, telling analysts and investors that it will be able to sell more IBM products to Red Hat users and vice versa.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;IBM said the deal will boost second half 2019 revenues by about 2 percentage points; 2020 by 4-5 percentage points; and 2021 by 2-3 percentage points,&quot; according to Barron's.Moreover, the Red Hat purchase will bolster IBM's free cash flow. That, in turn, could enable IBM to return more money to the owners of IBM stock.   Over the years, IBM stock has been pretty dependable on that front. In addition to IBM being a dedicated buyer of its own shares, the dividend of IBM stock has steadily grown and currently yields 4.94%, more than triple the yield on 10-year Treasuries. Blockchain Bets, Cloud CallsWhile IBM stock is widely viewed as a mature, if not lumbering, technology name, the company has a formidable presence in the fast-growing blockchain and is a worthy cloud competitor.  Cloud computing is certainly growing, but IBM is behind rivals such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the cloud-computing arena.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September &quot;Though still in the early stages, we think investments in IBM Cloud (a combination of SoftLayer and Bluemix); acquisition of Red Hat; establishment of development platforms like Watson Developer Cloud; and enterprise application partnerships with leading global companies present positive opportunities for IBM,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;Still, more work remains to be done.&quot;In the cloud space, IBM likely needs to sharpen its focus on software-as-a-service, also a hyper-competitive environment. With IBM facing intense competition in its hardware business from rivals, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), software-as-a-service has become more important for IBM stock.&quot;Cloud computing and increasing competitive pressures from Oracle and Cisco will pressure IBM's systems segment,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;We expect secular headwinds and intense competition to hinder the growth of IBM's hardware business over the long term. On average, we forecast a small annual decline in revenue for this segment through 2023.&quot;As for blockchain, a space where IBM has meaningful advantages over its competitors, the company recently unveiled its Trust Your Supplier (TYS) network. TYS is aimed at improving &quot;supplier qualification, validation, onboarding and life cycle information management&quot; for corporate customers.That's a lot of tech jargon. What it really means is the platform helps companies track the movement of goods and services. That could be a $2 trillion industry in a few years. TYS could easily attract many customers if its promises of improving administrative cost and onboarding efficiencies are realized. In the corporate world, &quot;efficiencies&quot; usually mean cost savings, and executives love that.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks to Consider for Those Who Can Handle Risk  The Bottom Line on International Business Machines StockThere are positive aspects of the outlook of IBM stock. That outlook would grow more compelling if the Red Hat acquisition proves to be a better deal than previously believed. Currently, Red Hat is an &quot;add on&quot; to the positive thesis on IBM stock. But if the acquired company exceeds Wall Street's expectations, IBM stock could rally.IBM stock price could also climb if the company increases its footprint in the SaaS market. Trading at just 10.53 times the average forward earnings estimate, IBM is most definitely a value play in a sector in which investors are looking for growth. Moreover, even mature companies (see Microsoft) are delivering growth in the SaaS sector.IBM stock lacks the pizzazz of many equities in its sector, explaining its low multiples. That's all right as long as investors can wait for value stocks to come back into style, something that hasn't happened in over a decade.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-04,"The trade war with China is still pushing technology stocks down, and that gives us another chance to sell a covered call on Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).We've been managing a long stock position in CSCO since August, and we've already successfully sold one covered call on the stock. CSCO has lost a little more value since mid-August, and we have another opportunity to collect income on the stock. Trade War Drags on Tech Stocks  The U.S. stock market pulled back yesterday after the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.1 -- showing the manufacturing sector in the United States is contracting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou see, the ISM Manufacturing PMI indicator is a diffusion index, which means it is based on a scale of 0 to 100, with 50 being the balanced midpoint. Any number above 50 on the scale indicates expansion in manufacturing activity. The farther above 50 the index goes, the stronger the expansion.Conversely, any number below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing activity. The farther below 50 the index goes, the stronger the contraction. This is the first time since 2016 that the ISM Manufacturing PMI has dropped below 50.Most analysts are blaming this contraction in manufacturing on President Trump's trade war with China, and traders seem to agree. Traders are responding by reducing their exposure to tech stocks because many technology companies generate a lot of revenue in China.CSCO is starting to drop as investors look to other sectors, and its technical picture makes a strong case for a new covered call trade. Resistance at $49 Holds  As traders have been reducing their exposure to CSCO, the stock has dropped back down to support just above $46. CSCO has confirmed, once again, that $49 is going to be a strong resistance level, making it a good strike price for a covered call. This price level served as resistance during the last four months of 2018, and it held as resistance again on Aug. 22.Daily Chart of Cisco Systems (CSCO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe stock tried to recover and bounce higher after the company's disappointing earnings announcement on Aug. 14, but it didn't have enough bullish momentum to stay above $49.

2019-09-05,"Markets have been volatile lately, bringing uncertainty to a business that really just wants predictability. In a way, this is worse than a run of bad news; at least when times are bad, investors know what will happen next. The question for investors now, is how to ride out this wave of volatility? That’s a hard question to answer; in August, 11 of 22 trading sessions saw the total market shift 1% or more.Protection lies in the market’s traditional refuge, the defensive stock. Nicholas Getaz, of Franklin Templeton Investments, says of the perfect stock that it’s a company with “a leading market position, products that are industry norms and standards, innovative growth drivers, and a business model that increases resilience.” So, let’s use the TipRanks Stock Screener to find three companies that meet this definition, and see what makes them compelling buys right now. Home Depot, Inc. (HD)We’ll start with an industry leader, the largest of the home improvement superstores. HD reported Q2 earnings on August 20, and the results were interesting. Revenues just missed the forecast, coming in a half-percent low at $30.84 billion. EPS, however, showed a 3.26% positive surprise; the expectation was $3.07 while the actual result was $3.17. Investors were pleased, and HD stock has gained 4% since.Just as important, HD is well-positioned to keep gaining, given today’s business environment. Interest rates are low, and the Fed is widely expected to make at least one more cut this year. This puts downward pressure on mortgages, creating an environment in which homeowners are more likely to refinance and plow their savings into needed home improvements and repairs. Which, of course, necessitates a trip to Home Depot.Home Depot, for its part, has been using its solid earnings, at least in part, to reward investors. The company offers a 2.4% dividend, a modest yield but a $5.44 annual payment due to the high share price. The company has been steadily increasing the dividend payment for the last decade.Wall Street’s top analysts are mostly pleased with HD’s performance in the first half. From Wells Fargo, Zachary Fadem writes, “We believe solid first half cost controls bode well for second half achievability, and … an improving setup ahead, featuring easing year-over-year compares, cycling lumber deflation, potential housing category improvements, etc.” Fadem gives HD a buy rating with a price target of $235, suggesting an upside of 4.8%.5-star analyst Peter Benedict, of Baird, agrees that HD is a valuable buy, writing, “Home Depot Q2 results did not contain any surprises and its results were likely good enough to support the shares at its current valuation.” His $230 target is slightly more conservative, with a 2.6% upside.Overall, HD shares have a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 10 buys and 6 holds assigned in the last three months. Shares are selling for $224, and are still rising after the positive quarterly report. The average price target of $228 suggests a small 1.8% upside. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)Cisco is the tech company that other tech companies rely on. It makes networking hardware, the gear that physically connects the internet. It’s a solid niche, that has defined its ‘industry norms and standards,’ and keeps the company in a comfortable position.Despite some recent share price losses, CSCO returned a 1.32% positive EPS surprise in its most recent quarterly earnings. And the company continues to pay out its 2.96% dividend. The quarterly payment is only 35 cents, but it’s reliable, and adds up to $1.40 per share annualized. Better yet, Cisco has been steadily increasing that payment; the dividend has risen 13% over the past 5 years. Shares have more than doubled over that time, as well.Reviewing CSCO for Cowen, 5-star analyst Paul Silverstein gave the stock a solid buy rating with a $61 price target. He wrote, “Trends in the bulk of its businesses remain healthy, supporting our view of a meaningful increase to its impressive margin structure and improving execution across most product and customer markets.” His price target implies an upside of 28%.Piper Jaffray’s James Fish agrees that Cisco is a buying proposition and a clear value. He says, “We see good risk-reward on Cisco at current levels as long as the company's growth segments … continue to execute.” His target, $55, indicates a 16% upside.The analyst consensus on CSCO is a Moderate Buy, based on 15 buys and 7 holds. The stock is trading for $47, and the average price target of $56 suggests an upside potential of 19%. General Dynamics Corporation (GD)Sheer size insulates this company from most economic problems. It is the fifth largest defense contractor in the US, and the sixth largest globally, with over $36 billion in annual revenue. Some of the company’s products are highly classified; others, like the F-16 fighter jet and the M1A1 tank, are among the world’s most recognizable weapon systems.Its leading position in the defense industry means GD is poised outperform the market this year. Where as the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date, GD shares have gained 21%. Back in July, when the company reported Q2 earnings, the $2.77 EPS beat the forecast by 3.25%.For return-minded investors, General Dynamics offers a 2.14% dividend. The share price is high enough to make the annual payment $4.08 per share, or $1.02 paid out quarterly. The company has paid out steadily, and regularly increased the payment, going back to 2011.GD’s well-founded position in its industry has attracted Buy ratings from some of Wall Street’s best analysts. Cai Rumohr, an aerospace expert with Cowen, gave the stock his approval along with a $202 price target at the end of August. His target suggests a 6% upside. Recent gains in GD shares have pushed the stock price above the average price target. GD is selling for $190, a 16% premium to the target. The analyst consensus, based on the two most recent reviews, a buy and a hold, is to Hold this stock. Momentum is on GD’s side however, considering the stock’s gains so far this year and its key role in a critical industry.TipRanks evaluates over 5,500 Wall Street analysts, based on their success rate and average return.

And now that IBM's $34 billion purchase of Red Hat has closed, the dividend is looking even more secure.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com In a presentation to analysts on Aug. 2, IBM showed that Red Hat would raise IBM's free cash flow by about half a billion dollars in 2020 and $1 billion in 2021, after interest costs from the purchase.This is important, since as I pointed out in my previous article on IBM, the company has stopped its buyback program in order to pay down the acquisition debt and maintain the dividend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIBM's annual $6.48 per share dividend costs $1.4 billion each quarter, or $5.6 billion annually. In Q2 IBM reported FCF of $2.4 billion, or $9.6 billion at an annual rate. That still leaves $4 billion for IBM to pay down the $34 billion in debt principal that it took on to buy Red Hat. Dividend Yield Comparison on IBM StockCompared to some other large software stocks, IBM's dividend yield looks very attractive. After all, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.3%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) yield 1.8%, and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) yields 2.9%.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy But, as I pointed out in my previous article, IBM's dividend growth rate has been slowing. These other stocks have had growing dividends, and they also repurchase their shares. Their buyback yields are also attractive, giving them high total yields.So, on the pro side, IBM's high dividend yield is now very secure with the Red Hat acquisition. But don't expect its dividend rate to increase much, if at all, since IBM now has to pay down its debt. FCF Yield ComparisonsOne bright spot is that IBM sports a very high free cash flow yield compared to its close peers. IBM's $9.6 billion FCF divided by its $125 billion market value gives IBM stock a 7.7% FCF yield. Microsoft's FCF yield is 3%, while both ORCL and CSCO stock have a 5.9% FCF yield.This means IBM's free cash flow is not being valued as highly as its peers -- which makes IBM stock attractive on a relative basis. International Business Machines Stock has Performed WellThe IBM stock price has risen 24% so far this year. This is better than most of its close peers. MSFT is up 39% YTD, but ORCL is up 19% and CSCO gained 14%. Given that the IBM is relatively undervalued on both a dividend yield and FCF yield basis, it's realistic to assume that the IBM stock price will continue to perform well.Meanwhile investors will have fun collecting IBM's relatively higher dividends. Those dividends are now even more secure with the extra free cash flow that the Red Hat acquisition provides.Moreover, once IBM has made a dent in its Red-Hat-related debt in several years, you can expect that IBM will resume buying back its shares again. That will have numerous benefits to investors. Moreover it will increase IBM's overall total yield (dividend yield plus buyback yield).In sum, IBM stock's dividend yield looks very attractive here and is much more secure with the Red Hat acquisition.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-09,"More than once over the past couple of decades, networking giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has been lumped in with other hardware stocks, and rightfully so. For the better part of its existence, Cisco stock has been an investment in networking hardware. Its business has been mostly dependent on enterprise-level IT upgrades.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com As the underlying technologies have changed, however, so too have Cisco's opportunities. It's still a hardware name to be sure, but it's also a software name. It's even becoming a recurring revenue platform.This paradigm shift didn't even come close to staving off a huge setback in August. CSCO stock fell from its July peak near $58 to last month's low around $46, with most of the selloff sparked by lackluster guidance for the quarter now underway. Headwinds in China also concerned shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe dip is ultimately an opportunity to step into a misunderstood and undervalued name. CSCO Stock Undervalued, UnderappreciatedThe post-earnings response was understandable.Cisco stock was already fighting a losing battle, peeling back from its July peak after announcing its intent to acquire Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA). Despite topping earnings and revenue estimates for the three-month stretch ending in July and pumping up the top line by 6%, earnings guidance of between 80 and 82 cents per share for its first fiscal quarter of 2020 wasn't the 83 cents analysts were modeling. Sales growth could also be flat for the quarter underway, following a 25% tumble in the previous quarter's China-driven revenue. Though the top end of Cisco's guidance was 2%, it was still short of consensus projections of 2.5%.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now The steep 20% selloff, however, largely ignores the fact that Cisco stock is now trading at 18.7 times its trailing earnings and only 13.6 times its forward-looking income.There are cheaper stocks out there, but there aren't cheaper stocks out there like CSCO. Indeed, even the usual valuation measures don't apply without a footnote. In this case that footnote is $33.4 billion worth of liquid assets or outright cash sitting on Cisco's balance sheet, versus its market cap of $201 billion.The valuation also doesn't reflect the fact that, although it's been occasionally uneven thanks to new competition from the likes of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Cisco hasn't failed to produce some level of profit in any quarter for over a decade. That includes the 2008 recession prodded by the subprime mortgage meltdown.And that reliability is only poised to improve. Cisco Embraces SubscriptionsThe company has arguably touted the idea more than it's mattered yet. Nevertheless, recurring revenue is a key part of its new business model.For the record, it's actually been a piece of the Cisco strategy as far back as 2017. That's when the tech giant launched its first-ever subscription-based product leveraging its Catalyst 9000 networking platform. But, CEO Chuck Robbins explained in March that recurring revenue should make up 30% of the company's total business within the next three years.To that end, as of the recently ended quarter, software subscriptions made up 70% of total software revenue. Applications and services only accounted for a little more than one-third of Cisco's total business.It's not clear if the company's fiscal trajectory is on pace to reach the goal. The paradigm shift within the technology arena favors Cisco exceeding that goal rather than falling short of it.One only has to look at the evolution of cloud computing to see renting rather than owning is the new norm. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a multi-billion dollar business on the premise of providing access to remote servers to organizations that don't want a giant server bank on-site, or can't afford the cash needed to outright buy a data center.Cybersecurity service provider FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has taken the idea a step further. It provides an entire suite of cloud-based digital security solutions that in the past would have been installed on-premise. Its customers enjoy the fact that for a small recurring fee, their service providers keep that cloud-based software, service and storage up-to-date.Amazon and FireEye like the fact that the underlying contracts make for predictable revenue.The trend dovetails nicely into Cisco's relatively new software-based routing platforms like its SD-WAN, which automatically remain up-to-date and secure without any major maintenance needed on the user's end. In the past, major improvements may have required a much more expensive purchase of new hardware. The Bottom Line for Cisco StockIt's all still a work in progress making it difficult to pinpoint where Cisco will be three years from now. Indeed, it's difficult to say where the company will be one year from now. To the extent its risk and potential can be weighed, however, Cisco stock looks like a buy-worthy bargain here.Headlines spurred an emotional response last month, which resulted in a knee-jerk selloff. Weakness in China didn't help in that regard. A closer inspection of the numbers would have made clear that Asia still only accounts for 15% of total revenue.Either way, with a potential end to the tariff war looming at the same time the company is just getting very, very good at revenue-steadying subscriptions, this beaten-down iconic name just might make for a decent addition to most portfolios.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in FireEye.

2019-09-10,"Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) appears unstoppable. It has pulled back modestly from its recent $176.55 per share record high. However, at about $165 per share, Roku stock has risen by almost 65% since its August earnings report.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com However, with the massive run-up in ROKU, the price looks to have moved far ahead of both its current position and its near-term growth potential. Although the company will likely prosper long-term, at these prices Roku stock at best a trade. Roku Stock Seems UnstoppableWithout question, this company has logged some impressive accomplishments. It took what could have easily become a commoditized industry and turned itself into what my colleague Tezcan Gecgil calls &quot;the pioneer of video streaming gadgets.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven the lack of profit potential in selling hardware, the company's ad platform and now, the Roku Channel, drive the overwhelming majority of company revenues.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market The Roku Channel cost the company its neutral stance between services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Hulu.Still, this has helped make this stock a growth machine, and the market has rewarded the company handsomely for it. The company may not earn a profit until at least 2021. Still, Wall Street forecasts revenue growth of 46.9% this year and 35.6% in fiscal 2020. ROKU and the FundamentalsThe equity has also proven all of my bearish predictions wrong. As a result, the ROKU stock price stands near record highs. Before the earnings announcement in August, I told traders to only buy as a speculative position on earnings. However, whenever I tell investors the stock has finished moving higher, it continues to rise.As it moves up, it separates itself further from the fundamentals. I do not expect ROKU to come in line with multiples and earnings growth for several years. However, the overall market does not typically perform well this time of year.Moreover, the U.S.-China trade war remains an ongoing issue. The equity trades at a forward price-to-sales (PS) ratio of just over 19, and almost 43 times its book value. At these levels, it has become priced for perfection.None of this means ROKU cannot keep moving higher. However, should the overall market turn or the company itself receives unexpected bad news, the equity would likely take a hard hit. Watch Insider SalesInvestors should also note that CEO Anthony Wood sold 35,000 shares at $155.06 per share on September 3rd. Other insider sales followed. Admittedly, CEO share sales can happen for numerous reasons. Also, the $5.4 million in revenue from the transaction amounted to a small fraction of his June sale of 400,000 shares for $41.3 million. However, this could point to doubts about ROKU in the near term.Again, I still like how the company has transformed the streaming space. If a fall swoon or a worsening trade war leads to a lower ROKU stock price, long-term investors should look at buying. However, at current prices, it has become a bet as to whether traders will take it higher or lower. The Bottom Line on Roku StockROKU has become unpredictable at current levels. I still expect the company to dominate the industry it created. I also believe that it will achieve new record highs long term. It remains very possible that those increases will even continue shorter term.However, such valuations have started to push ROKU into bubble territory. Once it falls significantly, it can take years, or sometimes decades, to recover.As a much younger trader who thought he could do no wrong, I once invested in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) during the years of the dot-com bubble.  I held a nine-fold gain at the March 2000 peak only to see most of my gains disappear. Almost 20 years later, CSCO still has not recovered its 2000 price.Truly profiting from ROKU in the short term means knowing when to get out, as opposed to what time to buy. Perhaps following the example of the CEO would make for a wise decision.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-10,"I've said it before, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a flawed index due to its price-weighting mechanisms, the index still has plenty of value for investors. After all, the index does represent some of America's largest and finest companies. Thanks to their large moats, strong cash flows and big dividends, Dow Jones stocks really are the bluest of the blue-chips and make great portfolio additions.However, the various shades of blue do vary.Thanks to the recent market hiccups, rising global tensions, the trade war and overall economic malaise, not all the Dow Stocks would be considered champions at this point. And in fact, a few of them downright stink. Misreads on trends coupled with the current global economic problems have made several stocks in the blue-chip index chronically underperform in recent weeks and in fact, years for some. That puts them firmly in the &quot;don't buy camp.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But how can you tell which Dow Jones stocks are big buys and which are downright sells? Luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we've done the leg work for you. Here are three of the Dow's biggest stocks to avoid. Dow Jones Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 26%The reason to buy industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) stems from the fact the firm is so global in its revenues. A huge portion of its sales come from overseas. That has driven the stock's cash flows and profits in recent years. The reason to sell 3M is also that it's so global in its sales.As the trade war has dragged on, 3M has been hit hard by the overall slowing global economy. A prime example was its last earnings report. Despite a hefty share buyback program, earnings-per-share for this Dow Jones stock slipped over 37% year-over-year, while net revenues declined 2.6%. The vast bulk of the slippage in sales continues to be from Asia, Europe other emerging markets. These are the regions that drove sales in previous quarters. Moreover, the strong dollar and local currency fluctuations continue to hit 3M hard.This is a big deal going forward. With no end to the trade war in sight and major international economies -- such as Germany -- slowing way down/contracting, 3M could be between a rock and hard place. During its last conference call, the industrial stock warned things could get rough. Management is now guiding to earn $8.75 per share on the high-end -- a dip of 3.1% from its last EPS estimate.While 3M isn't in any danger of cutting its dividend and ending its long streak of payout increases, the continued dip in EPS could spell trouble for its pace of dividend jumps. And with a PEG ratio of nearly 2 and forward P/E of 18, MMM stock isn't exactly a bargain.With many of the catalysts for ownership now deteriorating and the stock relatively expensive, this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid for the time being. IBM (IBM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 12%There are plenty of old school tech stocks that have pivoted correctly in the new paradigm. Dotcom leaders like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have successfully changed their operations to better compete in the cloud and across many new trends in tech. And their investors have been rewarded.Then there's IBM (NYSE:IBM).Big Blue should be a leader. Unfortunately, IBM has managed to make plenty of missteps over the last decade. Missing key trends like the rise of cloud computing has continued to hurt the firm's bottom line. Revenues last quarter marked the fourth-straight quarterly revenue decline for the tech dinosaur. Based on full-year estimates for 2019, IBM will have seen its sales drop by nearly 19% over the last five years. That's just terrible.So, it's no wonder why IBM decided to buy out Red Hat to inject some growth into the firm for $34 billion. And there is potential for growth. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel recently mentioned that the Dow Jones stock could be a major contender in open-source software and in the cloud. However, based on its estimates, IBM says Red Hat won't boost earnings until 2021 at the earliest. And given how lousy IBM has been at integrating acquisitions in recent history, the potential may not be realized.What's worse is that Big Blue recently suspended its lucrative buyback program to pay for the deal. Those buybacks have actually managed to reduce its share count by roughly 25% over the last few years.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now In the end, there's a lot of risk for IBM and not much safety net anymore. Red Hat will take a ton of time to integrate and in the meantime, investors are getting nothing but declining sales while waiting. There's better tech stocks out there and this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 25%It's easy to pick on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) based on the trade war and continued lower demand from China. After all, China's massive expansion and infrastructure upgrades have long been a huge driver for construction equipment. So, with China slowing, CAT is in some hot water.The issue for the heavy-machinery firm is that it's not just woes from China that are hurting its bottom line. It turns out, construction spending across the board is starting to wobble in a big way. Both Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) both recently warned that CAPEX spending is dropping in the U.S. as well. That CAPEX spending is also coming to the metals and mining industry as well as the sectors. The same could be said for agricultural and forester equipment. Overall demand for powerful diesel engines and other heavy machines is now dropping as the trade war has trickled on.This is a huge problem for CAT. Sales in the U.S. as well as key segments -- like energy -- have helped keep the profit engine growing and they have also helped it overcome many of the woes from China/Asia in general. But with many of these markets now seeing contraction and spending dwindle, CAT could be hit hard. And in fact, management is now predicting EPS come in at the lower end of their estimated guidance. If things continue to turn poor and the recession finally hits, the Dow Jones stock could be in a world of hurt.Now, CAT still pulls in a ton of cash flows and has seen rising sales. This has translated into a big 20% dividend boost and improved buyback program. But now that sales and cash flow growth have been muted in the new tariff-filled environment, that robust pace of dividend/buyback growth could slow if things start to really hit the fan.And for investors, that could make CAT a stock to place on their watchlist for now.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"Stocks that pay good dividends and also have significant stock buyback programs provide numerous benefits to investors. These benefits include:  * Share reductions from buybacks allow the stock to increase its dividends per share.  * Buybacks act as a natural buffer for the stock.  * Earnings per share increases for the same amount of net income.  * Buybacks act to sterilize share dilution from management and employee options.  * Lower share counts over time increase the remaining shareholders' stake in the company.  * Compared to dividends, buybacks are a much more tax-efficient return of capital.For these reasons, there is a clear trend in the United States stock market for companies to spend more on share buybacks. CNBC recently reported that according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study, U.S. share buybacks are expected to hit $1 trillion this year. Corporations are using over 104% of their free cash flow for buybacks, up from 82% last year.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September I'm going to focus on five stocks that pay shareholders dividends and have large share buyback programs. Combined, these dividends and buybacks provide large total yields. And over time, these stocks are likely to be good investments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has an attractive 1.4% dividend yield. But it returns even more capital to shareholders through its large share buyback program. AAPL has spent over 107% of its free cash flow on buybacks in the past year. The company has cut its shares by 32% in the last six years.Based on recent analysis, Apple stock will have an estimated 6.5% buyback yield over the next year, giving it a nearly 8% total yield.For example, AAPL recently reported that it spent $17 billion in share repurchases and $3.6 billion in dividends in its most recent quarter. The buybacks alone, if continued each quarter, represent on an annualized basis just under 7% of its market value ($68 billion dividend by $975 billion).Expect good things from Apple's stock buyback program in the years to come, including higher dividends per share and higher earnings per share. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.4%Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.4% and has a large share buyback program. It just completed a $25 billion share repurchase program. In the past quarter alone, MSFT spent $7.7 billion on shareholders, including $4.2 billion in share buybacks.These repurchases have reduced the amount of MSFT shares outstanding by over 30% in the past 15 years. Since Microsoft stock has a $1 trillion market value, its annual spending of over $16 billion in buybacks represents a 1.6% buyback yield. Combined with the 1.4% dividend yield, MSFT sports a 3% total yield. Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.7%Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock has a 1.7% dividend yield, but has a massive buyback program. In the past year alone, ORCL spent $36 billion on buybacks, representing 20% of its $182 billion market value.In its last eight fiscal years, ORCL has reduced its share count by over 33% using its free cash flow to repurchase shares. All eyes are going to be on ORCL's August fiscal first-quarter earnings statement to see how many shares it has bought back. Since ORCL spent over 280% of its free cash flow on buybacks, effectively drawing down its cash balance, I suspect ORCL's buyback activity may have been reduced for the August quarter.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Nevertheless, at the rate its buybacks occurred last fiscal year (ending in May), Oracle stock sports an annualized 20% buyback yield. Its free cash flow yield is 7.5% of its market value.ORCL will post its earnings Sept. 12, including its cash flow statement which will show the share repurchase amounts. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.8%Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has an attractive 2.8% dividend yield. Cisco stock also has an attractive buyback program. This is because the company is expected to make $7.7 billion in share repurchases this year.Compared to its $206 billion market value, this gives CSCO stock a 3.7% buyback yield. Its total yield is an appealing 6.5% (2.8% dividend yield plus 3.7% buyback yield).In the past ten years, CSCO has reduced its shares outstanding by 27%, and should reach close to a 30% reduction this year. The main reason for this is that CSCO produces abundant free cash flow -- over $15 billion in this year alone.Expect that shares will continue to fall at CSCO. This has the benefit of allowing CSCO to be able to raise its dividend per share for the same amount of earnings its produces. It also increases earnings per share. Lastly the share buybacks act as a continuing source of demand for the stock, will help push the stock higher over time. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.2%McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock enjoys a 2.2% dividend yield, but also engages in large share buyback activity. MCD reported that it expects to complete its three-year $25 billion share buyback program by the end of this year.This represents an average of $8.3 billion in share buybacks per year. Since MCD stock has a $158 billion market value, the average buyback yield is 5.3% of its stock market value.Combined with the 2.2% dividend yield, the buyback yield gives MCD an estimated 7.5% total yield. This means that over 7% of MCD's stock value is returned to shareholders on average each year through either dividends or buybacks.On Aug. 30 Mark Hake launched the Total Yield Value Guide, which focuses on high-total-yield value stocks.

2019-09-12,"Markets are rising so far in September, after a rough August. The S&P 500 is up 2.7% this month, bringing the index’s year-to-date gains to almost 20%. And looking forward, two stocks are poised for particular outperformance. These are stocks that are buzzing following two notable analyst ratings. Analysts usually reiterate ratings – so upgrades speak volumes about a stock's potential. We found these stocks by filtering for the latest upgrades on the Daily Analyst Ratings, an up-to-date listing of the most recent stock reviews by analysts. Let’s look more closely, and see what the analysts had to say about these two recent upgrades. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)The world’s fifth largest semiconductor company, with $31.8 billion in revenues last year, Micron (MU – Get Report) has proven more resilient than its peers, with less price volatility this past summer in the face of increased US-China trade tensions. MU shares have gained 12.6% so far this month, with 59% gains year-to-date.The strong stock performance drew notice from Longbow analyst Nikolay Todorov, who upgraded his stance on the stock from neutral to buy. In his comments, he wrote, “We are turning more positive on memory fundamentals as we now believe excess inventory will be depleted faster than expected, triggering an improvement in pricing and margin ahead of current expectations.”Going into greater detail, Todorov added, “Our checks highlight upside in shipments and improving DRAM and NAND pricing fundamentals associated with upside at select hyperscales and risk of tightening supply. As a result, upstream inventory drawdown is occurring faster than previously forecast, which should drive a bottoming in DRAM fundamentals by year-end to pair with an in-process recovery in NAND fundamentals.” Todorov’s price target of $66 suggests an impressive 30% upside for MU.Todorov is not the only bull on Micron. Weston Twigg, from KeyBanc, set raised his price target from $45 to $58, saying, “Barring a recession, we expect memory trends to improve through 2020.” Twigg’s new target implies a potential upside of 15%.The upbeat analyst reviews of MU shares, along with the general optimism about the company’s near- to mid-term prospects, pushed the stock price up in recent days, well above its average price target. As well as the upward trending share price, MU has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 14 buys, 5 holds, and 2 sells set in the last 90 days. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)We may live in the digital age, but our information networks live on hardware. And Cisco (CSCO – Get Report) is the leading provider of the networking hardware that makes up the physical connections of the internet.Cisco has done well as the hardware man for the tech world. Shares are up 14.5% year-to-date. While that is below the S&P average of 19%, the most recently quarterly report showed an EPS beat of 1.32%. Steady growth and earnings have made Cisco a favorite with investors, as has the company’s 2.96% dividend. The quarterly payment is a modest 35 cents per share, but Cisco has a policy making regular increases and the dividend has grown 13% in the last 5 years.The strong market position attracted attention from 5-star Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani. He initiated his coverage of this stock with a buy rating and a price target of $60, suggesting a robust upside potential of 20%. Daryanani believes that future hardware investment in the tech sector will focus on the upcoming 5G networks. He writes of Cisco: “Investors are underappreciating Cisco's shift towards a more predictable and free-cash-flow-focused model. The transition CSCO is undergoing merits investors focusing more on an FCF-based valuation vs. traditional price-to-earnings approach.“Cisco is well-positioned as an end-to-end solutions provider across the enterprise networking product spectrum; CSCO’s unique portfolio of assets allows the company to address emerging growth adjacencies (security, services, cloud-based solutions) while maintaining market leading positions in several core networking product categories.”Also bullish on Cisco is James Fish, of Piper Jaffray. Writing in mid-August, Fish said, “We believe that the stock warrants a higher valuation than the market is offering. We see good risk-reward on Cisco at current levels as long as the company's growth segments… continue to execute.” Fish’s $57 price target implies an upside of 12% for CSCO.Cisco is up 4% since Daryanani opened his coverage, and up 8% for September so far. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 22 reviews, including 16 buys and 6 holds. The average price target of $56.47 suggests an upside of 11% from the current share price of $50.60.Visit our Top 25 Experts page today, and find out more about Wall Street’s best stock watchers.",2 Tech Stocks Surging on Analyst Upgrades

2019-09-13,"There has been strong demand for better and faster communications for literally thousands of years -- from smoke signals to homing pigeons to the Pony Express, telegraphs, and telephones. Call it the thousand-year bull market … one that I can see continuing for another 1,000 years.Fortunately, we don't need to think that far ahead to make money now. In fact, we can start right now. The next great leap in technology and communications is happening as we speak, and this move to 5G is going to be the biggest one yet.Think about how important technology has become to our economy, our lives, and our world over the last century. Take technology away and almost everything collapses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf that's not the definition of infrastructure, I don't know what is. It used to be roads, and now it's the information super highway. Technology is everywhere … from our computers to our clothes dryers to our cars.Investors who recognized this trend in the 1980s and 1990s and owned the best internet infrastructure stocks made a ton of money:Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the leader in semiconductors. Those chips were a big part of the foundation, and the stock soared more than 3,500% in the 1990s.Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) made the equipment that made all of those chips. Its return in the 1990s: more than 6,150%.Then there was Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the king of communications and networking equipment. This stock went from under $1 per share in the early 1990s to $43 by the end of the decade for life-changing returns of nearly 34,000%! (The stock took off so sharply in the late 1990s that you can see how the higher prices on the y-axis are mushed together.)We are now on the verge of the most advanced breakthrough of all -- a new infrastructure that will not only make communications faster but enable virtually all of the coming technological innovations across the world.Just as there were fortunes made in prior generations, there will be big money made once again. In fact, I think this opportunity is even bigger because the leap ahead will drive other tech trends -- some of the most powerful the world has ever seen.Think of it as the next-generation toll road. The road to the future passes through 5G wireless technology, and it's time to set up our booth and start collecting. &quot;A Game Changer for Humanity&quot;&quot;Get ready,&quot; 5G &quot;is going to change EVERYTHING,&quot; says Forbes.ZDNet says it's so critical that it's going to &quot;replace the future.&quot;Financial Times calls it simply &quot;a game changer for humanity.&quot;5G is poised to fundamentally alter the very fabric of society. This tech is little-known (as of now), but it is going to be the centerpiece of an entire new generation of groundbreaking technologies. That's pretty heady stuff, and I completely agree.It is the key driver of what insiders are already calling the &quot;Next Industrial Revolution.&quot;In fact, that's exactly why USA Today claims &quot;it has the potential to usher in the fourth industrial revolution -- it's that massive.&quot;MIT calls it &quot;the next technological revolution.&quot;Tech insiders are already claiming the impact of 5G will be like the printing press, the internet, and the steam engine.That's why billionaire investors like Bill Gates and Ray Dalio are beginning to invest millions of dollars into this emerging tech. Companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are secretly making massive investments in it as well.Here's my prediction: If you invest in 5G today, it could be like getting in on the early days of Amazon, when investors could have made a massive 102,000% gain. Or Alphabet, which has allowed investors who bought when it first went public as Google to make more than 20 TIMES their money.I want to help you do that. How to Get StartedTech insiders estimate more than one trillion devices will be connected over the next 10 to 15 years. Automotive … financial services … agriculture … retail … defense … healthcare … manufacturing … media and entertainment … transportation … public safety … construction. It's all about to be revolutionized.The rollout of 5G is going to be MUCH bigger than 4G.4G was an improvement. 5G is a game changer.When exactly does all of this excitement happen? This time around, we have so many more applications in mind -- just waiting for this breakthrough. $53 TRILLION in new revenue will be added to the economy over the coming years, and those who become early backers of these technologies could make a fortune.It's already started.I believe 5G is so important to our world and to investors that I want to talk much more with you about it in the coming days. I want to make sure you understand what it is, why it's so revolutionary, and most importantly how to make money.I am incredibly excited about this the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I know you will be, too, as you learn more about it.

2019-09-13,"For a good portion of this year, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of the best-performing names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and impressive player among large- and meg-cap, mature technology companies.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Escalation of the U.S.-China trade spat vanquished the Cisco stock ebullience last month and the shares have only recent shown signs of snapping out of their doldrums. Though Cisco stock is up 3.12% for the week ending Sept. 12, the shares reside more than 14% below the 52-week high. Disappointing fiscal first-quarter guidance is one of the primary reasons why Cisco stock went from hero to dud in a matter of days.&quot;Cisco sees revenue for the quarter flat to up 2% compared with a year earlier, which implies a range of $3.1 billion to $3.36 billion, below the Street consensus at $3.4 billion,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;Cisco sees non-GAAP profit of 80 cents to 82 cents a share for the quarter, below consensus at 83 cents.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession Mr. Market was probably right to punish Cisco stock on the back of that poor profit preview. Think about the carnage in Cisco stock this way: investors embrace mature, older technology companies, like Cisco, for lack of earnings variability and volatility. If an investor wants growth and the risks that come with it, there are plenty of other places to be in tech.So when a company like Cisco disappoints on earnings or guidance, the repudiation is likely to be severe, as it recently has been for Cisco stock. Pep TalkThere's some good news as it pertains to Cisco stock, starting with the fact that it has some supporters on Wall Street and there may some underappreciated elements to the story here.Recently, Piper Jaffray analyst James Fish did a sum-of-the-parts analysis on Cisco and arrived the company being worth $244 billion, or $57 a share. That compares with a close just under $50 with a market value of $211 billion on Thursday, Sept 12. The analyst isn't saying Cisco can break up, but rather is pointing out growth opportunities in the name.As I've noted a couple of times here, Cisco is &quot;old school&quot; by the technology sector's standards, but that isn't a detraction. The company is heavily involved with some high-growth technology segments, including cloud computing, cybersecurity and Internet of Things (IoT).&quot;As networking teams are adopting cloud solutions, Cisco is proliferating software, analytics, wireless, and security offerings to satisfy nascent trends,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent research piece. &quot;With its extensive product portfolio, we see Cisco as the only one-stop-shop networking vendor. We believe Cisco's vast existing installation base and budding product offerings, like network monitoring and analytics, keep Cisco as an industry leader.&quot;With Cisco stock, investors get some leverage to fast-growing market segments, but the growth comes at a fairly reasonable price (about 15x forward earnings) and with a 2.80% dividend yield. There's Not Much Growth Ahead for CSCO, But Steadiness Should ReturnCisco will likely grow revenue at 3% to 4% over the next three or four fiscal years. That's nowhere growth stock territory, but if the company can offer modest surprises here and there with low earnings variability, conservative investors seeking technology exposure could be compelled to revisit Cisco stock.Increased device connectivity via the booming IoT market is another potential driver for Cisco stock, though one that's likely to be longer ranging in nature.&quot;The company's wireless segment is well positioned to capitalize on the growing number of devices touching networks,&quot; said Morningstar.Additionally, Cisco is an epic capital return story. The company has pledged to return 50% of cash flow to investors via dividends and buybacks. A decade ago, its annual dividend was 12 cents a share. Today, it's $1.40.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy If the company could push gross margins into the 65% area and operating margins into the 30% realm, those could be significant catalysts for Cisco stock over the medium term.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-17,"[Editor's note: &quot;5 Great Dividend Stocks to Buy From the Tech Sector&quot; was previously published in June 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]When most investors hunt for dividend stocks, the technology sector is often not on their shopping list. The perception is that most technology firms need and are forced to plow every extra cent back into their businesses in order to fuel growth. As a result, tech stocks are seen as a strictly capital appreciation element for a portfolio.However, this isn't true at all. Tech stocks make for amazing dividend stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe reality is, that many firms in the tech sector are cash flow and profit machines. Thanks to surging revenues and high margins, mature tech firms simply mint money at this point. So much, in fact, that many have too much money sitting on their balance sheets. To rid themselves of that excess cash, many tech stocks have started paying some hefty dividends. And they have been growing those dividends by leaps and bounds too.In the end, when looking for dividend stocks, the technology sector should be the first stop for portfolios rather than an afterthought. But which tech stocks have what it takes to be considered good dividend stocks as well?  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Here are five that are worthy of consideration. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.8%No list of dividend stocks in the tech sector can be written without the firm that started the modern trend of payouts from tech. We're talking about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). CSCO started paying a token dividend back in 2011 and hasn't looked back, growing that payout by more than 480%. And it's easy to see why Cisco has become such a dividend stalwart.Sensing a slowdown in networking, router and physical equipment sales, CSCO started to pivot into more software and services. Cloud computing, cybersecurity and other such products have quickly become big-time money makers for the firm. Perhaps, more importantly, these sales come with higher margins, reoccurrence and the ability to add value/upsell networking transactions. &quot;We just built you this massive network for your cloud operations. Would you like us to secure it as well?&quot;Because of this, CSCO has become a cash flow giant.In fiscal Q3  alone, the firm managed to generate a 16% jump in operating cash flows once adjusting to overseas taxes paid for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, cash on CSCO's balance sheet has swelled to more than $34.6 billion.With sales of software/services continuing to rise, CSCO should be able to keep bringing in the cash for the long haul. Even better is that the growth in data centers and 5G networking is once again boosting equipment sales.At the end of the day, Cisco is one of the best dividend stocks to buy -- tech sector or not. Seagate Technology (STX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.5%Like previously mentioned Cisco, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) may seem like a relic from the dot-com days. However, STX has managed to see plenty of new life in recent years. The key is data center demand is making one heck of a dividend stock.For many years after the dot-com bust, STX struggled. The rise of mobile and tablet computing crimped PC sales. At the same time, flash-based solid-state drives (SSD) hit Seagate's platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs) right in the wallet. SSDs are faster, smaller, and more power-efficient. Manufacturers liked these facts and started favoring them in PCS and other devices. As a result, STX stocks stagnated and was looking like a lost cause.That is until cloud computing and data center demand started to take over.It turns out, those building out networks and data centers prefer capacity over speed. That makes HHDs much better suited for this application. Since Seagate dove into SSD production -- like rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- it's been able to reap the full benefits of this expansion. In fiscal 2019, STX managed to produce $1.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $1.8 billion of free cash flows from higher drive demand.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip And naturally, Seagate has been rewarding investors with that extra cash. Today, shares yield a tech-sector high 4.5%. Apple (AAPL)Source:  Yuanbin Du Via FlickrDividend Yield: 1.4%$95 billion.That's a big number. It also happens to be the amount of cash Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has on its balance sheet. This makes the consumer tech company one of the most cash-rich firms on the planet. That fact alone could make it a big buy. But the fact that Apple has quickly become one of the leading dividend stocks and continues to increase its buyback programs makes it a big buy right now.The key is that Apple has been able to use its vast cadre of devices to sell apps, music, movies and games. This helps Apple produce plenty of cash flows. Meanwhile, its shift into various services and other add-ons for its customers have only enhanced its cash flows further. So, even though AAPL has been handing out plenty of cash to investors, its over cash balance continues to hover over that $200 billion mark. Last year, Apple spent more than $74 billion on buybacks and raised its dividend by roughly 5.5%.With new devices hitting the markets and a focus on building out content for those devices, Apple should have no problem growing that cash balance far into the future. That should make dividend investors happy. And while there are some risks with revenue slowdowns and Chinese trade, that massive cash pile provides such a huge cushion to keep the dividend grow going.With that, Apple is still one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Equinix (EQIX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.8%One of the biggest trends in tech continues to be the growth of cloud computing and mobile access. Any time you use an app to go shopping or check your bank balance, you're tapping into a data center far away. It turns out that's a very good business to be in. Just ask Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).EQIX is the world's largest owners of these data centers -- with more than 200 under its umbrella. The key is that EQIX doesn't actually own or really operate the centers, it's a real estate investment trust (REITs). That is, it owns the specialized buildings and rents space inside to firms to build their required computing needs. It's essentially an apartment building owner for computers.Given the continued surge in data center demand from e-commerce, cloud computing, and mobile operations, EQIX has been sitting pretty over the last few years. In Q2, its net income jumped 22%  versus Q1. This continues the REIT's string of strong performance.The data center giant has paid plenty of special stock dividends to its shareholders and has managed to grow its cash payout by 45% since 2014.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip With continued demand for data centers assured, EQIX is the best dividend stock to play tech's backbone. Shares currently yield 1.8%. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (TDIV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.4%Considering that this list didn't even touch such amazing tech dividend stocks like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or even Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), one approach could be to think broad. There are plenty of tech ETFs on the market, but only the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (NYSEArca:TDIV) tackles the sector with a dividend approach.The $1 billion fund tracks an index that screens for tech stocks that have paid a regular or common dividend within the past 12 months and haven't cut the payout either. This provides exposure to all the top names in tech that pay dividends -- currently at 92 different stocks. This includes all the names on this list as well. That focus also throws off a surprising amount of income as well. Today, TDIV has an SEC 30-day yield of nearly 3.17%. That's' better than the S&P 500 and current yields on Treasury bonds.And as a total return component, TDIV has been top notch. Since its inception in 2012, the ETF has roughly doubled in share price and managed to produce an average annual return of around 12%. That's around the same as the S&P 500. The key is that TDIV has been less volatile than the broader index. Less volatile than all the tech stocks in the broader index as well. The secret is in the power of the dividends.All in all, for investors looking to score some hefty dividends from tech and take advantage of the sector's growth, TDIV could be the best way to capture those benefits.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. unveiled an operating system that runs without the need for human oversight, part of a raft of new software tools meant to ease the company’s rocky transition to cloud computing.The operating system expands Oracle’s line of autonomous products beyond databases, the company’s flagship software. Chairman Larry Ellison announced the new Linux-based product Monday during remarks at OpenWorld, Oracle’s annual user conference in San Francisco.“If you eliminate human error in autonomous systems, you eliminate data theft,” Ellison said on stage. The feature makes Oracle’s products more secure than those sold by cloud leader Amazon Web Services, he said.Ellison said the operating system, which the company’s Autonomous Database runs on, will update itself without any downtime.The world’s second-largest software maker has sought to revive sales growth after years of almost stagnant revenue. Oracle hopes that a lineup of “self-driving” programs could help differentiate the company’s offerings against products from Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Those companies are the top two in the market to rent storage and computing power, which is projected to reach almost $39 billion in 2019. The tools may also entice longtime Oracle customers to upgrade their technology to take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.Oracle disclosed last week that Mark Hurd, one of the company’s two chief executive officers, would take a leave of absence to treat an unspecified illness. Ellison and Oracle’s other CEO, Safra Catz, said they would fill in for Hurd, who has overseen the company’s sales and marketing efforts.The Redwood City, California-based company also announced a variety of changes and new programs to bolster its partner ecosystem:Oracle unveiled an agreement with VMware Inc. to bring virtualization software to Oracle’s cloud, similar to deals VMware has signed with Microsoft and Google.Customers will be able to buy software made by other companies in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace, which may help company partners including Cisco Systems Inc. and Palo Alto Networks Inc.Oracle also said it expanded a relationship with cybersecurity company McAfee Inc. to bring its security incident software to Oracle’s infrastructure cloud.Ellison said Oracle would offer a free version of its Cloud Infrastructure, giving developers, students and others perpetual access to the company’s autonomous database, computing and storage.The company plans to launch 20 additional cloud data-center hubs, called “regions,” by the end of 2020. Ellison said the company would have more regions around the world than AWS.Oracle will let customers run the autonomous database in their own data centers next year, and unveiled new servers with updated memory components from Intel Corp.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Oracle Unveils More Autonomous Software to Boost Cloud Growth

2019-09-18,"There's a simple bull case for Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock at the moment. 5G rollouts worldwide should drive demand growth for Nokia products. The company itself is projecting sharp earnings growth in 2020. And NOK stock is cheap, at 11.7x the midpoint of 2020 EPS guidance.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com That said, there's also a simple bear case for Nokia stock: we've been here before. NOK stock seemingly has been a turnaround play for most of this decade - and had similarly impressive near-term catalysts along the way.None of those catalysts have reversed the trend. NOK stock is down 40% over the past five years, and has lost two-thirds of its value in the last decade. Maybe this time is different - but the history of the tech industry, too, suggests a difficult path to upside, even with a current valuation that looks rather cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips NOK Stock Has Been Here BeforeAs I detailed earlier this year, Nokia has had chances to drive growth -- and reverse the narrative surrounding the stock. The $7 billion sale of the company's phone business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) turned out to be a brilliant deal. Microsoft wound up losing at least $8 billion, and finally exited at a sale price of just $350 million. Yet the huge cash infusion did little for NOK stock.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Indeed, Nokia used that cash to help bankroll its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, which was to make the company a networking giant. That thesis didn't pan out. The company then re-entered the phone business. That plan hasn't worked.The story now is 5G. An admittedly strong second quarter earnings report contained positive news about customer retention in the shift from 4G. Nokia expects the full benefit to start hitting its P&L in 2020. And the staggered pace of the global rollout suggests that demand should continue for years to come.That said, Nokia already has admitted that it will struggle to hit its 2019 EPS guidance. Wall Street, for what it's worth, is betting against 2020 projections as well. Consensus of $0.40 is below the company's range of €0.37-€0.42 ($0.41-$0.45). The story is attractive -- but it's been attractive before. For this entire decade, Nokia simply hasn't been able to fulfill its potential. Is Nokia Stock an Outlier in Tech?To be fair, it's not easy to execute a turnaround, particularly in tech. There are no shortage of companies who, like Nokia, have struggled to adapt.There have been some winners. Microsoft itself is the most obvious one. It was only six years ago that Microsoft stock had traded sideways for a decade. Earnings growth had been minimal for years. Microsoft is now the most valuable company in the world.But Microsoft is a software play. In hardware, products can become 'commoditized'. And competition from China, in particular, is much stiffer. Indeed, Huawei has taken significant market share, with its political worries another potential tailwind for NOK stock.And in hardware, turnarounds have been difficult. IBM (NYSE:IBM) touched a nine-year low late last year. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has returned 9% over the past two years while broad markets have risen sharply. Blackberry (NASDAQ:BB) has been a perpetual &quot;next year&quot; story as both a hardware play and, more recently, a software play. Post-split gains for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) have stalled out. Nokia rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) is down 37% over the past five years, a performance in line with that of Nokia stock.There's really only old-line large-cap hardware play that has driven consistent gains: Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). And that company has scale and market dominance that Nokia simply doesn't have.To be sure, history alone doesn't suggest that NOK stock can't rally this time. There is an opportunity in 5G. The hit to Huawei's reputation at least weakens a key competitor. And Nokia stock is cheap enough if guidance is hit.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars But NOK also is a classic &quot;this time is different&quot; case. And as the old saw goes, those are the four most dangerous words in investing. That's been true in the past for Nokia and many similar tech plays. It could be true this time as well.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Datadog set its IPO pricing range at $24 to $26 a share on Tuesday, up from a previous range of $19 to $22 a share.

2019-09-25,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average’s recent gain has Wall Street taking notice. Despite some shakiness in the last five days, the index which contains 30 American blue chip stocks, has been outpacing the NASDAQ in the last month. The Dow has climbed 4% compared to the NASDAQ’s 2% gain over the same time period. Bearing this in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to see how 3 of the index’s tech stocks stack up against each other based on analyst consensus and upside potential.Let’s get started. Microsoft CorporationEven with Microsoft’s (MSFT&#92;- Get Report) already impressive 35% year-to-date gain, some analysts believe the company is just getting started.Its Azure cloud gives MSFT the advantage over its competitors as it’s the only cloud that extends to the edge, spanning identity, management and security. Azure is also the most open cloud, with the company expanding its partnerships with VMware (VMW), Oracle (ORCL) and Red Hat during Q4 2019.Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss believes MSFT can achieve “durable double digit growth based on the expansive Azure opportunity”. The five-star analyst also deems the company as the “best positioned name in tech for the emerging Hybrid Cloud architectures”. This is evidenced by the commercial cloud segment’s gross margin expansion to 63% in the most recent quarter. Adding to the good news, the company announced on September 19 that it was increasing its dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share and agreed to a maximum of $40 billion of buybacks. Its dividend yield is now at 1.48%. Based on all of the above factors, Weiss maintains his bullish thesis. On September 23, he reiterated his Buy rating and $155 price target, indicating 13% upside potential. The rest of Wall Street mirrors the analyst’s sentiment. With 22 Buy ratings compared to 1 Hold and 1 Sell, the word on the Street is that MSFT is a ‘Strong Buy’. Its $153 average price target suggests 12% upside potential.   Apple Inc.  Some investors have expressed concerns that 5G won’t be enough to revive Apple’s (AAPL&#92;- Get Report) declining iPhone sales. However, several analysts believe that 5G as well as its new services are capable of driving even more gains on top of its 38% year-to-date growth. While iPhones aren’t expected to be equipped with 5G capabilities until 2020, the new technology could drive substantial upside for AAPL. According to the consensus estimate, 5G iPhone sales could reach 190 million in 2021. That being said, Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy believes this figure should be much higher with his estimates putting sales at 208 million units. This prompted him to initiate coverage with a Buy and set a $260 price target on September 24. He thinks that shares could surge 19% in the next twelve months. It should be noted that AAPL still has a lot going for it even before the arrival of 5G iPhones. Based on a survey conducted by Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson, there’s strong demand for lower priced phone models. This is good news for the company as Apple just announced on September 10 that it cut the price tag for its iPhone 11 model. On the same day, the tech giant launched a revamped smart watch and broke the news that its Apple TV+ streaming service would cost much less than Disney’s (DIS) and Netflix’s (NFLX).  “While FY20 will prove to be a transition year for iPhone ahead of 5G devices coming late next year as consumers buy less high-end models, as long as services revenue and non-iPhone devices continue to perform well, this should tide investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones intensifies,” Olson explained. As a result, the five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating and $243 price target on September 23. His price target reflects his confidence in AAPL’s ability to gain 12% in the next twelve months. Wall Street is more cautious when it comes to AAPL. With 17 Buy ratings, 14 Holds and 2 Sells assigned in the last three months, the Dow stock is a ‘Moderate Buy’. Given its already substantial year-to-date growth, its $225 average price target implies 3% upside potential.  Cisco Systems Inc. The last of the Dow tech stocks on our list is considered to be somewhat underappreciated by investors. Nonetheless, Cisco (CSCO&#92;- Get Report) could see shares surge on top of its 13% year-to-date gain thanks to 5G. While it’s known as a networking hardware and telecommunications technology producer, CSCO is one of the many companies that wants to make a name for itself as a key player in the 5G space. Its 5G PowerX provides users with an open, hyper-programmable architecture to transform a multivendor or multidomain network into a unified system. This architecture makes it easier to manage bandwidth, enable network control for applications and provide network topology support. The company has also demonstrated progress in its efforts to shift towards a more free-cash-flow-based and predictable business model. Not to mention CSCO offers investors a dividend yield of 2.85% and an annualized payout of $1.40. “The transition CSCO is undergoing merits investors focusing more on a FCF-based valuation vs. traditional price-to-earnings approach,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani commented. He also added that his bullish stance can be attributed to CSCO’s ability to support the bandwidth requirements with an incremental approach to 5G technologies. As a result, the five-star analyst initiated coverage with a Buy and set a $60 price target on September 11. He thinks share prices could jump 22% over the next twelve months. All in all, Wall Street is optimistic about CSCO. The consensus among analysts is that it’s a ‘Moderate Buy’, with CSCO receiving 16 Buy ratings vs 7 Holds over the last three months. Its $56 average price target suggests 15% upside potential.   The Bottom Line There isn’t a clear winner when it comes to the 3 Dow tech stocks we mentioned. In terms of analyst consensus, MSFT comes out on top. However, CSCO surpasses MSFT and AAPL with respect to upside potential and beats MSFT's dividend yield.

2019-09-25,Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferre joins YFi AM to discuss what is happening in the market.,Major indexes mixed with Trump memo out
2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. founder Ren Zhengfei is ready to license his fifth-generation networking technology only to one other company -- and he wants that potential arch-rival to be American.The army officer-turned-billionaire reiterated an offer Thursday to license out Huawei’s full portfolio of 5G wireless technology -- which would include chip designs, hardware and source code -- to a single, exclusive licensee. That should be a U.S. company because Europe is home to close competitors like Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB and doesn’t need help to compete, he added.Huawei, accused by Donald Trump’s administration of aiding Beijing in spying while spearheading China’s tech-superpower ambitions, is trying to claw back business and shore up trust in its products. Ren reaffirmed an earlier estimate that U.S. sanctions could depress the company’s sales by $10 billion annually. His lieutenants have lately echoed his 5G licensing proposal to reassure foreign customers Huawei’s gear is free of security loopholes. But a willing buyer has yet to emerge.“We would like to offer an exclusive license to one company from the West so that it’s able to achieve economies of scale to support a business,” Ren said in a live-streamed discussion with visiting foreign academics. “With this one company, I think it should be a U.S. company.”Read more: China’s Huawei Woos Tech World With $1.5 Billion and 5G SecretsCritics charge that intellectual property theft from the likes of Cisco Systems Inc. and Motorola Solutions Inc. helped Huawei vault into the upper echelons of telecommunications providers, while Ren and his executives credit years of investment and research. The wireless giant is now accelerating spending on artificial intelligence chips and mobile software. It’s mobilizing its employees to source or develop alternatives to American circuitry and software to keep its edge in smartphones and next-generation 5G wireless technology.Huawei is on track to produce 600,000 base stations this year and 1.5 million of those the next. The company can make it happen without American components but it would prefer buying from U.S. suppliers, Ren said.The billionaire has gone from recluse to media maven in the span of months as he fights to save the $100-billion company he founded. The 74-year-old billionaire has taken the lead in Huawei’s defense after the arrest of eldest daughter and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou as part of a broader probe into the company. He’s since become a central figure in a U.S.-Chinese conflict that’s potentially the most important episode to shape world affairs since the collapse of the Soviet Union.“As time goes by, trust levels will increase,” he said during a discussion with Stanford lecturer Jerry Kaplan and fellow academic Peter Cochrane. “If we’re talking about a tech decoupling or separate governance, I don’t think it’s possible.”Read more: Billionaire Huawei Founder Defiant in Face of Existential ThreatTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei Billionaire Dangles 5G Secrets to Create a U.S. Foe

2019-10-11,"Wall Street is breathing easier today. But given that it is October and the art of deal-making is far from certain these days, investors can tread more confidently if they choose income-generating, blue-chip stocks that are well-positioned for winning the trade war. Let me explain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is nearly through the first half of October -- a month notorious for spooking investors -- and so far a market correction still hasn't happened. That's not to say the period hasn't been without incident or that a correction won't make an appearance this year. The fact is elevated volatility, back-and-forth political intrigue and mixed economic data offering jeers and cheers have been a staple on Wall Street this month. Nevertheless, a pullback which saw blue-chip stocks lose as much as 4.25% in early October has been completely retraced as of Friday's intraday trade.So, where exactly does that leave investors, other than a flat October, which may feel like a victory?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven that deal-making hasn't been a proven hallmark of U.S. President Donald Trump, I'm not holding my breath that today's market optimism for a partial trade deal with China won't be derailed by a tweet or temper tantrum. Of course, something else out of left field or maybe the continued saga of Donald and the Giant Impeach could always find Wall Street pulling up its bootstraps and getting defensive again.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now With all of that said, I'm recommending investors stick with blue-chip stocks. Risk-assets of this caliber have prevailed over bear markets, weathered all sorts of political theater and will pay investors for their patience. And right now three of these names also enjoy negotiating power for bulls on the price charts. Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Disney (DIS)Disney (NYSE:DIS) is the first of the blue-chip stocks to buy. The diversified entertainment giant hit all-time-highs in late July fueled by a breakout from a near three-year long triangle pattern.Shares of this blue-chip pay investors a below-market dividend of 1.36%. That's nothing to write home about, but it's a little something for your time. Moreover, DIS stock offers investors nice prospects for continued growth. And my guess is Disney's deeper move into the streaming market with Disney+ later this year and against the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), will prove to be the company's newest stock booster.With an oversold DIS stock pulling back to test its 40-week simple moving average, lower Bollinger Band and 50% retracement level in an inside doji bottoming pattern, this blue-chip stock is nearly ready to buy.DIS Stock Strategy: My advice is to buy DIS stock on confirmation of the two-week candlestick bottoming pattern as shares trade through $131.78. I'd give this blue-chip stock a bit of wiggle room, but if shares fall below $126.50, exiting the position and keeping the powder dry for stronger opportunities makes sense. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the next of our blue-chip stocks to buy. And you can thank Goldman Sachs for putting CSCO stock into a better position for buying. On Thursday, the investment firm warned Cisco's enterprise revenues will weaken while its telecom spending will remain at depressed levels. Investors reacted by sending shares down 1.47%.The combination in CSCO stock I'm looking at is much more upbeat. Today's buyers can get into this blue-chip as it offers a 3% yield backed by price action that's setting up a corrective double-bottom inside a very strong technical support zone.  * 10 Winning Stocks to Buy and Stick With for the Long Haul CSCO Stock Strategy: My advice in this blue-chip stock is to buy shares next week if the hammer candlestick is confirmed above $48.13. All chips are off the table if the pattern fails and investors would be smart to exit or risk a much larger correction toward possibly $40 a share. AT&T (T)Not that I've saved the best for last, but AT&T (NYSE:T) is a blue-chip stock whose attractive income stream of 5.50%, relative strength and pattern on the price chart make it ripe for buying.Shares are in position to stage a breakout from a tight multi-week consolidation that has found support from prior highs and above T stock's cup-shaped base of nearly 2.5-years. Bullish investors might also see the current pattern as a &quot;high&quot; handle formation. Either way, the price action bodes well for a continued rally into 2020.T Stock Strategy: The plan for buying this blue-chip stock is simple. Wait for T stock to trade above resistance and purchase shares through $38.22. And respect the pattern low for exiting if needed, as an even larger yield may not be worth the trouble.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-10-11,"Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock has plateaued. SHOP had  a massive run-up, as Shopify stock more than tripled in eight months. However, SHOP stock pulled back dramatically in August and has traded in a range since that time.Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Now many wonder what SHOP stock will do next. Will it retest its all-time high of $409.61 per share or will it resume its decline? Imagine the UnimaginableShopify stock is a long-term winner. However, the owners of SHOP stock have a lot to worry about in both the short and the medium term.  InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango, a SHOP bull, described the recent 23% decline since August as a normal, healthy pullback. Stocks that are in a longer-term rally commonly undergo such declines, and he may well be correct.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 However, the behavior of SHOP stock could also serve as a reminder that the &quot;unimaginable&quot; routinely occurs in the stock market. Unfortunately, SHOP stock is poised for a massive drop if investors' sentiment turns negative.Shopify stock still trades at 330 times its  forward earnings. At that level, it would have to fall almost 90% from its all-time high before it would no longer be overvalued by traditional standards.But such drops happen even to even to solid companies. In September of last year, many thought Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could do no wrong as NVDA stock climbed north of $290 per share. I can also remember when people thought the same about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). At one point in early 2000, CSCO rose above $80 per share, briefly becoming the world's most valuable stock.However, NVDA stock lost about 60% in less than three months last year. Cisco would go on to lose 90% of its value over two years as the tech boom went bust. Nearly 20 years later, CSCO stock has not yet regained its all-time high. Competitors, Economy Could Hurt ShopifyBut is it possible that those who are bullish on SHOP stock will be proven correct? Of course. The unimaginable happens every day. InvestorPlace contributor and Shopify stock bull Nicolas Chahine predicts that, &quot;the breakout in either direction will be strong.&quot; I agree with his assertion.Still, many signs indicate that SHOP stock cannot continue to trade at such high valuations. Unlike some other stocks that have broken out to the same extent, Shopify has competition. WordPress developers tend to gravitate toward WooCommerce. Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) purchase of Magento has made ADBE a competitor of SHOP.Furthermore, if a recession occurs, it will probably hit the small and medium-sized business that Shopify serves will be especially hard-hit. Shopify could attract new business as unemployed workers scramble for a way to earn money. However, that turnover will create uncertainty that could lead investors to question the high valuation of SHOP stock. How to Trade SHOP StockSHOP stock could move back to its record high or even beyond.But Shopify stock looks like a bubble. Virtually no company can justify a 330 forward price-earnings ratio, regardless of  its performance. Investors also need to remember that even the seemingly most solid of companies can lose almost all of their value.Despite the high price of Shopify stock, I see SHOP as a long-term winner.  Even with the rising competition in the e-commerce space, businesses often choose SHOP when they want an e-commerce platform that's not tied to Amazon or other large tech firms. Although a recession could disrupt the company's growth for awhile, its business has just scratched the surface of its potential, given the explosive outlook of e-commerce. Shopify will benefit as more businesses utilize e-commerce.Unfortunately, in light of the sky-high valuation of SHOP stock, investors do not know whether these catalysts will boost SHOP stock within several days or several years. That makes SHOP too risky to buy at its current levels.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-10-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s revenue jumped 24% in 2019’s first nine months, defying Trump administration sanctions to sustain growth in its pivotal smartphone business.China’s largest technology company reported revenue of 610.8 billion yuan ($86.1 billion) in the January to September period. Global smartphone shipments jumped 26% in the first three quarters to over 185 million units, helping safeguard its position as the world’s second largest name in mobile devices.China’s largest technology company managed to grow revenue despite curbs on the export of crucial American software and components, which executives had warned for months would severely crimp both its networking and smartphone businesses. Huawei has said it expects U.S. export restrictions to reduce annual revenue at its consumer devices business by about $10 billion, in part because Google can no longer supply Android updates and apps from Gmail to Maps for the Chinese company’s newest handsets.The company’s reported results -- which were unaudited -- suggest that those restrictions have yet to severely impair the business. Huawei, accused by Donald Trump’s administration of aiding Beijing in spying while spearheading China’s tech-superpower ambitions, is trying to claw back business and shore up trust in its products.Billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has warned his tech empire faces a “live or die moment,” and mobilized thousands of staff to work around the clock devising alternatives to American technology. Some American giants, including Intel Corp. and Micron Technologies Inc., have said they’re found ways to resume supplying Huawei, a major boost for the Chinese company.Huawei Sales Growth Slumps as U.S. Sanctions Start to BiteIts phone shipments in 2019 suggest its lead in the Chinese market, the world’s largest, is offsetting weak sales abroad. Huawei shipped more than 206 million smartphones in 2018, according to research firm IDC. The company is betting on its home turf and upcoming holiday season to drive its smartphone sales for the rest of the year. It aims to take half of the smartphone market in China, Bloomberg News reported earlier.There are signs also that U.S. efforts to block Huawei from the development of 5G technology are flagging: Huawei said Wednesday it has signed more than 60 5G commercial contracts to date worldwide. A senior executive in India for the company said the government there had given “no negative feedback” on Huawei, while in Germany, one of the biggest European markets, the Merkel administration said Huawei’s equipment will not be excluded in future 5G procurement. Huawei’s biggest bet, however, remains in China, where state-owned carriers are ready to build their own 5G networks.It remains unclear whether prolonged sanctions will eventually rob Huawei of growth, something Ren himself has warned may happen. Huawei remains at the heart of U.S. tensions with China, a symbol of the Asian country’s rising technological might.Critics charge that intellectual property theft from the likes of Cisco Systems Inc. and Motorola Solutions Inc. helped Huawei vault into the upper echelons of telecommunications providers, though Ren and his executives credit years of investment and research. The wireless giant is now accelerating spending on artificial intelligence chips and mobile software. It’s mobilizing its employees to source or develop alternatives to American circuitry and software to keep its edge in smartphones and next-generation 5G wireless technology.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Huawei Defies U.S. Ban With Strong Growth in Smartphone Sales

2019-10-22,"(Bloomberg) -- About eight months after its last funding round, data analytics startup Databricks Inc. said on Tuesday that it has raised $400 million from investors, bringing its funding total to nearly $900 million.The latest deal values Databricks at $6.2 billion, more than double the $2.75 billion price tag investors gave the company in February. The funding round included existing backers Microsoft Corp. and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as new investors Tiger Global Management, and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc.Ben Horowitz, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner, praised Databricks Chief Executive Officer Ali Ghodsi: “Ali is the best CEO that I’ve ever worked with,” and added that many companies struggled with making sense of their data. “AI-based insight is extremely difficult,” Horowitz said. “Databricks simplifies it from a performance standpoint that makes it easy and practical.”Databricks has more than 5,000 customers, including Viacom Inc., HP Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., Ghodsi said. The startup sells tools aimed at helping those companies organize their data, and uses artificial intelligence to enable them to understand and search for information. Microsoft is both an investor in and a partner of Databricks, and integrates a version of the startup’s software into its cloud product, Microsoft Azure.Databricks more than doubled its annual recurring revenue over the last year, the company said. If it extrapolated out its most recent quarterly revenue for the next year, annual sales would total more than $200 million. “We’ve had tremendous traction,” Ghodsi said.The six-year-old San Francisco-based startup plans to use some of its new cash influx on overseas hiring. “The biggest engineering issue we’ve faced in the last two years has been with visas,” Ghodsi said. “It’s been harder to get employees to the United States because of green card issues and visa issues. It’s also been harder to keep our employees here in the U.S.”In part to address that problem, Databricks will spend about $111 million on its new European Development Center in Amsterdam over the next three years. The company has tripled the size of its engineering team in the Dutch city in the past two years. “What we are finding is it’s easier and less expensive to hire anywhere than in San Francisco,” said Horowitz, who is on the Databricks board. He added that there’s room for expansion in Europe.On Tuesday, Databricks also announced it had hired Dave Conte as its new chief financial officer. Conte previously spent eight years as the CFO of Splunk Inc., where he helped take the company public.(Company corrects the number of customers in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Candy Cheng in San Francisco at ccheng86@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Databricks Doubles Valuation to $6 Billion in Eight Months
2019-10-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nokia Oyj only really has two competitors in the telecoms equipment business, and one of them — China’s Huawei Technologies Co. — has been all but banned from much of the market. At the same time, phone companies are opening their checkbooks for a new generation of 5G technology that’s only supplied by Nokia, Huawei and the other big rival, Ericsson AB.Pretty ripe conditions for a thriving business? Not for Nokia. The Finnish company on Thursday cut its profit outlook for this year and next, and suspended a dividend payout. Nokia shares fell the most in 19 years. Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri urgently needs to stop the bleeding.With a new burst of infrastructure spending by the big telecoms carriers, mobile networks should be a bright spot for equipment makers. Yet they’re Nokia’s biggest problem. Revenue from this business grew just 4.4% in the three months through September. Sales at Ericsson’s networks arm (which includes more than just mobile products) rose 9% in the same period.Ericsson’s performance may be flattered by its decision to cut prices to attract new customers, and then look to make bigger profit from long-term service contracts. Nokia is wary of copying this strategy, which has gone wrong for its Swedish rival in the past after the long-term revenue didn’t appear.But that caution isn’t helping. The gross profit margin at Nokia’s network arm still fell to 29% in the third quarter, down from 34% a year earlier. Suri ascribes that to the higher cost of 5G components. Because adoption of the technology isn’t yet widespread, economies of scale haven’t lowered its expenses. Unfortunately for Suri, Ericsson’s gross margin in the most similar part of its business increased slightly over the same period.Nordea Bank analyst Sami Sarkamies reckons Nokia simply lags behind Ericsson technologically. That makes Nokia’s equipment more expensive to produce. With the company still having to try to compete with Ericsson on price, this erodes profitability.Thursday’s share price decline has erased more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of Nokia’s market value, leaving it capitalized at 21 billion euros. That’s big, but not too big to be an acquisition target. American authorities are eager to beef up the 5G capabilities in the U.S., given China’s relative strength, so maybe a company like Cisco Systems Inc. or Qualcomm Inc. might be persuaded. A bid at the shares’ one-year-high, touched in January, would represent a 50% premium over where the stock was trading on Thursday. It’s far from certain that would overcome Finland’s concerns about losing a national champion, but it might at least make it think.

2019-10-27,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports its earnings on Monday, Oct. 28 after the bell. The Google parent continues as a wellspring for innovation. However, Google stock has thus far reflected the value of its creations poorly. Alphabet may excite investors with earnings, revenue or guidance. However, if it wants to deliver more significant gains to shareholders, they should consider looking at something besides financials.Source: turtix / Shutterstock.com Wall Street predicts that the company will earn $12.38 per share in its third quarter. If that forecast holds, that will represent a 5.2% decline from the same quarter last year when profits came in at $13.06 per share. Analysts also project revenues of $40.3 billion for the quarter. That would come in 19.5% higher than the year-ago revenue figure of $33.7 billion.From a fundamentals standpoint, Google stock looks like a buy. It appears history will look at the quarterly earnings drop as an anomaly. Analysts project profit growth of 11.3% this year and 14.3% in fiscal 2020. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 22.7, I would call this fairly valued, or perhaps slightly undervalued.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore importantly, it goes far beyond dominating internet search or powering mobile devices through its Android operating system. It succeeds in so many industries that it has become more of a conglomerate than a tech company in many respects. Alphabet leads the way in self-driving cars through Waymo and it researches health applications through Verily Life Sciences. It even leads in some unexpected areas. An Iowa State University study found that academic researchers prefer to use its Google Scholar research tool, for example. GOOGL Holds Tremendous Unlocked ValueAnalysts will probably look for many different things in the earnings report. Some will tell people to look for revenue and earnings, something GOOGL stock accomplishes most of the time. Others may say to pay attention to the guidance.As for me, I wonder when the company plans to unlock its value? InvestorPlace's Will Ashworth says that it will &quot;generate cash at a tremendous rate.&quot; With $121.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the second quarter, he's right. This makes it all the more mind-boggling that they do not follow the lead of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and pay a dividend. * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income Moreover, the companies Alphabet has created under its umbrella hold tremendous value. About 86% of Alphabet's revenue in the last quarter came from advertising. Everyone knows that percentage will fall. Indeed, many of its creations will drive future profit growth. However, the need to hold on to innovations has locked up hundreds of billions in market value.In my previous articles about Google stock, I keep going back to the estimate that places the value of Waymo at $175 billion. Moreover, going back to Will Ashworth's article, he valued the cash hoard alone at $175 per share. Take these as well as Alphabet's other businesses, and the current $874 billion market cap appears low. If GOOGL stock could more closely reflect the sum of its parts instead of the value of its whole, I could see it going much higher. The Bottom Line on Google StockGoogle stock could surge higher if it used the earnings report as an occasion to unlock some of the company's value. Analysts can speculate on how earnings, revenue and guidance will look after the release of the third-quarter report on Oct. 28.However, if the company wants to send Google stock higher, it should bring some of its value to the forefront. The current Alphabet stock price stands at around $1,260 per share. Though that comes close to all-time highs, GOOGL stock has never moved above $1,300 per share.Unlocking value would take Google stock to levels far above $1,300 per share. It would also mean that GOOGL could finally benefit from more of the success of its parent company.This hope may make a speculative position in Google stock worthwhile. Also, with double-digit profit growth, GOOGL probably rises longer term. However, unlocking value will likely make the difference between growing slowly or rapidly. I hope the company makes the latter possible.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-10-30,"Stock buybacks are big business. In the second quarter of 2019 alone, S&P; 500 companies spent almost $165 billion on share repurchases - and that was 26% less than the record high spent in Q4 2018.But it's still a big number. &quot;While the decline is significant compared to 2018, it remains higher than the pre-2018 levels,&quot; writes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices.Buybacks yield several benefits. Among them, given the simple math of calculating earnings per share (EPS) - total earnings divided by total shares outstanding - buying back shares can &quot;juice&quot; the EPS figure. Moreover, they tilt supply and demand in shareholders' favor. If a company takes shares off the market, in theory, it should make the remaining ones worth more.But are stock buybacks a reason to buy? Not on their own. But they are one of several material signs - dividend programs, manageable or no debt, intelligent capital expenditures - that a company is putting its stock in a position to succeed.Here are six stocks to buy that have spent considerably on stock buybacks over the past few years.

The chatter is that Beijing wants a meaningful rollback in recent tariff increases; not merely a halt to new tariffs.As a result, the major averages are pulling back slightly from their recent push to record highs.But the bigger story is that sentiment is evaporating for all those recent ultra-hyped IPOs that attracted billions in market value from venture capital investors only to wilt under the spotlight of the public markets.

The company reported a net loss of $1.2 billion for the quarter despite top-line growth as the ride share business steadfastly refuses to enjoy economies of scale.Management is looking to achieve profitability by the end of 2021, largely on the back of food delivery, which is another ultra-competitive marketplace. Zoom (ZM)Video meeting service provider Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) continues to test its post-IPO lows near the $60-a-share threshold, down some 40% from the high hit back in June.

2019-11-08,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.U.S. stocks keep rising, with all three major indices at all-time highs. Those gains represent a welcome change in pattern for the market. After all, the fear just a few weeks ago was that history might repeat.Last year's fourth quarter saw equities plunge amid cyclical fears. The peak of last quarter's earnings season led to a 6% decline in major indices in just six sessions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis time has been different, however. Earnings reports have been well-received. Cyclical fears appear to have receded, as housing stocks continue to soar and even major industrials have gained nicely.That said, risks remain. The trade war remains unresolved. The U.S. presidential election is less than a year away, which combined with an impeachment process could increase volatility in the equity market. And with the U.S. economy now in an unprecedented eleventh consecutive year of expansion, fears that a recession is &quot;due&quot; can return at any time.Meanwhile, the earnings calendar might lack some of the market's biggest names -- but it's hardly empty. A number of key companies release earnings reports this week and next, as companies on the retail fiscal calendar report. Next week's reports look particularly important, as they include leaders from several key sectors.  * 7 of the Best Internet Stocks to Buy More good news from those leaders can keep the rally going -- or, in one case, provide some hope for a sector that has been the worst in the entire market this year. But there are enough major companies releasing earnings next week to dim investor optimism if there's any sign of weakness. Rockwell Automation (ROK)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 12, before market openRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) isn't the best-known name to report next week, but the company's fiscal fourth quarter report on Tuesday morning could move some of the market's most widely-held stocks.After all, industrial names have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of earnings season. General Electric (NYSE:GE) rallied nicely. 3M (NYSE:MMM) bounced back after a huge earnings plunge in April. Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has broken out to a new all-time high.Industrial stocks are gaining despite the fact that U.S. manufacturing clearly is in a recession. That seeming contradiction of weakening demand and higher stock prices makes Rockwell's guidance for fiscal 2020 an important data point.After all, investors clearly are pricing in a rebound for the group. And few companies have a better picture of forward demand than Rockwell, who serves manufacturers through both software and motor components and other products. If Rockwell's guidance is strong, that could confirm the rising investor sentiment toward many of its customers. But if Rockwell undercuts that sentiment, it could be a sign that many industrial stocks have rallied far enough -- or too far. D.R. Horton (DHI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 12, before market openHousing and construction stocks like D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) have been some of the market's best performers this year. DHI stock has gained 47.8% so far this year. It hasn't been alone. Shares of rival Lennar (NYSE:LEN) have increased 47%. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, is up 46%.Those gains alone would add import to and increase expectations for any earnings report from D.R. Horton, the country's largest homebuilder. But specific aspects of this release magnify its significance.After all, D.R. Horton will detail its outlook for fiscal 2020, which can move not just homebuilding stocks but residential construction suppliers and distributors. And that outlook comes at a critical point: housing-related stocks actually have weakened in recent weeks despite strength in the broad market. It's for this very reason Louis Navellier -- a savvy investor who made a name for himself picking undervalued stocks -- recommends that his subscribers buy &quot;bulletproof&quot; stocks.In less than a month, DHI shares have pulled back over 6%, and LEN almost 8%. The ITB ETF has retreated almost 5%. Either sentiment has weakened and/or valuation fears are starting to return.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Stock Up On Whatever the precise cause, the sector clearly looks a bit wobbly as the rest of the market gains. The outlook from D.R. Horton thus will either assuage investor fears or stoke them. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 13, after market closeCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) heads into Wednesday's fiscal first quarter report in a strong position. CSCO stock has rallied from an important pivot point on its chart, moving off a multiple bottom and above moving averages. There's a clear path for CSCO stock to continue its breakout to $50 and beyond.From a broader standpoint, CSCO seems to be one of the few value names left in a tech sector at all-time highs. The stock trades at less than 14x next year's EPS estimates, a seemingly soft multiple for a tech giant.Technically and fundamentally, Cisco stock can move higher. But Cisco needs to deliver on Wednesday afternoon -- and there's some sign of weakness in the industry. Fellow networking play Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) plunged 24% last week after disappointing guidance for the calendar fourth quarter.A strong quarter from Cisco -- and, given Arista's stumble, a solid outlook -- would show that Arista's problems are specific to that company, and calm long-held investor worries about networking industry demand. That almost certainly drives Cisco shares higher, and given valuation and the technical setup could catalyze a longer rally.Anything less, however, and industry fears return, which almost certainly interrupts the recent bounce in CSCO stock. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, before market openCannabis stocks like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) have had a disastrous 2019. CGC stock is down 63% from its 52-week high, and other pot stocks have fallen even further.The one piece of good news is that the earnings calendar provides the industry a chance to drive some sort of positive sentiment heading into 2020. Reports from Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) before the open on Tuesday and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) after that day's close precede Canopy's Thursday morning release.At this point, the three cannabis companies simply need to deliver any kind of good news. Commentary on pricing will be closely watched, as it's clear that investors are starting to price in oversupply in the Canadian market. Commentary on the regulatory front, where a backlog of applications has slowed industry growth, will be another focal point.But one question at the moment is whether even good news will be enough to drive a long-awaited rebound. Aphria (NYSE:APHA) posted back-to-back impressive quarters, including guidance for EBITDA profitability, yet APHA stock trades near the lows too.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now As I wrote last month, I'm skeptical the bottom is in for CGC stock and other pot plays. But the sector at least has a chance to prove skeptics like myself wrong. Though as bearish as sentiment remains, it likely will take three monster earnings reports to do so. Walmart (WMT)Source: fotomak / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, before market openThe dominance of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in brick-and-mortar retailing means its results always are important. The company's sheer size makes it an indicator of the health of the U.S. consumer. Walmart's commentary on pricing moves grocery stocks like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and can impact the share prices of its suppliers as well.This time around, however, the report has a little extra significance. KR shares soared this week after a bullish forecast at its Analyst Day. Walmart's results could support that company's optimism -- or undercut that stock's gains.In contrast, shares of major consumer packaged goods suppliers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) look a bit wobbly. Fears of pricing pressure and private-label penetration have dogged that group for some time, and Walmart earnings could re-ignite those worries. To counter these fears, buy dividend-paying stocks that can thrive in most markets -- i.e. bulletproof stocks. Louis has spent the past two decades helping people like you and I beat the market, and he doesn't intend to stop now. Want to know what's on his buy list? Here's the secret.More broadly, this is a market at all-time highs in an economy that is almost solely reliant on the U.S. consumer for growth. Weakness in Walmart results would raise new questions about the health of that consumer, and thus the health of the economy going forward.Meanwhile, for Walmart stock itself, the report looks important. WMT stock sits at an all-time high at the moment after a 28% gain. The company's successful e-commerce strategy has positioned it as a legitimate competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In other words, expectations are rising. Walmart has to meet those expectations to keep its rally going. But how it does so may have an effect on many other stocks in the market. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 14, after market closeChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has basically no room for error on Thursday afternoon. Save for a stumble by Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), results across the sector have been strong. A poor quarter from Nvidia followed by beats from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) raises real concerns about market share and competition.With NVDA stock approaching a 52-week high heading into the report, those concerns are not priced in. The third quarter earnings report a year ago, when NVDA stock plunged on weak guidance, shows what the downside can be if Nvidia disappoints.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over That said, I wrote this week that I expect Nvidia stock to keep rallying. The strength in the sector suggests Nvidia should comfortably beat expectations. And this has been a second-half story all year. Increasingly it seems like that story is going to play out. But if it doesn't, NVDA stock is going to see some ugly trading on Friday. JD.com (JD)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Friday, Nov. 15, before market openChinese retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) heads into its third quarter report in a strong position. JD stock finally has broken through resistance at $32 and now trades at a 15-month high. At 27x forward earnings, valuation still isn't prohibitive, and a strong quarter can keep the rally going.Like NVDA, however, JD has little room for error. Larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) delivered an impressive quarter last week. Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) is nipping at JD.com's heels. The market understands that an apparently slowing Chinese economy may have an impact. But any market share losses will be untenable with JD stock at a 52-week high.This also is a case where the reaction to earnings might be as important as the results themselves. PDD has skyrocketed in recent weeks. BABA is at a six-month high. Investors clearly are coming around to Chinese stocks. A good quarter from JD.com and a good gain for its stock would suggest that sentiment can continue to improve. Anything less could be a problem for JD shares -- and for other Chinese names as well.Legendary investor Louis Navellier has opinions of his own.

2019-11-08,Were Q3 Earnings Estimates Too Low?,Were Q3 Earnings Estimates Too Low?
2019-11-08,"Excluding a stellar post-earnings move by Disney (NYSE:DIS), there wasn't much to write home about today for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Today, the Dow Jones added just 0.02%, as President Trump made some comments that were interpreted as meaning a trade deal between the U.S. and China isn't as close as previously expected.Source: Finviz Trade has been in the spotlight for much of this week and, to be fair, the president's comments today weren't as harsh (by his standards) as they have been in the past. Trump merely indicated that China wants a rollback on tariffs -- a notion that powered technology stocks higher yesterday -- and that the U.S. hasn't agreed to that yet.Previously, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that if the two sides can come to terms on a starter phase of a trade accord, there would be some concessions on tariffs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio Ongoing trade wranglings produced a mostly listless day for equities with the Nasdaq Composite closing the week higher by 0.48%, while the S&P 500 added 0.26%. In late trading, just 11 of the Dow's 30 members were in the green. Marvelous MouseAs mentioned earlier, Disney was the star of the Dow Jones today, surging 3.6% after the company posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $19 billion. Wall Street expected earnings of 95 cents a share on revenue of $19 billion.Expenses rose, which many on Wall Street are attributing to the costs associated with upcoming launch of the Disney + streaming service, which debuts next week. Price action in Disney shares today indicates analysts and investors are OK with those higher costs, but that means that Disney needs to quickly prove its a credible streaming player. Data suggest acquired Fox assets are paying off for Disney.&quot;Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 34% year over year to $19.1 billion,&quot; said Morningstar in a note out today. &quot;Media networks revenue improved 22% due to growth at cable networks and the broadcasting segment. Affiliate fee revenue in the quarter was up 18%, which was made up of a 15 basis points increase from the Fox assets and 7 basis points from higher pricing, with a 4 basis points decline from lower subscribers. This implies a 3% growth in affiliate fee revenue, excluding the effect of the acquired Fox entertainment assets.&quot; Walgreens AgainWalgreens Boot Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was back among the Dow leaders today, gaining nearly 1%. Walgreens stock has been gyrating this week amid ongoing speculation that it's a leveraged buyout target with a price tag as high as $70 billion.There was some chatter about the prospects of that deal today, though mainly of the opinion variety. But for those that like to speculate, big mergers and acquisitions are typically announced over the weekend or on Monday's and today is Friday. So maybe some new headlines are looming for shares of Walgreens. Rough DayAs mentioned yesterday, Nike (NYSE:NKE) encountered some rough public relations after a former member of the company's Oregon Project, made damning allegations about coach Alberto Salazar in a New York Times op-ed. On Thursday, Nike shares rallied, but those losses evaporated today as the company responded to Cain's allegations.&quot;These are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before,&quot; said a Nike spokesperson, according to CNBC. &quot;Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process.&quot;  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth It was also a trying week for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) following the departure of now former CEO Steve Easterbrook last weekend. However, the stock closed modestly higher today amid news that new CEO Chris Kempczinski finally acquired some stock in the company he's running, $500,000 worth to be precise. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWe're definitely on the tail end of earnings season, but there are couple of Dow components reporting next week, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) on Wednesday and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Thursday.In addition to Walmart, a slew of smaller retailers report next week and there's consumer data due out, so we should start getting a feel for how the holiday shopping season is shaping up, a theme that will be integral in determining the fate of stocks into year-end.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-11,"After slumping earlier in Monday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stormed back to notch a modest gain of 0.03% to start the week. That's not spectacular, but it's also decent considering where the blue-chip index started the day and the sheer amount of Dow-related headlines there were for market participants to digest today.Source: Finviz Broadly speaking, it was another slow day as investors waited on more concrete news regarding the ongoing U.S.-China trade saga. Tomorrow could be significant on the trade front because President Trump is slated to deliver remarks before the New York Economic Club.It's expected that the president's prepared remarks will revolve around the strength of the economy and equity markets since he took office. It's also expected that he might take some jabs Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and some of the contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. However, President Trump is known to go off script from time-to-time, so there are potential risks or rewards that come along with Tuesday's speech.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth Focusing on Monday, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.13%, while the S&P 500 settled lower by just 0.20%. In late trading, just nine of the Dow's 30 components were residing higher. Walgreens OfferWalgreens Boot Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has recently been making frequent appearances in this space amid speculation the pharmacy chain could be the target of a massive leveraged buyout offer.The rumors proved accurate as Walgreens stock surged 5% today on news that private equity giant KKR & Co. has approached the company about going private. Based on Walgreens' enterprise value (market capitalization plus debt), the pharmacy operator is worth nearly $73 billion, easily making this the largest leveraged buyout on record.&quot;The New York-based private equity firm has been preparing a proposal to potentially buy out shareholders of Walgreens Boots,&quot; reports Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter. &quot;It's unclear how feasible the transaction would be, given the need for large amounts of financing, and Walgreens Boots and KKR could decide against pursuing a deal, the people said.&quot; Boeing BounceWhile Walgreens surged, it wasn't the Dow's best-performing name today. That honor goes to the index's largest component: Boeing (NYSE:BA).The aerospace giant advanced by 4.5% on reports that the controversial 737 MAX jet could resume commercial flights in January. That's slightly later than the 2019 year end forecast investors were hoping would come to fruition, but January isn't bad all things considered.The company said it expects the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will issue an official order next week approving the 737 MAX's return to the skies.According to Reuters, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe stated the company &quot;expect[s] the Max to be certified, airworthiness directive issued, ungrounded in mid-December. We expect pilot training requirements to be approved in January.&quot; Controversial HeadlinesApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did what it usually does and that's close higher despite some controversy surrounding the Apple card. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the issuing bank behind that new credit card, sank 1.7%, incurring the brunt of that controversy amid media and social media reports that the bank's decision-making algorithm for the card shows signs of bias.Last Friday, a software developer took to Twitter to say he was offered 20-times the credit limit on the Apple same card as his wife. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said his Apple card limit is 10-times his wife's and he's urging federal action to get bias out of the approval/credit limit process.Goldman was one of seven Dow stocks that lost close to or more than 1% today.  * 7 5G Stocks to Connect Your Portfolio To  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAs I noted last Friday, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are the Dow members reporting earnings this week on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Investors should hope for positive surprises to get those stocks going. Not surprisingly, data confirm that upbeat earnings surprises are important contributors to stocks' near-term price action.&quot;Companies in the S&P 500 that have reported positive earnings surprises for Q3 have seen an increase in price of 2.3% on average from two days before the company reported actual results through two days after the company reported actual results,&quot; according to FactSet research. &quot;Over the past five years, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported positive earnings surprises have witnessed a 1.0% increase in price on average during this four-day window. Thus, the market is rewarding positive EPS surprises more than average during the Q3 2019 earnings season.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. gave a quarterly sales forecast that fell far short of projections, signaling that companies are postponing hardware purchases amid global political and economic uncertainty, including the China-U.S. trade standoff. Shares fell more than 4% in extended trading.Revenue in the fiscal second quarter will decline 3% to 5% from the same period a year earlier, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That indicates sales of about $11.9 billion, compared with an average of analysts’ estimates of $12.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit will be 75 cents to 77 cents a share, also missing analysts’ predictions.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins is transitioning Cisco into more of a networking software and services company. While that push is delivering results -- helped by a slew of acquisitions -- the company still gets the majority of sales from machines that are the backbone of the internet and corporate networks.“Just go around the world and you see what’s happening in Hong Kong, you look at China, what’s happening in D.C., you’ve got Brexit, uncertainty in Latin America,” Robbins said during a conference call with analysts. “Business confidence suffers when there’s lack of clarity and there’s been a lack of clarity for so long that it’s finally come into play.”If sales drop as projected, it would be Cisco’s first quarterly year-over-year revenue decline in two years.Cisco shares declined to a low of $45.12 in extended trading after earlier closing at $48.46 in New York. The stock has gained 12% this year.Fiscal first-quarter net income fell to $2.93 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $3.55 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Revenue gained less than 1% to $13.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 84 cents a share.Cisco has said that the biggest drag on its earnings are cable companies that are trying to extend the life of their existing gear rather than buying new equipment. Adding to that slowdown, a big chunk of spending by phone-service providers is on the early deployment of 5G, or fifth generation, cellular networks. That’s mainly for the base station radio towers that Cisco doesn’t sell. Its gear will be needed later when traffic picks up in data centers.Cisco’s hardware business generated sales of $7.54 billion in the period ended Oct. 26, a drop of 1% from a year earlier. Applications, its software unit, gained 6% to $1.5 billion and security revenue jumped 22% to $815 million.Cisco is the biggest maker of routers, switches and other gear used to connect computers. About 60% of revenue comes from the Americas region. The company gets a tiny percentage of sales from China, where it has been largely locked out of the market.

2019-11-13,"Let the earnings season’s final countdown begin. Close to 90% of S&P 500 listed companies have already announced their third quarter financials, with the season winding down on a generally positive note. So what does this mean for the remaining few names getting ready to post results?We wanted to find out. With this in mind, we used TipRanks.com to get the full scoop on 3 Buy-rated stocks reporting quarterly results today. The platform gave us access to extensive market data that includes factors like analyst consensus and price targets, stock analysis and corporate insider activity, just to name a few. Here’s the lowdown. Energizer Holdings, Inc. (ENR)The company behind the famous Energizer Bunny is one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world. While shares have dipped year-to-date, Wall Street’s gaze has turned to ENR, with many anxiously waiting to see if a turnaround is on the horizon.Ahead of its fiscal fourth quarter release, Deutsche Bank analyst Faiza Alwy tells investors what to pay close attention to. If ENR can post 6%-plus organic growth, which would fall in-line or exceed the consensus estimate, and beat on EBIT/EPS, the analyst would take it as a positive signal. Alwy will also be looking to see if the battery maker can “assertively guide batteries organic growth for the first-half”.Even though the Energizer brand faces intense competition from Duracell and private labels, Alwy argues that unscanned channels, its presence within international markets as well as its recent acquisition of Spectrum Brands’ auto care business could fuel substantial gains. “We see further upside to the extent the company can show some upside to auto care sales this quarter,” the four-star analyst explained. To this end, Alwy kept the Buy rating and $55 price target, implying 31% upside potential. (To watch Alwy’s track record, click here)   Like Alwy, the rest of the Street is on the same page. As ENR boasts 100% Street support, the consensus is unanimous: the stock is a ‘Strong Buy’. Additionally, its $56 average price target brings the upside potential to 33%. (See Energizer stock analysis on TipRanks)    Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)At first glance, Cisco’s below-consensus guidance is troubling. However, Oppenheimer’s Ittai Kidron tells investors that when you take a step back and focus on the bigger picture, it isn’t as gloomy as you might think. CSCO has felt the effects of trade tensions and macro concerns that have hampered the market. That being said, Kidron points out that the company is still on track to meet expectations. “Our checks suggest that tough conditions have persisted but have not worsened. We see signs of resiliency in WLAN, security and campus switching spending and believe Cisco has appropriately reset the bar to a level where it can deliver in-line results and offer in-line guidance,” he commented.Kidron adds that the demand for campus and data center switching has improved significantly, lending itself to his conclusion that CSCO has a leg up on its competition in the segment. While noting that its legacy DC footprint is a cause for concern, the five-star analyst’s long-term view is positive given CSCO's growing software and recurring revenue mix. As a result, Kidron’s bullish thesis remains very much intact. His $57 price target indicates that shares could surge 18% over the next twelve month period. (To watch Kidron’s track record, click here)      Wall Street’s approach is more varied when it comes to CSCO. 11 Buy ratings and 8 Holds assigned in the last three months make the consensus a ‘Moderate Buy’. Its $55 average price target puts the upside potential at 13%. (See Cisco stock analysis on TipRanks) ProPetro Holding Corporation (PUMP)ProPetro provides hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services to upstream oil and gas companies. With shares down 38% year-to-date, investors are worried PUMP won’t be able to deliver with its third quarter performance. PUMP has been under scrutiny following several negative disclosures including the report of an SEC probe, with shares feeling the heat as a result. It doesn’t help that slowing completions activity witnessed in September will likely weigh on profits. Nonetheless, J.P. Morgan analyst Sean Meakim believes that much of the risk associated with PUMP has already been factored into the share price. “As such, we think ProPetro is set up to provide a better outlook than the sell-side expects, and if it can offer incremental reassurance regarding the SEC probe and positive commentary on customer demand in 1H20 the stock could catch a bid,” he noted. The company’s new DuraStim fleets could also stand to boost PUMP’s position.   Based on all the above factors, Meakim is still optimistic that PUMP can be a long-term winner. Along with his Buy rating, the analyst sees 82% upside potential in store. (To watch Meakim’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 9 Buys and 5 Holds received in the last three months give PUMP ‘Moderate Buy’ status. Its $15 average price target suggests there’s room for a 93% twelve-month climb. (See ProPetro stock analysis on TipRanks)",Earnings: 3 Buy-Rated Stocks to Watch Wednesday

2019-11-14,"Investors took pause on Thursday, as equities cooled off a bit and a few key earnings reports rolled in. Let's take a closer look at a few top stock trades going into the end of the week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is getting hammered after reporting earnings. Shares are down more than 7% and have been for most of session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBelow $46 does not bode well for CSCO. That area has been support since August. A series of lower highs (blue line) was squeezing Cisco lower, but a positive earnings reaction could have ended that trend.Instead, support is giving way, opening the door to the 23.6% retracement at $43.55. If that doesn't hold, a decline into the $42.75 area could be next.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 On the upside, see if CSCO reclaims $46. Above that level, the 50-day moving average is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Uber (UBER)Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock is just a hair above its 52-week lows. When Uber reported earnings earlier this month, we noted the decisive move the stock made through its recent lows.That set the tone for a collapse down to $25.58, the current all-time low. Just above that figure now, Uber is setting up for a make-or-break situation.Either the recent low holds as support and Uber rebounds or it doesn't and shares continue to break down. The stock is down almost 50% from the 52-week high of $47.08, and investors seem to want nothing to do with Uber.A look-below-and-fail is possible -- where Uber stock briefly breaks to new lows and snaps back -- but until shares are able to reclaim the $28.50 area, Uber looks unattractive on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Canopy Growth (CGC)Just recently, we thought Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) could be putting in a bottom. Shares were finding support near $18 for about a month, and after a big rally, had actually taken out downtrend resistance (blue line).Now though, shares are being walloped on earnings, down more than 13%. The move sends Canopy to new 52-week lows and well below recent support.This one is a no-touch for me, as it is firmly in no man's land.If it can reclaim $16.75 -- a significant area on the multiyear chart -- then perhaps we could get a rebound back up to the 200-week moving average near $19.70 (not shown above). But wait to see the strength first, there's no need to be a hero. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Roku (Roku)What a beast Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been. The stock gave short-term traders an excellent red-to-green setup on Thursday morning, as it continues to move well from its post-earnings low.The August gap-up near $118 held on the post-earnings gap down last week. Since then, shares are up about $30 apiece.Now, $150 could either act as the brakes to the recent move or the accelerator back up to $160-plus. If Roku pushes higher, it would be encouraging to see $150 act as support on a pullback. If $150 acts as resistance now, see where buyers step in, perhaps at the 20-day moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Cisco CrumblesAs noted earlier, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was easily the worst-performing member of the Dow Jones today. The communications gear giant reported fiscal first-quarter results after the close yesterday, saying it earned 84 cents a share on revenue of $13.20 billion. Wall Street was expecting 81 cents a share on sales of $13.09 billion.Cisco's results weren't the problem. Outlook for the current quarter was. For the fiscal second quarter, California-based Cisco expects to earn 75 cents to 77 cents, below the 79 cents analysts were expecting. The company also forecast a revenue decline of 3% to 5%.

2019-11-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The global bond market rallied for a second consecutive day on Thursday in an awkward development for the growing chorus of voices that have cropped up the last few weeks contending that the synchronized global slowdown was over. From China to Germany, and from Cisco Systems Inc. to freight shipments, the latest data show  it’s too soon to turn optimistic.In China, industrial output rose 4.7% in October from a year earlier, below the median estimate of 5.4%. Germany did post a surprise expansion in its gross domestic product for the third quarter, but that came with plenty of caveats. For one, the increase was only 0.1%, and the contraction for the second quarter was deeper than initially reported — negative 0.2% versus negative 0.1%. In the U.S., economists were passing around the latest Cass Freight Index for October, which fell 5.9% to mark its 11th consecutive year-over-year decline. This gauge has been around since 1995 and tracks freight volumes and expenditures by hundreds of companies in North America conducting $28 billion of transactions annually. More important, the compilers of the index noted in the latest survey that the index “has gone from ‘warning of a potential slowdown’ to ‘signaling an economic contraction.’” Cisco is not in the freight business, but comments by Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins late Wednesday after the computer company released fiscal second-quarter results echoed the sentiment in the freight industry. “Just go around the world and you see what’s happening in Hong Kong, you look at China, what’s happening in D.C., you’ve got Brexit, uncertainty in Latin America,” he said on a conference call with investors and analysts. “Business confidence suffers when there’s a lack of clarity, and there’s been a lack of clarity for so long that it’s finally come into play.”Maybe the global economy isn’t worsening, but it’s too soon to say an upswing is underway. Despite the sell-off in the bond market since September, yields are still showing caution. Yields on bonds worldwide as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index stand at 1.45%, which is closer to its all-time low of 1.07% in 2016 than last year’s high of 2.27% in November.AWASH IN MORE DEBTThe Institute of International Finance came out with its quarterly look at the mountain of global debt, concluding that it rose by about $7 trillion in the first half of the year to a record of just more than $250 trillion. That increase is more double the $3.3 trillion expansion for all of last year. It pegs global debt, which it sees expanding to $255 trillion by the end of the year, at a lofty 320% of global GDP. It’s no surprise that the world is awash in debt, but yields show there seems to be a dearth of it for the public because of massive purchases by central banks. As of October, the collective balance-sheet assets of the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of England stood at 35.7% of their countries’ total GDP, up from about 10% in 2008. Still, this is no time to be complacent. The IIF points out that much of the growth in debt has come in emerging markets, which is generally considered riskier than that of developed economies and where central banks are not doing things like quantitative easing. This could become an issue relatively quickly; the IIF pointed out that $9.4 trillion of bonds and syndicated loans from emerging markets come due by the end of 2021.CORPORATE CASH SHRINKSThe latest doubts about the strength of the economy kept the S&P 500 Index little changed for a second consecutive day. Perhaps that’s for the better because falling interest rates and bond yields are perhaps the single-biggest reason equities are up 23.4% this year in the absence of earnings growth. The second is probably share repurchases. But a new report from Societe General SA raises concern that the cash companies use to fund those buybacks is being depleted. “A boon for U.S. share buybacks” has left companies with less cash in their coffers, Societe Generale strategists Sophie Huynh and Alain Bokobza wrote in a report. Cash and money-market investments held by companies in the S&P 500 peaked in 2018’s first quarter on a per-share basis before falling 5.3% through the third quarter of this year, according to Bloomberg News’s David Wilson. S&P 500 companies have bought back the equivalent of 22% of their market value since 2010, the Societe Generale strategists noted in their report.CHILEAN CRISIS ENTERS NEW PHASEThe chaos in Chile, long known as the safest bet in Latin America, has become so bad that not even direct intervention by the nation’s central bank was able to reverse the slide in the peso. The currency fell about 1% Thursday, bringing its slide to 11.4% since mid-October. That’s the worst of the 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg and more than five times the next biggest loser, the Hungarian forint. What should have investors worried is that the peso depreciated even after the central bank announced a $4 billion currency swap program to ease liquidity in the market amid the worst civil unrest in a generation. “I don’t think it will help stop the sell-off in any way,” Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo, told Bloomberg News in reference to the swaps program. “There has to be some breakthrough on the political front for the currency to stabilize.” Foreign investors have been especially rattled since the government said Sunday that it backed plans to rewrite the constitution in response to four weeks of riots and protests in support of better pensions, wages, education and health care. If that were to happen, it’s possible the government would swing too far to the populist left to the detriment of the economy. FOLLOW THE CLIMATE CHANGE MONEYDespite the overwhelming evidence about climate change, there is still an alarming number of deniers. But if it was really all a big hoax or overblown, then why are the world’s biggest, most influential investment firms steering away from areas that are likely to be hit the hardest, such as the coasts? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is considering real estate markets including Denver; Austin, Texas; and Nashville, Jeffrey Fine, a managing director at the firm’s merchant-banking division, said Thursday at a conference hosted by the NYU School of Professional Studies. Fine may not have specifically cited climate change, but according to Bloomberg News’s Gillian Tan, he did note that more companies and young people are moving away from the coasts. The Fed held its first conference on climate change last week in San Francisco, with one central bank official saying it has the potential to “displace people permanently” amid damaging wildfires in California and storms punishing the Eastern Seaboard. About 3 billion people — or some 40 percent of the world’s population — live within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of a coastline, according to Bloomberg News. It’s projected that by 2050 more than 1 billion will live directly at the water’s edge.TEA LEAVESThe idea that the U.S. consumer was strong and carrying the economy took a hit a month ago when Commerce Department data showed that retail sales in September fell unexpectedly. The 0.3% decline from August was directly opposite the 0.3% advance expected based on the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s why Friday’s update from the government on October retail sales is so critical, especially heading into the holiday sales season. Economists are calling for a 0.2% rebound. Bloomberg Economics isn’t so optimistic, saying that decelerating wage growth suggests household demand will moderate. It is forecasting no change in spending. Although the headline number will get the attention, the smart money will be looking at sales among a control group that are used to calculate GDP and exclude food services, auto dealers, building-material stores and gas stations. By that measure, sales are seen rising 0.3% from no change in September.DON’T MISS Stock Investors Could Use a Refresher on the Basics: Nir Kaissar You Care About Earnings?

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. sued three former senior employees whom it accused of stealing thousands of files containing confidential information when they defected to a competitor.Shortly after resigning their jobs at Cisco this year, the three men joined an unidentified company that competes “in the IP telephony, headset, video, and collaboration space,” according to the complaint.Cisco claims that Wilson Chung, who was one of its principal engineers, downloaded more than 3,000 internal documents containing trade secrets, including information about the company’s contributions to 5G technology and its design specification for a video-conferencing prototype, before he left in February.Chung is accused of recruiting another Cisco engineer, James He, to join the competitor. At that point, He started photographing confidential Cisco documents with his iPhone and copying other company records and emails, according to the complaint filed Monday in federal court in San Jose, California.Cisco said that Jedd Williams, who was one of its sales executives, sought employment with the same competitor, telling one of its executives in an email that he could “hit the ground running” using “a play I drove VERY successfully at Cisco ... and a play that I’d like to repeat again.”In mid-October, on the same day he uploaded 12 Cisco sales forecasting spreadsheets, he announced he was leaving the company to work at his church and focus on personal issues, according to the complaint. “Mr. Williams joined the same competitor shortly thereafter.”LinkedIn profiles for men with the same names show that all three, after long stints at Cisco, now work at San Jose-based Poly, a developer of video, voice and content collaboration and communication technology.Poly declined to comment. Cisco didn’t respond to a request for comment.The case is Cisco Systems Inc. v. Chung, 19-cv-07562, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).(Updates with allegations in third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Robert Burnson in San Francisco at rburnson@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Joe SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Sues Ex-Employees Over Alleged Trade Secrets Theft

2019-11-22,"I can see why investors would be tempted to buy the dip in Nokia (NYSE:NOK). The sell-off since a disastrous third-quarter report has brought valuation back in line. The 5G tailwind that attracted investors to Nokia stock still exists. Yes, the news in the Q3 release was disappointing -- but a lower price, in theory, could offset some of that disappointment.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com That said, the case on paper has a very big problem in practice. Nokia stock simply can't be trusted at this point.The 5G tailwind was supposed to benefit results this year and next -- not in 2021, as is now hoped. Market share is eroding. On paper, NOK stock does look cheap -- but looking at the actual business, it seems increasingly clear that it should be.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 5G and Nokia StockThe Q3 earnings report unquestionably was disappointing. NOK stock fell nearly 24%, its largest loss in 19 years. Interestingly, the quarter itself came in ahead of analyst estimates. But it was guidance that led to the enormous sell-off.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That Have Ridiculous Possibilities Heading into the quarter, Nokia had guided for 2019 adjusted earnings per share of €0.25-€0.29, which was then set to grow sharply to €0.37-€0.42 in 2020. The outlook for both years was slashed after Q3.For 2019, Nokia now sees adjusted EPS of €0.18-€0.24. That's actually not that big a decline from original expectations for this year, particularly given that Nokia already had said after the second quarter that there were risks to meeting 2019 guidance. But in 2020, Nokia now sees adjusted EPS of just €0.20-€0.30. Adjusted operating margins are now expected at 8-11%, against a prior 12-16%.The culprit was the company's networks business and particularly its 5G portfolio. Those products were supposed to drive the growth and margin expansion Nokia projected, but that's no longer the case. Nokia clearly is losing market share to Scandinavian rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) as both companies try to take advantage of the political pressure being applied to Chinese rival Huawei.As a result, Nokia is spending behind the business to try and lower prices and better compete with Ericsson, in particular. That rival has opted to lower upfront pricing in hopes of making up the profit through higher-margin service contracts. Nokia apparently has to match that pricing -- but that's not the only issue here. Management and Execution ProblemsI've long been skeptical of the turnaround case for Nokia stock for two core reasons. As I detailed earlier this year, this is a company with a long history of overpromising and underdelivering.Last month's news is just the latest in a long history of disappointments. And in that context, it's hard to trust the new guidance going forward. Why is this time different?Certainly, management isn't inspiring any confidence at this point. CEO Rajeev Suri told Bloomberg in an interview that part of his company's problem was that its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent created &quot;more work,&quot; as the company had to migrate all of the legacy Alcatel-Lucent products to the Nokia nameplate. But that acquisition was completed three years ago, and certainly, Suri was aware of that issue when the company reiterated guidance in August.This simply doesn't seem like a management team on top of its business. It's losing to Ericsson. It was just six months ago that Nokia was talking up the fact that it hadn't lost a single 4G customer in the transition to 5G, and now it's overhauling its go-to-market strategy. As Will Healy noted on this site, the company reportedly is losing Telecom Italia, with that customer going with Huawei and Ericsson.From a broad standpoint, there's another question. If Nokia can't drive growth now, when can it? Huawei has been hampered, if not crippled, by security concerns. There's really no other competitor besides Ericsson. And yet Nokia isn't expecting much in the way of growth, even if guidance is met this time around. Cheap Isn't Enough for Nokia StockTo be sure, NOK stock is cheap. The midpoint of updated 2020 EPS guidance, €0.25, translates to $0.277. That, in turn, suggests just a 12x forward multiple.And so, again, there's an aspect of Nokia stock that is tempting. The dividend has been cut to fund 5G investments, but management expects the payout to return at some point. 5G growth should continue. Huawei's competitive positioning is at long-term risk.But that's not enough -- and it's not as if other networking plays don't have bull cases themselves. Industry leader Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has sold off. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) plunged after earnings, and has its own &quot;buy the dip&quot; case. Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) has shown long-awaited signs of life. Investors willing to step in to the sector have options beyond NOK stock.The biggest issue here, however, is company-specific. Yes, Nokia has an opportunity for growth. But it also has a stock price at a six-year low because it hasn't capitalized on past opportunities. It's exceedingly difficult coming out of the Q3 release to believe that this time is different.That's why the NOK stock price fell 24% after earnings. It's why it's kept falling. Investors don't trust Nokia, or Nokia stock. It's difficult to blame them.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reported sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, signaling that corporate demand for data-center hardware remains in a slump amid slowing economic growth.Revenue dropped 9.1% to $7.22 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales declines. Analysts, on average, projected $7.42 billion.HPE Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri is trying to increase sales by moving the server maker to a subscription business model. By 2022, all HPE hardware and software will be available as a service or via a pay-per-use model. The company recently bought Cray Inc. to bolster its position in the supercomputer market. HPE has cut expenses, including the size of its workforce, as part of a restructuring meant to modernize the company and boost its profit margin.Like other makers of servers and storage hardware, HPE has been contending with slowing economic growth and geopolitical tensions around the globe, which generally make businesses more cautious about buying new hardware. Cisco Systems Inc. said this month that customers had slowed down or reduced new purchases due to business uncertainty.HPE generates about two-thirds of its quarterly revenue from overseas sales.“Global trade tension is causing uncertainty, which results in longer sales cycles,” Neri said in an interview. He also pointed to other geopolitical factors causing some clients to pause orders.“We have put the focus on particular areas where we want to grow faster,” Neri said, citing businesses including high-performance computing and the company’s GreenLake hybrid cloud-computing product that lets customers pay for services based on how much they use. “That’s why we’re confident. We have a better portfolio and we have better coverage even though we see weakness in the market.”HPE shares declined about 4% in extended trading after closing at $17.45 in New York. The stock has increased 32% this year.“Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s sales growth will likely remain anemic for fiscal 1H amid seasonal weakness and pressured corporate capital spending,” Anand Srinivasan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note before the results were released.Server sales dropped 13% to $3.23 billion and storage hardware revenue fell 12% to $848 million in the quarter ended Oct. 31.Neri reiterated his pledge that the company will deliver 1% to 3% sales growth in the next three years.HPE posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $480 million, or 36 cents a share, from a loss of $757 million, or 53 cents. Profit, excluding some items, was 49 cents a share. Analysts projected 46 cents.Adjusted profit will be 42 cents to 46 cents per share in the current period. Analysts on average expected 43 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also affirmed its recently issued fiscal 2020 outlook of $1.78 to $1.94 per share.(Updates with comments from CEO in the sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",HPE Reports Revenue That Misses Estimates on Server Demand

Analysts, on average, projected $1.59, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted revenue rose 1.2% to $22.9 billion in the period ended Nov. 1, just missing analysts’ estimates of $23 billion.Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell has sought to outperform peers by diversifying his company’s product portfolio. Macroeconomic forces, including trade and geopolitical tensions, have caused Dell’s clients to slow down their data-center hardware purchases. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. said earlier this month that businesses have been more cautious due to global uncertainty.Dell’s revenue growth is helped by its majority interest in software maker VMware Inc., while the company’s personal computers and storage hardware products continue to boost profit.“Our highly differentiated set of offerings enables us to continue to win in a consolidating industry, while also driving long-term value for all stakeholders,” Jeff Clarke, Dell’s vice chairman, said in a statement.Shares gained about 2% in extended trading, after closing at $53.19 in New York. The stock has gained 8.8% this year.The personal computer division grew 4.6% to $11.4 billion in the quarter. Commercial sales rose 9.4% due to corporate clients upgrading their computers to adopt Microsoft Corp.’s Windows 10 operating system. Revenue from consumers, on the other hand, fell 6.4% in the period.Revenue from Dell’s data-center hardware declined 6.1% to $8.39 billion. Storage hardware sales increased 6.9%, but servers and networking gear dropped 16%, highlighting a slower spending environment among large corporate clients.VMware, majority owned by Dell, said sales exceeded analysts’ estimates, rising 12% to $2.46 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $2.41 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.49 a share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.42. VMware makes software that allows customers to combine multiple tasks on a single server, and is trying to shift to selling more programs that help companies run applications in the cloud and in their own data centers.Dell repaid about $1.1 billion of gross debt in the most recent period and has paid down about $3.5 billion so far this year. The company said it repaid more than $18 billion in gross debt since its EMC Corp. acquisition, announced at $67 billion, closed three years ago and is on target to repay about $5 billion of gross debt in fiscal 2020.&#92;--With assistance from Dina Bass.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Dell Reports Rosy Profit on Corporate Demand for New Computers

2019-12-04,"Investors that have been actively engaged with the U.S.-China trade spat for the past several months know there aren't many certainties except that situations can turn on a dime. In other words, stocks can go from dismal days (yesterday) to excellent showings (today) rather rapidly.  * The S&P 500 jumped 0.63%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 0.53%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.54%  * Industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM), a fairly trade-sensitive name, paced the Dow today, gaining about 1.2%On Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with China wasn't necessary until after the 2020 presidential election, exuding confidence he'll win a second term and that China needs a resolution much more than the U.S. That stoked speculation that both sides could proceed with punitive tariffs that would only serve to ratchet up hostilities. Wednesday brought a different, more sanguine story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 of the Best-Performing Conglomerate Stocks of 2019 &quot;Negotiators are getting near an agreement on the amount of tariff relief in a phase-one accord between the world's two largest economies. President Donald Trump said discussions with China are going very well, just a day after downplaying the urgency of a deal,&quot; reports Bloomberg.In other good news, U.S. oil inventories declined by more than analysts were expecting, helping Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest domestic oil companies, join the ranks of the Dow winners.No one, not even President Trump himself, knows what tomorrow will bring on the trade front, but today was the best day of December to this point as 25 of the 30 Dow members were higher in late trading. Diverting BlameAvid readers of this column know that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been in hot water for much of this year, disappointing investors along the way, due in large part to litigation risk, be it asbestos or opioid.The stock rallied 1.62% today, putting it in the upper echelon of Dow performers after JNJ said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was wrong when it said it found traces of asbestos in its popular baby powder.&quot;Our talc is safe and asbestos free, and these 150-plus tests, and the tests we routinely do to ensure the quality and safety of our talc-based products, are consistent with the results from renowned independent research labs over the past 40 years,&quot; said JNJ in a statement out Tuesday evening.The company did say that the  previously announced recall of Lot 22318RB of Johnson's Baby Powder remains in effect. Speaking Of Healthcare…It was another solid day at the office for managed care provider UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) as the stock gained about 1%. An array of analysts were out today boosting price targets on UNH shares, including BMO Securities to $310, Credit Suisse to $320 and Piper Jaffray to $325. Even the average of those targets, which is just over $318, implies significant upside from the $280 area at which UNH currently resides. Careful With CiscoThere were a small amount of Dow Jones losers today, but Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was the worst offender in the group, shedding 0.88%.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy This old guard tech name has been tumbling for several months and with an almost 6% drop over the past month, the stock is very much in danger of turning red on the year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTomorrow is a new day and with it comes the aforementioned potential for new headlines on the trade front, but some market observers believe President Trump's trade musings are minor blips on the radar and won't derail stocks this month.&quot;I do not believe that they will follow through with the December tariff,&quot; said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group's chief investment officer, said in an interview with CNBC. &quot;If we do not have a [China trade] deal, I think they'll couch it and we're just postponing the tariffs … The administration knows how sensitive we are to the possibility of those extra tariffs particularly hitting the consumer.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-05,"Although tech stocks generally comprise a hot space, not all companies within the space are hype-worthy.The technology sector is one of the biggest gainers of the year. With an almost 40% year-to-date gain, 2019 will go down in the history books as a banner year for tech stocks. Its ranks are full of out-sized winners that have showered shareholders with profits. Heavy hitters like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have led the charge. But not all companies that call technology home have participated in the rally. Some find themselves sliding into Christmas amid disappointing earnings and deteriorating technicals.  * 7 Hot Payments Stocks to Buy Now With that in mind, let's take a look at three tech stocks to sell before the start of 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tech Stocks to Sell: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Drawdown from 2019 peak: -25%Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares were flying high into mid-year but have since been thoroughly smashed. The downtrend accelerated following the past two earnings reports, revealing widespread disappointment in the company's profitability. The damage has been bad enough to turn the slow-moving 200-day average lower to join its shorter-term counterparts.This week's support break signaled a continuation of the descent and points toward a potential retest of its early January low near $41. Volume patterns show a groundswell in distribution over the past few months and are reflective of institutions abandoning ship. While the tides could always turn, CSCO is one of the ugliest ducklings in the tech sector. Dropbox (DBX)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Drawdown from 2019 peak: -32%The chart of Dropbox (NYSE:DBX) reveals consistent weakness ever since its IPO. There was a single moment of hope last June when DBX scored a robust breakout, but it fizzled fast, and the stock has been cruising lower ever since. The first half of the year was constructive and even had DBX stock push back above all major moving averages. But, the progress was wholly dismantled over the back half of the year.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy We're now within spitting distance of all-time lows. Every single time the stock gets an uptrend going, its quarterly earnings report arrives to throw a wet blanket on the bullishness. The past four events have seen heavy selling pressure. Until the fundamentals can improve enough to warrant an upside surprise in the stock after an earnings release, the chances for recovery are slim. Twilio (TWLO)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Drawdown from 2019 peak: -35%Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) could be a case of a stock running too far too fast. Its meteoric ascent since its 2016 IPO carried the software company up over 500%. That's a lot of future growth getting priced in. Perhaps the recent dismantling is simply a correction of the exuberance, a return to more sane valuation. It's a plausible narrative.But even if you view this as a longer-term dip to be bought, the chart still looks terrible. More evidence is needed before you pile in. At a minimum, TWLO stock needs to break above resistance and the 50-day moving average to reverse the uninterrupted series of lower lows and lower highs. A push above $106 would do the trick.Until then, steer clear of bottoming fishing.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. has started supplying switch chips to major data-center operators, including Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc., opening up a new avenue to win orders from some of its largest networking-equipment customers.Cisco Silicon 1 is a switch semiconductor that’s already being used by Microsoft and Facebook in crucial networking equipment, the companies said Wednesday at an event in San Francisco. San Jose, California-based Cisco is now offering the chips, which it says are the fastest in the industry, to all of its customers, regardless of whether they buy its networking machinery. Previously Cisco’s chips were only available as components of its machines.The shift toward standalone chip sales is another departure from the business model that made Cisco one of the biggest companies in the technology industry. Cisco’s expensive proprietary combinations of hardware and software make up the backbone of much of the internet and corporate networks, and these products generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. The new initiative has the potential to attract business from customers who want to build their own machines instead of buying whole packages. It also puts Cisco in direct competition with its suppliers, Intel Corp. and Broadcom Inc., which also make switch chips that the networking equipment maker uses in some of its products.“From today -- and this is something that some of you never thought we’d do -- some of our customers will buy our silicon and build their own products if that’s what they choose to do,” Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said at the event. “We really want our customers to consume this technology in any way they want.”As the internet infrastructure business moves away from suppliers who provide all the needs through locked-down combinations of hardware and software, Robbins has been pushing Cisco to adapt by becoming a bigger supplier of networking services and software. On his watch, software has risen to provide about 11% of revenue. Hardware still generates more than half of sales.Cisco shares rose less than 1% to $44.24 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The stock gained 1.8% this year through Tuesday’s close.The move into selling components is an attempt to win orders from the hyperscalers, such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, a group that has increasingly turned away from Cisco’s offerings and equipped their data centers with computers and networking gear designed in house. Those big cloud-computing vendors contribute as little as 2% of Cisco’s total sales, according to Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold.Switch chips perform the crucial function of deciding where packets of data should go in a network of computers. They are designed to handle that task at great speed, and only a few companies have been successful in the market. Broadcom is the biggest provider of this type of chip as an individual component and has as much as 80% share, Leopold said. Intel took a bigger interest in the market in June when it bought startup Barefoot Networks.Cisco’s new offering will combine the attributes of both switch and routing chips, the company said. It’ll be able to move data very quickly and still be programmable, carrying the ability to have its function changed. Routing, directing traffic among networks, is typically conducted by groups of chips that bring other attributes but are unable to direct data fast enough for modern internet traffic loads. One chip providing all of the functions will simplify the operation of networks by eliminating the need for different layers of software, Cisco executives said.Offering up what was previously guarded as a proprietary advantage shows a flexibility at Cisco that has been increasing as Robbins works to transform the company. Analysts predict the build-it-yourself approach to networking, pioneered by the large cloud-service operators, over time will be copied by companies looking to reduce the cost of their data-center spending. That corporate market is one of Cisco’s biggest sources of revenue.Cisco’s equipment, including its chips, is designed by the company and manufactured by a third party, which it hasn’t identified.The company also announced a new router machine at the event, designed to better serve as the backbone for new fifth generation, or 5G, cellular networks. The Cisco 8000 will be based on the new chip. The company also unveiled plans for products that will support faster data transmission speeds over fiber-optic cables. Like the rest of the networking industry, Cisco is positioning itself to be a main provider of equipment for the predicted surge in internet traffic and data created by the proliferation of mobile systems.(Updates with comment from Cisco CEO in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Cisco Enters Chip Market, Supplying Microsoft, Facebook"

2019-12-12,President Trump likely to sign limited trade agreement before Sunday Continue reading...,US Indexes Close Higher Thursday With China Trade Developments
2019-12-12,"Stocks rallied Thursday due to a familiar catalyst: positive trade talks. However, this time could be different because the U.S. and China have agreed, in principle, to Phase I of a trade deal. That accord now awaits President Donald Trump's signature.Source: Courtesy of Finviz  * The S&P 500 surged 0.86%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 0.79%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.73%  * In a case of a pleasant surprise, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of best-performing names in the Dow today, adding an impressive 3.08%.In the first paragraph, the operative phrases are &quot;in principle&quot; and &quot;awaits President Donald Trump's signature&quot; because investors have been down this road before. Phase I of the trade deal should have been signed last month, but for a variety of reasons, that obviously didn't happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;U.S. negotiators have reached the terms of a phase-one trade deal with China that now awaits President Donald Trump's approval, according to people briefed on the plans,&quot; reports Bloomberg.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Investors can and do have varying views on President Trump, and it is their right to do so, but regardless of one's opinion of his presidency, it's hard to argue against his shrewdness. Meaning, he's aware that we're almost in an election year and clouds created by a stormy relationship with China do more harm than good for his reelection prospects.Trump said in a tweet earlier today that both sides want the trade deal to happen. That's certainly encouraging and very likely why 25 of the Dow's 30 components were higher in late trading, one of the better ratios over the past several weeks. Bad News FirstGetting the bad news out of the way first, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the worst offender on the Dow Jones today and the only one with a loss in the neighborhood of 1%. The company said today it has reached a $125 million with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) regarding the grounding of the 737 MAX passenger jet, but as is often the case with news on that front, there's more to the story.The more likely culprit behind Boeing's Thursday woes was Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson saying the company is giving unrealistic timelines about when the 737 MAX will be flying again.Remember, it's the FAA's call, not Boeing's, about when the plane becomes flight-ready again. Apple SurpriseIt was surprising to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) scuffle on a day when positive trade news dominated the headlines, but the stock is higher by more than 3% this month and there was plenty of good news to go around today.Should President Trump quickly sign the trade deal, that means the tariffs set to go into effect on Sunday will be averted and that's positive for Apple.Those levies would have increased the price of already pricey iPhones, iPads and MacBooks by 15% at arguably the worst time of the year to raise prices on any consumer product. Cisco SurgeAs noted earlier, previously moribund Cisco was the Dow leader today on news the company is getting into the semiconductor and has already procured data-center operators, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), as clients.Edward Jones upgraded Cisco to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold,&quot; adding to the stock's Thursday upside. Jumpin' JPMorganJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was competing with Cisco for top honors on the Dow Jones today as the largest domestic bank was flirting with gains of 3%.Tuesday after the bell, JPMorgan announced that it's making significant alterations to its wealth management businesses.&quot;JPMorgan will put its U.S. wealth management business for affluent clients, its network of financial advisors at Chase branches, and its new You Invest online brokerage all together in one unit. JPMorgan will keep its private bank for the ultra-wealthy separate,&quot; reports Barron's. Looking AheadThis is an ideal time of year to start considering sector bets for the new year and healthcare appears to merit evaluation. Today, each of the Dow's healthcare names, a group including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), traded higher and it appears that some market observers are bullish on blue-chip pharmaceuticals names for 2020.&quot;For Major Pharma, we remain constructive on the group and see the potential for a recovery year in 2020 after the sector underperformed the broader market in 2019,&quot; said J.P. Morgan in a note out today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodaySpeaking of looking ahead, the current forecast for 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) is pretty sturdy and implies some upside to come for stocks in the new year.&quot;For 2020, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for all of the companies in the index) is $178.57. If $178.57 is the final number for the year, it will mark a record-high EPS number for the index,&quot; notes FactSet research.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, there was one somewhat concerning data point out today -- weekly jobless claims checked in at 234,000, ahead of the 225,000 claims economists expected.The less volatile four-week moving average moved up to 226,000 from 224,000.

Finally, A Lift For CiscoAs noted above, Cisco Systems was the Dow's best-performing name today, snapping out of multi-month funk that had it on pace to be one of the index's worst performers this year. Thank Barclays analyst Tim Long for the Cisco assist today as he upgraded the stock to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;equal weight&quot; while lifting his price target on the name to $53 from $47.&quot;Cisco has a diversified revenue stream, but a few key product areas should improve for Cisco and the industry over the next year,&quot; said Long in a note to clients.Importantly, the analyst also increased his earnings estimates on Cisco to $3.25 from $3.20 for fiscal 2020 and to $3.50 from $3.38 for fiscal 2021. Ebbing LitigationWhen it comes to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock in 2019, the primary issue has been the company's various legal wranglings, be they opioid or baby powder asbestos issues. These issues are well-documented and it appears Wall Street is looking forward with JNJ, not backward.Shares of JNJ jumped 1.24% today, good for one of the better showings in the Dow after Barclays analyst Kristen Stewart upgraded the pharmaceuticals name to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;equal weight&quot; while lifting her price target to $173.&quot;In our view, litigation concerns are more than priced in and the risk/reward is attractive,&quot; she said in a note to clients. &quot;We think JNJ checks a lot of boxes heading into 2020, leaving risk/reward skewed to the upside.&quot; Sort Of A SurpriseUnited Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) continued its recent bullishness though in modest fashion today.

The stock inched higher today in advance of that report. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI came across an interesting Dow-specific tidbit courtesy of Barron's today. As many of you know, the Dow is often derided compared to the S&P 500 because the former is price-weighted and holds just 30 stocks while the latter is cap-weighted and home to more than 500 names. Still, the Dow has been a winner over the past few years.&quot;The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 6 percentage points behind the S&P 500 index so far this year, but the often-maligned Dow is ahead during the past five years and lags only a little in the last 10,&quot; according to Barron's.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-20,"Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) stock has struggled since peaking in July. It showed signs of recovering in the latter part of November. Still, trade concerns killed that rally, and its decline accelerated despite its positive fiscal Q3 results which it unveiled on Dec. 5.Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com Nonetheless, this shows  why investors need to differentiate OKTA stock from Okta, the cybersecurity firm. Although I foresee a bright future for Okta and its signature product, the shares already reflect strong performances by the company for years to come. Okta vs. OKTA StockOne month after I dubbed OKTA stock &quot;too unpredictable to buy,&quot; it is trading at approximately the same level as it was when my column was published. OKTA stock rose shortly after my column was published, but increased trade tensions stopped the rally in its tracks. The drop continued even though the company's Q3 results beat analysts' average estimates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOKTA stock price has, for the most part, steadily risen since 2017. The rally of Okta stock accelerated in 2019.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a division of the federal government's  Department of Homeland Security stresses the importance of maintaining long, complex passcodes. But remembering dozens of such passwords has proven too difficult for most people. Given the commonality of this problem, the appeal of Okta's relatively simple, single sign-on product has both customers and investors singing the company's praises.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Many investors have also seen  its potential, even though Wall Street analysts expect its losses to continue through 2022. However, the fact that analysts, on average, forecast revenue growth of 43.7% in fiscal 2020 and 31.4% in FY21 shows that the company is continuing to gain traction.As another InvestorPlace contributor, Josh Enomoto, stated, the 32% increase in the number of the company's customers and the 41% increase in its $100,000-plus per year contracts bode well for OKTA stock. Although its growth will slow, I expect it to continue expanding robustly for years to come.Still, investors should not confuse Okta with OKTA stock. The OKTA stock price of around $114 is about 20% below its July peak of $141.85. Still, at a price-sales ratio of 25.4, it has become too expensive. The Danger of Stocks Like OKTAI have followed the stock market for a long time. The history of some of these high-flying stocks does not bode well for OKTA stock investors. For example, VMware (NYSE:VMW) began trading in 2007. Optimism about its virtualization software drove its multiples into the stratosphere, and it quickly rose to a peak of over $125 per share that year. Like most every other stock, it fell hard during the 2008-09 financial crisis. As a result, it did not surpass its 2007 high again until 2017.Some of the high flyers of the dot-com era have done even worse.  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) still has not returned to its 2000 high. Even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did not reach its dot-com bubble high again until 2016.But I think OKTA has a bright future. More clients, large and small, continue to buy its product. I also think its overseas business will grow and that it will offer more types of single sign-on products. However, with several years of gains already priced into the equity, I would not recommend buying OKTA stock at these levels. Final ThoughtsThe OKTA stock price reflects gains too far into the future to be attractive. In a world in which the internet facilitates so much business, the need for cybersecurity only continues to grow. As the breadth of passwords needed exceeds people's ability to remember all of those codes, Okta's single sign-on product is quite beneficial.However, the traders of OKTA stock should be aware of the history of overvalued stocks.And while I like Okta as a company, buying OKTA stock now could cause investors to lose a great deal of money down the road.

Cisco stock has not received as much attention by investors over the last few years amid the focus on cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and more trendy tech applications.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Now, investors may have a reason to take a second look at CSCO stock. As the internet makes the transition to 5G, CSCO could become again a more prominent name in tech as it returns to a leadership role in the industry. Will CSCO Return to Dot-Com-Era Prominence?About twenty years ago, Cisco stock helped to lead the dot-com boom. A run-up in the late 1990s led to the company briefly achieving the world's largest market cap in 2000, taking it to an all-time high of $82 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, after the dot-com boom gave way to a bust, Cisco stock went on to lose more than 90% of its value and gained little traction after that drop. CSCO fell out of favor and out of the headlines as it transitioned from a growth stock to a more conservative investment. In 2011, it began a move from just above the $13 per share range to about $48 per share today.  * 10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020 Still, this bull trend has suffered some hiccups. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) entry into the networking business, as well as lower guidance caused the stock to slide in August. As its current price of about $47 per share, it trades at about 17% below its 52-week high.However, CSCO has still risen by about 14% for the year. Moreover, I think the new Cisco stock should draw more attention from more risk-averse investors. Despite competitive fears from Amazon and others, the company offers some advantages. It derives only about 3% of its revenue from China. Furthermore, it has heavier exposure to other emerging Asian markets such as India, which has not become a major target of tariffs. &quot;Internet of the Future&quot; Could Take CSCO Stock HigherFurthermore, CSCO stock could see a return to prominence due to 5G. Cisco has bet heavily on the internet of the future. Consequently, it just released its next-generation networking internet platform called Silicon One. How this competes against the likes of Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) or Broadcom (NYSE:AVGO) is not yet known. Still, it can support 5G, an essential attribute as many believe that increased 5G traffic could overwhelm current networks.Cisco stock also reflects the attributes of an equity that will attract risk-averse and income-oriented investors. This is a far cry from its heyday when Cisco scoffed at the idea of paying dividends. Today, it not only introduced a payout in 2011, but it also increased the dividend every year since. This year's annual payout of $1.40 per share takes the yield to just over 2.9%.Also, the company, once known for its elevated multiple, now trades at a forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of about 14.1. Earnings growth levels of 4.5% this year and 4.9% the next will probably not excite investors. However, analysts predict that profit increases will average 6.99% per year over the next five years. If this forecast holds or moves higher, it could take Cisco stock higher with it. The Bottom Line on Cisco StockCisco may return to a more prominent leadership role in the tech industry. The company has spent most of the last 20 years transitioning to a more conservative investment. As few paid attention, it spent most of the 2010s in a steady growth mode. Despite this move higher, it trades at only about 14.1-times forward earnings. Now, it could play a critical role in the coming years as its customers upgrade their networks to handle 5G-level traffic.Cisco stock does not come without risk. It fell during the late summer as Amazon entered the networking business. Moreover, it will still have to compete with Juniper, Broadcom, and other networking firms.However, 5G still presents an opportunity for more rapid growth. Also, investors can receive a payout at 2.9% and rising while they wait for the recovery. Although I do not expect the growth levels of the 1990s, today's Cisco stock looks more like a reasonably priced income and growth play.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-12-27,"Some believe every dog has its day. But when it comes to investing in some of 2019's more doggish blue-chips, select Dow stocks are ready to pay big-time dividends to investors in more than one way in 2020. Let me explain.It has been a merrier investing season for investors this year following 2018's corrective bag of coal that weighed so heavily on Wall Street's animal spirits. For its part, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrials cruised to all-time-highs and a gain of nearly 2% this month on the back of a Santa Claus rally. The price action has also extended the Dow's year-to-date return to an unusually strong 22%.Bullish participation among individual blue-chips has been solid. But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the cake in price performance. The market's largest publicly-traded company has made it a December to remember with its gain of 8% and year-to-date rally of over 84%. Still, there are other Dow stocks that investors should be even more excited about right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs we head into 2020, rotations among sectors and stocks are nearly inevitable and potentially highly-profitable situations. Having said that, one place to look are blue-chips which have behaved somewhat doggishly this year, while putting in solid technical work to increase the odds of outperformance among Dow stocks in 2020.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Bottom-line, if you missed this year's big winner, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) gain of 56%, or happily happen to be sitting on big-time profits with less margin for error, celebrate the New Year in Dow stocks ready for technical leadership and that offer healthy dividends to boot. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Charts by TradingViewCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the first of our Dow stocks to buy. The blue-chip stock has under-performed the benchmark index by roughly 12% in 2019 with a gain of about 10.5%. But the New Year is setting up to pay big-time dividends in the form of price performance that's sure to delight investors on top of the company's fat dividend of nearly 3%.Technically, shares are shaping up to establish a monthly bottoming candlestick within a key longer-term support zone comprised of price congestion, Fibonacci, and trendline analysis. As CSCO's correction has also maintained this Dow stock's uptrend and stochastics are just now forming a bullish crossover in oversold territory, buying on weakness looks even more compelling.CSCO Stock Strategy: The recommendation in Cisco is to buy shares in January on price confirmation December is a bottoming candlestick. Set a stop-loss beneath the pattern low and look for this Dow stock to challenge its 2000 high of $63.94 for taking initial profits. Caterpillar (CAT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is the next of our Dow stocks to buy. No doubt it's been a tough couple years for CAT stock investors. But now there's more than just dividend relief of approximately 2.8% to take the sting out of holding this blue-chip investment.Technically, CAT's weakness since 2018 has produced a high-level double-bottom consolidation pattern. With the corrective lows successfully testing the 50% Fibonacci level and remaining above the Dow stock's lengthy basing pattern from 2011 - 2017, there's strong pattern evidence in place for Caterpillar to trade aggressively higher in 2020.CAT Stock Strategy: For this Dow stock, shares can be purchased right now. CAT stock affirmed its bottom with a breakout last month through the pattern's April mid-pivot of $142.54. Now and with Caterpillar just 4% higher and stochastics quickly confirming the bullish price movement, there's no time like the present to go long.  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 I'd recommend a stop-loss beneath $137, which looks like sufficient leeway off and on the price chart. On a rally, given the size of CAT's consolidation work, I'd allow a breakout to new highs take this Dow stock towards $200 before reducing exposure and locking in profits. Chevron (CVX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewChevron (NYSE:CVX) is the last of our Dow stocks to buy. The energy giant's 3.95% dividend puts shares firmly on the radar of income investors who follow the Dogs of the Dow buying strategy. But it's CVX stock's healthy base-on-base pattern within an uptrend that's caught our eye.After two failed monthly breakout attempts (highlighted in yellow) followed by a successful test of the prior cup's highs, a third try with stochastics leading the way looks promising for bullish follow-thru in 2020 for CVX stock.CVX Stock Strategy: Buy this Dow stock on a breakout above the July high of $124.48. A stop-loss below $117 or 6% risk looks approachable both off and on the price chart. Likewise, I'd allow profits to run in CVX stock towards $150 before reducing position size.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

Just 10 years ago, heading into the 2010s, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) was ranked in the top 10 for most powerful consumer brand in the world. Now, people have forgotten about Nokia almost entirely.Apple won't fall off as quickly as Nokia did, but a ton can change in ten years in the tech world. People largely buy the same food, drink the same beverages, buy the same apparel brands that they did a decade ago. However, technology evolves so quickly that a towering giant like Blackberry (NYSE:BB) or Nokia can virtually disappear in a decade.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way To that end, imagine what Apple's flagship product will look like in 2030. Will we even be carrying smartphones around? Or will the product category have been totally reinvented by then?That's why Apple's lack of innovation since Steve Jobs' passing is so troubling. On many fronts, Apple has allowed rivals to beat it with new tech hardware. As long as the smartphone remains in its present form and its existing consumers stay loyal, Apple will make a lot of money; But it's not a business that deserves a high price-earnings (P/E) ratio.There's a good reason that folks were pricing Apple in the 12-14x P/E range for so long before the stock finally took off in 2019. If Apple doesn't come up with another act soon, it will be categorized with the same old stale tech label that caused stocks like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to trade like dead money for nearly the entirety of the 2001-15 time period. Too Big To GrowApple shares are currently selling for 24x trailing earnings and 19x forward earnings. That doesn't sound terrible at first glance, But remember that Apple sold for under 15x earnings on many occasions over the past five years.Additionally, it becomes really hard to grow earnings once you are Apple's size. The company earned $64 billion last quarter. Uber (NYSE:UBER) by contrast, has a market cap of just $52 billion. When you make more money in one year than the entire market cap of a large tech rival - or the GDP of a small country - it becomes hard to grow.For Apple to get to 15x earnings at the current share price, it would need to tack on nearly $20 billion a year of additional earnings. Not revenues, but earnings. How many more smartphones sales would that be? Apple doesn't have another big thing going, either. It's not bringing in big revenues from cloud, advertising or a hot new hardware product -- as tech rivals have surpassed them on various fronts. An Out-Of-Control Momentum TradeApple's stock has clearly gone into a parabolic sort of move. It's simply unnatural for the country's largest stock to run up 40% in just a few months. The value of its actual operating business surely hasn't gone up by $400 billion since September, even if the market cap has.With the stock market roaring higher into year end, there's a lot of money going into index funds. What's the largest constituent in your average S&P 500 or NASDAQ ETF? That's right, Apple. Additionally, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has bought a ton of Apple in recent years, and his endorsement has given the stock the greatest sort of celebrity backing.For folks wanting to get long stocks into a raging bull market, Apple has been a no-brainer pick. And, as the share price inexorably climbs, people feel it is a sure thing and throw more money at it. Whenever a correction hits, though, money will flow out of Apple at record speed. Final Thoughts on AppleJust one year ago at this time, investors were fearful for Apple's future. The company's business had gone into a temporary slump, and shares went into freefall following a surprise profit warning in January.It was Apple's darkest moment in years, and many bears proclaimed that the Apple era was winding down. Instead, the company quickly turned things around after that terrible quarter, and the share price moved 80% higher within 12 months. In fact, Apple's turnaround was one of the most surprising sentiment swings in a large-cap stock in many years.Tap back into that feeling from January, though, for a second. It wouldn't take that much for the market to feel that sort of negativity again. Trade deal or no trade deal, Apple is struggling in China. It's price point is too high to work in many emerging markets, in fact.The services strategy doesn't appear to be a cure-all. Apple can keep riding its smartphone supremacy in a few mature developed countries for at least a few more years. But without something new, Apple's inflated stock price will come crashing back down.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned Intel stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

That Could Continue in 2020.
2019-12-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Twenty years ago, writing in Fortune magazine, I dubbed the 1990s “the Nasdaq Decade.” And why not? Practically from the moment the browser company Netscape went public, the tech stocks that dominated the Nasdaq stock exchange only went up. Cisco Systems Inc. rose 125,000% in the 1990s. Dell Technologies Inc. was up 72,000%. Shares of EToys quadrupled on their first day of trading in 1999. The Nasdaq itself rose 685%.But a few months after the decade ended, the internet bubble burst, and by 2002 the Nasdaq had declined 78%. The tech highfliers  that had soared in the 1990s either went bankrupt or their valuations crashed back to earth.Financially speaking, the 2010s have been characterized by corporate mergers, aggressive activist investors, out-of-control CEO pay and “maximizing shareholder value.” But more than anything, it has been a decade awash in private equity deals. I therefore dub it the private equity decade. And I’ll admit that I’m rooting for private equity to get a comeuppance similar to the one that took place in tech after the Nasdaq decade.Private equity deals have been part of the financial landscape for decades, of course. Who can forget KKR’s $25 billion leveraged buyout (as they were called then) of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s — a deal memorialized in the classic book “Barbarians at the Gate?” Indeed, some of the biggest private equity deals on record — TXU Energy, First Data, Alltel, Hilton Worldwide — took place in the frothy years before the 2008 financial crisis.What was different in the 2010s was less the size of the deals as their proliferation. In 2009, private equity firms completed 1,927 deals worth $142 billion, according to the financial data firm Pitchbook. By 2018, there were 5,180 private equity deals worth $727 billion.Why so many deals? One reason is more firms are holding more capital than they know what to do with; Bain & Co. recently estimated that private equity firms have a staggering $2 trillion in “dry powder” that they need to deploy. But another reason is that there just aren’t as many big deals available as there used to be, so firms have had to move down the food chain to find companies willing to be bought out. Many, if not most, of the deals in the past few years have been for less than $500 million. I half expect the bodega down the street to be bought out.What has also become clear this decade is the high-minded rationale the private equity industry once used to justify its deals has largely evaporated. You don’t hear much anymore about how taking a company private will remove short-term incentives, impose necessary restructuring, yadda, yadda, yadda.The main thing private equity has done this decade is to pile debt onto companies — imposing repayment costs while pulling out fees and dividends that have no bearing on what the private equity firm has actually done. Famously, Toys “R” Us went bankrupt because it was buried in private equity debt. So did Gymboree, Sports Authority, Linens ’n Things, and many others. In 2017, when the Limited announced it was shutting down its 250 stores — and throwing its employees out of work — the private equity firm that owned it, Sun Capital Partners Inc., reported to investors that it had nearly doubled its money, thanks to the dividends and fees it had paid itself.One private equity skeptic, Daniel Rasmussen, conducted a study to see the effect private equity firms had on the companies they bought. Using a database of 390 deals with more than $700 billion in enterprise value, he found that:In 54 percent of the transactions we examined, revenue growth slowed. In 45 percent, margins contracted. And in 55 percent, capex spending as a percentage of sales declined. Most private equity firms are cutting long-term investments, not increasing them, resulting in slower growth, not faster growth.Instead, he continued, there is a new paradigm for understanding the PE model:As an industry, PE firms take control of businesses to increase debt and redirect spending from capital expenditures and other forms of investment toward paying down that debt. As a result, or in tandem, the growth of the business slows. That is a simple, structural change, not a grand shift in strategy or a change that really requires any expertise in management.In other words, whatever larger purpose private equity might have once had, the 2010s exposed an industry that cared about lining its own pockets — often at the expense of the companies it bought. It has become dealmaking for its own sake.It seems to me that there are two likely consequences for the devolution of private equity in this decade. The first is that when the business cycle finally turns, the consequences for the thousands of companies carrying private equity debt are likely to be severe. As increasing amounts of capital have chased deals this decade, purchase prices have increased drastically. Rasmussen reports that in 2013, private equity deals were done at an average of 8.9 times adjusted earnings. Today, that number has risen to 11 times adjusted earnings. That means the debt loads are becoming heavier.The second consequence is political. If the Democrats take the Senate or the presidency — or both — the private equity model is going to be under sustained attack. Titans like Henry Kravis and Steve Schwarzman will be hauled before Congress and berated for the industry’s practices. Already, Elizabeth Warren has put forth a proposal to rein in private equity — she calls it the “Stop Wall Street Looting Act.” Among other things, it would give workers rights when a bankruptcy takes place and would put private equity firms “on the hook for the debts of companies they buy.”One other thing: In this decade of growing income inequality, nothing symbolized the gap between the haves and the have-nots like private equity. When it can walk away enriched while companies it owns go bankrupt — is that really the way capitalism is supposed to work? Perhaps the 2020s will be the decade when it starts to work for everyone again.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2019-12-31,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock admittedly looks attractive at the moment. Cisco is a wonderful company, the dominant player in networking. And Cisco stock looks cheap. Shares are valued at just 14x the fiscal 2021 consensus earnings-per-share estimate. That's a valuation that prices in little in the way of growth.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The problem of late is that Cisco isn't posting much of that growth. Two consecutive earnings reports have disappointed investors and sent Cisco stock tumbling. Shares have recovered a 7.3% decline after the fiscal first-quarter report in mid-November. But CSCO stock still sits 18% below its 52-week high.If that growth can return, Cisco stock can and likely will rally. But at the moment, that's a big &quot;if,&quot; and near-term upside will be limited unless and until Cisco can generate some optimism from the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Key Question for CSCO StockCSCO has tumbled after each of its last two earnings reports. The November selloff followed an 8.6% decline in August resulting from the company's fiscal fourth-quarter release.In both cases, the actual report wasn't the culprit. Cisco beat analyst estimates on both lines in both quarters. In fact, the company hasn't disappointed relative to Street expectations since 2014. Rather, Cisco's outlook was the issue. Second-quarter guidance was particularly weak: Cisco expects revenue to decline 3% to 5% year-over-year. Earnings per share should increase by roughly the same amount, but all of that growth and then some is coming from share repurchases.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 The question at the moment is whether the weakness seen in recent quarters simply is a short-term phenomenon. There's some reason to believe that it is. The trade war has disrupted demand from China. After the first quarter report, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told Barron's that orders from that country had declined 31% year-over-year.5G wireless provides an opportunity, but not yet. CEO Chuck Robbins said on the Q1 conference call that those networks wouldn't drive sales until the second half of fiscal 2021. Those sales should deliver some of the growth for which Cisco is looking. More broadly, networking demand simply seems soft, but should rebound at some point thanks to 5G and other factors.The bull case, in short, is that the current situation will pass. Growth will return, and the multiple assigned to Cisco stock will expand. Something like 17x $4 in EPS -- up from an expected $3.24 this year -- gets CSCO stock near $70. Add in a 3% dividend yield, and total return equals roughly 50% in a matter of years. The Risk to Cisco StockBut the core worry is that recent quarters aren't just the result of short-term factors. Rather, they're the sign of a reversion to the mean.After all, end market growth for Cisco, particularly in the core networking business, remains minimal. Cisco has added software revenue to hardware sales with products like the Catalyst 9000 series of switches, but even that hasn't been enough to drive real growth of late. Rival Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) has been one of the S&P 500's worst stocks over the past six years, gaining less than 9% total. Demand weakness is a key reason why.Cisco has alleviated that pressure through software development and acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, for instance, applications revenue increased 15%. Security sales climbed 16%, thanks in large part to the purchase of Duo Security. Infrastructure platforms revenue, however, climbed just 7% -- and that was a good year. That category actually saw sales decline in the first quarter.If the software tailwind, in particular, fades, then perhaps Cisco's growth stalls out. 5G is a help, but it's not a panacea, as the travails of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) show. And this is a stock that has struggled in the recent past. In fact, from 2007 to 2017, CSCO stock basically had a lost decade, with annual share price appreciation in the 1% range.  * The 10 Best Mutual Funds for Your 401k One of the core questions here, as I noted last year, is whether Cisco is something closer to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or more akin to IBM (NYSE:IBM). Can it, as Microsoft did, leverage a massive user base and the shift to the cloud to jumpstart growth? Or, as with IBM's mainframes, is the customer demand problem simply too intractable for Cisco to change its profile?Investors have reacted so strongly to the last two earnings reports because those questions still hover over Cisco stock. Cisco needs to give an answer to those questions for its shares to rebound. The Case for CSCOTo be sure, there's an interesting case that it's worth waiting for the answer. Cisco's dividend yields almost 3% at a time when the 10-year Treasury bond yields less than 2%. For those of us who lived through 2000 and 2008, it's difficult to think of a tech stock as &quot;safe.&quot; But given Cisco's dominant position, it may well be safer than many old-line &quot;blue chips.&quot;The one catch, even below $50, is that it's tough to see that case as compelling. Growth concerns are real. Valuation is attractive, but there is no shortage of fellow Dow Jones components at low forward multiples: Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and even fellow tech titan Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Those companies admittedly have their own challenges, but investors looking for &quot;cheap&quot; stocks have options.The issue at the moment is that Cisco still needs to prove that it's the best of that bunch, and thus at least deserves the modest valuation premium it currently receives. The company hasn't been able to do so over its last two quarters, and until it does, sideways trading will persist.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, the company has been pursuing a strategy of diversification, which has provided some extra juice to Cisco stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com In particular, a series of acquisitions has helped Cisco to expand into software and cybersecurity solutions. Last summer, growing revenue -- helped in no small part by those acquisitions -- was a key factor in driving Cisco stock to highs not seen since 2000, with CSCO topping $58 in July.A pair of quarters with weaker-than-expected guidance pulled the rug out from under CSCO stock, though. After dropping to $43.52 on Dec. 5, CSCO has rebounded, ending the year with a $47.96 close. That's a modest 12% gain for 2019, but a drop of 17% from its highs in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWill the current Cisco stock recovery continue into 2020? CSCO Stock Price PerformanceCisco's biggest competition in its core networking business is Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR). While Cisco stock posted a 12% gain for 2019, Juniper was in the red, losing nearly 8% of its value in 2019.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers Another key competitor is Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), which also slipped in 2019, closing the year down just over 1%. In that context, the performance of CSCO stock in 2019 seems much more solid.The investment Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal have Cisco stock rated as a &quot;buy&quot; despite its poor performance in the second half of 2019. They also see upside for the stock, with a $52.70 average 12-month price target. Those analysts are not nearly so optimistic about Juniper or Arista Networks stock, both of which get a &quot;hold&quot; rating. Growth Strategy Compared to IBMOn some level, Cisco has been a competitor with IBM (NYSE:IBM), although the two were more into collaboration in 2019. The trajectories of the two companies are often compared. Both are old school technology giants that came to dominate their markets. That domination meant meaningful revenue growth required moving into promising new business areas. However, the success of their respective strategies shows markedly different results.   If you look at CSCO over the past five years, it has delivered nearly 80% growth -- even after the slide in the second half of 2019. IBM, on the other hand, has struggled. Over the past five years, IBM stock is down 17%. &quot;Cisco has been doing something IBM didn't -- the acquiring and integrating of scores of other smaller technology companies,&quot; Long Island University Economics professor Panos Mourdoukoutas wrote in Forbes. While IBM has been largely focused with trying to trying to change from within, Cisco has augmented its core networking business by buying into promising areas of growth.This has included a strong entry into workplace collaboration with the acquisition of Webex in 2007, and enterprise cybersecurity with Duo Security in 2018. Last year's $2.6 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications strengthens the company's position in data center installations, through high-speed optical data transmission.In addition, Cisco has done a good job of integrating acquisitions into its portfolio and into the marketplace to make them even more enticing for customers. For example, last November, the company announced Cisco Webex Meetings would be partnering with Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams.  The China FactorThere has been some thought that warming trade relations with China could provide a boost to CSCO stock in 2020. InvestorPlace's Vince Martin points out that Cisco's business in China was down 31% in the last quarter. However, China's Huawei is a formidable global competitor for networking infrastructure. Any gains made by Cisco as a result of a thaw in the trade war with China could well be offset by loosening of restrictions against Huawei.    Bottom Line on Cisco StockAt this point, the likelihood that the CSCO stock price will continue its recovery in 2020 seems good. Factors such as a weakness for demand in networking equipment that led to its slide in the second half of 2019 are expected to be offset by telecommunications companies investing heavily in 5G rollout. Meanwhile, CSCO's acquisition and integration strategy has been successful and shows no sign of slowing.With their $52.70 average 12-month price target, investment analysts don't see Cisco stock hitting the 19-year highs of last summer, but that's still 10% upside.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-03,"(Bloomberg) -- A salacious three-year legal battle involving a former partner at Sequoia Capital, a onetime exotic dancer and a promised $40 million hush money payment has come to an end.A California Superior Court judge ruled in favor of venture capitalist Michael Goguen, finding his former mistress Amber Laurel Baptiste committed fraud and extortion when she threatened to publicize false claims, including that he gave her a sexually transmitted infection. The judge ordered Baptiste to pay back the full $10.25 million she got from Goguen. After a three-day trial that Baptiste didn’t attend, the court also approved a restraining order to protect Goguen and his current wife, Jamie Goguen.Unless an objection is filed by the end of next week, the Dec. 20 ruling becomes final and caps a saga that sent Silicon Valley’s gossip mill into overdrive and extinguished Goguen’s two-decade investing career at one of world’s most prestigious venture firms. Baptiste’s allegations surfaced just as the MeToo movement was beginning to take shape, drawing heightened scrutiny of executive wrongdoing. The decision is a rare moment of possible redemption for a powerful man accused of sexual misconduct.Baptiste said she stands by every claim she made in her initial lawsuit and plans to file an objection to the ruling before the deadline. She said she has already spent nearly $5 million of the money Goguen gave her on legal fees and is in the process of hiring what would be her sixth attorney. “I will continue to fight this all the way to the end,” Baptiste said.Goguen said by phone from his home in Whitefish, Montana, that the ruling concludes a “heartbreaking and devastating” chapter of his life. He said many friends and colleagues have treated him “like a leper” since Baptiste went public with her allegations in 2016. Even after defeating Baptiste’s original suit in September, the scandal continued to impede Goguen’s efforts to operate his new VC fund. Goguen stopped short of celebrating the verdict as a victory. “I’ve become jaded,” he said.At Sequoia, Goguen specialized in finding and funding technology startups that specialized in networking and cybersecurity. Initial public offerings and sales of some of those companies to Cisco Systems Inc. delivered riches to Goguen and the VC firm. Baptiste’s suit in 2016 had an immediate impact, with Sequoia scrubbing Goguen from the company website and removing him from the boards of 11 companies. Sequoia said at the time that the allegations against Goguen were “unproven and unrelated” to the firm. “Still, we decided his departure was appropriate,” Sequoia said. A spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment on the new ruling.Goguen and Baptiste have said they met in 2002 at strip club in Dallas where she was working, and they began spending time together. In 2014, Goguen paid Baptiste $10 million in what was to be the first of four installments to sever communication and keep details of their affair and other allegations under wraps.In her 2016 complaint, Baptiste alleged that Goguen sexually abused her for more than a decade, infected her and then reneged on a promise to pay the full $40 million. Goguen countersued, calling the affair consensual and accusing her of extortion. Goguen claimed he stopped paying her because she violated their contract by continuing to contact him and then broke their confidentiality agreement with her suit.Baptiste soon parted ways with her attorney and claimed that Goguen’s lawyers were working with a private investigator to stalk her. She has said Goguen was using his wealth and power to overwhelm her.Last year, Goguen defeated Baptiste’s suit before it went to trial. A judge ruled in September that Baptiste had failed to provide evidence for her claims or undergo mental and physical examinations required by the court.In the December decision on Goguen’s countersuit, Judge Danny Chou ruled that Baptiste forged the date and results of medical tests accusing Goguen of giving her the infection. He found that Goguen agreed to the payment in order to stop Baptiste from spreading false claims to create a “media circus.”Chou also found Baptiste fraudulently solicited donations from Goguen for a nonprofit she established called Every Girl Counts. The organization was supposed to help feed, clothe and shelter three dozen young girls. But Baptiste didn’t provide any such services and instead spent more than $40,000 of the charity’s funds to commission fantasy paintings of herself, according to the ruling.Seeing the countersuit through was a necessary step toward clearing his name, Goguen said. After defeating Baptiste’s suit a few months ago, Goguen said the conclusion had the opposite effect of what he expected.

2020-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- For Paul Boudre, U.S. President Donald Trump’s push against Chinese telecommunications companies is less about espionage than the race for technological supremacy.Boudre, the chief executive officer of Soitec, a French maker of semiconductor materials that go into 5G equipment, automobiles, cloud computing and IT infrastructure, says Trump’s actions are aimed primarily at allowing American firms to catch up.“Trump’s kick in the pants for companies is to wake them up and to catch up,” Boudre said in an interview Tuesday in Paris. “Trump is the emissary saying that if nothing is done, we’ll be blown away. That’s why he’s been trying to put a brake on the advances that China has made.”With the “everything-connected” era well under way, the race for a technological edge is intensifying. Trump has repeated railed against China and its companies, including Huawei Technologies Co., citing industrial espionage and intellectual property theft. He has limited their access to the U.S. market and to American suppliers, while also pressing allies from Japan to The Netherlands to review policies toward the Asian giant.The executive push and the infrastructure policy are driving U.S. companies like Cisco, Qorvo Inc., Skyworks Solutions to accelerate their research, a move that could allow American players to get new 5G technologies rolling out potentially in 2021, Boudre said.“Technology has become political today,” he said.Supply ChainsThe U.S. pushed to block the sale of chip manufacturer ASML’s technology to China by sharing a classified intelligence report with the Dutch government, Reuters reported on Monday, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.Soitec, which has factories and licenses for producing the substrate for handsets and infrastructure in France, Singapore and China, can provide “China Free” material if requested, Boudre said, adding that no such demands have been made by its clients.“What’s happened with Trump is a modification of supply chains,” he said. “Huawei won’t rely exclusively anymore on Qorvo, Skyworks, Qualcomm, because there is a risk. So they’ve developed relations with Murata, STMicro and others.”Developments in the U.S. 5G market this year and next will be a test of whether Trump’s policies were fruitful, Boudre said.“Clearly, two technologies are now being implemented,” with China’s 5G building on 4G, while the U.S.’s 5G that’s more of a new development called “millimeter wave.” The U.S. technology may hit the broad market in 2021, Boudre said, with Cisco driving the innovation. Qualcomm’s modem chip using millimeter wave technology is likely to hit the market in 2020.Soitec RisingWhile Trump’s moves have roiled trade and supply chains for companies building 5G and other technologies, Soitec has been spared, the executive said.The company, whose material goes into almost every smartphone in the world, plans to double sales in the next three years, reaching $1 billion in its fiscal year 2022, and sees revenue tripling in the next five years or so.Founded in the early 1990s in the French Alps, Soitec, which now employs 1,500 people, sits at the heart of the revolution that’s made possible everything from mobile phones, personal assistants like Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Google’s Nest, to 5G antennas and connected devices in cars.In the automotive sector, where Europe has an edge, Soitec is working with Robert Bosch GmbH, Audi AG, STMicroelectronics NV and others to define future components, Boudre said. In artificial intelligence, he sees a shift of computing power from the cloud to devices lifting demand for Soitec’s materials, which allow chipmakers to combine computing, memory and connectivity on a single chip.The extent of all that growth will be evident when the company discusses its long-term plans in June, Boudre said.Soitec’s stock rose 85% in 2019, making it among the top 10 performers of the benchmark SBF120 index.&#92;--With assistance from Caroline Connan and Francine Lacqua.To contact the reporters on this story: Helene Fouquet in Paris at hfouquet1@bloomberg.net;Rudy Ruitenberg in Paris at rruitenberg@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Vidya RootFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Trump’s China Tech Spat Is About Taking 5G Lead, French CEO Says"

2020-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- With all eyes this week on the CES trade show in Las Vegas, famous for a mind-boggling array of personal gadgets, it’s worth considering something counterintuitive: Venture capitalists like consumer technology a lot less than they used to.According to PitchBook data compiled for Bloomberg, last year the normal order of funding in venture capital flipped. Enterprise technology companies, which specialize in software or services for businesses—long the dowdiest landing pad for venture dollars—attracted $30.42 billion, PitchBook data shows, about one-third more cash than consumer technology companies.That funding total is growing fast. Enterprise companies’ venture haul for 2019 was almost double the previous year’s. Meanwhile, the cash going to consumer companies fell by almost a quarter between 2018 and 2019, according to PitchBook data, to $23.26 billion.Those numbers mark the first time in at least last five years that pure enterprise companies have raised more money than consumer-facing tech, the data shows. (Though a separate &quot;undetermined&quot; category, where the distinction between enterprise and consumer technology is not as clear, regularly outpaces both.) The switch comes at a time when enterprise companies’ initial public offerings have been warmly received by investors. For example, shares in video communications company Zoom Video Communications Inc. almost doubled after its April initial public offering. And security company Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. is up almost two-thirds following its June debut. Meanwhile, the most hotly anticipated consumer IPOs have underperformed. Ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. is down by about a third since its June offering, and in an extreme case, co-working company WeWork’s plan for the public markets dramatically crumbled last fall.But public market reception isn’t the only thing driving investment. The enterprise industry—less saturated by existing industry giants—has become a destination for some of the most talented entrepreneurs, and VCs know it. While corporate software may sound painfully boring, advancements in cloud computing and machine learning mean enterprise companies can give employees creative outlets. Investors liken the new opportunities to those once sparked for consumer startups by the advent of smartphones. In the consumer world, large companies are famous for edging out or buying up threatening upstarts. Either outcome means entrepreneurs in the giants’ crosshairs will never get to lead sizeable independent companies. While some large enterprise companies follow that playbook—SAP SE and Salesforce.com Inc. have cemented reputations as acquisition-hungry—enterprise founders often enjoy more latitude to say no to acquisition offers, with less fear that the bigger company will crush them.Cloud-monitoring business Datadog Inc., for example, turned down a bid from Cisco Systems Inc. just days before its IPO in September. And Slack Technologies Inc. continues to grow even as Microsoft Corp. has spent years pushing Teams, its own answer to office messaging.It helps that cutting-edge enterprise software requires a degree of specialization that can be hard to replicate. And increasingly, enterprise customers are open to working with startups, blunting the reputational advantage big brand-name companies enjoy when they roll out a competing product.For insights into how founders are thinking, consider Oleg Rogynskyy, whose business analytics company, People.ai, is the second enterprise startup he's founded. His career could have gone in a consumer direction if he had pursued the first business he got funding for—a photo feed he started in college in 2007. It could have turned into Instagram, maybe, or it could have gone the way of countless other less lucrative photo-sharing startups (remember Hipstamatic, PicPlz and Path?).Switching to enterprise was a good move, Rogynskyy says now. He believes enterprise companies can more easily grow to $100 million in revenue and reach IPO faster than their consumer counterparts, even if those IPOs might raise less capital. “The outcomes are smaller,” Rogynskyy says, “but the odds are higher.”This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter.

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg) -- When Salesforce.com Inc. emerged two decades ago, it lashed out at the software establishment: large companies that allegedly locked clients into dated products. Now, a coalition of newer rivals have extended that criticism to the cloud applications pioneer.  Ten software upstarts kicked off a public campaign Thursday that knocks customer relationship management, or CRM, titans, including Salesforce, Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, by saying the large companies keep clients trapped in subpar software suites, potentially shutting out smaller rivals with newer technology.The “Platform of Independents” leading the effort include Segment Inc., Amplitude Inc., Outreach Inc., Pendo.io Inc. and Drift.com Inc. Some of the companies are privately held unicorns, with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Each caters to a different software niche. The campaign began with a two-page ad in Thursday’s print edition of the Wall Street Journal and includes a web page and information sessions for prospective clients. More than 190 companies co-signed the main tenet of the campaign, that CRM software “isn’t enough” to provide good customer experiences to consumers.“We, as independent software companies, have built our products with the belief that a business should never be locked into a suite, never forced to have a one-size-fits-all technology approach, and its data should never be siloed,” the companies said in a statement. “It’s time to break free of the data monopoly.”The smaller companies argue the large software makers focus more on selling bundled packages of products than serving their clients’ needs with continuous innovation. Large technology companies have come under increasing antitrust scrutiny for their business practices, including how they wield power to maintain advantages over smaller firms. Beyond panning the quality of the bigger players’ technology, the chief executive officers of the startups said their larger rivals use acquisitions to bolster their market power.“If any of these guys becomes too big, that’s a threat to all of us in this ecosystem,” said Spenser Skates, CEO of Amplitude, which helps clients understand user behavior to improve product experiences. “Salesforce bought MuleSoft, Cisco bought AppDynamics. This is continuing to happen. It’s definitely a concern.”Representatives for Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Salesforce has been well served by its strategy in the CRM market. The company’s shares climbed about 19% last year. Oracle’s stock rose about 17%. Salesforce led the market for customer-management applications with 16.8% as of 2018, the last full year for which data is available, according to research firm IDC. Oracle was next with 5.7% while SAP came in third with 5.6%. Adobe Inc. and Microsoft Corp. rounded out the top five.Salesforce, founded in 1999, is the youngest company in the group. The others have been around for about four decades.“I think there’s something significantly broken that there’s been no big CRM company built in the last 10, 15, or 20 years,” Peter Reinhardt, the CEO of Segment, which helps companies compile their data about consumers, said in an interview.Reinhardt, who spearheaded this campaign, said he isn’t interested in being acquired. Rather, he wants to work more closely with his Platform of Independents peers to jointly sell packages of software solutions to clients, as a way to counter the selling advantages and software product bundles of larger companies. And Reinhardt is optimistic that a shakeup is possible in enterprise technology.“I think we have a temporarily dominant set of companies,” he said. “But I think there’s a huge opportunity for another rewrite of the CRM world.”(Updates with 2019 share performance in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Software Upstarts Hit Salesforce, Oracle on Tech and Sales Practices"

2020-01-17,"For a boring company like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), it enjoyed a solid performance in 2019. Last year, Cisco stock returned nearly 17% for stakeholders. Granted, it's not an earth-shattering figure. As a telecommunications equipment specialist, Cisco isn't exactly a sexy organization. However, it's a name you may want to keep in the backburner.Source: Anucha Cheechang / Shutterstock.com Before I get into the bullish argument for Cisco stock, let me acknowledge the reservations many investors have. To start off, some folks are skeptical of the underlying company's growth narrative. As an example, Cisco generated top-line sales of $13.2 billion in the most recent quarter ending Oct. 31, 2019. That represented only a modest 0.7% lift from the year-ago quarter.Now, no one is suggesting that Cisco stock is a growth monster. But without an overriding catalyst, it's hard to get the markets excited about the networking giant. That's probably one of the reasons that led to the rather choppy trading in shares last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in mid-July 2019, Cisco was up 40% for the year. But quickly thereafter, shares tumbled. The volatility continued when management reported its results for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Although the company beat on both the top and bottom lines, it disclosed disappointing guidance for fiscal Q1 2020.  * 10 Cheap Stocks Under $10 to Buy for 2016 With the see-sawing price action of Cisco stock, several investors elected to stay on the sidelines. While it's difficult to imagine a blue-chip powerhouse like Cisco tanking completely, market gains have been hard to come by. In other words, better alternative investments existed in this space and others.Be that as it may, the broader 5G rollout provides a distinctly lucrative opportunity for the telecom-equipment provider. Cisco Stock May Own the Keys to 5GAsk a random person on the street what 5G means and you'll probably get the answer of faster wireless speeds. While that's certainly a major component of this next-generation telecommunications technology, not too many people may appreciate the complex path toward structural realization.Put another way, 5G isn't just a switch that telecoms pull - voila! Faster wireless speeds! Instead, it's a multifaceted journey with myriad cogs that must work in sync to realize its true potential. Here, Cisco provides a critical pathway to enabling both mobile carriers and customers the full benefits of 5G. Thus, Cisco's general manager of service provider networking, Jonathan Davidson, boldly claimed that the company &quot;is the most important 5G vendor in the world.&quot;One area where Cisco is undoubtedly crucial is in the 5G backhaul. Essentially, a backhaul in telecommunications is the intermediary link between a core network and the group of localized subnetworks standing at the main network's edge.Currently, the challenge for the telecom industry is that today's backhaul is geared toward past technology. Davidson bluntly stated that much of the present backhaul in the U.S. is operating as &quot;a really low capacity network.&quot;Long story short, without an upgraded backhaul, the 5G rollout will hit a technical backlog.But it's not just the backhaul narrative that bolsters the case for Cisco stock. The underlying organization also aims to help mobile carriers upgrade their core networks to fully advantage 5G's potential. To that end, Cisco has gained substantial credibility by partnering with Japanese firm Rakuten (OTCMKTS:RKUNY) to build out its 5G network, along with its virtualized telco cloud.It's quite possible that the markets aren't pricing in the longer-term implications for Cisco's 5G opportunities. Therefore, you can get in before the bullish wave hits. Boring Is Good, Especially Right NowEven with Cisco's 5G thesis, the company's boring reputation will be hard to shake. Still, I think this is actually a benefit, especially in the current market environment.Let's face it: with the broader bull market heading toward its eleventh year, it's on the edge of wearing out its welcome. If history is any guide, you'd expect a wider-scale correction in the next year or two.If so, the exciting names are probably the most vulnerable to steep losses. That doesn't fit Cisco stock at all. Here, you have an investment supported by a stable balance sheet, strongly positive cash flow and a dividend. While these attributes won't prevent spilling red ink, any volatility will at least be mitigated.Therefore, from both a strategic and tactical perspective, Cisco stock just makes sense.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.The world’s rich and powerful are in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum’s 50th annual meeting, and the gathering will be closely watched to see how the global elite aims to tackle issues they helped create, above all climate change.President Donald Trump’s appearance, which came on the same day his impeachment trial starts in Washington, began with him calling the trial a “hoax” and “disgraceful.” In his speech, he lauded his economic achievements and said the U.S. is “winning again like never before.”Meanwhile, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was in the audience for Trump’s speech, stepped up her criticism of governments and companies for not doing enough to tackle climate change.For in-depth coverage and analysis of Trump’s speech, check out our TOPLive blog on the Bloomberg Terminal. To get all the daily highlights delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Davos Diary newsletter.Here’s the latest (time-stamps are local time in Davos):Carney Sees ‘Fundamental Reshaping’ of Financial System (4:30 p.m.)Rising awareness about the impact of climate change has triggered a “fundamental reshaping” of the financial system, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.“Once you get a common approach to this, and dialog around it, then you have a market and then you know where to put the pressure,” Carney said in a panel discussion on promoting “Green Growth.”“Right now, the conversation can be deflected so easily because different people are talking about different priorities with a different language,” he added.Australia’s Cormann Sees Climate Link to Bushfires (4:35 p.m.)Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said there’s little doubt that the extremity of raging wildfires can be partly linked to climate-change effects.“Australia has been well prepared to deal with emergencies, but this was a particularly devastating, extreme event,” he said. “There’s no doubt that climate change has had an impact, it worsens the intensity of the events and there is certainly more we need to do to manage the events when they occur.”Cormann added that the country “absolutely does its bit when it comes to effective action on climate change.”Trump Is ‘Very Happy’ With French Tariff, Digital-Tax Talks (4:28 p.m.)President Trump says he is happy with the outcome of talks with France after he and President Emmanuel Macron agreed to a truce in their dispute over digital taxes.“We had a very good conversation, it worked out very well, the U.S. is very happy with the result, and we appreciate very much what President Macron did,” Trump said, declining to specify details of the agreement.China Says U.S. Trade Deal Won’t Hurt Imports From Others (4:06 p.m.)China’s Vice Premier Han Zheng said the country’s trade deal with the U.S. won’t hurt business for other countries.In the most high-profile remarks on the country’s economic policy since the accord was signed last week, Han said that its commitment to buy more from the U.S. is in line with its World Trade Organization obligations and won’t squeeze out other imports. Han also pledged to lower barriers for foreign investors as he set out the case for China’s engagement with the global economy.“China will open its door wider,” Han said. “Though facing some protectionism from some countries, the determination to open up will not waver.”Cisco Looks Past China Tension, Brexit for Rebound (3:57 p.m.)Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said the recent trade deals between the U.S. and China could help “re-energize” business after global uncertainty weighed on the company’s business outlook.In November, Cisco’s share price slumped after the networking company gave a sales forecast that was far below analysts’ projections, pressured in large part by rising global political and economic turmoil. In an interview, Robbins attributed this “business pause” to Brexit and tensions between China and the U.S., but is optimistic looking past these issues.Kosovo President Vows to Pursue EU Integration (3:30 p.m.)Kosovo’s president pledged to work with his pick for premier to advance the country’s efforts to join the European Union and NATO and expects Prime Minister-designate Albin Kurti to create a government “very soon.”“We have one goal: to move as fast as possible toward European integration and to be a member of NATO,” President Hashim Thaci said in an interview on the sidelines of the forum.Trump Talking ‘Big Trade Deal’ With EU (3:20 p.m.)President Trump said he would be discussing a “big trade deal” with EU officials in Davos.“We’ve been talking about it for a while, and hopefully we can get something done,” he told reporters during a meeting with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “A deal between ourselves and essentially Europe is something we all want to be able to make.”Trump said he had heard von der Leyen is a “very tough negotiator, which is bad news for us, because we’re going to talk about a big trade deal.”Both sides agreed to meet “soon” in Washington to “move the common transatlantic agenda forward,” the Commission said.Protesters Echo Greta’s Call for Action (3:15 p.m.)About 200 climate activists gathered in Davos to protest against the World Economic Forum and what they said was lack of action to stop global warming, with banners that read “Strike WEF. Eat the rich,” “World Economic Fail” and “WEF managers: listen to Greta.”The demonstrators, which included school children chanting “save the planet,” congregated about one kilometer away from the venue where global business and political leaders gathered. Thunberg, the 17-year old Swedish activist who spoke earlier, didn’t attend the rally. Swiss police prevented demostrators from blocking the main thoroughfare in Davos.Starbucks Says Hold the Milk to Cut Carbon Footprint (3 p.m.)To cut your morning coffee’s carbon footprint, skip the Frappuccino and take a plain black espresso. Overall, dairy products are the biggest source of carbon-dioxide emissions, according to an environmental assessment by Starbucks Corp. By 2030, the cafe chain is targeting 50% reductions in carbon emissions, water withdrawal and waste sent to landfills.“We know this journey will be challenging, we know we can’t do this alone, and we know this will require others to join us,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in an interview.U.S. Tax System Fosters Inequality: IMF’s Gopinath (2:50 p.m.)Inequality in the U.S. is still among the highest in advanced economies, and there is room to change tax rules to try to address that, according to International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath.“There are some very wealthy individuals who can redefine labor income as capital income. That needs to be got rid of. It’s just not right for the times,” Gopinath said during a panel on the U.S. economy.“Similarly when it comes to estate taxes, there is a windfall to beneficiaries of wealthy individuals,” she added. “These are kinds of low-hanging fruit that I think need to be addressed so that going forward there is more opportunity spread around.”Mnuchin Says U.S. Growth Predictions Too Low (2:40 p.m)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said growth projections for the U.S. economy for this year are probably too low and recent trade agreements with China, Mexico and Canada will provide a boost in 2020.“There’s no question, when we look ahead to 2020, that business in the U.S. feels very good,” Mnuchin said during a panel discussion on “Testing America’s Economic Resilience.” “And there’s no question that the two trade deals that we’ve done will have an impact this year.”Mnuchin added that Boeing Co.’s problems with its 737 Max aircraft could remain a drag on the economy and that he doesn’t comment on Federal Reserve policy. Asked why Trump does and he chooses not to, Mnuchin said: “He’s the president, and I’m the Secretary of the Treasury.”China’s Han Calls for ‘Inclusive’ World Economy (2:30 p.m.)Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said “risks and uncertainties” are increasing and the only way to counter them is to foster “an inclusive and open world economy.”“Unilateral and protectionist practices which run counter to the global trend will lead nowhere,” Han said in a special address. “They will only weaken the foundations of global growth and trade and end up hurting everyone’s interests. To resolve the difficulties and the problems in economic globalization, the fundamental solution lies in building an inclusive and open world economy together.”Stiglitz Predicts ‘Significant Haircuts’ in Argentina (2:25 p.m.)Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz warned investors in Argentine debt that they should be prepared for major losses.“The reality is there will have to be significant haircuts,” Stiglitz said in a Bloomberg interview. “I cannot conceive of any reasonable model not saying that there has to be significant haircuts. It would be fantasy to think otherwise.”Stiglitz mentored Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman, who is in charge of renegotiating Argentina‘s debt.Citigroup Reassures Branch Workers (2:15 p.m.)Citigroup Inc. spends about $8.5 billion a year on technology, but the bank’s boss says that doesn’t mean branch workers will all be replaced by machines anytime soon.Modernizing the bank’s app and digital-banking experience won’t necessarily result in Citigroup needing fewer people in its retail bank, Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Instead, it will mean “being smarter” about how those employees are used, he said.Trump Takes Veiled Swipe at Climate ‘Alarmists’ (1:54 p.m.)Trump launched a veiled attack on environmental “alarmists,” taking a swipe at the World Economic Forum’s key focus this year.Trump invoked those who predicted an “overpopulation crisis” and the end of oil, saying: “These alarmists always demand the same thing, absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives.”“This is not a time for pessimism, this is a time for optimism,” he said in his speech, which was watched by Thunberg. “Fear and doubt is not a good thought process, because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.”BlackRock’s Fink: Government Dependency a Key Climate Risk (1:40 p.m.)BlackRock Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the biggest risk on the path to a carbon-neutral economy is being too dependent on governments to take action, saying they’re not equipped to handle the task on their own.“Climate change is now becoming an investment risk,” Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. The transition to a carbon-free economy will take over 50 years, and “the key thing that we need to do is find ways to mitigate those risks while we are dependent on carbon,” he added.Thunberg Calls for ‘Real Zero’ Carbon Emissions (1 p.m.)Thunberg called on the world’s polluters to aim for “real zero” carbon emissions rather than “net zero” and said “our house is still on fire.”“We are not telling you to keep talking about reaching net-zero emissions or carbon neutrality by cheating and fiddling around with numbers,” Thunberg said in a speech at a panel on “Averting a Climate Apocalypse.”“We’re not telling you to offset your emissions by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate,” she added.“We demand participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels.”Blackstone’s Schwarzman Reacts to Trump Speech (12:30 p.m.)“It was for several different constituencies,” Blackstone Group Inc. Chairman Steve Schwarzman said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “This was a speech to basically say ‘I think we need some perspective and let’s look at what’s happened under this administration.’ That is not just for domestic consumption, it’s meant to be heard in the broader context.”The billionaire co-founder of the New York-based private equity firm has previously advised Trump and was present in the White House when he announced the first part of the China-U.S. trade deal.Trump Urges Nations to Join Together (12.15 p.m.)Trump concluded his speech by calling on world leaders to join together to “make our nations stronger, our countries safer, our culture richer, our people freer, and the world more beautiful than ever before.”“Above all else, we will forever be loyal to our workers, our citizens and our families, the men and women who are the backbone of our economies, the heart of our communities and the soul of our countries,” Trump said. “Let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world.”Trump Hails ‘Blue-Collar Boom’ (12 p.m.)Trump said the economic strength of the U.S. is benefiting ordinary people and “the workers come first” under his administration.“The U.S. celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda,” he said. “This is a blue-collar boom. The American dream is back, bigger better and stronger than ever before.”Trump Attacks Fed for Interest-Rates Policy (11:55 a.m.)Trump renewed his feud with the Federal Reserve, saying the central bank raised interest rates too quickly.These great numbers are “despite the fact the the Fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly,” Trump said. “I see such tremendous potential for the future. We have not even started, because the numbers we’re talking about are massive. The time for skepticism is over.”CEOs Complain They Can’t Save the Planet on Their Own (11:50 a.m.)As the financial industry comes under pressure to avoid funding dirty energy, the heads of Citigroup Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group AG said they need their clients to do more work too.“I say to our clients, ‘I don’t want to be the sharp end of the spear,’” enforcing industry standards, Michael Corbat, chief executive officer of New York-based Citigroup, said Tuesday in a panel discussion. “You should set those, you get proper buy-in and we will be here to support you.”Mario Greco, the CEO of Zurich Insurance, agreed with Corbat that carbon is mispriced, and said insurance firms are having a tough time deciding what to underwrite as a result.Trump Trumpets His Economic Achievements (11:50 a.m.)In his speech, Trump said that the U.S. “is in the midst of economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before.”“We’ve regained our stride; we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of American enterprise,” Trump said. “America’s thriving; America is flourishing and, yes, America is winning again like never before.”Trump Says Impeachment is ‘Just a Hoax’ (11:40 a.m.)Trump told reporters on the way into his speech that the impeachment trial is “just a hoax” and a “witchhunt that’s been going on for years.”“Frankly it’s disgraceful,” he added. “We look forward to being here. We’re meeting with the biggest companies in the world, the biggest businesses in the world and world leaders, all for the benefit of the United States.”Immigrants Key to Growth, Microsoft CEO Says (11:40 a.m.)Microsoft Corp’s chief executive officer warned that countries that fail to attract immigrants will lose out as the global tech industry continues to grow.“Every country is rethinking what is in their national interest,” Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait.Governments need to “maintain that modicum of enlightenment and not think about it very narrowly,” Nadella added. “People will only come when people know you’re an immigrant-friendly country.”Nokia’s Suri Predicts Productivity Boom (11:35 a.m.)The next industrial revolution will bring about “massive productivity growth” the likes of which hasn’t been seen in decades, according to Nokia Oyj Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri.Speaking on a panel about manufacturing, Suri estimated that productivity should increase by as much as 35% starting in about 2028. The gains will be seen first in the U.S. and a few years later in China, India and the European Union, he predicted.Naspers CEO Sees Growth in Second-Hand Clothes (11:30 a.m.)Naspers Ltd., Africa’s biggest company by market value, expects second-hand clothing sales online to pick up as companies around the world look to cut production of new goods to help address climate change.“We are big investors in trading in second-hand clothes -- we think the world will need more recycling over time,” Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk told Bloomberg TV. “In classifieds, we are helping to reduce the production of new goods.”Bremmer Says Delegates Like Trump’s Policies (11 a.m.)Ian Bremmer, president of consulting firm Eurasia Group, said Davos delegates may not like Trump but “they like his policies.”“They like the regulatory rollback, they like his cabinet, they like his tax policy,” Bremmer told Bloomberg TV, adding that an informal poll of about 40 to 50 delegates he conducted showed there is “zero panic” about Trump winning a second term.“You can have Greta here, you can have a bunch of people talking about climate and sustainability, but the reality is that Trump doesn’t drive people crazy at Davos the way he does in the United States,” Bremmer said.Trump is likely to show his “triumphalist, unilateralist” side in his speech. “This is going to be Trump saying victory lap, I’m the greatest ever, my economy is doing well, my markets are taking off, look how much money I’m making you guys.”Huawei CEO Dismisses Threat of U.S. Escalation (10:50 a.m.)Huawei Technologies Co. founder Ren Zhengfei played down the threat that the U.S. will impose even stricter sanctions against his company, saying he is confident China’s largest tech company can survive further attacks.“This year, the U.S. might further escalate its campaign against Huawei but I feel the impact on Huawei’s business would not be very significant,” he said during a panel discussion.IBM Proposes Rules to Counter AI Bias (10 a.m.)IBM called for rules aimed at eliminating bias in artificial intelligence to ease concerns that the technology relies on data that bakes in discriminatory practices and could harm women, minorities, the disabled and others.“It seems pretty clear to us that government regulation of artificial intelligence is the next frontier in tech policy regulation,” Chris Padilla, vice president of government and regulatory affairs at International Business Machines Corp., said ahead of a Wednesday panel on AI to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty.Mnuchin Says EU Car Tariffs Not Curently Planned (9:10 a.m.)Car tariffs on producers in the European Union are not currently planned to enforce Iran sanctions, but they remain in President Trump’s toolbox, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.The U.S. will likely have $1 trillion deficits for a couple more years and the next phase of the China trade deal may not be a “big bang,” Mnuchin told the newspaper.HKEX CEO Li Shrugs Off Virus Concerns (8:50 a.m.)Charles Li, chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., shrugged off concerns about the outbreak of a deadly virus originating in central China.“There are a lot of things that impact investor sentiment but you have to think that structurally the market is very resilient,” Li said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.Thunberg Says ‘Nothing Been Done’ on Climate (8:45 a.m.)Speaking on a panel about sustainability, Thunberg said people are more aware about environmental issues now but that “pretty much nothing has been done” to tackle climate change as emissions of carbon dioxide have not declined.“Without treating this as a real crisis we cannot solve it,” Thunberg said. “It will require much more than this, this is just the very beginning.”The panel didn’t attract leaders of the fossil fuels companies attending the forum, with most senior oil and gas executives absent.Trump Wants ‘Hundreds of Billions’ for U.S. (8:30 a.m.)Trump arrived in Switzerland with ongoing impeachment proceedings on his mind. He tweeted throughout much of the flight, largely about a Senate trial due to get underway there Tuesday. But he said his Davos appearance is all about the economy.His aim is to “bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America,” he wrote on Twitter.“We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!!,” Trump tweeted ahead of his arrival in Davos just after 9:30 a.m. local time. He also took a swipe at what he called “Fake News Media,” accusing it of hating to talk about the economy and “how incredible it is.”IEA’s Birol Worried About Situation in Iraq (8:15 a.m.)Fatih Birol, executive director at the International Energy Agency, told Bloomberg TV’s Francine Lacqua that the situation in Iraq is currently his main concern in the oil markets.“Recent developments in Iraq are not very comforting,” Birol said. “I see Iraq as a major issue, which is very important for the oil markets but also for the world economy, which is already very fragile. I really hope we all see an Iraq that has some stability and production can go ahead.”German Greens Leader Sides With Trump on Spending Critique (7:40 a.m.)Robert Habeck, co-leader of Germany’s opposition Greens party, told Bloomberg TV’s Francine Lacqua that the government needs to rethink its balanced-budget policy and spend more in areas like climate-friendly infrastructure.Habeck attacked Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “fetishism” about balancing the budget and said that although he’s not a fan of U.S. President Donald Trump, the criticism in the U.S. about Germany not spending enough is valid.The Greens, who are currently Germany’s second-most popular party behind Merkel’s bloc, have been out of government for too long and are ready to take on the responsibility of running Europe’s biggest economy, Habeck added.Monday CatchupIMF Trims Global Growth Outlook But Tones Down Risk WarningsMore Than Half of CEOs See Global Growth Slowing This YearEU Agonizes Over Troop Deployment With Libyan Oil Flows BlockedMacron, Trump May Have Tariff Truce in 2020 Digital Tax FightBlackRock’s Hildebrand Says Lawmakers Key to Climate FightPhilip Morris Steps Up Vaping Plan, Keeps Close Ties With AltriaMachin at Davos Warns Pension Funds on Rush to Illiquid Assets&#92;--With assistance from Eyk Henning, Sridhar Natarajan, Andrea Dudik, Simon Kennedy and Shelley Robinson.To contact the reporters on this story: Iain Rogers in Berlin at irogers11@bloomberg.net;Chris Reiter in Berlin at creiter2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, ;Simon Kennedy at skennedy4@bloomberg.net, Iain Rogers, Chris ReiterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Trump Lauds His Achievements, Talks Trade With EU: Davos Update"

Including dividends, I'm up about 3%.Analysts have been watching this slow growth for years. While other tech giants have rocketed upward, Cisco has just met the market. It opened for trade Jan. 24 at about $49/share, a price to earnings ratio of 19.5, and a dividend yielding 2.86%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy &quot;Show me,&quot; the critics say. Show me what? Cisco has 31% of the market for IP endpoints, 20% ahead of anyone else. If there's a phone market, Cisco dominates it. Trouble is no one believes in phones anymore. Cisco Stock StrategyCisco has been putting its money into add-on networking software it can sell by subscription, and a chip set called Silicon One, for handling the next decade's network applications.This has analysts pounding the table for Cisco stock, with two-thirds rating it either a &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;strong buy.&quot; It's been too cheap for too long, they argue. Its rebound has just begun. Certainly, Cisco has been hit hard by the trade war, which has mainly benefited Chinese rivals like Huawei. Huawei hardware is cheaper, it gets the largest market to itself, and it's winning big contracts in Europe on price and anti-American animus. Cisco has cut back operations in China but has publicly called the impact &quot;very minimal.&quot; CEO Chuck Robbins calls it all a &quot;shallow pause.&quot; Why I Like CiscoRobbins, born in a former country town turned Atlanta suburb, will celebrate five years at the helm in July, having succeeded the legendary John Chambers. He has had to negotiate two industry transitions, from hardware to software, and from boxed devices to chips. He has kept Cisco humming and profitable, but the politics of the Internet have not helped.Cisco needs big customers to thrive, telcos and scaled enterprises that use Internet contracting as politics by other means. The move into security software has made it as vulnerable to emergency patches as anyone else.Growth is now expected from Silicon One. The new chips also change Cisco's target market from telcos to the Cloud Czars, companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). This is a good thing.As Mitch Wagner of Light Reading notes, the company's new direct strategy puts it in competition with suppliers like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). It also transforms and unifies Cisco's product line, drawing together five different chip architectures into one, hence the name.To make its transitions work, Cisco has been constantly in acquisition mode. Its latest buy is Exablaze Systems, an Australian maker of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which will go into its Nexus networking gear. Exablaze was Cisco's sixth acquisition of 2019. This followed six deals in 2018, and nine in 2017. Such deals bleed capital, but they maintain competitiveness. The Bottom LineCisco is at the center of nearly every fast-growing technology 2020 offers.It's in the 5G transition to wireless ubiquity. It's in the fast-growing security market. It's keeping up with the cloud transition and joining the rush of suppliers to design their own silicon.I don't expect Cisco to explode with growth as others do. I see it as a purely defensive play within the technology sector. It's able to cover its dividend with income and has enough cash to cover its debt twice over, with a stock that can keep funding acquisitions.Don't expect excitement from Cisco stock. Expect steady gains and you won't be disappointed.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2020-01-29,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson risked a rift with President Donald Trump as he gave Huawei Technologies Co. the green light to help develop Britain’s next-generation broadband networks.While the U.K. government announced it will keep what it calls high-risk vendors such as Huawei out of the most sensitive core parts of its 5G mobile networks, the company will be able to supply other equipment that is critical to the roll-out of broadband such as antennas and base stations.That is a blow to the Trump administration, which wanted Johnson to impose an outright ban on the Shenzhen-based tech giant, citing concerns that its gear could be vulnerable to infiltration by Chinese spies. The two men spoke about the U.K. decision on Tuesday, according to Johnson’s office. American officials had warned the U.S. may be forced to hold back secret intelligence from the U.K. in future, if Johnson pressed ahead with giving Huawei a role. The company has always denied it poses any security risk.A key pillar of Johnson’s vision for a future outside the world’s richest single market is a trade deal with the U.S. and the Huawei license risks setting up a clash with Trump. On their call on Tuesday, Johnson “underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies,” his office said.The initial reaction from Washington was muted.A senior U.S. administration official expressed disappointment at Johnson’s decision, but also hope that the U.S. and the U.K. could still find some way to exclude components from untrusted vendors in 5G systems in future. Trump himself has yet to comment, and is preparing to announce his Middle East peace plan later Tuesday.Read More: U.K. Still Wary of China Hacking Threat After Limiting HuaweiReactions from Congress were more critical. “Here’s the sad truth: our special relationship is less special now that the U.K. has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei,” said Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska.Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee suggested curtailing intelligence-sharing with any allies whose networks run on the equipment of “untrusted” vendors. “If we have exhausted our carrots with the Brits, it may be time to use a stick,” Blackburn said in a statement. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a reference to Brexit, said: “I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing. Allowing Huawei to build the U.K.’s 5G networks today is like allowing the KGB to build its telephone network during the Cold War.”In London, too, senior members of Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party expressed dismay at his decision. Former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, and ex-cabinet minister David Davis warned of the security risks the Chinese company posed. “The size and complexity, the problem we are trying to protect against, is enormous,” Davis told the House of Commons. “Huawei should be banned from our networks.”The widely-expected announcement by Johnson’s government is a compromise between the outright ban on Huawei sought by the U.S. and the access sought by telecommunication companies. While it ends months of political wrangling in the U.K., the process remains fraught with peril for Johnson as he prepares to end Britain’s 47 years of European Union membership and plans to negotiate a new trade deal with the U.S.Market ShareUnder the U.K.’s policy, a cap of up to 35% will be imposed on Huawei’s share of the non-sensitive parts of the next-generation networks, such as antennas, masts and even fixed-line fiber-to-the-home components.High risk vendors, a category which would also include China’s ZTE, which is already banned from the U.K., are also to be “excluded from sensitive geographic locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases.”The 35% cap will be kept under review and could reduce over time, the government said. The cap is roughly in line with Huawei’s current overall market share in 4G, and Huawei said it was expected and reasonable. U.K. officials said the cap could be reduced over time, and the aim is to work with allies to help develop alternatives and get to a stage where the country doesn’t need to rely on high-risk vendors at all.However, the cap may mean that phone carriers like BT Group Plc’s EE, Vodafone Group Plc and Three have to rejig their 5G plans to comply. Three, a unit of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., had been depending on Huawei to deliver the entirety of its 5G radio-access network, with Nokia chosen to provide the core.Dave Dyson, chief executive officer of Three U.K., said in a statement: “We note the government’s announcement and are reviewing the detail.”Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj are the primary Huawei rivals in networking equipment now, but the U.K. decision may help create more options for certain segments of wireless networks. Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., Ciena Corp. and Infinera Corp. may benefit as wireless operators look for alternative suppliers, said Woo Jin Ho, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.Huawei ReassuredIn a statement, Huawei Vice-President Victor Zhang said it was “reassured” that the U.K. will let the company keep working with carriers on 5G.“This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future,” he said, committing to build on Huawei’s more than 15 years supplying U.K. telecom operators.The Confederation of British Industry, the leading business lobby in the country, said “this solution appears a sensible compromise that gives the U.K. access to cutting-edge technology, whilst building in appropriate checks and balances around security.” Vodafone, which uses Huawei in its U.K. radio network, said “we aim to keep any potential disruption to customers to a minimum.”By curbing Huawei’s access but still allowing the supplier to play a role in 5G, British officials are betting they can manage any security risks at home and still maintain intelligence-sharing ties with the U.S. and other allies.Johnson discussed Huawei in a phone call with Trump on Friday, and clearly wasn’t swayed by the push for a total ban. The prime minister said the U.K. could have the best of both worlds: retaining access to the best technology while protecting the data of consumers. British security services deem the risks manageable.For the U.K. timing of its announcement is particularly sensitive. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who had warned Johnson’s predecessor not to “wobble” on the issue, is due to visit on Wednesday.Huawei has been a key supplier to the U.K. and many other European phone networks for over a decade so this decision will be closely watched by others. In fact, many European nations are leaning in the same direction as the U.K.QuickTake: Can a 70-Year-Old Spy Alliance Endure in Era of 5G?The EU will publish its own guidelines on Wednesday which give leeway to member states to restrict or ban Huawei without forcing them to do so. According to a draft of the document seen by Bloomberg, countries should consider banning suppliers based in countries with insufficient “democratic checks and balances” from core 5G components.Canada has also indicated interest in a similarly split decision -- allowing Huawei while also pledging to contain any security risk.A key concern of the U.S. is that other countries will copy-and-paste the U.K.’s solution, relying on its regulatory system and high level of access to Huawei technology.“The U.K. model isn’t easily replicated,” warned Ian Levy, technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre, in a blog published alongside the decision. “The approach we’ve come up with for the U.K. is specific to the U.K. context. Others shouldn’t assume they’re getting the same level of protection for modern networks if they do similar things without performing their own analysis.”The market is broken, he added, because it’s not commercially attractive to build good security into networks.(Updates with Huawei alternatives in 16th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Olivia Konotey-Ahulu, Josh Wingrove and Kevin Cirilli.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Seal in London at tseal@bloomberg.net;Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Tim Ross, Rebecca PentyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Disappointed as Johnson Gives Huawei Partial 5G Role

2020-02-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc., a maker of cloud-based databases, raised $479 million in its latest funding round, boosting the company’s valuation to $12.4 billion. It also announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce.com Inc.Snowflake sells a type of database that compiles information from various sources so it can be analyzed. The company competes against Amazon.com Inc.’s Redshift product as well as those from industry stalwart Oracle Corp., which has stumbled in the cloud-computing market. Snowflake’s use among clients more than tripled in 2019, making it the fastest-growing cloud-based business software product, according to Okta Inc.’s annual Business @ Work report last month. Snowflake’s new valuation will boost it to No. 13 among global startups, according to data from CB Insights. The company previously was valued at $3.9 billion.The increased valuation came about as part of the new relationship with Salesforce, Frank Slootman, Snowflake’s chief executive officer, said Friday in an interview. “They want to invest in the company as a condition of the partnership,” he said. “They want to benefit from the upside from them being a partner.”Salesforce Ventures, the investment arm of the customer-relations software maker, and Dragoneer Investment Group, which led the fundraising, each contributed half of the round, he said.Slootman said the company recently added two new female board members, Kelly Kramer, the chief financial officer of Cisco Systems Inc., and Teresa Briggs, a former executive at Deloitte LLP. Snowflake is preparing to make the leap to the public markets by the end of 2021, Slootman said.Existing Snowflake backers, including Altimeter Capital, Iconiq Capital, Madrona Venture Group and others, are expected to participate in another investment closing “within the next few weeks,” according to Snowflake.Snowflake said its alliance with Salesforce will involve products, marketing and sales efforts. It will release further details on the relationship in June. Slootman said that Salesforce and Snowflake will make it easier to transfer data between their systems, a process he currently describes as “clunky, slow, and expensive.”In some past instances, Salesforce has eventually acquired portfolio companies. To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Snowflake Vaults to $12 Billion Valuation, Partners with Salesforce"

2020-02-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. said revenue this quarter may decline more than analysts projected, indicating that corporations are still cautious about increasing spending on their computer networks.Sales in the third quarter, which ends in April, will drop as much as 3.5% from a year earlier, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average expected revenue of $12.6 billion, in line with the midpoint of Cisco’s forecast range. Adjusted profit will be 79 cents to 81 cents a share. Analysts had projected 80 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Cisco is predicting a second consecutive quarterly revenue contraction, showing that its main business of selling expensive networking hardware is still struggling amid tepid spending by corporations and government agencies. While a push into software and services had eased the company’s reliance on hardware, such as switches and routers, that machinery still provides the biggest chunk of revenue. Cisco’s customers in certain markets and areas are putting off signing orders, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said.“It’s just lower close rates and taking longer to get closed,” he said in an interview. “That tells you it’s a pause and not a cliff.”Cisco shares declined about 4% extended trading. They had earlier closed at $49.93 in New York, leaving them up 4.3% in the last 12 months. That compares with a 23% gain in the S&P 500 Index.The company said net income in the fiscal second quarter rose to $2.88 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $2.82 billion, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 4% to $12 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 77 cents a share. On average, analysts were predicting profit of 76 cents on sales of $11.98 billion.Cisco’s hardware business generated sales of $6.53 billion in the period ended Jan. 25, a decline of 8% from a year earlier. Applications, its software unit, also dropped 8% to $1.35 billion and security revenue expanded 9% to $748 million.In Europe, orders would have increased if not for the U.K., where companies and the government held off. Similarly, in Asia, China revenue dropped 30%, Robbins said. Without that drag, Asia as a region would have shown growth. In the U.S., Cisco’s largest and most profitable region, the company was hurt by slower server sales and the ongoing decline in orders from phone and internet service providers.Robbins expressed his confidence in a rebound once issues including Brexit, trade and the health crisis in China are resolved.“There’s a lot of sprouts out there that lead me to continue to be optimistic,” he said.Cisco, whose gear handles much of the world’s internet data traffic, has said that telecommunications service providers have pared spending on computer networks. Many are devoting the bulk of their budgets to purchases of radio equipment to build out coverage of new fifth generation, or 5G, cellular networks. Once those networks have been built out and are generating traffic, investment will shift to the kind of gear Cisco makes, for connecting the computers that handle the data-processing element of wireless services.(Updates with CEO comments in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Jillian WardFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Gives Sluggish Sales Forecast on Lingering Slowdown

Video-calling potential investors or distributors remains “our contingency plan,” Ching said.Robert Vis, chief executive officer of enterprise communications startup MessageBird, said MWC is “super important” as networking at the show “fundamentally drives our business.”The Amsterdam-based company competes with the likes of Twilio Inc., helping firms chat with customers via messaging apps, SMS and calls. To make this happen, Vis said MessageBird needs to forge and maintain thousands of relationships with businesses, software companies and mobile carriers.“I founded the company in 2011 and we used to go with three people and run 20 meetings a day,” he said. This year he’d expected to take 40 people and hold about 500 meetings, before deciding Wednesday to pull out.“We’re a 200 million-euro ($218 million) business and this is the event of the year from a carrier perspective,” he said. “But we just don’t want to take any risk in terms of our employee safety.”The GSMA, which organizes MWC, confirmed as recently as Wednesday that the event is still going ahead.If it doesn’t, there are travel, accommodation, exhibition booths and entertainment costs deep-pocketed tech companies can afford to absorb in ways startups can’t always.MessageBird’s booth costs about 750,000 euros, in addition to travel and accommodation. But, Vis said, employee safety was more important than the numbers.Less CompetitionEven before the virus scare, big companies globally have begun looking for ways to generate buzz for their products without hitting the conference circuit.Sony, the world’s biggest console maker, skipped last year’s E3 video-game conference for the first time in almost a quarter-century. It said at the time it would focus on “exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community” instead.IDC analyst Raquel de Condado Marques said that large companies, such as Samsung Electronics Co., could ultimately benefit if MWC was halted.“Smaller vendors that were planning to launch their phones at MWC were counting on the visibility they could earn,” she said. “Therefore, Samsung will benefit from the fact that some of its competitors will lose the spotlight that MWC could potentially cast on them.”ShowStoppers, a popular companion event to MWC and other tech conferences, such as the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, gives smaller companies an opportunity to meet industry insiders and journalists at evening networking events.Many smaller companies take booths at these evening gatherings, which draw hundreds of industry insiders and journalists with promises of early access to cool tech from the main show, peppered with food, drinks and networking.On Tuesday, its organizer, Steve Leon, said the event was still planned to go ahead.“ShowStoppers continues to monitor news and will follow health and safety advisories from the World Health Organization, Spanish authorities, GSMA, airlines and other organizations, and the Chinese and other governments,” he wrote in an email to attendees.&#92;--With assistance from Vlad Savov.To contact the reporter on this story: Nate Lanxon in London at nlanxon@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Virus Hits Startups Trying to Pitch at Giant Mobile Conference

2020-02-13,"Follow markets long enough and you're bound to hear some speculation regarding the efficacy of Chinese data. Meaning that there are plenty of folks out there that think economic numbers out of the world's second-largest economy may not always be accurate.Source: Provided by Finviz What is not up for debate, however, is that the number of new cases of the coronavirus from China spiked by 15,000 in the mainland, after the method for counting instances of the deadly respiratory illness was altered. That raises doubts, including in the White House, that China isn't being entirely forthright with just how bad the situation is there. As a result, stocks meandered Thursday, listlessly drifting between gains and losses.  * The S&P 500 fell 0.16%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.43%.  * The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.14%.  * Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was by far the worst-performing Dow name today, plunging 5.23% after revealing tepid guidance for the current quarter.Overall, these are not dramatic declines considering that it is clear the coronavirus situation is far from resolved. If anything, the scenario may be worsening in China and that presents a potential headwind for riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, with 14 Dow stocks higher in late trading, Thursday wasn't a good day nor was it alarmingly bad. Cisco ConundrumFor tech investors, Cisco just isn't the growth story it once was. Prospects for the networking gear maker partying like it's 1999 again appear grim at this point. The company served up guidance for the current quarter of earnings of 79 cents to 81 cents a share while Wall Street was expecting 80 cents.  * 7 Reasons to Own Taylor Morrison Stock As I noted earlier this month, Cisco feels a lot more like an International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) than a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).What that means is an ultra-conservative investor may like Cisco for buybacks and dividend growth, but don't expect much in the way of capital appreciation over the near-term. Speaking of MicrosoftMicrosoft was trading slightly lower at this writing after Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith approved Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) request for a preliminary injunction on the now controversial $10 billion JEDI contract from the Pentagon.Microsoft, to the surprise of many, particularly Amazon, won that deal and the latter has consistently cried foul since then. Amazon even wants to depose President Trump on the matter.I'm not an attorney or a law professor, but granting the injunction, which halts Microsoft's JEDI work, seems to be a slippery slope. What's to stop any company that loses out on a government contract going forward from pursuing the same action and Campbell-Smith has now established precedent that could encourage sore losers to pursue legal action.There is a $42 million penalty for Amazon should the judge eventually rule the injunction was unnecessary. No, I'm not bearish on Amazon stock. Quite the contrary, but one gets the feeling between the $42 million (assuming it's paid) and legal fees, Amazon could find plenty of better ways to spend capital. Caterpillar AgainCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been getting some run in this space this month and the industrial machinery maker is back again today with good reason.Goldman Sachs upgraded the Dow stock to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral,&quot; while lifting its 12-month price forecast on the stock to $168 from $156. Even at $162, the mid-point of that range, that represents decent upside from today's close around $140. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTaking a break from the intraday conversation, I figured I'd pass along some interesting research I came across that's relevant to owners of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and the other Dow healthcare names.The long and the short of it is, State Street sees opportunity in the group despite this being a presidential election year.&quot;The current negativity towards health care sets the stage for the sector to potentially surprise to the upside, thanks to its fundamental backdrop combined with secular tailwinds,&quot; said State Street in a recent note. &quot;Health care firms are expected to post the strongest earnings and revenue growth in 2019 of any sector, and over the past three months, analysts have been ratcheting up their 2020 earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for the sector.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. raised the stakes in its battle with Huawei Technologies Co., using a law historically associated with prosecuting mafia figures to claim the Chinese company engaged in decades of intellectual property theft.Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou had already faced criminal charges. The fresh allegations, announced Thursday, up the ante by including racketeering conspiracy, increasing the potential punishment. They come as the global battle for supremacy in fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, is joined.Huawei broke the law “to drastically cut its research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage,” the Justice Department said in a statement. The company even launched a bonus program to reward employees who got their hands on confidential information from competitors, prosecutors said.The new charges depict a company that won international standing by stealing trade secrets, evading U.S sanctions and lying to authorities. They are likely to increase tensions between Beijing and Washington, which has accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, even as Huawei won a brief reprieve from a proposed ban on buying parts.The indictment doesn’t name the businesses from which Huawei allegedly stole intellectual property, but details of the allegations match descriptions of companies including Cisco Systems Inc., Motorola Inc. and Cnex Labs Inc.“The indictment paints a damning portrait of an illegitimate organization that lacks any regard for the law,” Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s Democratic vice-chairman, said in an emailed statement. “Intellectual property theft, corporate sabotage and market manipulation are part of Huawei’s core ethos and reflected in every aspect of how it conducts business.”Huawei doesn’t “abide by Western business practices,” Rob Spalding, a Washington-based technology and security expert at the Hudson Institute who served on the National Security Council, said in an email. “Which is why many U.S. companies are no longer competitive in the global marketplace.”Read More: Why 5G Mobile Arrives With a Subplot of EspionageHuawei, in turn, has accused the U.S. of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the U.S to “stop unreasonably targeting Huawei and other Chinese enterprises.”The new indictment “is part of the Justice Department’s attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei’s reputation and its business for reasons related to competition rather than law enforcement,” a representative of the company said Thursday. “These new charges are without merit and are based largely on recycled civil disputes” from the last 20 years “that have been previously settled, litigated and, in some cases, rejected by federal judges and juries.”Huawei was previously accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Meng, the CFO, was charged with fraud last year, with the case rippling into Canada, where she is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. Meng’s lawyers have argued in court that their client did nothing wrong.The U.S. said Huawei stole trade secrets, including copyrighted works, source code and user manuals for internet routers, to “grow and operate” its business. The company swiped antenna and robot testing technology, prosecutors said.Then, they said, it doubled down.“When confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, the defendants allegedly made repeated misstatements to U.S. officials, including FBI agents and representatives from the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, regarding their efforts to misappropriate trade secrets,” they said.Read More: U.S. Ramps Up Huawei Fight With Iran, Trade-Secret ChargesThe U.S. dates the thefts to 2002. But the government has also linked the 2016 alleged theft of a computer chip from a California tech company for Huawei with the latest charges.Bo Mao, a Xiamen University professor, was charged in September with stealing trade secrets. His lawyers said in a court filing Thursday that the prosecution is related to the Huawei case.In the new indictment, the government is wielding some prior allegations of wrongdoing, like Huawei’s alleged theft of a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile US Inc., to build a more muscular case. The U.S. alleged that a Huawei engineer secretly took photos of T-Mobile’s robot, Tappy, took measurements of parts and even stole a piece of it. When T-Mobile threatened to sue, the U.S. said, Huawei blamed “rogue actors” within the company.Intellectual property theft “explains a lot of Huawei’s success,” said Jim Lewis, of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Huawei is the poster child for China’s commercial spying.”The case is U.S. v.

2020-02-19,"The markets keep on storming higher, as U.S. equities again notched new record highs on Wednesday. Let's take a look at a few of our top stock trades going into Thursday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe parabolic rise in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) came to a temporary halt over the past few weeks, but the bulls are again bidding it higher -- or the shorts are as they cover. Either way, it doesn't matter who the buyer is, just that the stock is still ripping higher.Shares rallied more than 7% on Tuesday to break out over resistance. Up another 7% on Wednesday, and Tesla stock is approaching its prior 52-week high of $968.99. Over that mark, and a squeeze up to $1,000 per share could certainly be on the table.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn a dip, I want to see the $800 to $825 area hold as support. That will keep TSLA above the 10-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Ultimately though, now that the 20-day moving average has caught up to the stock price a bit, maintaining over this level remains bullish.Below, and the trade may finally start to unwind a bit. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: iQiyi (IQ)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comiQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) has been on the rise, possibly from the &quot;iQiyi and chill&quot; catalyst. Even before the coronavirus began its rapid spread, though, IQ stock was trading better.After bursting through short-term resistance near $25, IQ stock stopped just short of $28 resistance. Now pulling back to $25 and the 20-day moving average, aggressive bulls can take a chance on the stock near current levels.However, a close below the 20-day moving average may force longs to stop out, as the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) could be in play in that scenario.Should $25 hold as support, however, the recent high near $27.50 is the first upside target. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Cisco Systems (CSCO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) does not have momentum right now. While the rest of the market has been making new high after new high, CSCO stock has been struggling since July.In August, the 200-day moving average gave way as support. A few days ago, it was resistance. Both tests are shown via blue circles on the available chart.After apparently disappointing earnings, CSCO shares are below all of its major moving averages -- as well as short-term uptrend support (blue line). Now in the $45 to $46 zone, bulls are looking for support to help buoy the stock.If it does, look for CSCO to reclaim the 50-day moving average. If it can't, or if support doesn't come into play soon, the December lows near $43 may be in play. Overall, I don't like Cisco much at this moment, as it has no momentum or trend and support is dicey.Back above the 50-day shows some life, though, and could put the 200-day moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Alteryx (AYX)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comLast week, Alteryx (NASDAQ:AYX) smashed earnings and revenue expectations and provided better-than-expected guidance. Short of Friday's post-earnings rally, though, AYX is having trouble rallying.That's as the valuation is high and after a robust rally in the first place. Consider that AYX ended 2019 right around $100 per share and tagged $160 on Monday. That's a huge move, even if the earnings were great.So, what do investors do?From a technical standpoint, Alteryx looks incredibly healthy; Maybe even a bit too healthy. But remember, this name just made new highs, unlike the rest of the market which has been doing so for months now.If AYX can consolidate above $145, it could gain steam and push even higher. I would love to buy a dip down to the $145 breakout level and/or the 20-day moving average. Below this measure, though, and $125 to $130 could be on the table.No one said AYX isn't a wild mover. But when Alteryx has the wind at its back, it's a difficult trend to fight.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AYX.

2020-02-21,"When investors buy stocks for the long haul, the holding period is ideally forever. But that is not always possible. Valuations may reach unfavorable levels or fundamentals may worsen. When that happens, investors need to re-evaluate the company's long-term prospects. One of the quickest negative catalysts that will accelerate a blue chip's safe-haven status is if it gets in the news. That is, news reports that tarnished the company's branding just might hurt the future returns.Sometimes headlines try to hurt a company's branding but are really just noise that investors should ignore. Deeper research into the latest headlines concerning the stock is necessary before acting irrationally and selling. But the biggest &quot;tell&quot; that a company is broken enough that it is time to sell is looking at fundamentals. If revenue is slowing and profits are shrinking, an investment portfolio's performance will suffer. When that happens, it is time for investors to ditch that holding.Macroeconomic risks are higher than ever. Devrim Yaman, a finance professor and associate dean at Western Michigan University's Hawthorn College of Business, said in an email to InvestorPlace that &quot;in 2020, we expect markets to be particularly volatile. This is partly due to the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in November as well as the primaries before that. The U.S.-China trade war and the economic impact of the coronavirus will likely exacerbate the volatility.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurther, Yaman pointed out the performance disparity between low and high volatility stocks will widen. She said &quot;I expect investors to gravitate towards the high volatility factor in 2020 in order to profit from these fluctuations. This is in contrast to the historical long-term data which shows that overall low volatility stocks earn higher returns than high volatility stocks.&quot;  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Increasing Their Dividends in 2020 The combination of macro risks and tarnished brands suggests that investors might want to drop seven of the following stocks. Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Martina Badini / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is in the news after U.S. regulators are fining eight former executives over the account scandal. Four years ago, the bank pressured employees to meet difficult sales targets. This resulted in employees opening millions of fake accounts to meet those targets. In the last six months, the stock climbed from a bottom of $43.34 and topped $54.75. And in hindsight, Wells Fargo stock peaked at the end of 2019 ahead of its quarterly earnings report.The fourth-quarter report had two weak results that suggest investors should ditch the stock. Non-interest income grew by 4% but was offset by a 6% decline in net interest income. The bank blamed low interest rates, which suggests that a further Federal Reserve rate cut will continue pressuring this bank's results.Wells Fargo also posted higher litigation accruals, to the tune of $1.5 billion. Bulls may argue that the balance sheet cleanup with the write-down sets a bottom from here. The new CEO is at the beginning phases of orchestrating a turnaround. At a price-to-earnings ratio below 12 times and a dividend that yields over 4%, value investors may speculate by buying WFC stock here.In a price-to-earnings model, Wells Fargo stock is worth approximately $46 (per finbox.io):Metrics Range Conclusion Selected LTM P/E Multiple 8.x-10x 9x Selected Forward P/E Multiple 11.1x-13.5x 12.3x Fair Value $41-$50.64 $45.82 Table courtesy of finbox.ioFor anyone who has held the stock for a long time, selling shares would help avoid further losses. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported Q2 results that sent the stock falling from $50 to around $47 last week. Non-GAAP earnings per share of  77 cents beat expectations. Yet revenue fell by 4% year-over-year to $12 billion. Despite the mixed results, management declared a 3% hike in the dividend, giving Cisco stock a yield of around 3%. Why sell Cisco when dividends are increasing?Unfortunately, the 3% dividend hike is small and reflects the weak cash flow. Rumors that it will buy FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) are equally troubling. Buying the underperforming business will cost at least $3.7 billion. If the business is slowing -- even though it benefits from secular growth trends from 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 400G -investors should look elsewhere. The ongoing shift to the cloud is not accelerating Cisco's revenue growth. Conversely, investors could buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock instead.  * 7 Failing Tech Stocks to Disconnect From Now Cisco's infrastructure platform and application segments posted falling sales year-over-year. Also, the services revenue growth of 5% is good but slow. At current prices, investors have better options elsewhere.  Pfizer (PFE)Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) posted yet another quarterly earnings report that missed expectations. So unless the company achieves revenue growth of at least 5% annually over the next five years, shareholders should sell. The stock pays a dividend that yields 4.2%, but anyone who demands upside appreciation has many other drug stocks to consider instead.Sales of Ibrance, which treats metastatic breast cancer, rose 23% and is potentially a $5-billion-a-year product. But this year is a make-or-break year for the drug. CEO Albert Bourla said that &quot;We continue to expect our two event-driven Ibrance early breast cancer programs, Penelope B, and powers to read out in late 2020 and early 2021 respectively. If successful, and following regulatory approval, these programs could double the number of patients eligible to benefit from Ibrance.&quot;Any negative data read for Ibrance may send Pfizer stock lower in 2020.Pfizer's sale of its Upjohn unit will bring in $12 billion in cash proceeds, which strengthens its balance sheet. Looking at the full year 2020, the company forecasts revenue of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion. This weak outlook is due to the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica -- a pain medication -- in the U.S. CFO Frank D'Amelio said &quot;the midpoints of these ranges imply … higher adjusted R&D expenses and higher adjusted other income, which reflects earnings from the consumer healthcare joint venture.&quot; Walgreens (WBA)Source: saaton / Shutterstock.com The market fooled investors into buying Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stock in November 2019. A leveraged buyout by KKR (NYSE:KKR) would value the company at $85 billion. The deal is unlikely because it would require taking on too much debt. And so, Walgreens stock fell from $62, instead of heading toward the $71 take-out price.Walgreens acquired 1,932 stores from Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), solidifying its play as a retail pharmacy. But CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) proved that vertical integration with a healthcare plan provider is a better approach. Walgreens posted revenue of $34.3 billion, up 1.6% over last year. In effect, the proposed buyout was the only positive catalyst lifting the stock.CVS Health posted a different story. The company reported revenue growing 22.9% to $66.9 billion. Adjusted operating income rose 1.3% to $3.8 billion. It looks like holding CVS stock and selling Walgreens stock would make the most sense for 2020. Besides, Walgreens is busy with a transformational cost management program instead of growing revenue. This will bring more than $1.8 billion in annual cost savings by 2022. It also led to a free cash flow generation of $674 million in the first quarter. While this program is on track, CVS offer investors better revenue growth now.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks With Over 50% Upside Potential Walgreens is still struggling with &quot;noise in the second quarter.&quot; This suggests that the 13% headwind in earnings per share from the program will hurt WBA stock for now. 3M Company (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is trading at levels not seen since 2017. Even after the stock fell from a yearly high of $219 to the $160 level, the stock still trades at a premium valuation. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is around 4.5 times.Investors could buy Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and pay a PEG of 2.8 times. So, it does not make much sense to continue holding 3M stock. In the fourth quarter, 3M took a restructuring charge that shaved 20 cents from its EPS. Management said that the $134 million charge &quot;includes streamlining our organization by reducing approximately 1,500 positions spanning all business groups, functions and geographies.&quot;Cutting staff and reorganizing the units is the same as shuffling the deck. The lower headcount will save on costs but fails to grow the company. In fact, U.S. organic growth fell 3% in Q4. Transportation, electronics, safety and industrial businesses all performed poorly. Revenue from the electronics unit dragged Asia-Pacific revenue, which also fell 3%. Business dropped by 7% in Japan.Cautious investors may model revenue growing at no more than 2% annually in a 10-year discounted cash flow (DCF) model: revenue exit. Under the following assumptions, MMM stock is worth under $140 a share.Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 8%-9% 8.5% Terminal Revenue Multiple 2.8x-3.8x 3.3x Fair Value $117.66-$161.85 $138.89 Upside -26.9%-0.5% -13.7% Table courtesy of finbox.io  Dell Technologies (DELL)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Once a publicly traded company, then privately traded, and public again, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is an inexpensive stock. It trades at a trailing P/E of 10.4 times and a forward P/E below 8. This just shows that investors should avoid the stock for a reason. The company bought EMC but did not have any synergies with it. It struggled to grow EqualLogic, a storage company. Conversely, shares of Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are sharply higher over the last few years.Insider selling of DELL stock is another bearish signal. On the flip side, investors seeking an undervalued stock may look at HP (NYSE:HPQ) instead. If Xerox (NYSE:XRX) succeeds in buying it, HPQ stock will reward its investors.Dell's outlook is hardly encouraging, either. The company forecast fiscal 2020 sales of $91.8 billion to $92.5 billion. This is below the $93.5 billion consensus estimate. And in Q3, the net revenue grew by just 2% to $22.8 billion. So, as it spends its fiscal 2020 paying down the debt of around $5 billion, it still has $44.7 billion left.Dell stock has a good value score:DELL Industry S&P 500 Value Score 86 57 74 Price-to-Earnings 10 17.8 25.5 Price-to-Sales 0.4 0.7 2.4 Data courtesy of Stock Rover.comThe quality score suggests otherwise. Notice the low operating margin:DELL Industry S&P 500 Quality Score 48 52 80 Gross Margin 30.8% 27.8% 29% Operating Margin 2.4% 4.4% 13.4% Net Margin 4.2% 4.1% 9.6% Data courtesy of Stock Rover.com Arista Networks (ANET)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) posted Q4 revenue falling 7.3% over last year to $552.5 million. Earnings per share came in at $3.25. At a forward P/E close to 22 times, investors may not want to hold this market-valued stock when the IT sector is slowing down. So with both Cisco and Arista reporting a slowdown in the business, the risk of further downside is high.Arista posted revenue of $552.5 million and $2.4 billion for the year. Its 5-year total addressable market is $30 billion by 2024. Unfortunately, markets price stocks for the near term. If businesses are not increasing their orders for the company's campus Ethernet switch, the stock may correct further. The data center Ethernet switch business is supposed to offset the slowdown in switches. But data center revenue growth will not pick up until 2022.The company cut operating expenses and spent less on research and development. Headcount increased in sales and marketing, offset by a drop in other sales costs. By right-sizing the business, Arista may weather the storm. It might grow its cash from operations, too. In Q4, it generated $327 million of cash from operations. This allowed it to authorize a three-year $1 billion share buyback.Most analysts rate the stock a &quot;hold,&quot; according to TipRanks. With little upside and a fair value between $197-$232, consider selling the stock.Chris Lau is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the trendiest ideas in finance is something called “social impact investing,” which is the idea that people should put more money into socially beneficial companies and products, and less into socially harmful ones. That hardly sounds objectionable, but I am skeptical about how much good social impact investing can do.The first risk is that social impact investing will be used to “whitewash” various harmful policies. By divesting from a particular set of companies, an investment fund loses at most a very small benefit from an additional degree of broader market diversification. The fund still is likely to earn the market rate of return on its other investments, and in the meantime it can claim virtuousness. At the same time, the funds can pursue socially harmful policies elsewhere: investing in companies that lobby for tariff protection, say, or emit less visible forms of pollution, or how about refined sugar?A second risk is that social impact investing simply redistributes wealth from investments — maybe to less socially conscientious individuals. Imagine a socially conscious investment firm that declines to participate in the initial public offering of a company that pollutes the ocean. That might create downward pressure on the price of the IPO. But there is a problem: The value of the actual investment has not declined, so at a potentially lower IPO price other investors will step in to fill the demand. In fact, those investors may have the chance to buy at a discount and earn a higher return than otherwise.The net result is that conscientious investors have missed out on a profitable opportunity, while less socially aware investors have earned more. Over time, the less socially aware investors will become richer, and their greater wealth may translate into greater political and economic influence.Maybe this effect isn’t large, but it is negative, and it will become correspondingly larger to the extent social impact investing becomes more popular (in 2018, the money pouring into sustainable investment funds quadrupled, rising to about $21 billion). That doesn’t sound like an appealing trade-off.But put that worry aside and assume that social impact investing simply makes it easier to get a solar power company off the ground with an IPO or an expansion. It’s still not clear that much has been gained. At that late point in the process, the company will succeed or it won’t, no matter what the socially conscious funds do.If anything, it would be more useful to have socially conscious research and development at the very early stages of projects. To some extent there are such investments, and I am more sanguine about being conscientious then than when companies already exist and funds are making investment decisions.It is also difficult to monitor the performance and social efficacy of the funds focused on doing good. In actively managed sustainable equity funds, for example, the most commonly held stocks are estimated to be Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, Apple and Cisco. I have nothing against those companies, but you have to wonder exactly how much social improvement those investment funds are buying.Norway’s fossil fuel divestment is well-publicized. Less well known is that it exempted Shell and Exxon. There simply aren’t clear benchmarks for which investments to avoid, and of course some critics will portray technology companies as the embodiment of evil.Too many of the empirical arguments for social impact investing stem from a single example: South Africa under apartheid. In that case, a coordinated campaign of divestment and international economic and social pressure did hasten the end of apartheid, all for the better. But most sanctions are not very effective at achieving their stated political goals, or their effectiveness may be unclear. South Africa may have been a special case because it was relatively small and isolated, and because so many South Africans had ceased to believe in apartheid.Investment in socially beneficial activities can be worthwhile. But it ignores the question of who decides what is “beneficial,” and it is yet another example of how politics and media are becomingly increasingly performative. Everything is about looking good instead of substance. It is increasingly difficult for businesses and investment funds to perform their proper work under the glare of perpetual debate and periodic condemnation.The notion of extending that same glare to economic investments makes is hardly reassuring. I’ve yet to see a conception of social impact investing that I find convincing.To contact the author of this story: Tyler Cowen at tcowen2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The prospect is tantalizing: the Boeing Co. versus Airbus SE battle, but for the 5G era.Nokia Oyj, the Finnish telecommunications equipment firm, is contemplating asset sales and merger options, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. That raises the prospect of joining forces with Swedish rival Ericsson AB, thereby creating a European behemoth to compete more effectively with China’s Huawei Technologies Co.A tie-up would echo Europe’s cobbling together of Airbus in the 1960s and 1970s as a rival to U.S. aircraft-making giants like Boeing, setting up a fiercely contested duopoly that has dominated global aviation ever since. Unfortunately, it would also be a strategic misstep. Asset sales are the far more sensible option.Merging the two Nordic companies would most likely create as many problems as it would solve. Nokia has endured a tumultuous 12 months — the shares fell 25% in October after cutting its outlook — in part because of the failure to effectively integrate its last major acquisition, the $18 billion takeover of Alcatel-Lucent SA.Combining with Ericsson would make it easier to compete on price with Huawei, which benefits from the economies of scale afforded by the massive Chinese market, but it could also require several years just to secure regulatory approval, let alone integrate the operations. That would be a boon to Huawei, which could capitalize on the period of uncertainty to secure new customers.Crucially, Finland, which is one of Nokia’s five-biggest shareholders through its Solidium Oy investment vehicle, would surely stand in the way of any merger that would eliminate a lot of jobs.An acquisition by Cisco Systems Inc. would satisfy President Donald Trump’s exhortations for the U.S. to build a giant in fifth-generation wireless technology, pairing the San Jose, California-based company’s core network savvy with Nokia’s expertise in wireless communications. But it would be foolish of Cisco to tap its sizable cash pile for a deal that would dilute its margins; it enjoyed net profit representing 24% of sales last year, compared with Nokia’s 2.1%.QuicktakeHow Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech TussleNokia’s substandard 5G offering means Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri has been unable to profit on the tribulations of Huawei, and its shares have lost a third of their value over the past year. That downturn in fortunes makes it vulnerable to an approach from an activist investor scrutinizing businesses that are undervalued as part of the whole.Nokia can get ahead of that threat by putting some assets on the chopping block. Its intellectual property arm would seem the prime candidate: the division still generates healthy profits — it has a 98% gross profit margin on sales of 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) — but the value of the portfolio is deteriorating steadily. Nokia could sell much of it for a lucrative sum — those parts pertaining to its old handset business, for example — while retaining the most recent patents developed for 5G. The fixed-access business, which has endured the steepest sales drop-off, might also be a candidate, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst John Butler.The review of options may yet come to nothing, as my Bloomberg News colleagues reported. But the last thing Suri needs is the unhelpful distraction of an activist calling for changes as he plays catch-up in 5G. It would be far better to be proactive himself.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-02-27,Investing.com - Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Stock fell by 4.05% to trade at $40.46 by 15:51 (20:51 GMT) on Thursday on the NASDAQ exchange.,Cisco Stock Falls 4%
2020-02-27,"(Bloomberg) -- This has been the decade of the data center, which can be measured in a ten-fold increase in traffic and a 25-fold jump in worldwide storage. The surge was thought to come with a steep cost for the climate, since all those racks of servers run hot enough to require special cooling systems and vast amounts of energy. But data centers are rapidly becoming more energy efficient, and new research suggests there’s no longer a close link between more cloud computing and more energy use. A report published Thursday in Science credits the progress to better management, more efficient hardware and the rise of “hyperscale” data centers created by tech giants.Back in 2010, according to the report, data centers globally used about 194 terawatt-hours of electricity—about as much power as Iran used that year. By 2018 that figure had increased to 205 TWh. That’s a 6% rise in power use, in a period that saw data-center computing grow by 550%.The data-center industry’s 20% annual improvement in energy intensity dwarfs all other major parts of the economy. The power used today by data centers, 1% of the global total, is roughly the same as it was in 2010.This was an unexpected result. Analysts have extrapolated the incredible rise in cloud computing on to data-center electricity consumption “leading to unreliable predictions of current and future global data center energy use,” according to the report in Science. Instead of collecting and analyzing power-use data, some researchers had been taking the growth factor seen in data-center internet traffic and assuming energy use was growing just as quickly. This new research is the first major attempt to compile a bottom-up view of data-center energy use in a decade. Researchers based their work on reports published by Cisco Systems, Inc., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the International Energy Agency, among other sources.“We don’t have nationally reported statistics for data centers,” said Eric Masanet, lead author and a mechanical engineering professor at Northwestern University. That created a lot of work for him and his colleagues. “We don’t see these estimates come out very often.”In a blog post Thursday, Google celebrated the findings and touted the company’s own efforts at buying renewable power and cutting energy use. Urs Hölzle, senior vice president for technical infrastructure, wrote that Google can now harness about seven times as much computing power from the same amount of energy as it could five years ago. (Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., were not involved in the research by Masanet’s team or its funding.)Can the trend continue? The rise of hyperscale data centers and potential for better efficiency in storage means that computing and power use may continue to diverge, at least through the next doubling of data-center workloads, which is estimated to take 3 to 4 years. Masanet and his co-authors recommend policy changes to support continued efficiency gains. Government efforts such as the Energy Star program in the U.S. can include servers and networking equipment. Renewable energy can play an even bigger role in data centers through tax credits and procurement standards. Finally, there can be better data about data centers. “Data centers are becoming way too important to not rally more research behind them,” Masanet said.To contact the author of this story: Eric Roston in New York at eroston@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Aaron Rutkoff at arutkoff@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Climate Fears About Cloud Computing Have Been Vastly Overstated

2020-02-28,"Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) hit a 52-week low of $42.07 on Feb. 25. Cisco stock hasn't been this low since December 2018. It doesn't help that the S&P 500 was experiencing its second consecutive day of 3%-plus losses. As I write this, CSCO is down 27% from its 52-week high of $58.26, which it hit last July.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Is it time to buy Cisco stock on this extended dip?The last time I wrote about Cisco in December, I discussed the company's &quot;Internet of the Future&quot; strategy. At the time, I thought it could be the spark that got its share price trending higher. And it was until this latest correction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI concluded by saying that the introduction of the Silicon One chip series was a step in the right direction for a company to search for organic growth. Two months later, I'll lean on some of my InvestorPlace colleagues for further insight into Cisco.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip By the end of this article, we'll know whether it's worth buying Cisco in the low $40s. Earnings Were a Mixed BagCisco reported second-quarter results on Feb. 12 that included beating the consensus estimate by a penny at 77 cents and exceeding analysts' revenue estimate by $30 million at $12.01 billion.Year over year, its adjusted earnings per share rose 5.5% while its revenues were 3.5% lower than a year earlier. It is that last number that moved investors off Cisco stock. It's also possible the company's Q3 2020 earnings estimate of 79 cents to 81 cents wasn't nearly enough for investors, although it does provide a nice sandwich for the analyst estimate of 80 cents.Although it's tiresome for shareholders to sit by as revenues continue to move sideways despite the promises for 5G growth in the future, the company's margins remain strong. In the second quarter, it had a non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7%, 220 basis points higher than a year earlier. In terms of its operating margin, it was 33.7% on a non-GAAP basis, 180 basis points higher than a year earlier. The Future for CiscoSo, despite the fact it faces short-term revenue declines, it's still able to maintain higher prices on its hardware. Also, the move from hardware to software is reaping the rewards for the company on the margin front as it transitions to its long-term business strategy focusing on the internet.As CEO Chuck Robbins stated in the quarterly conference call, 72% of Cisco's software sales during the second quarter were sold on a subscription basis.&quot;While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The long term secular growth trends of 5G, WiFi 6, 400-gig and the shift to the cloud remain and we expect to benefit from them,&quot; Robbins said.&quot;Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long term.&quot;Robbins, who has been Cisco's CEO since July 2015 and with the company since 1997, is taking it in a new direction. He believes the results will come, but they will take time. Attractive Valuation for Cisco StockInvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto recently discussed Cisco concerning its valuation and the so-called earnings disappointment that was Q2 2020.&quot;The longer-term narrative for Cisco stock is this: the obstacles are temporary, but the opportunities are not,&quot; Enomoto wrote on Feb. 20.&quot;For instance, the 5G rollout is a crucial spark for CSCO because it specializes in backhaul and core services for mobile carriers. According to Cisco general manager Jonathan Davidson, the existing backhaul network in the U.S. is operating at a 'really low capacity.'&quot;Josh goes on to say that the company's free cash flow generation remains healthy. In the trailing 12 months ended Jan. 25, 2020, Cisco has free cash flow of $14.8 billion, up from $12.9 billion just two years earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $170.2 billion, it's got an FCF yield of 8.7%. Value investors generally consider FCF yields of 8% or higher.With long-term debt of $14.5 billion, or just 8% of its market capitalization of $181.3 billion, combined with a 3.4% dividend, there aren't many tech stocks out there that provide this much protection against the downside while paying you to wait for renewed growth.As my colleague so ably states, &quot;the price of Cisco stock today represents a discount against future bullishness.&quot;Until now, I've sat on the sidelines. Trading near a 52-week low, I believe now is an excellent time to buy Cisco stock. Should it fall into the $30s, I'd buy some more.In the meantime, enjoy the healthy dividend rent check it pays.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-02-28,"It's been a confusing month for software firm Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK). The communication platform saw its share price rise exponentially on news that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was planning to use Slack. But shares later gave up some of those gains when investors realized that the tech mogul had already been using the platform.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Slack stock popped once again on news that Uber (NYSE:UBER) was rolling out the platform among its employees, but shares are still well below the $37.22 they were fetching near their Wall Street debut.So is the company a buy at $26 per share? Here's a look at the case for and against Slack stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Making Connections, Growing MarginsThere's no doubt about the fact that Slack has been building its resume with several high-profile clients. IBM has been the biggest news as the tech firm is not only Slack's largest customer, but it proves that the platform can scale up to serve big-wigs like Big Blue. CEO Steward Butterfield said as much when IBM announced that the platform would be accessible to all 350,000 of its employees.   * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your 10-Year-Old &quot;Going wall to wall in IBM -- it's basically the maximum scale that there is, so we now know that Slack will work for literally the largest organizations in the world,&quot; Butterfield said.But IBM isn't the only big partnership on Slack's books lately. Ride-hailing Uber also contracted the firm to connect its 38,000 employees. The Uber deal is a big one for Slack, especially considering Uber said it didn't believe the platform would be able to meet its needs just a few years ago. Last December, Slack also inked a deal with SiriusXM (NYSE:SIRI) to help the firm connect its employees around the country. Big partnerships like these are important for a few reasons. The most obvious is revenue. Slack needs big contracts like these to make money. But these deals also legitimize the firm's business, giving the firm much-needed clout that will help it compete.Another reason to like Slack is the fact that the firm's software-as-a-service business is high margin. Slack's streamlined business operates efficiently, allowing the firm to deliver impressive gross margin figures that come in ahead of its competitors. Slack's gross profit margin came in at 86.3%, significantly higher than Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 67.7% or Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) 63.9%. Tough CompetitionHowever, it's not all roses when it comes to Slack stock. Competition is one of the biggest reasons investors might want to consider staying on the sidelines -- namely competition from Microsoft. While Slack has certainly proven that it's capable of handling big-time accounts with its IBM partnership, the firm may not get the chance to do so very often.That's because Microsoft's Teams product is a direct competitor. That's problematic because it means Slack generally appeals only to organizations that aren't using Microsoft's suite of services, making its potential customers pool much smaller.Plus, competing against a massive tech firm like Microsoft is tricky. Microsoft has more funding and already has a good reputation among its many clients. Limited GrowthThe other issue that Slack is facing is a limited growth runway. As it stands, Slack only offers one product. Granted, its proven that its communications network is powerful and scalable, but that does limit growth prospects. Unless the firm is able to develop a suite of services that it could use to get more out of existing customers, it's long-term growth story is stunted.With that said, there are some who believe Slack will eventually get acquired by a larger tech firm, hoping to add Slack's platform to its own portfolio. Buying a stock on takeover speculation isn't a great strategy, but it's worth noting.  The Bottom Line on Slack StockSlack stock has gotten caught up in the market's selloff this week, losing more than 5% on Tuesday alone. This makes for a good entry point for those who believe in Slack's future. At just under $27 per share, I'd say Slack's potential has already been priced in.However with the stock making its way to $25, it's starting to look far more attractive.

2020-03-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When you’ve been in this business as long as I have — four decades and counting — there are inevitably a few articles that you look back on with a grimace. For me, the cover story I wrote for Fortune magazine in October 1999 ranks right up there.If Netscape’s public offering in August 1995 marked the beginning of the dot-com bubble, that October four years later marked the beginning of the end. In just three and a half years, the Nasdaq index had climbed nearly 200%. Stocks like Cisco, Dell, Juniper Networks, Yahoo and so many more rose into the stratosphere. (Cisco, for instance, gained 125,000% in the 1990s.) At the time, I lived in a hip college town in Massachusetts steeped in left-wing politics, yet my lefty neighbors were suddenly all talking about how much money they were making in the stock market.So I decided to write a piece about how middle-class Americans had become obsessed with the market and how it was transforming investing. “Trader Nation,” the cover headline screamed. “At work, at home, all day, all night: Everybody wants a piece of this stock market.” My thesis was that individual investors were creating (to borrow from that cover language again) “a new set of rules.”Oops.Five months later the bubble burst. Those middle-class Americans, it turned out, hadn’t transformed investing after all; they had been caught up in a bubble and had lost a lot of money. No doubt there were those who saw it coming, but I wasn’t one of them. Neither were the millions of others. In theory, investors understood that dot-com prices were out of whack and that it had to end someday. Nonetheless, when it actually happened, people were caught by surprise.It’s the same with the emergence of the coronavirus. As we begin this new week of market uncertainty, it’s worth remembering that when market conditions change, you rarely see it coming. This is partly because when we’re in a particular economic environment, especially one that has lasted a long time, we tend to forget that there was ever a time when it was different.But it’s also because, more often than not, the thing that changes everything usually comes out of the blue — it’s a long tail event, or a black swan or whatever you want to call it — a risk so unlikely that it is beyond the realm of normal expectations. The coronavirus is a classic of the genre.For nearly a decade, market indexes had been on an upward trajectory with only an occasional break. Then between Feb. 19 and Friday, the market dropped about 13 percent, putting it firmly in correction territory. Another week like last week and a bear market will be upon us. (Stocks did rebound on Monday.)Did anyone see this coming? No. Even last December, when it first emerged that the Chinese city of Wuhan was suffering from an outbreak of the illness — and that the Chinese government had quarantined the city — it still didn’t seem possible that it could end a 10-year bull market. Again, we all knew it had to end someday — but nobody anticipated a pandemic might be the culprit.In books like “Fooled by Randomness” and “The Black Swan,” Nassim Nicholas Taleb has made a nice living pointing out that Wall Street’s risk-management tools aren’t adept at anticipating black swans — not just pandemics, but tsunamis, nuclear accidents, assassinations and other rare catastrophes. The greatest risks, he believes, aren’t the ones you can see and measure but the ones you can’t see and therefore can’t measure.But I think another factor is at play, which is the complacency that comes from living in a period that makes you forget that times were not always like this one. In the 1970s, the stock market was so dormant that BusinessWeek famously proclaimed “the death of equities” on its August 13, 1979, cover. The article noted that there were 7 million fewer shareholders than in 1970 and that chronic inflation “was destroying the stock market.” The authors wrote: “To bring equities back to life now, secular inflation would have to be wrung out of the economy.”What BusinessWeek — and most of us — could barely comprehend was that inflation would ever be tamed. But Paul Volcker, who was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve about the same time that article was published, did it. It took him a while, and he had to inflict a lot of economic pain on the country, but by August 1982 his actions led to a powerful 18-year bull market.Or consider the subprime housing bubble. Mortgage underwriting standards fell away; Wall Street became addicted to buying and bundling subprime loans; homeowners abandoned safe and sound prime mortgages for subprime loans they couldn’t afford; ratings companies gave triple-A ratings to subprime mortgage bonds that were doomed to fail. All of these actions were predicated on the idea that housing prices could only go up — because, after all, that’s what they had always done. No one could imagine housing prices falling. And once they did, people on both Main Street and Wall Street were caught so unaware they had no time to prepare for the painful losses that would cost millions their homes, not to mention the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.When Donald Trump was elected president, I was among those who thought his sheer economic ignorance would cause the market to crater. His use of tariffs as his weapon of choice would raise costs for U.S. businesses and consumers, which would be reflected in lower consumer spending and reduced profits. His disruption of cross-border supply chains would damage the economy. His eagerness to rid the country of immigrants would hurt agriculture, small manufacturing and other industries that relied on immigrant labor.I was hardly the only one who thought this. The day after the 2016 election, Paul Krugman wrote: “So we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.” But the Trump administration slashed corporate taxes while the Fed did its part to keep the market rising, and the Obama stock market morphed into the Trump stock market without a hitch.It could be the thing we least expected that ends this bull market.

2020-03-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. projected sales that will beat analysts’ estimates, but reflected slowing revenue growth. Shares fell in extended trading, underscoring Wall Street’s high expectations for the videoconferencing company whose stock has more than tripled since going public.Revenue will be $199 million to $201 million in the quarter ending in April, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $185.4 million. If Zoom hit the top end of that sales projection for the fiscal first quarter, it would represent year-over-year growth of 65%, compared with 78% in the January quarter and 85% in the previous one.Zoom’s stock, which has hovered near a record high recently, has surged since the company’s initial public offering in April, reflecting robust growth rates and disciplined finances. Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has sought to outrun competition from Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., which have continued to invest in their conferencing software amid Zoom’s rise.“People were hoping for a revenue acceleration,” Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in an interview. Recent announcements that companies were asking their employees to work from home further inflated investor expectations, he said.The spread of coronavirus, officially known as Covid-19, has especially increased remote working in Asia. Wall Street was hoping that would raise demand for videoconferencing technology to connect teams through virtual meetings. U.S. companies including Microsoft and Twitter Inc. have encouraged their employees to work from home as a precaution against the spread of the virus.Shares fell about 5% after closing at $116.80 in New York. The company had a market value of more than $32 billion at Wednesday’s close.This isn’t the first time investors have punished Zoom despite beating expectations. In December, Zoom’s stock fell 10% the day after reporting surging revenue.Zoom projected that profit, excluding some items, will be 10 cents a share in the current period, compared with analysts’ estimate of 6 cents.Sales were $188.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31. Analysts’ projected $175.8 million.Revenue will be $905 million to $915 million in fiscal 2021, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $867 million.

2020-03-12,"Stocks have been getting pounded for the past month. And with huge volatility every day, it's hard to trust any rebound at the moment. That said, some investors have been complaining that there are still relatively few bargains within the tech space. By and large, tech companies have held up even as other sectors like energy have imploded. However, the selloff has created some tech bargains. Take Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), for example. CSCO stock has plunged from $50 as recently as Feb. 12 to below $35 today.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Cisco stock has fallen 27% in a month; it's down a startling 41% from its 52-week high. Cisco has sold off for the reasons you'd probably expect. First, the trade war hit demand for its products throughout 2019. Now the coronavirus from China has cast further doubt on the spending plans of Cisco's major customers. Delays of projects, such as the rollout of 5G systems, are creating short-term obstacles for Cisco. But investors may be overreacting to the company's problems. Sluggish EarningsCisco released its fiscal second-quarter results on Feb. 12. It was not a particularly cheery report. The company's earnings per share and revenue did surpass its guidance, but that was largely because the company had set expectations so low. Its operating income only rose 1% year-over-year, while its revenue fell 3.5% YOY.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company doesn't expect its business to pick up in the near-term, either. It forecast another single-digit-percentage decline in revenue next quarter. That's not surprising, given that its key hardware division is continuing to struggle. The company's comments on its earnings conference call indicated that it is clearly struggling at the moment. After Cisco reported its results, the company announced that it would carry out layoffs to keep its costs in check during this lean period. Not All Bad NewsWhile Cisco's earnings didn't beat analysts' average estimates by a large amount, there was plenty to like under the surface. For one, its security business grew 9% in Q2 versus Q1. That's not surprising, as security is booming in general right now, and Cisco has invested heavily in the area. Security also has similarities to Cisco's areas of expertise, and success in security should help strengthen the company's competitive edge over the long-term. That said, there's a ton of firms looking to take share from Cisco in the security sector.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Perhaps most importantly, the revenue of Cisco's services division rose 5% YOY in Q2. Cisco has long been a hardware vendor, and it's traditionally focused on making big hardware deals. However, Cisco, like so many other tech companies, has realized that Wall Street really pays a premium for recurring revenues. As a result, Cisco has added more services to its portfolio, and it's taking payments for some products over longer periods of time.Obviously, given the company's share price at the moment, Wall Street isn't rewarding Cisco for its steady services growth right now. Sooner or later, however, as investors' sentiment improves, analysts will highlight Cisco's increasingly strong subscription services and software sales and argue that the company deserves a higher valuation. Valuation And DividendSpeaking of value, Cisco stock is downright cheap at this point. Analysts, on average, forecast that Cisco will earn roughly $3.25 per share over the next year. That would put Cisco's price-earnings ratio at just 12. A skeptic could argue that a P/E ratio of 12 is reasonable, since Cisco is a &quot;dead money&quot; company that hasn't gone anywhere for years.Then again, for much of the 2010s, investors labeled Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as dead money businesses as well, as both appeared to be stagnant companies living off aging cash cows. For much of the decade, both stocks traded for around 10-12 times their earnings. Then Microsoft pivoted to the cloud, while Intel started developing a ton of next-generation technology that went beyond its bread-and-butter CPU chips. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) similarly traded under 15 times its earnings for much of the past few years before suddenly exploding higher as Wall Street warmed up to its services story.There's no guarantee that Cisco will catch that sort of big wave going forward. The company will need to develop a narrative that gets investors excited if it wants its stock to start trading at 18 times or 20 times its earnings instead of its present P/E ratio of 12. That said, Cisco's effort to generate more recurring software and services revenues is a great start. This is the classic formula that tech companies use nowadays to get investors excited. While Cisco's hardware sales will always be volatile, the recurring revenues make its results less volatile and make the whole operation more valuable. Cisco's Strong DividendIn addition to being a cheap stock, Cisco also offers a robust dividend. Cisco's stock currently has a dividend yield of 3.6% per year, which means that it offers double the dividend yield of the S&P 500 index as a whole.On top of that, Cisco is known for its rapid dividend hikes. The company has increased its dividend eight years in a row. Over the past five years, it has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of more than 13% per year. Given the company's strong profitability, its  dividend payout ratio is just 44% despite its juicy dividend yield. Add it all up, and Cisco is a strong growth and income stock. The Verdict on CSCO StockCisco is not the most glamorous tech stock out there by any means. Many investors have labeled it &quot;dead money.&quot; But as the past few years have shown, tech companies with low P/E ratios and strong earnings can suddenly spring to life.Will Cisco enjoy a huge rally over the next year? A lot would need to go right for it for that to happen. It's still facing major challenges, including the virus, slow network rollouts, and its relatively weak recent earnings report. In general, though, these concerns should lift as we enter the back half of 2020. And at this price, it won't take much for Cisco stock to rally.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-03-12,"With Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock hammered by recent sell-offs, is now the time to buy? The telecom equipment also-ran has its work cut out for them. But while Huawei and Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) may be ahead in 5G contracts, catalysts remain in motion.Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com For one, the U.S. government has an interest in propping up Nokia. Preventing China-backed Huawei from dominating 5G remains a top concern. More far-fetched ideas, such as a U.S. takeover of Nokia, seem rather absurd. But having America in the company's corner remains a positive factor.But that's not all! With low expectations priced in, even partial success in 5G could help move the needle. A change in leadership could also improve odds of a turnaround. With shares trading at a discount to peers, upside potential may outweigh downside risks. Let's dive in, and see why Nokia stock could be a buy at today's prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Darkest Before The Dawn For NOK StockIn a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; world, it's tough to support the underdogs. Nokia is not the strongest name in its industry. But while this &quot;fallen angel&quot; likely won't reach past levels of success, investors could still see upside if the company exceeds low expectations.As InvestorPlace's Faisal Humayun discussed March 4, Nokia faces many challenges in 2020. Competition for 5G contracts hurts margins. So does increased 5G-related investments. Supply-chain headwinds from the coronavirus add even more pressure. Yet, the expectations of reduced operating margins are already priced into shares.It's always darkest before the dawn. Nokia's 5G investments could pay off. Even if they don't dominate the space, they could still build a decent book of business. And with a new CEO taking the helm, the company's prospects could be brighter. Current CEO Rajeev Suri's announced exit may be cause for concern. But given the company's poor performance, they have little to lose.Incoming CEO Pekka Lundmark has yet to discuss strategic changes. But a changing of the guard could move the needle. As a recent MarketWatch article discussed, the ingredients for success could already be in place. Nokia is behind in 5G contracts, but not by much. The company has 68 deals worldwide, compared to 81 for Ericsson and 91 for Huawei.The pressure is on Lundmark to execute the company's 5G strategy. But, with shares trading at &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; levels, even a half-successful effort could mean upside for Nokia stock. Despite Troubles, Undervalued Relative To PeersWhile prospects remain uncertain, you can't deny NOK stock is cheap. Shares trade for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.2. That's on par with Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) forward multiple of 12.3. But compare that to Ericsson, which trades for 14.5 times forward earnings.On an enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) basis, Nokia looks even cheaper. With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.2, the company's valuation is well below Cisco's EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.9. And far below Ericsson's EBITDA multiple of 14.Granted, Ericsson's stronger business justifies a higher multiple. But, if Nokia beats expectations with its 5G strategy, expect multiples to move higher. Maybe not back to above $5 per share. But a move back to the $4 t0 $4.50 per share price level is within reach. In other words, 20%-35% upside from the stock's closing price of $3.32 on March 10.The company's low valuation could also make it a takeover target. But don't use this is your rationale for buying NOK stock. A merger with Ericsson seems like a logical move. But it likely wouldn't get past antitrust concerns. The low-margin nature of Nokia's business also means names like Cisco or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aren't waiting in the wings, either.A sale of the company outright is a long-shot. Yet, asset sales remain an option. Besides freeing up capital, non-core asset sales would help further make Nokia a leaner operation. No Slam-Dunk, But Nokia Shares Could Be Worth The RiskBuying NOK stock today is no blue-chip investment. With Huawei and Ericsson outpacing the company in 5G deals, this floundering also-ran is a high-risk opportunity. But, this high-risk comes with high upside potential if things turn out better than expected.Last year's reduced guidance set the tone for disappointment. Yet, if Nokia can beat expectations, shares likely will move higher. While behind rivals, the company has a shot in building a decent book of 5G business.Don't expect shares to shoot up immediately. NOK stock could flounder in the current price range for some time. But, shares could move higher within the next year or two.

It's looking increasingly likely that the Tesla stock bubble will mark the peak of the 2010s bull market.Source: Christopher Lyzcen / Shutterstock.com In many ways, the Tesla's run was like that of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) during the dot com bubble.Much like Intel and Cisco, Tesla has a solid business with long-term growth potential. But Like Cisco and Intel, Tesla's valuation was beyond absurd.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you were one of the buyers that has gotten burned by Tesla or bitcoin or cannabis or any of the other market bubbles in the past few years, it's ok. Even Warren Buffett makes mistakes. But the important thing is that you learn from your mistakes.  * 10 of the Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy in a Bear Market Unfortunately, I have read some comments from TSLA stock owners blaming the coronavirus for the stock's downfall. They say Tesla was just &quot;unlucky,&quot; but there was a lot more than luck involved with the Tesla sell-off. If you chalk these losses up to pure bad luck, you will likely make the same mistakes in the future. Understanding Cyclical MarketsIf Tesla investors learn one thing from the crash in Tesla stock price it should be that financial markets are cyclical in nature. Unfortunately, anyone who started investing in the past 11 years has only ever experienced a bull market.In a bull market, investors are hungry for risk. They are hungry for growth. In the most recent bull market, they didn't care about profits. They didn't care about valuation. And with interest rates essentially at 0%, they certainly didn't care about debt.That atmosphere created the perfect storm for Tesla. Tesla logged impressive growth numbers at the cost of heavy losses. It turned to the debt markets to fund its expansion over and over and over again, even as recently as last month. The stock climbed higher and higher and higher, even when its valuation became ridiculous compared to both its auto industry peers and its big-tech peers.In a bear market, investors want safety. They want reliability, dependability and predictability. In an economic downturn, lending markets tend to tighten.The past 11 years have been the easiest time in U.S. history to grow a business. Companies like Tesla have gotten unlimited access to capital and a free pass from growth investors. But the last month is evidence that the market's mentality toward Tesla may have finally shifted. Tesla's ProblemsI get why it may seem like the COVID-19 outbreak was unlucky for Tesla. Nobody saw it coming. But the thing is nobody ever sees the next crisis coming. Nobody saw the housing crisis coming. Cisco and Intel investors didn't see the bursting of the dot com bubble coming.It could be the housing market, a viral outbreak, an oil crisis or World War III, but there will always be another trigger for the next market downturn. It's not bad luck. It is inevitable. The only thing investors don't know is when it will come and how bad it will get.TSLA stock has not been unlucky. It is a textbook example of the type of stock that underperforms during a bear market. Tesla isn't consistently profitable. It has reported positive earnings per share in four of the past eight quarters. It will likely be unprofitable once again in the first quarter of 2020.Tesla has an extremely high debt load. It has about $13 billion in debt and less than $7 billion in cash on hand. And even after the huge sell-off, TSLA stock is trading at earnings and sales multiples 10 times higher than Ford (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM). How to Play TSLA StockIf Tesla got unlucky, every other stock in the market also got unlucky. Yet there's a reason why TSLA stock is down 46% in the past month while high-quality stocks like Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) are down less than 10% in that time.TSLA stock is a high-risk, high-reward speculative stock. Until it proves a consistently profitable business model and demonstrates it is self-sustaining, it will remain a speculative play.Like Cisco and Intel were back in 2000, I think the future is bright for Tesla. But investors have to be smart about how they play the stock. Cisco's dot com peak was $80.06. Twenty years later, it's trading at $35.50. Intel's dot com peak was $74.88. Twenty years later, it's trading at $50.I have and still do recommend investors just look for opportunities elsewhere. The last six months alone is enough evidence that Tesla is more of a trading vehicle for day traders, cult followers and short-sellers than a reasonable investment. You can admire Tesla's progress and its CEO Elon Musk from a distance without putting any of your hard-earned money into one of Wall Street's biggest casino stocks.As long as the bear market continues, TSLA stock will likely continue to underperform. Tesla investors should think about whether they are content to continue to see themselves as unlucky or whether they want to learn from their mistakes and take action.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-03-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker of gear that directs internet traffic, said its Webex collaboration service is experiencing a staggering jump in use as companies look to find a way to securely connect workers confined to their homes.Webex daily meeting volume has more than doubled since the beginning of March and expanded 2 1/2 times from February. At peak hours, volume is up 24 times where it would be normally, the company said.Cisco’s conferencing business is the biggest provider of such services to companies with revenue many times the size of newer rivals such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. Demand for these services from home-bound employees during the Covid-19 pandemic indicates that work practices will probably change permanently, said Sri Srinivasan, who heads the company’s collaboration unit.“We will never go back,” he said. “The way we work is going to change forever. Employers are going to be able to hire workers from wider geographic areas because staff won’t have to come to the office as much, he added.While dropped connections and delays getting into meetings has increased, so far Cisco’s technology has just about kept up with the volume, Srinivasan said. The company was able to learn from the steep increase in traffic in Asia early this year and apply those lessons to the U.S., where volume is still increasing.The peak volume for traffic is at 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Monday through Friday. Internally, Cisco has started a process scheduling calls to begin outside of standard times -- not the top of the hour or 30 minutes past the hour -- and is recommending users do the same.Webex opened a free sign-up and service in response to the virus outbreak that drew 240,000 new subscriptions in the first 24-hour period, the company said. That program mirrors the growth by Zoom, which offers a time-limited free service for its multiparty conference calls and a paid service. Srinivasan said Cisco’s data policies are stricter than Zoom’s, meaning important work that needs to remain private will continue to take place on its system.Cisco no longer breaks out the performance of its collaboration division. The last time it did, revenue was about $4 billion in fiscal year 2015. Since then, the company has frequently cited the unit’s growth as being one of the fastest among its businesses. Zoom is on course for annual sales of about $890 million in calender 2020, according to the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.At the same time the explosion in traffic is helping collaboration providers make better products much more quickly. Cisco uses artificial intelligence to analyze what’s happening on Webex and increasingly to enhance elements such as call-center software. The company typically deals with 39 billion events (logins, calls, videos initiated, messages sent, etc.) per day on its systems. Last week that number increased to 270 billion a day and is still rising.Regardless of competitive dynamics, Srinivasan said it’s more important that all the services remain stable and continue to improve in order to help with the effort to stop the spread of the virus.(Company corrected the number of new subscriptions in the seventh paragraph of story published March 23.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Cisco Sees Demand Surge for Webex, Zoom’s Larger Rival"

2020-03-27,"It has been a heck of a rally attempt this week on Wall Street. Still, was that price action anything more than a bear in bull's clothing? Let's take a look at what's happened in the market the past few days and how to prepare for the immediate and maybe less immediate future with three diverse and opportunistic stocks to trade.Over the past three sessions the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and broad-based, large-cap S&P 500  captured stunning gains of around 13% to 16% respectively. As the saying goes, one day doesn't make a trend. But after three good days, bullish investors may have something stronger going for them. But do they? And which stocks to trade, as a bull or bear, make sense right now?To answer those questions, investors should recognize this week's rally was preceded by the market's swiftest and most panicked oversold bear market in decades. As such, the well-deserved jump in stock prices could be nothing more than a classic bear market rally. These price spikes are known for their short-lived ferocity before turning treacherously against those buying with the belief a bottom is in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'd hazard a guess the described price action from above may have investors' attention on Friday. But don't be so quick to rush to judgment because Friday is showing mostly lower prices in the market. The thing is, Friday also marks day four of a rally attempt in the broader averages. And that's good news for bulls. Tuesday's price jump marks day one after confirming Monday's fresh bear market low. It's that simple. Yet its importance, as well as the action of the past two sessions, can't be overstated. What's more important though are days four through seven of this count.During this window of time, investors should be monitoring the market for a follow-through day, as it's critical to the longevity of this week's potential bottom. Why, you ask? The fact is no intermediate turning point in the market has ever occurred without this technical confirmation. Now all that's needed to increase the odds of a bull market is one additional meaningful rally accompanied by increased volume, without price action undercutting Tuesday's &quot;day one&quot; low. Simple, right?  * 7 Strong Stocks to Buy to Survive the Coronavirus Crisis Bottom line, only time will tell if today's bear market is going to be uprooted by this robust technical signal. And while I'm hopeful and see the odds as favoring a follow-through day, today simply demands looking at stocks to trade which are suited to an uncertain market environment. Stocks to Trade: Cisco Systems (CSCO)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the first of our stocks to trade. This old-school, large-cap technology play is a stock to buy. But don't just take our word for it. Broker Jeffries recently hailed shares as one which investors are 'practically stealing' given the company's quality fundamentals amid the indiscriminate selling of the past month.There's more to Cisco as well.With a hand in the booming and now obviously important teleconferencing market via Cisco's collaboration WebEx platform, as well as offering essential cloud-based cybersecurity for those same businesses, the drivers look good for CSCO stock.What also looks terrific is Cisco's 3.8% dividend. And that's not all either.Lastly, this stock offers a still fairly uncommon oversold monthly stochastics setup. And as that's accompanied by a March hammer bottoming candlestick that's formed inside layers and layers of key longer-term price support, there are plenty of reasons to see Cisco as a stock to trade from the long side. Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe next of our stocks to trade is Bed Bath and Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY). Moreover, this is a stock for the bears in our midst. Long before the coronavirus outbreak, BBBY stock was already showing strong signs of a fall with no chance of getting back up. What's more, there's still plenty of room for more downside to come.In a nutshell, the shift in consumer preference to online shopping now owned by a cartel of companies led by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) has proven BBBY stock's Achilles Heel. It's a condition without a cure in sight. Further, with poor fundamentals and a market capitalization of around $925 million that opens the door to lower prices, bears in this heavily-shorted name remain on the right side of the price action.  * 9 Food and Restaurant Stocks to Dine In On My suggestion for this stock to trade is to use an intermediate-dated bear put spread. It's practical and smart advice, given short-selling restrictions, as well as potential &quot;bear market rallies.&quot; And unlike shorting stock, this options strategy effectively limits and reduces exposure while leveraging the downside potential. Enphase Energy (ENPH)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe last of our stocks to trade is Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). For investors willing to step up to the plate in a pure-play growth play before a potential FTD signal, ENPH is a stock to buy today.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, shares of this $4 billion solar mid-capitalization company were seeing a fire lit under them due to the company's increasingly superior earnings and sales growth trends. Now that the baby was thrown out with the bathwater this past month, shares are well-positioned at the intersection of where growth meets value on the price chart.Technically, this stock to trade has corrected and confirmed a weekly chart doji candlestick which found support off ENPH's 62% lifetime Fibonacci cycle. Even better, the volatile shares have quickly pulled back over the last couple sessions, allowing investors to buy this leading stock on weakness near the signal price of the weekly candle.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- With its 175-acre campus in Cupertino, California, and several dozen more offices across the rest of the world, Apple Inc. wasn’t designed as a work-at-home company. That all changed about three weeks ago in the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier in March, Apple shuttered many facets of its Apple Park and older Infinite Loop campuses as San Francisco Bay Area officials put in place stay-at-home orders. Later, the company told employees that specific approval is needed to gain access to an office, but identification badges remain functional. The shift from office culture to remote work has been challenging for the hardware-focused company with a passion for secrecy. In the past, Apple has gone to great lengths to keep its new products shielded from the public until the company is ready to unveil them. Employees work behind secure doors with blacked-out windows, lock products in cabinets and are barred from discussing their assignments even with spouses. Now, working from home, some are finding it hard to adjust and there have been minor hardware development setbacks, according to Apple employees who asked not to be named talking about company matters.The majority of Apple’s hardware products are engineered at Apple Park or surrounding buildings in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California. For some work that requires hands-on development, some hardware engineers in Silicon Valley are allowed into the office, the people said. Apple also has hardware engineers in San Diego, California, and global coronavirus hotspots like Italy, Germany and Asia. But the company’s restrictions in those regions are far stronger. Apple has extended its remote work policy until at least April 5, depending on an office’s location. In a notice to staff, Apple said that “whether you’re working at home or at the office, it’s always critical to keep confidential work confidential. While working remotely, use the same care and always securely store confidential items and documents when not in use.”Still, Apple hasn’t paused its efforts to build future devices. The company is working on new versions of the HomePod speaker, Apple TV set-top box, MacBook Pro, budget iPads, Apple Watch and iMac for as early as later this year. The next round of flagship iPhones are targeting release in their normal fall window, Bloomberg News recently reported.Bay Area counties announced Monday they were extending stay-at-home orders until May 1, meaning these restrictions will be in place for at least another month, a key period when Apple finalizes products for later this year and next year.Read more: Apple’s Supply Chain Woes Linger Even as China Recovers“Apple has struck the balance between recognizing that much of the world runs on their products and that they need to keep them functioning and advancing, and they are balancing that with employee safety,” said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and co-founder of Loup Ventures. “They are reminding us with these small products they’ve recently announced that they’re going to keep working.”In early March, in a contrast to its normal practices, Apple started allowing engineers to take home early versions of future devices to continue work during the lockdown period. Previously, the company allowed select employees to take home nearly complete devices such as iPhones for real world testing. Typically, Apple is a company built on in-person meetings. Designers, for example, gather around kitchen-like tables to dream up future products. Hardware experts engineer and test devices together — things that simply are either more difficult or impossible over the internet.Taking home a future product requires the green light from the vice president of an employee’s organization. That list of staff with future devices at their homes also is sometimes reviewed by Apple’s senior vice presidents, the management team run by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. As part of the work-from-home order, Apple has clamped down on which employees are allowed to take home future versions of software, including the next release of iOS, the platform that runs the iPhone and iPad. Like with hardware, employees working on unreleased software, such as the upcoming iOS 14, require approval from the highest levels of the organization, the people said. Some Apple software engineers have privately complained about the difficulties of working from home, including distractions and concern about the on-going health crisis. But Apple’s software releases for later this year are currently on track and the company said it will announce the new versions in June at an online version of its annual developer conference.  Meetings have continued by phone and video conferencing. Apple requires employees to communicate via its own FaceTime service, Slack Technologies Inc.’s app and Cisco Systems Inc.’s Jabber or WebEx in order to maintain secrecy. For file sharing, Apple limits working to its suite of productivity apps, Salesforce.com Inc.’s Quip and Box. As part of its shift to working at home, Apple has also sent employees tips on ergonomic work setups, offered to reimburse staff for purchases of desks and computer monitors and has published responses to workers’ concerns about Covid-19.  Apple shut all 458 of its stores outside of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong earlier this month, and the company is holding store employee meetings, known as “Daily Downloads” virtually and on a less regular basis. Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of people and retail, has also been sending employees messages recorded from her home. Last week, she told employees that some workers and their family members were ill with Covid-19. She also re-iterated that stores would reopen on a case by case basis depending on local conditions possibly as soon as the first half of April.To lighten the mood in an otherwise traumatic period, Apple started a contest for employees to share photos of their work from home setup. The last guideline reads: “If you’re working on anything confidential, please keep it out of the shot.” (Updates with area stay-at-home order extended until May 1 in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Tests Its Secrecy Somewhere New: Employee Homes

2020-03-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus is changing the way we work. As more governments implement stricter shelter-in-place orders, corporations and their employees are scrambling to figure out how to conduct business operations in a work-at-home world. First, new hardware is required. Sales of monitors, webcams and laptops are soaring as people build out their home offices. But that’s the easy part.The bigger issue is how to enable similar levels of productivity without the many brief conversations and in-person meetings during a typical day at the office. To accomplish this, companies are increasingly turning to a handful upstarts in the aptly named workforce collaboration software category. These are the tools, initially designed for use in an office, which the world has now discovered work so well when trying to stay connected remotely, from video conferencing to electronic messaging platforms. And as they gain traction in the home workspace, it seems more and more likely they’ll stick once we’re all back in the office again, accelerating a trend toward greater usage that was happening anyway.Three tools that particularly stand out come from Zoom Video Communications Inc., Slack Technologies, Inc.  and Smartsheet Inc. What these companies have in common is they are upstarts, their products are arguably best-in-class for what they do and they’ve all seen their shares jump amid the widening coronavirus crisis.As recently as a couple months ago, the companies faced challenges in trying to raise awareness for their offerings. Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems, Inc. have much larger marketing budgets and deeper relationships with Fortune 500 tech buyers. Well that is less of a problem now. The need to just get work done has become a showcase opportunity for the best-of-breed software vendors to break through the noise and put some distance between their products and  the tech-industry goliaths’ less-capable offerings.Zoom is further along in the brand-awareness process. By now, everyone knows how the company is thriving as the video-conferencing pure play of choice. Earlier this month, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said on a call, “Given this coronavirus, I think that overnight almost every business really understands they needed a tool like this. This will dramatically change the landscape.” Last week, Bernstein’s survey of 516 working adults revealed Zoom’s momentum continues to rise. Based on an analysis of responses, the data implied Zoom’s boost in usage among knowledge workers was more than double, versus any other vendor since the coronavirus crisis began. Zoom’s success will have ramifications for when the crisis ends too. As businesses get acclimated to using inexpensive, high-quality videoconferencing, executives may realize the prior level of travel spend simply isn’t worth the cost.Smartsheet is also flourishing in the moment. The company makes software that automates business processes and workflows without requiring technical programming skills. For example, it can replace the manual data entry into Excel spreadsheets by using automatically updated web-enabled forms, improving accuracy and productivity. Earlier this month, the company posted 58% quarterly billings growth for its fiscal fourth quarter and said it wasn’t seeing a negative impact from the coronavirus.And then there’s Slack. The messaging platform has seen a surge in demand for its service, and as a hard-core user myself, I can vouch for how Slack has improved communications with colleagues inside and outside the office. Compared to email, it enables a faster form of iterative communication, similar to a back-and-forth real-life discussion with a co-worker, saving time and increasing understanding. Perhaps even more important, the software offers a searchable repository of conversations, documents and files that enables an efficient knowledge transfer to other team members.Many companies have started realizing Slack’s utility in recent weeks. Late Wednesday — in a now-epic tweet thread chronicling the explosion in demand for Slack and pressures on the company to meet it — CEO Butterfield revealed updated growth metrics for the current quarter, and they were jaw-dropping. In about two months, Slack had acquired 9,000 new paid customers, a figure 80% higher than the roughly 5,000 in each of the prior two quarters. Average messages sent per day per user were also up 20%.Slack shares rose 10% Thursday as investors cheered the improving metrics, and have largely held that gain since.  It’s important to note that even after these gains, Slack is trading only a few dollars above its $26-a-share initial direct-listing price in June 2019, and for much of its time as a public company has traded below that level. Moreover, there is no guarantee the rising usage will translate into a permanent customer base; there will be some users, perhaps, who drop the service when things are working more normally. And there may be major corporate layoffs and losses from economic shocks that could make larger enterprise deals more difficult to close. Butterfield himself is aware of this, saying Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the company’s current pace of growth “is just not sustainable … We would have the whole world on it in a couple of months if we kept going.”But as workers form new ingrained habits using these tools, they will become that much harder to give up. This points to better sustainable results for Zoom, Slack and Smartsheet over time.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Investors ought to stake claims in ongoing trends now to maximize returns over the next few years.If anything, a market correction, or even a crash, can create better prices for investors willing to buy and hold. In the technology sector, the increasingly connected world of smart devices (speakers, thermostats and doorbells, to name just a few) will result in strong sales growth for these devices and the systems that power them. While consumers are familiar with these devices as ways to make life more convenient, turning on lights or opening garages with their smartphones, the business applications should appeal to investors.Of course, this connected world needs communication infrastructure to support 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). So, should the global economy slow considerably in the short-term, the demand for connectivity will not change much. For example, the sudden need to stay at home to work will increase the demand for connectivity solutions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut these developments in the telecom sector are only one aspect of the increasingly connected world.Robert Siegel, lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business, thinks every industry will be affected by the proliferation of smart devices that can communicate with each other via the internet:&quot;Some obvious ones include manufacturing, mobility, and healthcare. The ability to make things with speed and scale will drive large scale but simultaneously customized manufacturing of items ranging from clothing to retail to food (yes, food!). Cars will become moving collections of sensors which will impact traffic, entertainment (in and out of the vehicle) and hospitality.&quot;  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Might Not Survive When it comes to the world of smart devices investors should invest not only in the &quot;usual suspects&quot; (telecom and tech stocks), but in companies that offer solutions in the automotive or retail space as well. Here are seven stocks investors should consider. Tech Stocks to Buy: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) directly benefits from the surge of people working from home in order to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said that user activity for its video conference platform, WebEx, surged to 5.5 billion meeting minutes in just the first 11 days of March.In the cloud space, Cisco has partnered with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to support AWS and Azure, respectively. Its software-defined network (SDN) WAN connectivity gives those platforms very tight security, as well as a way to analyze the entire network of devices. On a conference call, Cisco said that its SDN provides data on &quot;hundreds or thousands [of] different types of network devices.&quot; That ensures the customer gets the most data out of its infrastructure.Cisco has expertise in building large-scale networks that are highly available (e.g. reliable) and secure. Customers get better tools to manage the network and to ensure its security. In effect, Cisco enables users to connect quickly to an Azure or AWS platform.Critically, Cisco has a security stack in place to handle a higher volume of users. So the end-user on, say, Office 365, should still have a good experience despite increased traffic.That's great news for Cisco. In a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model, assume revenue growing a modest 1.2% compounded annually. With the following metrics below, Cisco stock is worth over $50:Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 9.5% - 8.5% 9.00% Perpetuity Growth Rate 2.0% - 3.0% 2.50% Fair Value $45.64 - $59.05 $51.32 Data courtesy of finbox.io AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com AT&T (NYSE:T) is one of the best plays in the telecom sector right now, even if the company recently cancelled an accelerated share buyback to preserve cash on hand.The company said that it decided to pause its $4 billion stock buyback &quot;to maintain flexibility and focus on continued investment in serving our customers, taking care of our employees and enhancing our network, including nationwide 5G. These continued investments will help ensure the Company is well-positioned when the pandemic passes and economies begin to recover.&quot;Earlier in March 2020, the company announced that 5G is now live in 22 more markets across the U.S. Since some of the latest smartphones, like Samsung's Galaxy S20, support 5G, customers will begin to utilize the faster low-band spectrum. 5G offers faster speeds over broader distances than the older 4G+ network. And since the demand for better network performance keeps growing, AT&T is in a good position to build its subscriber base at the expense of its competitors.AT&T's Business Solutions division sells wireless products, IoT, and connected devices through FirstNet. It is deploying high-speed nationwide wireless broadband to serve public safety. The reliability and speed of its network will serve to improve AT&T's reputation. Consumer and business customers will switch to AT&T's network if they want a better network and more services. AT&T said its Business Wireline group contributes a lot to its EBITDA.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Might Not Survive Analysts currently have an average price target of $42.10 on AT&T stock (per Tipranks). Nokia (NOK)Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is a leading supplier of 5G networking solutions. In early March, the company announced a collaboration with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Nokia will ship variants of its 5G AirScale radio access solutions. This will embed Intel's Atom P5900 processor. So, the 5G radio will &quot;combine compute, connectivity, and acceleration technologies.&quot; Because 5G supports billions of devices, the increase in volume and scale will need better technologies to back that demand.Nokia entered a partnership with Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) to develop 5G multi-Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT). This will combine Nokia's wireless technology with Marvell's multi-core ARM processor platforms. Nokia's ReefShark will benefit from lower power usage and smaller chip size.Nokia is progressing well in the 5G space. In Feb. 2020, the company completed a 5G core standalone network trial with KDDI, a leading telecoms company in Japan. So Nokia, through its 5G AirGile cloud-native core product, has the know-how to analyze 5G networks in a stand-alone service format.Assuming the following metrics in an earnings power value model, Nokia stock is worth $5.10:Metrics Range Conclusion Adjusted Earnings 952 M - 4.03 B 1.988 B Discount Rate 9.0% - 7.0% 8.00% Fair Value $2.39 - $11.31 $5.10 Data courtesy of finbox.io Ericsson (ERIC)Source: Shutterstock Just as Nokia reported a successful trial with KDDI, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) achieved cloud-native CI/CD  (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline delivery for KDDI's standalone 5G Core network.This will support the automatic deployment of new software and functions without disrupting the 5G core network. Ericsson has effectively automated the deployment process by taking out the need for staff involvement.The company further announced the production of its first 5G base station. The factory is located in Lewisville, Texas. And once it is operational later this year, the factory will supply all radio access components for a solution that 5G networks will use.In its fourth quarter, Ericsson management said it had nearly 80 commercial 5G agreements in place, with 24 5G networks already live. Customers are migrating to 5G and will need both operational support systems and cloud infrastructure as a by-product. So overall, gross margins held a steady 38.1%. The company's portfolio will benefit from the good momentum regardless of the current market conditions.Looking ahead, the shift from 4G to 5G is driving capital expenditure growth in the industry. Alongside that upgrade is data growth from users. Plus, the sudden shift in users needing to work remotely due to the COVID-19 lockdown also accelerated the upgrade timetable.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Might Not Survive ERIC stock has a fair value of $7.94, according to a quantitative research report by Stock Rover. NXP Semiconductor (NXPI)Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) beat consensus estimates yet again in the fourth quarter. The company benefited from strong demand in mobile, automotive, and industrial IoT markets. Revenue topped $2.3 billion, $30 million above company guidance.In the industrial IoT sector, NXP posted revenue falling 12% year-on-year due to the U.S./China trade worries. But looking ahead, revenue from industrial IoT will rise by 20%. Mobile will increase in the low double-digit percentage range.To bolster its Wi-Fi product, NXP acquired Marvell's (NASDAQ:MRVL) connectivity business. This will strengthen its automotive infotainment connectivity solution. Its industrial and IoT applications will also benefit from the Marvell acquisition. In the 2021-22 period, NXP expects improved traction for its ultra-band solution. So, with more IoT application use cases, expect a higher revenue range forecast.Management expects modest growth in the 5G space. On the conference call, CEO Rick Clemmer said that the company hasn't &quot;seen a resumption of the 5G growth yet. And it looks like it'll still be a couple of quarters out before we'll see strong growth in 5G deployment. We clearly see that it's coming. Just don't see it in the near term.&quot; STMicroelectronics (STM)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) has lost half its value on the stock market. The company said it will cut production by up to 50% due to the coronavirus outbreak in France. Yet if the global slowdown proves short-lived, STMicro should meet its full-year 2020 outlook. It commented on its conference call that product demand will grow because of trends in &quot;smart mobility, power and energy applications, and IoT and 5G.&quot;STMicro set a $1.5 billion capital expenditure plan to support growth in those markets. Its eventual goal is $12 billion in revenue. If history is any indicator, this firm will exceed those targets. Last year, for example, demand in personal electronics such as smartphones and wearables, climbed in the latter half of 2019.This year, 5G infrastructure build-outs are growing. So, ST is in a good position to meet the rising demand in IoT and 5G. And as more smartphone makers refresh the models to the 5G standard, the average selling price increases. ST will also offer such features as wireless charging and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems sensors.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Might Not Survive On Wall Street, the average price target on STM stock is $28.98 (per Tipranks). Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a Wall Street favorite, with a $94.67 price target. The smartphone chip processor and modem supplier said that demand in China already returned to normal levels. The company is at the forefront of the 4G to 5G transition. In anticipation of the explosive growth ahead, the company is maintaining a healthy level of operating expenditure levels. This will help it keep or improve its structure.In the long-term, investments in the business today will pay off tomorrow. With its radio frequency design wins and high-performance Snapdragon chip, investors should expect Qualcomm's operating margins to increase. The business is so healthy not just in China but overall. The company said on its Q! earnings call that &quot;in terms of inventory on 5G, we're really at the front end. And we have increasing demand from our OEM base. And really, the challenge for us is how do we keep up with increasing demand, because it's an incredible opportunity for us to grow.&quot;Investors may forecast revenue growing by around 3% annually in a 10-year discounted cash flow revenue exit model. Also, assume the following metrics:Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 10.0% - 9.0% 9.50% Terminal Revenue Multiple 3.4x - 4.4x 3.9x Fair Value $74.34 - 92.15 $82.92 Data courtesy of finbox.ioDisclosure: the author owns Nokia stock.

2020-04-03,"At time of writing, global coronavirus cases are nearing the one million mark, with the U.S. leading the number of cases by a country mile. Given this dubious honor, it's no surprise that the markets have taken down even stable companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). However, because of its long-term potential, many are taking advantage of the discount in Cisco stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com In my opinion, it's not an unreasonable bet. Fundamentally, CSCO features a solid balance sheet. Additionally, its three-year revenue growth rate is above average for its industry, while featuring very strong profitability margins. Better yet, Cisco stock entitles you to a generous dividend, which can help mitigate downside while giving you passive income for your troubles.Nevertheless, investors should be careful about the evolving and harsh realities that come from a health crisis transitioning to an economic one.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look In shocking news, during a one-week period, more than three million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. For the latest reported week, economists estimate that, at minimum, we could see 3.5 million workers join their ranks. However, according to USA Today, other sources have much higher forecasts:…Nomura forecasts 4.1 million; Morgan Stanley, 4.5 million; and Bank of America, 5.5 million. Such first-time jobless claims represent the best measure of layoffs across the country.The numbers could mark just the initial wave of a punishing couple of months.&quot;We could see unprecedented job loss in the April jobs report in the tens of millions, with the unemployment rate (now a 50-year low of 3.5%) reaching double digits,&quot; Bank of America said in a research note.No matter what, Cisco stock will encounter at least some turbulence ahead. Organic Marketing for Cisco StockDespite the obvious headwinds - and many understated ones - CSCO shares have grown increasingly compelling to contrarians. I don't think it's just the discounted price that's driving interest. Rather, the underlying company has ample marketing opportunities. Moreover, management is taking advantage of them.Primarily, the pandemic is a chance for Cisco to market its broad cybersecurity services portfolio. As you know, cybercriminals have come out in full force during this crisis. Prominently, many crooks have set up fake websites to &quot;sell&quot; N95 face masks. Or in another bizarre example, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones peddled fake coronavirus cures before getting shut down.Of course, the main problem is that cybercriminals are advantaging the emotionally heightened state of our country to dupe people out of their valuable assets. In this digital world, it's not always cash that's most desirable. Instead, unauthorized access to privileged information is often well worth its weight in gold.Frankly, what better way to gain that access than to manipulate someone's emotions?Adding to this problem, millions of workers find themselves operating remotely. While great for national health, it's unfortunately creating a data goldmine for cybercriminals. To counter this problem, Cisco is offering for a limited time its cybersecurity services free of charge, particularly for platforms involving remote workers.In the early stage, this initiative probably won't benefit Cisco stock. After all, the underlying company is giving something away for free. But in the long run, it's a perfect marketing opportunity to demonstrate the necessity of strong, reliable network defense mechanisms.Invariably, cybercriminals will wreak havoc on companies with lesser, shall we say Cisco-less platforms. Thus, this is an easy juxtaposition to sell corporate clients, eventually boosting the profile of Cisco stock. Advantaging a Virtual NormalIn an interview with CNBC, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins brought up interesting statistics regarding the jump in remote conferencing. Robbins stated:In the first 11 business days of March, we've had 5.5 billion meeting minutes…Yesterday we held 3.2 million meetings globally on Webex, and that doesn't include one on ones. Those are multi-individual meetings.Naturally, over the last several weeks, interest in so-called work-from-home stocks - Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK), Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and Dynatrace (NYSE:DT) - have soared. Currently, we're in the low-hanging fruit phase of sector demand; that is, just existing is winning.But as we move forward, corporate clients will judge work-from-home platforms on several criteria, including reliability, usability, and safety. Here, CSCO has a great opportunity to market itself as a comprehensive solution for all communication needs.Granted, it's not a perfect bet because we're hardly in a perfect environment. That said, if you're going to buy some discounted shares, Cisco stock offers a very solid look.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-04-06,"(Bloomberg) -- When Donald Trump toured an Austin, Texas, factory in November alongside Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, the president promoted the event as a celebration of U.S. manufacturing and the return of good-paying jobs to the country.The Apple CEO had successfully made his case to the administration that some components for his company’s products should be excluded from Trump’s China tariffs in exchange for keeping production in the U.S.“Today, I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high-paying jobs back to America,” Trump tweeted on Nov. 20.But the facility Trump visited is owned and operated by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd. and has been open for 30 years. For decades, it has been producing various devices for many companies including Cisco Systems Inc. Apple has been at the Flex plant since 2013.Computer Parts“He doesn’t have to worry about tariffs,” Trump said of Cook during the Nov. 20 factory tour. “Because when you build in the United States, you don’t have to worry about tariffs.”Two months earlier, the iPhone maker was exempted from tariffs levied on components it imports from China that are used in the Mac Pro desktop put together at the Flex plant. The removal of a 25% surcharge on items like power supplies and printed circuit boards that house the main components of the computer lowered Apple’s costs and, according to Cook, was the reason why the Cupertino, California-based company continued its manufacturing at the Austin factory.But other companies, like San Jose, California-based Cisco, didn’t receive the same treatment. Now jobs related to the manufacture of its products are at risk.In July 2019, Cisco asked the government to exempt the company’s power supplies for U.S.-made servers and switches from the same 25% tariff. Cisco said neither this China-made product nor a comparable one is available in the U.S. or from sources in third countries.Tariff ExemptionsCisco, like many other U.S. companies, was making the same plea to the Trump administration as Apple had: The exemptions were necessary to save good-paying American jobs.After months of being stuck in the process, Cisco was told March 5 that its application for the tariff exemption was denied.“After careful consideration, your request was denied because the request concerns a product strategically important or related to ‘Made in China 2025’ or other Chinese industrial programs,” Joseph Barloon, general counsel for the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, wrote in the denial notice.The applications for an exemption from Apple and Cisco were strikingly similar, particularly when it came to the question of whether their products helped China expand its industrial might.Power Supply“The subject power supplies are not strategically important or related to ‘Made in China 2025’ or any other Chinese industrial policy,” Cisco wrote. “The manufacture of these products in China is unrelated to China’s efforts to develop indigenous, advanced Information and Communications Technology products.”Apple used nearly identical language, saying: “This product is a component of a consumer electronic device. It is not strategically important or related to ‘Made in China 2025’ or other Chinese industrial programs.”Indeed, the power-supply boxes imported from China don’t require cutting-edge technological know-how. They are mostly made up of large spools of copper wire, capacitors and other basic wiring. They haven’t been made in the U.S. for years and don’t require highly paid skilled labor.Apple’s application to get a tariff exclusion was approved in September 2019.Tariff ReliefA USTR spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment when asked why Apple’s power supply unit doesn’t constitute a product that’s strategically important to China’s industrial programs if an almost identical one from Cisco does.Cisco representatives specifically told USTR and others in the administration while the applications were pending that jobs were at risk, according to sources familiar with the process who asked not to be identified discussing private talks.In a statement after the decision, Cisco said the exemptions it sought “would support the competitiveness of this domestic manufacturing.”The company said it would continue to work with the trade representative’s office for tariff relief on other items, including “for communications equipment that we believe are vital to support the medical response to the coronavirus.”USTR doesn’t make public the reasons why it approves a company’s exemption requests. The business community writ large has complained about the lack of visibility into why certain companies get what appears to be preferential treatment over others.San Jose, California-based Flex, which works for both companies, said in a statement that “securing waivers for tax exemptions is an individualized process based on each customer situation” and declined to identify other customers that use the Austin plant. “Flex’s global footprint provides our customers with options for manufacturing locations, however, we also work closely to help our customers secure tariff exemptions based on their needs.”A group of Texas lawmakers in a letter to trade chief Robert Lighthizer last year underscored that jobs are on the line in Cisco’s case. “Cisco’s operations in Texas directly support more than 1,150 jobs in our state and indirectly support thousands of related jobs in logistics, warehousing, distribution and transportation,” the lawmakers said in their Sept. 13 letter.The decision by the trade office means it’s now a lot cheaper for Cisco to put together its servers, switches and routers in Flex plants in Mexico and export the finished device tariff-free to the U.S. The company declined to say what actions it would take regarding jobs or manufacturing in light of the denial of tariff exemption.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Risks U.S. Jobs While Saving Apple’s at Austin Factory

2020-04-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said he’s told staff not to worry about losing their jobs and urged other companies to follow his example when possible.“We’re actively involved in the community trying to help people who’ve been impacted by this, why would we contribute to the problem?” Robbins said in an interview. “There are companies whose revenue has gone to zero who have no option. To me it’s just silly for those of us who have the financial wherewithal to absorb this, for us to add to the problem. It’s illogical.” Cisco, based in San Jose, California, has about 75,000 employees.Robbins said Cisco is focused on the near-term response to Covid-19 and has little visibility into how the economic downturn will affect its business farther out in the future. For now, the largest maker of hardware that handles internet traffic is rushing to meet demand for its Webex conferencing business and help customers expand their online capabilities, he said.Like other hardware makers, Cisco has seen increased demand from corporate customers that are experiencing a surge of online activity or trying to support more employees working from home. It’s too early to say whether that’s a short-term bump or a more permanent shift in the way companies do business, he said.IT Support Staff Go From Ignored to Indispensable: Fully Charged“Customers got to the point they’re at now by using everything they could to get up and running,” he said. “There’s a thesis that says some of our customers are going to go through an upgrade cycle. But we don’t know.”Some industries such as health care, higher education and financial services may be among those that build up their infrastructure to adjust to these changes more permanently, he said.Robbins said he’s spending a lot of his time on efforts by Cisco employees to help local communities. The company has implemented programs such as removing conferencing hardware from offices that are empty and sending it to hospitals. They’re using such gear to implement new procedures like remote patient check-ins, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Cisco CEO Tells Staff Jobs Are Safe, Urges Others to Avoid Cuts"
2020-04-09,"The newly publicized security vulnerabilities of Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), combined with the likely easing of the novel coronavirus crisis in a couple weeks and the meaningful competition the company is facing, do not bode well for Zoom stock at all. As a result, investors should avoid the shares.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com On April 5, The Washington Post reported that &quot;thousands of personal Zoom videos have been left viewable on the open web.&quot; A number of the company's customers have also been plagued by harassment while using its software.Further, Zoom has multiple links to China that have disturbed some of its customers because of the security implications of those links.

2020-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chipmaker that supplies crucial components for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, told customers that disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the Covid-19 pandemic means they’ll need to place orders for parts six months ahead of time.Lockdowns in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines are “closing or severely restricting business operations,” according to a letter to customers from Nilesh Mistry, Broadcom’s vice president of sales, dated April 13 and seen by Bloomberg. “Air and sea transport options have become unreliable and become more expensive and have increased delays,” Mistry wrote. The San Jose, California-based company declined to comment.Broadcom is a critical part of the supply chain for products ranging from mobile phones to data-center hardware. Any delays in the delivery of its semiconductors could spread throughout that supply network, potentially leading to missed launches of some of the world’s most high-profile and widely used electronic devices.Wireless customers include Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which use Broadcom chips to add Wi-Fi and other connectivity to some of the world’s best-selling smartphones. In networking, its switch chips are the market leaders, going into machinery that’s used by all of the biggest equipment makers, including Cisco Systems Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., and companies such as Amazon.com Inc. that build their own gear.The chipmaker’s letter to customers didn’t specify which products are experiencing delayed shipments and what the normal lead time is between orders and delivery, compared with the 26 weeks specified in the letter.“We hope that as the global community finds better methods to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the conditions will abate and we will be able to resume our normal operations,” Mistry said in the letter.Broadcom is part of the same supply chain that most of the world’s chipmakers use to outsource production, testing and packaging of their products. Products from companies such as Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are built mostly by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., then tested and packaged by other companies in China and Southeast Asia. Some companies perform elements of the process in-house, and a shrinking group are capable of doing all the steps themselves.On March 12, Broadcom withdrew its annual sales forecast and gave weak near-term guidance, citing the impact of the pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan told investors that, while fundamental demand was still strong and he hadn’t see any negative impact in the first quarter of the year, “visibility was lacking.”As part of a bond offering last week, Broadcom warned investors that it was experiencing some disruption to parts of its global supply chain. In the “related risks” section of a regulatory filing, the company highlighted that a main warehouse and a number of assembly and test subcontractors are in Malaysia, which has shut down all non-essential businesses. The warehouse is fully operational, but “many of the facilities of our suppliers and service providers are not,” the company said at the time.“An extended closure of these facilities may require us to move assembly and test services to providers in other countries, and may, eventually, lead to a shortage of some components needed for our products,” Broadcom said. “In the event restrictive measures in Malaysia are intensified and our warehouse is shut down or required to operate at a reduced capacity, our ability to deliver product to our customers would be severely limited.”The test and assembly of chips includes coating them in protective plastic, adding electrical contacts that let them communicate with the rest of the device, and making sure they function. Such work is less expensive and easier to conduct than the processing of silicon wafers that make up the fundamental circuits of the chips. Much of the packaging work was shifted to countries with lower labor costs decades ago.(Updates with company warning on Malaysia facilities in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Broadcom Says Chip Orders Require Six Months’ Lead Time

2020-04-17,"(Bloomberg) -- By mid-March, John Lyotier’s travel software business Left Technologies Inc. was cratering with the spread of the pandemic. Seeking to cut costs, he reached out to his office landlord, who offered rent relief. Then he contacted Amazon.com Inc., asking to “explore creative financing opportunities” for his monthly cloud-computing bill.The response was succinct. “’Nope, that’s the way it is,’” Lyotier recalled.The ability to rent computing power online has revolutionized the internet economy and turned a trio of companies -- Amazon, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google -- into the indispensable utilities of the web. The trio was expected to generate annual cloud revenue of more than $60 billion -- before greater demand from stay-at-home orders turned the cloud businesses into one of the bright spots in the collapsing U.S. economy.With the economic devastation of Covid-19, entrepreneurs like Lyotier feel the fate of their businesses rests on the benevolence of their cloud provider. While Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and Microsoft are restructuring some large contracts on a case-by-case basis, according to people familiar with the decisions, smaller companies aren’t receiving the same flexibility. Half a dozen startup executives said recent appeals to these cloud companies have gone unanswered.While older technology providers, such as Cisco Systems Inc., are offering credits to customers, the major cloud companies haven’t made any public announcements about deferring or cutting bills for clients.“They’ve been pretty radio silent,” said Jason Kim, co-founder Taloflow, which advises businesses on managing AWS bills.Cloud providers attracted so many companies over the past decade, in part, with the flexibility of the model. Businesses can start with a credit card, often on a pay-for-what-you-use basis, rather than pay for a back-room server or mainframe computer. Demand drops, and, typically, so does cloud usage and the bill.But the sales strategy for the big cloud companies has been to ink long-term deals. Customers typically receive discounts on list prices in exchange for minimum spending thresholds. As of the end of December, AWS recorded $29.8 billion it expected to post as future revenue as part of such contracts that run more than one year. Google told investors that at the end of 2019 it had $11.4 billion in cloud sales it planned to book. Microsoft sells cloud services, as well as much of its on-premise software, via multiyear agreements.Startups and other companies locked into these contracts feel particularity hurt. “Their revenues have sunk 50% or 60%, but their costs have remained static,” said Kim.Regulated, traditional utilities have offered some relief. California state regulators, for example, prohibited utility providers from shutting off power for missed payments. When a California company asked Google for payment assistance, it was told the company could only suspend their account and reopen it 30 days later, according to an April 1 email viewed by Bloomberg News.“We treat payment terms with our customers or partners as confidential and we’re not able to disclose details,” a Google Cloud spokesperson said in a statement.An AWS spokesman said customers can turn off cloud services in a way that wouldn’t be possible with corporate-owned data centers. The company published a blog earlier this month with tips on how to reduce AWS costs during the pandemic. “This is a very difficult time for some of our customers, and we are actively working across a number of dimensions to help them manage costs,” the spokesman said.Microsoft has been postponing renewal dates on cloud contracts to give some large companies in industries, including oil and gas, consumer packaged goods and retail, time to evaluate the toll from Covid-19, said a person familiar with the agreements, who asked not to be identified discussing private talks. Over those three months, pricing will remain fixed.Microsoft, like other vendors, generally increases the price when existing customers sign up for another multiyear contract. The company is cutting those markups in response to the pandemic. Microsoft also is giving some clients a discount on money owed for using more services than paid for upfront.Before the pandemic, Google had been offering a year or 18 months of free productivity tools in an effort to capture Microsoft clients. Google has bolstered those efforts recently.Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft and Google have recently given some customers more time to pay bills, the Information reported earlier.Economic data from some smaller enterprise firms gives a snapshot of the downturn’s impact on cloud computing. GloboTech Communications, a Montreal company that provides server and data management services, said about 7% of clients reported issues paying their April bill. Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Luc Quimper expects that number to increase and said the company has accommodated the vast majority with deferred or staggered payments. “The internet is an infrastructure that’s become essential to our lives,” he said. “We’re not interested in putting companies out of business just because they’re not paying for a month.”For several years, new tech businesses saw the cloud market as a bounty. In a rush to win customers, AWS and Microsoft’s Azure raced to give free usage credits to small companies on the theory that a few of these startups would explode and become big, reliable customers.Lyotier recalled the boost that the AWS credits gave his business two years ago, turning him into a “fan boy” of the service. His $19,000 monthly AWS bill now exceeds his rent, while his coffers are shrinking. “The reality is, we’re a startup again,” he said.Kris Hartvigsen, who runs Dooly, a sales software provider, thinks the cloud companies should change offers for new customers into “pandemic credits.” His provider, Google, hasn’t so far. He considered shifting to Microsoft’s Azure and accessing credits awarded for new customers, but said the engineering costs of moving systems were too high.“When you’re a startup, your plane isn’t too far off the ground,” he said. “So when it’s going to crash, it’s going to crash fast.”(Updates with Microsoft actions for large customers in the 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon, Microsoft Offer Little Relief to Small Cloud Clients"

2020-04-23,"(Bloomberg) -- The tidal waves of unemployment filings across the U.S. showed only the barest signs of abating last week as more than 4 million people applied for benefits, bringing the five-week total during the coronavirus pandemic to 26.5 million.Most states continued to see initial claims decline on an unadjusted basis, and several states did report decreases in layoffs for the prior week -- both signs that job losses are indeed slowing a bit. And government aid to small businesses could spur some employers to restore jobs in coming months.But filings might continue at an extraordinary pace for several more weeks, boosting an unemployment rate that may already be around 20%.While most of the layoffs in sectors like retail have likely already occurred, there will be “collateral damage” as companies faced with weak demand dismiss workers, said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo & Co.Bryson said he believes the U.S. is past the peak in initial claims “for the foreseeable future,” but “if we open up too soon and this coronavirus comes roaring back then we may in fact see those sorts of numbers again.”It’s still unclear to what extent the most recent claims totals reflect millions of people still losing their jobs each week or whether it’s largely a reflection of jobless Americans who are just now able to get through jammed websites and phone lines after weeks of trying.States are racing to boost the capacity to computer systems built years ago, adding workers to handle unprecedented volumes of claims and trying to get the $600 in additional weekly aid to the unemployed.Some states have taken steps such as staggering applications by alphabetical order of last name or the last digit of one’s social security number on certain days of the week in order to manage the flow.Initial jobless claims of 4.43 million in the week ended April 18 followed a slightly downwardly revised 5.24 million in the prior week, according to Labor Department figures Thursday. The median estimate of economists was for 4.5 million claims.California reported the most initial claims last week, at an unadjusted 533,600, down from 655,500 the prior week. Florida was next, followed by Texas at 280,400, up slightly from the prior week. Georgia and New York also reported more than 200,000 filings, though both down from the previous week.Unadjusted claims in Florida more than doubled from the prior week to an estimated 505,000. Connecticut and West Virginia also posted sharp increases.U.S. stocks rose after the report, while 10-year Treasury yields were little changed.What Bloomberg’s Economists SayThe latest initial claims represent the “third consecutive weekly drop from a peak of nearly 6.9 million at the end of March. While this is an important turning point, the flood of claims will likely continue.”&#92;-- Eliza Winger and Carl RiccadonnaRead more for the full reaction note.Assuming all who filed for benefits are counted as unemployed, the latest figures suggest a potential April unemployment rate of around 20%, given that Thursday’s data reflect the reference week for the monthly jobs report. That’s double the 10% peak reached in the wake of the last recession in 2009 and approaching levels last seen during the Great Depression.Continuing claims, or the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits, rose by 4.1 million to an all-time high of 16 million in the week ended April 11. That pushed the insured unemployment rate to 11% -- the highest on record. Those figures are reported with a one-week lag.State ResponseThe massive government stimulus package provides an extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits and expanded coverage to self-employed and other “gig” workers, presenting additional challenges for the states. Providing the additional aid has been wrought with technical issues and increased the number of applications flowing in.In New Jersey, where more than 500,000 are collecting unemployment and receiving the weekly supplemental pandemic payment, promised aid to self-employed or independent workers hasn’t arrived, according to Angela Delli Santi, a labor spokesperson.“We anticipate having it up and running shortly,” Delli Santi said of the aid for self-employed people. “States had little lead time to get these programs up and running.”In Michigan, one of the hardest-hit states, the state labor department has 600 people answering phones and communicating with people who apply for benefits using the Internet, compared with a normal agency staff of about 130, spokesperson Jason Moon said.Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday that the state has seen a vast improvement in handling millions more online filings and calls after recent boosts in capacity. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has installed new servers to increase capacity, and just over the weekend, the state upgraded its system to process claims faster.Texas, which has seen 1.6 million applications related to the pandemic, added an eighth call center and paid out $499 million in benefits in just the first two days of this week.“We are making changes, making advances, updating our phone systems and our web systems, adding more staff, adding call centers to meet the demand of people who are filing for unemployment insurance,” said Cisco Gamez, a spokesman for the Texas Workforce Commission.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Unemployment Waves Keep Hitting With Millions More Claims

2020-04-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With lockdown restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic decimating many U.S. businesses and tens of millions filing for unemployment, it’s no surprise Americans are fretting about their job security. To ease this uncertainty, many technology companies have decided to institute a “no-layoff” policy for their employees during these tumultuous times. Not only is this good for workers — but it’s smart business, too.The list of companies guaranteeing continued employment includes some of the biggest and brightest names in tech. Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang told employees in an email earlier this month that the chipmaker won’t cut staff due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, it’s pulling forward new salary hikes. Likewise, Cisco Systems Inc. CEO Chuck Robbins told Bloomberg News his employees’ jobs were safe, as did management at ServiceNow, an enterprise software provider that is among the number of tech firms reporting earning this week. PayPal Holdings Inc. also made job-protection vows.While the industry isn’t alone in extending these kinds of guarantees — several financial companies including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. have made similar commitments — the number of tech companies doing it is notable. It’s easy to be generous during boon times. But reputations are built during tough times. Promising job security engenders loyalty from one of companies’ most important assets: human capital. Future and current employees will remember how they were treated during this crisis. And by standing firm for their workers, the companies will be able to hire and retain the best talent going forward.Some executives may consider staff reductions because they are worried about their stock price. This may be a myopic move. Over time, the stock market values companies on their fundamental long-term earnings power, not near-term financial results. Further, any benefits from cost cutting may not make up for the loss in institutional knowledge that can generate more future revenue as well.Moreover, the companies that safeguard their employees will benefit from increased productivity, too. It’s simply human nature. When people get worried over job security, the culture tends to grow more toxic. Instead of teamwork and collaboration, employees start to focus on internal politics and everything becomes a zero-sum game. Instead of taking smart risks, serving customers and building better products, workers play not to lose. Removing the uncertainty should breed better creativity and performance.Of course, not every company has the balance sheet strength to make the employment security promise. If a firm doesn’t have financial liquidity, it won’t do anyone any good if the timeline to insolvency gets accelerated by avoiding needed restructuring. Should conditions worsen, it may be necessary for some companies to reverse no layoff pledges. But for companies that can afford to look through the valley and commit to supporting their staff through this difficult period, it can only increase their competitive advantage.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-05-01,"Since reporting its earnings last week, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) stock has not done much. But then again, there was already a nice rally ahead of the announcement. Note that the shares went from $6.17 in mid-March to $8.35.Source: Shutterstock For the first quarter, Ericsson's revenues increased by 2% to $4.93 billion. While there was considerable weakness in the digital services business, there was strength in other segments like for networks. Given that the contracts tend to be large, there are often timing issues. And yes, with the novel coronavirus pandemic, there has been some more delays with deals.But despite this, I think the long-term does look bright for Ericsson, especially with the megatrend of 5G rollouts. The fact is that the company is positioned nicely, in terms of its global infrastructure, IP (Intellectual Property) portfolio and end-to-end technologies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Issues Looming Over Disney Stock Ahead of Earnings So let's take a deeper look at why Ericsson stock is a good play right now: CoronavirusEricsson acted swiftly to make its workforce remote. This was no easy feat as the company has about 85,000 employees. But Ericsson has set up a Crisis Management Council and has also been able to put in processes to maintain the performance of its networks. Another benefit has been that the company has a diversified sourcing infrastructure and various production sites across the worldWhile the coronavirus will weigh on growth, it is likely to be temporary. Keep in mind that the company has reiterated its financial targets for 2020 to 2022. In fact, in the second half of this year, there is likely be an increase in momentum because of the merger between T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint. This should lead to more spending on rollouts.Ericsson also continues to report strong margins. In the latest quarter, the gross margin rose from 43.2% to 44.4%. As a result, the company continues to generate strong cash flows.Note that there is $3.81 billion in the bank. In other words, there appears to be enough liquidity for dividends, buybacks of Ericsson stock, R&D investments and acquisitions. StrategyEven though Borje Ekholm has been CEO only for a couple years, he has wasted little time in putting in place a solid strategy. He has not only been disciplined with costs but also wise in nixing low-margin contracts.But Ekholm has been effective in focusing on the right technologies to capitalize on the 5G opportunities. For example, the Digital Services segment has benefited from software sales and cloud platforms, which have provided higher margins. And as for the Managed Services unit, there have been nice gains from AI and automation systems. 5G Opportunity for Ericsson StockThe 5G market is intensely competitive, with many large operators like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Huawei. Yet Ericsson has been able to fare pretty well, especially when it comes to winning business. For the first quarter, the company announced 86 commercial 5G contracts and completed 29 live networksWhat's more, the 5G opportunity is enormous for Ericsson stock. According ResearchAndMarkets.com, the spending is forecasted to go from $12.6 billion in 2020 to $44.9 billion by 2025, for a compound annual growth rate of nearly 29% (consider that this accounts for the estimated negative impact from the Covid-19 virus). Just some of the drivers for the growth include the adoption of IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices, the rise in automation and the continued growth in data traffic.In the Ericsson annual report, Ekholm writes: ""But 5G is much more than enhanced mobility for consumers. This is an innovation platform so powerful that it will be the driving force behind the next big shift in society - the fourth industrial revolution. By 2025, we expect the number of cellular IoT connections to reach 5 billion. This shift will impact all sectors, potentially increasing the addressable opportunity for telecom operators by up to 30% by 2030.""Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-05-07,"Thursday was another example of inexplicable price action, with stocks rallying even as the weekly jobless claims number spiked, setting the stage for what's going to be an unsurprisingly dismal April jobs report before the open Friday morning.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 rose 1.15%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.89%  * The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.41%  * Underscoring just how wacky things were today, bad news king Boeing (NYSE:BA) was actually the Dow's best-performing component, gaining 5.64%.As noted above, stocks faced off yet again with a grim set of initial jobless claims data. For the week ending May 2, 3.17 million Americans filed for first-time jobless benefits, bringing the total number of claims filed since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak to a staggering 33.5 million. The only good thing about the most recent claims number is that it was lower than the prior week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe'll get a more definitive number tomorrow with the April jobs report, but right now it looks like the U.S. unemployment rate is 15.5%, which is depression-level territory. Making matters worse with the most recent batch of claims is that California and Texas -- the two largest states by economy -- were among the joblessness leaders.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now Over the course of U.S. economic history, there are instances where California's economy thrives and Texas's flounders, or vice versa, and the broader national economy survives. However, it's improbable for the U.S. economy to thrive if both California and Texas are tanking at the same time.Still, half of the 30 Dow stocks were higher in late trading and while that's a great percentage, some of the index's biggest components were in the green. Tech, AgainThe technology sector is getting plenty of praise these days, deservedly so, not simply because it's the largest sector weight in the S&P 500. Don't look now, but while that index and the Dow are still in the red on a year-to-date basis, the Nasdaq Composite moved into positive territory with today's gains.That move was supported by the usual suspects, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jointly account for a massive percentage of the Nasdaq Composite. Those stocks traded slightly higher today.Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), a Dow/Nasdaq stock seen to benefit from the work from home trend, also notched a slight gain today. Dividend TalkAs I noted yesterday, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) could be a near-term dividend offender and fellow Dow stock Disney (NYSE:DIS) joined that ominous group on Tuesday, but with so much negative dividend news this year, some market observers are looking at the companies that are going the other way.Among Dow dividend raisers to this point in 2020, there's the aforementioned Apple, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Procter and Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV). Good News From Bad NewsHere's an interesting tidbit: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), the Dow names with the most exposure to weakening consumer credit quality, each closed higher today on reports that consumers are taking the opportunity to pay down debt.Said another way, with limited options beyond online shopping and food delivery to spend on the discretionary side, it looks like many consumers are saying &quot;Hey, let's trim some of that credit card debt.&quot; Should that trend continue, it could allay concerns that Amex and JPMorgan could be hit with a slew of charge offs in a recession. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTomorrow's jobs report will probably show a ghastly unemployment rate of 16%, but this week's market action suggests investors are willing to gloss over that number in anticipation of the economy reopening. That's going to be a slow roll, but with some positive signs emerging, including Nevada releasing a plan to reopen casinos and California relaxing some restrictions this week, market participants are betting on the &quot;things are heading in the right direction&quot; theme.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-05-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. gave a better-than-feared sales forecast, helped by a boom in remote work and online activity that is stoking demand for the company’s network equipment.Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in July, will fall 8.5% to 11.5% from a year earlier, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. At the mid point. that indicates revenue of about $12 billion, slightly more than analysts expected. Adjusted profit will be 72 cents to 74 cents a share, also ahead of analysts’ projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before,” Chuck Robbins, chief executive officer of Cisco, said. The shares rose 2.8% in extended trading, after closing at $41.95 in New York.Spending on data centers, servers and other equipment has increased to support millions of employees working from home over the internet. As the largest provider of switches and other gear for computer networks, Cisco benefits from this trend. The company has also touted a surge in use of its Webex video conferencing service. However, a recession has begun, limiting technology spending by companies and governments.During a conference call, Robbins was asked whether orders will decline again if the economy slows further. The CEO said he thinks that’s already happened. Some industries like travel and leisure are not spending, while elsewhere the crisis has spurred investment to update network infrastructure, he added.“Anyone who’s going to be in trouble three to six months from now is already pausing,” Robbins told analysts.Cisco said net income in the fiscal third quarter fell to $2.8 billion, or 65 cents a share, from $3 billion, or 69 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 8% to $12 billion, matching Wall Street estimates. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 79 cents a share, beating analysts’ expectations.Cisco’s hardware business reported revenue of $6.43 billion, down 15% from a year earlier. Applications, its software unit, saw sales fall 5% to $1.36 billion, while security revenue rose 6% to $776 million.Cisco CEO Tells Staff Jobs Are Safe, Urges Others to Avoid CutsIn mid-April, Cisco said it would offer $2.5 billion in financing to customers to encourage them to keep buying equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some buyers of Cisco gear, services and software will be given a 90-day holiday on payments, and can defer 95% of the cost of what they purchase until January 2021.

2020-05-13,"The market seems caught in mixed thinking.On the one hand, excitement about the economy slowly starting to reopen has boosted shares recently. But there also seems to be a sense that it all might be too good to be true and the reopening might be premature. This morning, the former seems to have once again taken hold, as cautious optimism might be the theme of the day. In addition to optimism about the economic reopening, the Federal Reserve has also been a boon to the recovery in equities by providing support for the economy and market. This morning, market participants were waiting for a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Investors and traders were likely wanting to hear more commentary about the potential for negative interest rates as well as the Fed's position on helping out the economy amid the financial devastation from the coronavirus.With the next scheduled Fed meeting weeks away, the market will have plenty of time to parse Powell's comments. We may know a lot more by then about the spread of the virus, the pace of economic reopening, and whether more fiscal stimulus is forthcoming.This morning's positive tone has helped an impressive rebound after the really weak close to yesterday's session. The positive sentiment, which is also helping oil hold around $25 a barrel and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) dip toward 30, seems to be coming from the idea that the worst of the coronavirus may be over. But with headlines shifting daily, it seems that volatility will continue.The Down End of the Seesaw In addition to the optimism, there seems to be a sense that the economic recovery may have a long way to go. That school of thought appeared to prevail as yesterday's session wore on.There's been nervousness about international locales that are seeing a resurgence in coronavirus cases after lifting lockdowns. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Senate that opening the U.S. economy prematurely could trigger an outbreak that might be uncontrollable and set the economic recovery back. One of the places that has seen fresh coronavirus cases is Wuhan, China. That location has particular weight because it was the global epicenter when the coronavirus first emerged, making the news particularly discouraging for those thinking the economy might rebound quickly and support a V-shaped stock market recovery.There also seems to be an increasing amount of tension between the U.S. and Chinese governments over the coronavirus. (See more below).At home, the airline industry was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) Industrials sector after downbeat comments on the industry from Boeing Co's (NYSE: BA) chief executive officer. That industry has been one of the hardest hit amid the pandemic amid grounded flights as travel has dried up considerably.Some Bright Spots While those issues may have been marks in the negative side of the ledger on Tuesday--perhaps sparking some profit-taking from recent gains--the news wasn't all doom-and-gloom on Tuesday.The Fed started its program of buying corporate bond exchange traded funds (ETFs). While this is arguably a positive for the market--assuming it's viewed as a temporary backstop from the central bank--it was also baked into the cake, which might have limited broader support for stocks amid the other somber news. (See more on the ETF buying below.)News from the supply side helped oil on Tuesday, with crude oil futures (/CL) gaining ground on news that Saudi Arabia and some neighboring countries said they'll cut production even further. But crude's advance didn't seem to provide much help to the Energy sector (IXE), which fell 2% as the broader market lost ground.The excitement about the domestic and world economies reopening has helped lift oil prices--and the Energy sector--in recent days. But that sentiment is fickle, and the ebbs and flows in oil prices have been serving as a sort of proxy on sentiment about a global economic recovery. That economic recovery would likely mean an increase in demand for petroleum products for ground and air transportation and manufacturing. Though the core of earnings season is behind us, there's one to watch for this afternoon: Tech giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). Earnings are expected to come in at $0.69--down about 14% vs. the year-ago quarter--according to third-party analyst consensus. Big tech has delivered a mixed bag this earnings season, with Microsoft  Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) surprising to the upside but Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and cloud and hardware mainstay IBM (NYSE: IBM) falling short. CSCO earnings may be of particular interest, as its cutoff date includes the month of April--which is when the coronavirus shutdown kicked into high gear in many places.    CHART OF THE DAY: 10-YEAR YIELD SLIPS. As stocks pulled back Tuesday amid worries about the economic recovery, demand for safe-haven Treasuries increased. That caused the yield on government debt, including the 10-year Treasury, represented here by an index, to decline. Data source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  The Market and the Economy: The Fed's historic foray into buying corporate bond ETFs on Tuesday marked just one of the ways the central bank is trying to help backstop the stock market and wider economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Other steps have included lowering the federal funds rate and buying Treasuries. It seems that the Fed's interventions have helped equites recover faster than the wider economy, creating a gap between Wall Street and Main Street. It's arguable that the stock market, which is forward looking, is pricing in a relatively quick economic recovery, aided by the Fed's efforts. The situation is another reminder that the market isn't the economy, and vice versa.Deja Vu All Over Again: In an uncomfortable reminder of the U.S.-China trade war, there are signs that tension is once again rising between the world's two largest economies. Legislation was introduced in the Senate on Tuesday that would allow the president to sanction China if the Asian nation doesn't cooperate with investigations into the origins of the pandemic. In separate news, Bloomberg reported that legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over treatment of Muslim minorities could come to the floor as soon as this week. The White House has also directed the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to stop plans to invest in Chinese companies. For investors, the talk of punishing China financially may bring back memories from the not-too-distant past when the market faced uncertainty over the trade dispute. Now, with the economies of both China and the United States on the backfoot from the coronavirus, it seems that added uncertainty is the last thing Wall Street needs.Technically Speaking: Yesterday, it looks like the news flow gave traders and investors an excuse to book some profits, and the selling seems to have reinforced an area of technical resistance around 2,945-2,955 for the SPX. Late last month, the SPX pulled back from a high of 2,954.86. It retested that general area this week and hit a high on Tuesday of 2,945.82 before pulling back. It seems that the market would need some sort of catalyst in the news flow to move solidly above that level, with a close above 2,950 perhaps needed to shift the technical picture higher.

2020-05-14,"Shares in Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) rose after its third-quarter profit topped market expectations as work-at-home orders drove demand for its tools and virtual networking products. The stock appreciated 2.3% to $42.93 in pre-market trading on Thursday.In the third quarter ended April 25, earnings per share, excluding items, stood at 79 cents exceeding analyst expectations of 69 cents. Total revenue in the reported quarter dropped 8% to $12 billion year-on-year which is slightly higher than the analysts’ average estimate of $11.7 billion.&quot;The pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before,” said Chuck Robbins, chairman and CEO of Cisco. “We remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations.&quot;Looking into the fourth quarter, Cisco guided investors by saying that it sees revenue decline between 8.5%-11.5% year-on-year. It also provided financial guidance for adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents-74 cents versus a consensus of 71 cents.Commenting on the earnings results, five-star analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver at Robert W. Baird, said that in spite of persistent macroeconomic headwinds due to the coronavirus pandemic, Cisco executed well against muted expectations showing nice profit upside.“Cisco has been giving away free licenses for many of its security products that help enable remote work, including Umbrella, Duo, AnyConnect, and AMP,” Ruykhaver wrote in a note to investors. “We do see an opportunity for Cisco to convert some of these free licenses into paying users as we move through the current crisis, helping to drive growth.”Ruykhaver raised Cisco’s price target to $48 from $46 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock.However, Ruykhaver still expects the company’s growth to remain pressured in the near term, with product revenue weighed down by “continued weakness in infrastructure platforms”.Overall, out of the 16 Wall Street analysts covering the stock 9 have Buys and 7 have Holds adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus.

2020-05-14,"Wall Street's main indexes were set to extend declines on Thursday, following two prior sessions of losses, as investors worried the current economic downturn might be here for longer than initially presumed.  Futures fell further after data showed 2.98 million Americans filed for state unemployment benefits last week, higher than economists' estimates and cementing expectations for a third straight month of massive job losses in May.  The three main stock indexes are now headed for their worst week since mid-March, as hopes of a quick economic recovery were dashed this week following sobering comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci.",US STOCKS-Futures fall on fears of prolonged economic downturn

2020-05-14,"Wall Street seems to still be on edge a day after sobering commentary from the Federal Reserve chief sent the market lower.Commentary from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was a stark reminder that even though stocks have rallied from coronavirus-induced lows, the economy may be far from being out of the woods.And weekly jobless claims numbers this morning helped underscore his downbeat assessment of the economic situation. Traders and investors were expecting another terrible figure for initial unemployment claims, with a Briefing.com consensus estimate forecasting an addition of 2.475 million initial claims. The actual number came in worse than expected, showing an addition of 2.981 million initial claims.Despite the worse-than-expected number, which reflects some of the economic pain of the pandemic and continues adding to the unemployment roster, the number of new claims added each week is continuing its trend of declining.The Jerome Powell Show Comments from Powell set the tone for the trading day on Wednesday, and the tone was negative.Investors were listening for any clues about the state of the U.S. economy and future monetary policy moves. And the market seemed particularly focused on this nugget from Powell: &quot;While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks.&quot;The words &quot;highly uncertain&quot; didn't sit well with investors, nor did &quot;downside risks&quot;. While Powell didn't detail any new support for the economy and market from the central bank, and said the Fed isn't considering negative interest rates, he did seem to leave the door open for additional policy measures from the Fed while also saying more fiscal support from elected officials could be costly but worth it. But it remains to be seen whether additional stimulus, if any, will come from the central bank via monetary facilities, or from Congress and the White House in the form of fiscal measures or a combination of both.All in all, Powell's comments left the market with a more pessimistic (or perhaps realistic) outlook on the economic recovery, without providing new, concrete responses from the central bank. This comes against a backdrop of increasing worries about the economic reopening possibly being premature, as fresh infections are being reported in locations that have eased lockdowns.Wednesday's Markets The somber tone helped push the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) above 35, and all three of the main U.S. indices slid markedly. Treasury yields also dipped, another sign that concerns about the health of the U.S. economy remain. The weakness spilled over into the Financial sector, especially banks, which are extremely sensitive to credit risk. And with interest rates as low as they are, banks could feel some pain.In addition to weakness in equities, crude oil prices also pulled back, leading the Energy sector to the worst performance of the day. Despite the first decline in U.S. crude inventories since January, oil prices slipped as market participants worried about the demand prospects in light of Powell's bleak outlook. View more earnings on CSCOThe longer the economic downturn lasts, the longer it will be before we see robust demand for petroleum products for travel by automobile, transportation by semi-truck or train, and flying for vacation or work.Much of the recovery for airlines depends on &quot;the middle seat test.&quot; Travel won't get back to normal until people start feeling comfortable enough to take a seat between two other people on a crowded airplane. A similar assessment could probably be made for much of the rest of the economy.Looking for a bright spot? Communications equipment giant Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) topped consensus on both the top and bottom lines after the close Wednesday. But like many things these days, though it's a mark in the &quot;W&quot; column, it comes with an asterisk--in the form of lowered expectations. Despite beating consensus, sales were still off 8% from a year ago, and its next-quarter guidance is calling for a revenue slide of between 8.5% and 11.5% vs. a year ago. And though shares rose 1.5% on the news, it came on a day when shares followed the market down--to the tune of about 3% ahead of the report.Still, perhaps the telling lesson here is that since CSCO earnings include April numbers--when the pandemic really began to hit businesses hard--perhaps when the next earnings season rolls around, other tech companies might see numbers that aren't as bad as some had feared.    CHART OF THE DAY: HANGING ON TO SUPPORT. In a look at the technical picture for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the index has been ranging between its 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels. On Tuesday, we saw the SPX sell off from its 61.8% retracement level, and that sell off continued into Wednesday. The index reached its 50% level but bounced off it. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Negative, or a Positive?Anyone hoping that Powell might at least crack the door to negative interest rates was disappointed on Wednesday, as the Fed chief said the central bank isn't looking at the unorthodox policy measure right now. Economic data out Wednesday didn't seem to offer enough incentive for policy makers to change their mind. The April producer price index, a measure of inflation, fell more than expected, dropping 1.3% when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a 0.5% drop. &quot;The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound,&quot; Briefing.com said. Although negative rates could be a boon for borrowers, overall they probably wouldn't be good for the market. Such a move would put banks in dire straits. And the Financials sector is one of the largest in the SPX.Negative Rates? &quot;Negative,&quot; Says Powell: Last week we pointed out that, despite Powell's saying in a recent press conference that negative interest rates would not be &quot;an appropriate policy response,&quot; several CME Fed Funds futures contracts had been trading above 100, indicating a slightly negative interest rate. The Fed chairman has doubled down on the &quot;not here&quot; response, saying yesterday that &quot;it's not something we're considering,&quot; and the even more emphatic &quot;the evidence of their effectiveness is very mixed.&quot; So that's that, right? Well, two interesting things from current CME data. First, from the April 2021 contract through the end of next year, Fed Funds futures contracts all settled above 100 Wednesday. However, if you look at CME's FedWatch tool, the meter has moved ever so slightly in favor of a rate hike this year. Granted, it moved from a 0% chance to 0.7% chance, but still greater than zero. Rather than split hairs, it might be best to say that rates are expected to be near zero (give or take) for an extended period. Retail Sales Numbers On Tap: Powell's remarks probably won't be the last bit of sobering economic news this week. April retail sales figures are coming up on Friday, and they're not expected to be pretty. Retail sales for the month are expected to have slid by a record 11.9%, according to a Briefing.com consensus. That's after falling 8.7% the previous month. March's decline was the worst on record and even worse than the average Wall Street estimate. Grocery stores were seeing plenty of demand for staple items. Not so much discretionary purchases like clothing and furniture. And restaurants and bars have been among the hardest hit. Investors might want to watch for reactions in shares of retailers like L Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LB), Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE: M) and restaurant chains McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), Yum Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE: DRI). Still, the market is expecting the number to be bad, so much of this might already be baked into the cake.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-05-15,"A simple pullback in the market may prove more complex than many investors may have anticipated. But for three large-cap stocks in particular, strong and well-received quarterly reports, and less questionable larger price patterns, have placed them among the key earnings stocks to buy today.Things haven't been so simple for most stocks and it has been an action-packed couple of days in the market. On Thursday, the S&P 500 made a broad-based bullish reversal after suffering a 7% decline over the past three sessions. This grabbed many investor's attention. But with Friday's failure to follow-through with the bullishness, and an inability for it to move above the 62% retracement level, many wonder if this was as good as it could get for the bulls. Thankfully, not every stock on the S&P has suffered.  * 7 A-Rated Gold Stocks to Buy For Your Portfolio Hedge There are no guarantees as to what comes next. But amid geopolitical mudslinging between the U.S. and China, Federal Reserve talk and today's &quot;new normal,&quot; earnings have also played a role in moving the markets higher and lower. Three large-cap stocks in particular come to mind as examples of this movement:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)Let's take a closer look at these three earnings stocks to buy. Each has grown stronger thanks to well-received earnings reports and bullish price charts that continue to point towards higher ground. Earnings Stocks to Buy: Cisco Systems (CSCO)  Source: Charts by TradingViewAlongside cheap fundamentals, business for Cisco is looking up. The company just released earnings results Wednesday evening and offered surprise results that were stronger than expected. The quarterly confessional also importantly delivered mostly upbeat guidance that didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. CSCO stock finished up more than 4.50% in Thursday's market-bucking performance.Technically, Cisco is also ready to deliver for tomorrow's investors. Following a larger and slightly deeper bearish cycle than the broader market experienced, CSCO stock formed a trustworthy bullish hammer set inside layers of durable longer-term Fibonacci support.With April confirming the reversal candlestick, shares more than 5% above the original signal price and favorable stochastics setup backing a purchase, CSCO stock is undoubtedly one of the standout &quot;earnings stocks&quot; to buy now. Regeneron (REGN)  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe next earnings stock to buy that has my attention is biotech giant and novel coronavirus play Regeneron. Last week, the outfit reported stronger-than-forecast results and offered bullish news of its plans for a drug study related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Investors were impressed by what Regeneron had to offer and sent REGN stock rallying by just over 6%. But if you think that's as good as it gets, look again.After leading the broader market to all-time highs into 2015, Regeneron went through a fairly painful and elongated bear market that endured for four years. But this past year's out-performance has established a clean end to that phase. It has also opened the door for an equally bullish cycle in REGN stock to emerge.  * 10 High-Risk Stocks That Could Go Either Boom or Bust Currently, shares of Regeneron have confirmed a weekly handle breakout within a larger irregular monthly chart double bottom (&quot;W&quot; base). With the smaller consolidation set high inside the larger pattern's base and situated around the mid-pivot, there are multiple reasons to view REGN stock favorably. And notwithstanding a riskier stochastics setup, Regeneron looks well-positioned to continue leading or even surpassing the broader market in 2020 and beyond. Microsoft (MSFT)  Source: Charts by TradingViewMicrosoft -- the world's largest company -- got a bit bigger on the heels of its solid quarterly results. Sure, some might argue that its slower sales growth is a concern. However, you'd be fighting the fact that MSFT stock is still backed by overall strong business trends, as well as burly tendencies on the Microsoft price chart.Technically, Microsoft's correction in 2020 has gone on to form a slightly aggressive &quot;V-shaped&quot; cup on the weekly chart. The good news is that the pattern has demonstrated consistent relative strength. The fact is, MSFT stock bottomed off durable layers of support well above where the broader market found its own corrective low. Furthermore, the steep rally in Microsoft has enjoyed equal bullish determination.Shares of Microsoft have vaulted above and successfully tested the base's 62% retracement level. This compares favorably to the S&P 500. Thus far, the broader market's rally high has been stymied by the same Fibonacci level. There's more too that bodes well for this earnings stock to buy.After this week's minor setback, MSFT stock has pulled back from its earnings-driven handle breakout. Shares are now slightly beneath the consolidation's pivot high of $180.40 by a couple percent. In my estimation, this offers investors a solid-looking &quot;second chance&quot; entry if shares can find their footing over the next couple sessions without compromising the handle's integrity.The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler's observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

2020-05-15,"Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its third fiscal quarter that ended in April, unlike most recent earnings report that reflected results throughout only March. There's no doubt, Cisco felt the turbulence alright. There was a piece of good news due to video conferencing along with being slightly ahead of Wall Street projections, shares rose 2% following the results on Wednesday.Q3 Earnings ReportRevenue of $12 billion fell 8% year-over-year which is the company's worst decline in six years. And the midpoint of its forecast for the next quarter represents an even bigger drop of 9.5%--the worst in more than a decade. But at least both the latest revenue and the forecast ended up being more optimistic than Wall Street. Per-share adjusted earnings of 79 cents confidently exceeded analyst estimates of 71 cents. And the bright side, the closely watched service, and security segments achieved revenue growth in the quarter. As expected, due to imposed-lockdown measures, there was increased usage of WebEx videoconferencing service, an early entrant in the category now popularized by Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM).COVID-19 has emphasized already weak spotsCisco didn't exactly enter the pandemic from a position of strength as it was already dealing with a broad-based slowdown that affected its results during the last couple of quarters. The pandemic has only worsened things further. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE: HPE) is also expected a decline in earnings as a result of lower revenues for its quarter that also ended in April but we will need to wait until May 21st to be able to compare the impact of COVID-19. Supply chain disruptions back in March were surely beyond bad news as HP was counting on a PC market turnaround.And then there is Dell (NYSE: DELL) which will report a week later on its own quest to reach the holy grail of profitability. At least, Dell as well as Lenovo (OTC: LNVGY) both expanded their market shares. Despite the severe disruption, at least they can all look forward that working from home is set to become a permanent feature - they just need to find a way to produce enough to meet the demand!Outlook - medal for bravery!The fact that Cisco was willing to give forecasts is worthy of praise. Most companies have pulled their guidelines and are tiptoeing in an effort to avoid issuing any forecasts. The only brave ones are the businesses that have benefited from the pandemic or from subscription-based software companies that already secured their revenue for this turbulent year. Moreover, consider that Cisco is typically conservative with its projections, the fact that it came out with estimates and despite fairly pessimistic projections, this clearly reflects the company's confidence that won't be going further South. Considering the span and dynamics of this pandemic, Cisco deserves a pat on the back for that!

2020-05-15,"One of the driving forces for innovation and economic growth has been venture capitalist funding. These investors have been critical for fueling breakout companies like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). But venture funding is only for a relatively small number of companies. For other small businesses, equity crowdfunding is a gamechanger.Source: Shutterstock Not surprisingly, few options existed outside of friends and family, banks, and, with a bit of luck, angel investors. During the past decade a new source emerged -- equity crowdfunding. Today, online crowdinvesting portals make it easy to raise small amounts of capital, such as $25,000 to a little higher than $1 million.How does equity crowdfunding and VC funding compare? How do they differ? Here's a look:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFund Structure: On the one hand, a typical VC involves a fund that several partners manage. For their efforts, they will receive an ongoing fee (often 2% of the amount of the fund) and 20% to 25% of the profits.An equity crowdfunding platform, on the other hand, is where many investors pool their dollars to fund a startup. These investors usually do not receive a fee (although, the online platform usually does); instead, their reward is when the stock is sold for a profit (which can be the result of an acquisition or even an initial public offering).""The major tradeoff that businesses who raise using equity crowdfunding instead of Venture Capital -- and traditional angel investing -- is that companies are trading off fewer, higher-dollar value investors like VCs and traditional angels for a larger number of smaller investors in equity crowdfunding,"" said Brian Belley, who is the founder of Crowdwise.  * Read This Before You Invest in Private MarketsMarket Opportunity: For the most part, VCs look for investments that have the potential hitting valutions of $1 billion or more. One reason is that the risks are considerable. In other words, it's often a couple investments that will lead to positive returns for a fund. Because of this, VCs tend to look at markets like technology and biotech, which offer substantial growth opportunities.As for equity crowdfunding, the investments can be really for any type of industry. Some of the investors may not even be interested in making money! Instead, the participation could be more about being a part of something that is fun and exciting. An example would be for a company that makes a game that you would love to play.The Pitch: When you seek money from a VC, you will have several meetings with the partners. And if things go well, you will get a term sheet and then there will be due diligence. Then after all this, the deal should be closed and the money transferred.But equity crowdfunding involves posting a presentation on a website. In fact, the founders of the company may not come even have any contact with many of the investors.Governance: A VC will usually require certain rights, such as to inspect the books or be a part of the board of directors. The partners may even help with recruiting, finding partners and seeking new investors.But with equity crowdfunding investors, there is little involvement in the company. Although, they may still be a powerful source of word-of-mouth.Legal: There are certainly major differences in the securities laws.""All securities offerings must either be registered or fall under an exemption from registration,"" said Ryan Reiffert, who operates the Law Offices of Ryan Reiffert, a boutique business and corporate law practice. ""Now, why do you care about what exemption is being used? Well, the exemption being used can impose certain restrictions on the offering, such as who you can or cannot solicit, accept as an investor, etc. It may also restrict the amount of securities you may offer, the disclosures you are required to make, and much more.""Negotiation: Most VC deals involve extensive negotiation on the terms. Keep in mind that the investor agreements can be long and complicated. But equity crowdfunding is much more standardized and straightforward. But there are usually fewer contractual rights and preferences for the investors.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling. He is also the founder of WebIPO, which was one of the first platforms for public offerings during the 1990s.  As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-05-20,"High-tech stalwart Cisco Systems (CSCO) was one of the first major companies to report results for the fiscal quarter that ended in April. The results posted Wednesday afternoon are more reflective of the impact of Covid-19 than those in other recent earnings calls which only reflected results through March. And the results were grim: Cisco’s revenue for its fiscal third quarter fell 8% year-over-year to about $12 billion, its worst decline in six years. And yet, its per-share adjusted earnings of 79 cents on revenue of $11.98B easily beat analysts’ bleak target of 71 cents. The service and security segments managed modest revenue growth in the quarter. And of course, usage of WebEx videoconferencing, one of Zoom’s (ZM) primary competitors, grew strongly. Cisco’s shares rose 2% following the results.Cisco entered the pandemic from a position of relative weakness. The company has been citing a “broad based slowdown” affecting results for the last couple of quarters, and the pandemic has worsened conditions considerably for corporate tech. Market research firm Gartner revised its global IT spending forecast for the full year, projecting negative 8% growth, against a pre-Coronavirus forecast that called for a 3.4% rise.Cisco said it’s expecting 72 cents to 74 cents in adjusted earnings per share and a 8.5% to 11.5% decline in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. In contrast to Cisco, most companies have declined to issue new guidance, with the exception of businesses that have benefited from the pandemic or subscription-based software companies that already have booked their annual revenue. Analysts are moderately bullish on Cisco, with 12 Buys and 10 Hold recommendations within the last 3 months. The average analyst price target for Cisco is $47, representing upside of 4.5%.

2020-06-01,"(Bloomberg) -- In his quest to expand U.S. mobile broadband capacity, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai hasn’t been afraid to anger colleagues in government.He’s taken on the Pentagon, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as well as the departments of Transportation and Energy. Those agencies have warned that his plans to reallocate spectrum could endanger national security, harm weather forecasts, loosen control of the electrical grid and degrade vehicle safety.So far, Pai has prevailed.“Pai is willing to get himself on the hot seat,” said Doug Brake, telecom policy director for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based policy group that works to accelerate innovation.The fights are worth billions of dollars as industries jockey for rights to airwaves, riding a boom in usage for such things as online shopping, streaming television and social media. Appetite for gadgets and the airwaves on which to run them is only growing: the U.S. will have 1.2 billion mobile connected devices by 2023, up from 560 million in 2018, according to a forecast by Cisco Systems Inc.Pai’s independence may be tested in coming months as President Donald Trump has ordered the FCC to draw up regulations to keep social media companies such as Twitter Inc. from censoring political speech.“This debate is an important one,” Pai said in a statement. “The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”Pai, whose office didn’t reply to requests for comment, has an insiders’ profile that doesn’t suggest a penchant for inter-agency skirmishing. He is a former FCC commissioner, agency staff lawyer and U.S. Senate aide, and before that an attorney for Verizon Communications Inc. President Donald Trump elevated him three years ago to chairman of the commission, which was created in 1934 to keep radio signals straight and now doing the same with wireless broadband.Pai, 47, presents a whimsical public face for an agency steeped in arcane technical policy making. He spices his remarks with pop-culture references, citing the TV sitcom “The Office” and the film “The Big Lebowski.” His Twitter feed branches from telecom policy into philosophy, architecture and sports teams from Kansas City, not far from his childhood home in Parsons, Kansas.As chairman, he has made priorities of pruning regulations and pushing for more mobile broadband to feed the nation’s insatiable appetite. With backing from the agency’s Republican majority, he’s compiled a series of victories for the wireless industry -- and at times setbacks for older uses of airwaves.NOAA, for example, said the FCC’s push to reallocate some spectrum would set back satellite-assisted weather forecasting decades. The Transportation Department warned about road safety when a patch of airwaves set aside for driverless cars was reassigned. The Energy Department opposed taking spectrum used by the power companies.Perhaps most memorably, the Defense Department raised alarms about the FCC’s April 20 approval of a mobile broadband network, saying the service will interfere with military and civilian GPS.Wins and losses are closely linked in airwaves policy because of the nature of spectrum -- the invisible electromagnetic waves that carry communications. Each slice of airwaves can carry one use; a second use on the same frequencies threatens interference, just as a shouted conversation in a room can drown out a quiet chat.To avoid conflicts, regulators including the FCC put different services on separate airwaves. Antennas listen for the chatter on their assigned channels, and don’t pick up signals at higher and lower frequencies, which in turn are left to other users.Assignments, including some set decades ago, have come under question as the mobile broadband revolution deepens, bringing fresh demand for airwaves to handle booming wireless traffic. Old services are being forced to move to different airwaves or share their frequencies with new arrivals.Pai’s FCC has worked to set up frequencies for more Wi-Fi and the high-speed gadgetry that will combine to form the 5G revolution of fast, ubiquitous wireless connections -- a priority for the White House and big tech and telephone companies. The changeover promises such wonders as remote surgery, autonomous cars, rich virtual reality video feeds, and factories humming with connected equipment.Pai takes credit for rearranging a dozen swaths of spectrum. The amount of airwaves affected is more those used by all U.S. mobile broadband providers, Pai said in a video posted on the agency website last year.Friction is inevitable as broadband and other wireless technologies vie for space in the crowded tableau of airwaves swaths, known as bands.“Finding new bands or new opportunities to reallocate for new purposes is more difficult than ever before,” said FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, a Republican. “There’s no greenfields to pick from. And so finding new spectrum for a new purpose means reallocating someone who already exists there.”To others, the FCC’s airwaves fights show lax management by the Trump administration, leaving cabinet officers to push their own airwaves priorities.“This is a result of running the administration as if it were an episode of ‘The Apprentice,’” said Harold Feld, senior vice president with the policy group Public Knowledge. “The federal agencies have just stopped cooperating.”Space Force Commander General John Raymond said in a May 6 congressional hearing that Ligado Networks LLC’s plans for a mobile broadband network would interfere with GPS receivers, which rely on faint signals from satellites, and harm training.The FCC shot back that it wouldn’t be moved by “baseless fear mongering.”In a May 26 letter to Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Pai defended the Ligado decision, saying it “included strict conditions to ensure that GPS operations continue to be protected from harmful interference.”In a teleconference with lawmakers on May 19, Pai said “America needs to lead in 5G and that requires us to think creatively about a variety of different spectrum bands.”Changes keep coming. The FCC in April voted to allow Wi-Fi on the 6 gigahertz airwaves, despite an expression of concern from the Energy Department. Utilities said the change risks interference to electric, water, and gas transmission and distribution systems. Chipmaker Broadcom Inc. called the action “momentous” and “a definitive moment in U.S. wireless history.”Airwaves AuctionMobile providers will get more opportunities in an auction slated to begin in July. Another, potentially larger airwaves sale is to begin Dec. 8 as the FCC offers a wide swath of prime airwaves now used by satellite providers such as Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite providers will move aside, keeping enough frequencies to serve current customers; new users will offer mobile broadband.Bidders may include largest U.S. providers Verizon, AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., who all snapped up airwaves in earlier FCC auctions.“It isn’t easy to get the government to move quickly on anything,” Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, a wireless industry trade group with members including AT&T and Verizon, said in an email. Pai “deserves tremendous credit for making sure wireless providers have the spectrum they need to meet our nation’s 5G ambitions.”Not easy, and not without turmoil. The debate with NOAA concerned power levels for an airwaves swath that Verizon won in an FCC auction. The disagreement persisted for much of 2019 before agencies, working with the State Department, arrived at a unified position. The result was a lower power level than the FCC wanted, and more than NOAA preferred.Bipartisan leaders of both the House Science Committee and the Commerce Committee have asked the Government Accountability Office to probe how the NTIA and other federal agencies interact to resolve spectrum disputes.“‪Under the Trump administration, spectrum coordination efforts have repeatedly failed,” Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the Commerce Committee chairman, said in an email.Representative Greg Walden, of Oregon, the Commerce Committee’s top Republican, in an email said that “not everyone will be satisfied all of the time” as spectrum allocations are made.Others see confusion.“In this administration, instead of having everyone pull in the same direction, we have disputes that are pulling us apart,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, the agency’s senior Democrat.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","FCC Chief Takes On the Pentagon...and DOT, and NOAA, and Energy"

2020-06-03,Zoom Video Inc. on Tuesday managed to assuage the fears of investors that the growth of the popular videoconferencing service would be strong only while people are sheltering in place.,Zoom’s astounding quarter shows it expects to be a force even after workers go back to the office
2020-06-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. demonstrated that paying customers have flocked to its virtual-meeting software, transforming the once-niche appmaker into a popular communications service and positioning it to benefit as the nature of work, school and life is upended.Zoom reported sales soared in the three months ended April 30, when the coronavirus pandemic spurred a wave of stay-at-home orders for millions of people worldwide. The company expects the trend to continue the rest of the year, and projected that revenue and profit will leapfrog investors’ earlier expectations.“A shift in work culture triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic urges corporations to pull forward adoption of cloud-based video-conferencing tools,” Boyoung Kim, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote Tuesday in a note. Zoom’s “intuitive technology and strong brand recognition should help the company pick up market share in video conferencing, outpacing the industry.”Sales in the current quarter will be as much as $500 million, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Revenue in the third and fourth fiscal quarters should be consistent with that performance, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said during a conference call. Overall, Zoom expects to generate as much as $1.8 billion this fiscal year, which is almost triple the size of the business last year. Analysts, on average, estimated $930.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Zoom’s shares jumped 6.6% to $221.80 at 11:44 a.m. Wednesday in New York after closing at a record $208.08 on Tuesday. The stock has tripled this year.Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has tried to ensure that his virtual-meeting platform can cope with a swell of demand from people staying home to curtail the spread of Covid-19. While security and privacy issues plagued the system early in the quarantine, Zoom has become an essential service, attracting more than 300 million participants some days, up from 10 million in December. The software maker allows gatherings of as long as 40 minutes for no charge. While Zoom has attracted more buzz than corporate rivals, the results Tuesday suggested it can attract the paying clients needed to compete against services from Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.The software maker said its potential market has expanded beyond an estimate of $43 billion by 2022 made by analyst IDC, according to a 2019 regulatory filing. And executives said they have expanded hiring plans to take advantage of the opportunity. While Steckelberg warned that the lifting of stay-at-home orders may cause fewer people to use Zoom’s software, the company said it hadn’t seen the numbers decline yet in areas that have reopened.Many educational institutions that teach through Zoom have decided to host virtual classes through at least the fall, pointing to robust demand for the app through the rest of the year. To continue growing at a torrid pace, Zoom will sell its Phone software and Rooms hardware products to existing customers, Steckelberg added. Yuan vowed not to rely on advertising to make money from its legions of free users.In the fiscal first quarter, revenue increased about 170% to $328.2 million. Analysts, on average, expected $203 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was 20 cents a share, compared with analysts’ average projection of 9 cents.The company said its expects adjusted profit in the fiscal year will be $355 million to $380 million, or $1.21 to $1.29 a share. Analysts had estimated 46 cents, just more than Zoom’s earlier forecast. The company has been spending to bolster its network capacity, including by buying cloud-computing services from Oracle Corp. during the pandemic. Zoom also continues to use Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud service, which provided the majority of the new capacity.Zoom’s daily meeting participants have dipped a bit below the blockbuster 300 million figure revealed in April, but Steckelberg said the company expects to consistently surpass that milestone in the future.The company said it ended the quarter with about 265,400 customers with more than 10 employees, a more than fourfold increase from the same period a year earlier. The company now has 769 corporate clients that have spent more than $100,000 on Zoom’s products over the last 12 months, about double from a year earlier.With Zoom’s popularity has come controversy over the company’s security practices. Trolls have invaded myriad meetings, religious gatherings and other events, to share pornography and shout profanity or racial epithets, in a phenomenon known as “Zoombombing.” The company highlighted or created a raft of tools users can employ to prevent the virtual attacks, including passwords and waiting rooms.There also were instances when Zoom calls were routed through servers in China even when no participant was based there and users were unwittingly sending metadata to Facebook Inc. when they signed in. Zoom put an end to both practices. The company pledged to commit to bolstering privacy over all other concerns for three months, purchasing a secure-messaging company, Keybase, to bring the highest standard of encryption to the platform, and hiring cybersecurity experts to guide safety efforts.Corporate clients will get access to Zoom’s end-to-end encryption service now being developed, but Yuan said free users won’t enjoy that level of privacy, which makes it impossible for third parties to decipher communications.“Free users for sure we don’t want to give that because we also want to work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,” Yuan said on the call.(Updates with shares in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Zoom Transforms Hype Into Huge Jump in Sales, Customers"

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. said it’s put more money into efforts to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and now is directing some of its contributions to help tackle systemic racism.The biggest maker of computer networking gear and one of the most cash-rich companies in technology is using part of its Cisco Live technology conference to address the role of companies in tackling social issues. It had previously announced spending $50 million on helping homeless people in Silicon Valley and a further $225 on fighting the effects of the virus. The commitment has now been increased to half a billion dollars, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins has become increasingly vocal in urging technology companies to help solve societal issues that aren’t being dealt with by government. He has said the company won’t cut jobs in the economic downturn and suggested others in the industry do the same.“It is clear to me that our notions of corporate social responsibility, advocacy or even the most recent notion of stakeholder capitalism simply aren’t doing enough to care for our world,” Robbins said in a statement. “The successive battles of Covid-19, the resulting economic contraction and job losses, and our own reckoning with deep-rooted systemic racism and bigotry have brought to light centuries of inequality, injustice, and fragility underpinning our society for far too long.”Robbins said that the typical pattern of corporate donations and declarations of solidarity aren’t enough. Neither is technology itself a solution.The company introduced a number of programs that will take its efforts beyond financial contributions. They include providing expertise and manpower to nonprofit organizations that work with underserved communities, opening Cisco’s medical and other services to those outside its workforce, helping health care and education institutions recover from the crisis and research into technology that can help advance health care and reduce social inequality.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Cisco Spending $500 Million on Covid-19 Relief, Anti-Racism"

2020-06-22,"By now, I'm assuming you've heard about President Trump's plan to jump-start the U.S. economy by spending $1 trillion on an &quot;infrastructure plan.&quot; You really should have heard of it by now... because he's been promising it for about four straight years. But could 2020, with its arrival of a coronavirus and a recession that's cost more than 40 million Americans their jobs, be the year that it finally happens?Maybe.In Rosenblatt's latest report on the subject, analyst Ryan Koontz admits that there have been &quot;years of infrastructure talk from all sides and surprisingly little to show for it.&quot; But he also argues that passing an infrastructure bill, as an economic stimulus measure to get people back to work and help restart the economy, &quot;makes sense&quot; and is &quot;broadly favored in public polling,&quot; suggesting that 2020 could be the year there's enough public support to get such a plan through Congress.Moreover, the infrastructure bill now being mooted in the White House could be about more than just building roads and bridges. In addition to such steel-and-concrete projects, Koontz observes that the White House wants additional spending to accelerate the rollout of 5G wireless networks to form &quot;a meaningful part in the bill.&quot; If this comes to pass, then high-tech firms helping to build the 5G infrastructure could become major beneficiaries of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.Which high-tech companies in particular? Koontz identifies four likely targets: Ciena (CIEN), CommScope (COMM), Ericsson (ERIC), and Nokia (NOK).In Koontz's view, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan could begin accelerating spending on 5G infrastructure as early as next year, and increase spending by internet providers such as AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), and T-Mobile (TMUS) by an average of 30% annually through 2023. This spending would flow to the infrastructure builders (Ciena, et al).In 2020 the scenario Koontz describes, CommScope would probably be the biggest beneficiary in terms of revenue growth, growing its revenues collected from the big telcos by as much as 50% that year alone. Ciena would be second in line, growing revenues perhaps 42%, followed by Ericsson (30% revenue growth) and Nokia (25%). Other networking infrastructure companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Juniper (JNP), and Infineon (IFNNY) would benefit, too, albeit to a lesser extent.As for which of these 5G infrastructure plays Rosenblatt likes best, Koontz leans towards Ciena, which he says has &quot;strong exposure to hyperscale and 5G programs,&quot; is the market leader in optical networking outside of China, and likely to win market share globally as non-Chinese telcos shun use of equipment manufacture by China's Huawei has.Koontz is also impressed with Ciena's recent improvements in profitability. Indeed, over the past five years, operating profit margins at Ciena have more than doubled, from 5.5% to 12.4% (over the last 12 reported months). Applied to a 50% increase in annual revenue ($3.66 billion), this has led to an explosion in profits at Ciena, which topped $321 million over the past 12 months -- versus just $12 million earned in 2015.When you consider furthermore that Ciena's free cash flow for the same period -- $381 million -- is running nearly 20% ahead of reported profits, it's pretty clear why Koontz rates Ciena a &quot;buy&quot; alongside a $64 price target. CIEN's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on an impressive 12 Buy ratings indicating confidence in the stock. Only four analysts rated it a Hold. The average price target of $61 and change implies a 12.5% upside potential from the current share price of $65.

2020-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- The same trends behind soaring stock prices for Amazon.com Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. are benefiting shares in the companies associated with their real estate.Communication towers and data center stocks -- sometimes referred to as “where the internet lives” -- have seen some of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 so far this year as stay-in-place measures to combat the coronavirus have accelerated the demand for digital services and connectivity.Whereas the pandemic has severely hit many commercial property owners, shares in real estate investment trusts related to technology are outperforming. The combined market value gained by just five of those stocks is almost the same as the amount lost by 30 REITs specializing in malls and shopping centers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.“If you’re a real estate investor and your mandate is to own real estate, you’re obviously not doing very well owning offices or owning retail,” Cowen analyst Colby Synesael said in a phone interview.With more people at home, the demands on technology and its infrastructure have been tremendous, whether it’s allowing for online shopping, mobile streaming or working remotely. As a result, certain REITs have emerged as defensive plays for investors, Synesael said.American Tower Corp., Digital Reality Trust Inc., Equinix Inc., Crown Castle International Inc. and SBA Communications Corp. have added roughly $50 billion in total market capitalization this year, and valuations for towers and data centers have never been higher.Data centers, for instance, are trading at a roughly 15% premium to the overall REIT average on a price to estimated adjusted funds from operations basis, according to Berenberg analyst Nate Crossett. Historically they’ve traded at a 7% discount.As a global data center company, Equinix has boasted of its work building out coverage and scale for clients that have gone on to become household names in the work-from-home era including Zoom and Cisco Systems Inc.’s Webex.“Two significant customers of ours is Zoom and Webex -- both of whom obviously saw exceptional increases in their demand as work from home took off,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Meyers said in an interview. “We played a very key role in helping them ramp up their capacity to meet that demand. That was true also in networking cloud providers.”Meyers said it’s difficult to anticipate how much more revenue the company could see over time. In terms of demand, he pointed to recent overall online traffic trends, which surged 25% to 30% over a 30- to 45-day period-- growth that normally would take nine months to a year to achieve.Digital Realty Chief Financial Officer Andy Power said in an interview that the company had seen a pickup in data center demand from clients filling near-term gaps but that longer-term, he was “pleasantly surprised” at how larger enterprises were also taking this moment to plan for the future.“We’re seeing the criticality of our infrastructure playing out front and center while many of our other asset classes [in real estate] are seeing sloping rent,” he said. Even for clients in struggling industries such as travel, the company has seen increased deployments. “Our services are fundamentally mission critical for their businesses. You cannot book an airline ticket or any hotel reservation without the infrastructure we’re essentially providing.”Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch said the need for increased connectivity during the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of digital infrastructure, which is a long-term driver for the stocks.“If you think of everyone on their computers, trying to connect to their workplace and do all these Zoom calls and stream Netflix -- that creates more traffic and the need for power,” she said.Before the virus, shares in tech-related REITs had already been rising, catching the attention of investors, Cowen’s Synesael said.For communication towers, he noted a sea change in 2018 when Vanguard Group began adding towers to its investment portfolio, prompting more investors to do the same ahead of the U.S. rollout of 5G spectrum.Unlike data centers, tower stocks aren’t seeing a fundamental change in earnings from the pandemic, Synesael said. However, they are still benefiting from trends Covid-19 has accelerated like mobile data use, which Synesael expects to continue.Despite their relative premium, Berenberg’s Crossett said that on an absolute basis “there’s still plenty of room to run” for data center stocks.“To the extent that there’s a pullback, I would be adding to these names,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tech-Exposed Real Estate Is Pulling Away From Other Properties

Now the question is…what does the third quarter have in store?We're anticipating the third quarter is going to start in the same way the second quarter ended: with consolidation.This gives us a great opportunity to generate some additional income by selling another covered call against Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCSCO is likely to see strong underlying fundamental strength as the company benefits from increased 5G development and spending around the world, but the growing concerns about COVID-19 in the United States are likely to temper bullish enthusiasm in the short term. Action from the White HouseOne of the global leaders in the 5G race is Huawei, but you might recall the company has been under investigation for participating in Chinese espionage.CSCO has been approached by the U.S. government about purchasing European 5G leaders Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), and though the company doesn't seem interested, it does indicate the government's interest in boosting these tech and communications companies.CSCO has also benefited from its customers' spending sprees at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's video conferencing service WebEx has become more popular because of its security features, something Zoom Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) still struggles with.But that bullish rise may not last. Companies are still reopening even as cases rise, and those that aren't won't be buying any new equipment. CSCO's sales surge was nice, but it probably isn't sustainable.It's also important to remember that investors may not have an appetite for risk right now. Consolidating for the Rest of JulyJust like the S&P 500, CSCO hit its recent high in early June before pulling back into its current consolidation range. The stock has been bouncing back and forth between resistance at $48 and support at $44, and we expect it is going to continue to do so in July.Daily Chart of Cisco Systems (CSCO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewWe would recommend choosing a strike price just above the $48 support level because it is always better to have a buffer in the event of a rise.Because CSCO reports earnings on Aug. 12, we wouldn't recommend holding a covered call longer than a month.

2020-07-09,"Shares of Cisco Systems Inc.  rallied 1.1% in midday trading Thursday, to buck the broad-market selloff, after Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall turned bullish on the networking giant, citing attractive valuation, durable earnings growth and potential tailwinds. The stock was the best performer of the two of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average  components that were gaining ground, as the Dow tumbled 494 points, or 1.9%. Marshall raised the rating to overweight, after being at equal weight since February 2019, and boosted his price target on the stock to $54 from $46. Marshall said Cisco's valuation multiple is at the greatest discount to the S&P 500  in the past 10 years. He believes the &quot;valuation gap&quot; will normalize as Cisco's earnings prove more resilient than investor expectations, driven by strength in public sector and service provider revenue, and as business spending improves as networking and security needs grow. &quot;We are mindful of secular headwinds and broad macro exposure, but think growing networking/security needs, cash flow flexibility and [operating expenditure] discipline provide tailwinds, helping multiple gap close over [the next 12 months],&quot; Marshall wrote in a note to clients.

2020-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- During a series of Cisco Systems Inc. online all-hands meetings on race in early June, some workers posted comments in message channels that other staff and company management said were demeaning to Black people, exposing racial divisions at the Silicon Valley tech giant and leading to the dismissal of a number of people.During the first videoconference on June 1, following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins spoke with Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, who is Black, and Bryan Stevenson, a Black lawyer and author who founded the Equal Justice Initiative, in front of 30,000 employees. The conversations about race continued in subsequent online global staff meetings.“Black lives don’t matter. All lives matter,” one worker wrote in the comments during one of the virtual all-hands meetings, according to screen shots obtained by Bloomberg. Another said the phrase Black Lives Matter “reinforces racism” because it singles out one ethnic group. “People who complain about racism probably have been a racist somewhere else to people from another race or part of systematic oppression in their own community!” a third worker wrote in the chat section visible for all those online.Cisco, the world’s largest networking company, said it fired “a handful” of workers for inappropriate conduct because it “will not tolerate” racism. Bloomberg News wasn’t able to confirm the identities of all the fired workers so chose not to name any of them.Floyd’s death in late May under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer re-energized the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted a nationwide reckoning over the role of race in American life. Many technology companies, including Cisco, responded by affirming their support for equal rights and opportunities for Black Americans, donating to groups leading those efforts and educating their workforces on the struggle for racial equity.Internal BacklashExecutives have publicly positioned themselves against racism, but some workers inside these companies are chafing at the new focus on race. The incident at Cisco is just one example of a company facing an internal backlash to its support for racial justice.The conflict has intensified questions about how these largely forward-thinking companies should manage employees with differing views on race. While Cisco fired some workers, other tech companies facing dissent, such as Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn and HashiCorp Inc., have taken different approaches such as increased employee training. Automaker Toyota Motor Corp. dismissed U.S. workers involved in a video that mocked Floyd’s death.“Employers should be striving for zero tolerance when it comes to racism and discrimination, period,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The protests we’ve seen in the streets have become part of our new normal and will eventually make their way inside workplaces if employers fail to meet the moment.”‘Heartbreaking’Cisco said 237 of 10,400 comments made during the June 1 videoconference objected to what was being presented or disagreed that the meeting should even be taking place. Most of the messages expressed praise for management, making the minority of reactionary posts stand out and sparking responses from other staffers. The posts, written while Robbins was announcing a $5 million donation to groups combating racism, shocked some executives.“I just felt sad to see it,” Francine Katsoudas, Cisco’s executive vice president and chief people officer, said in an interview. “I felt a ton of empathy. I knew that for the African-American and Black employees that were in the meeting, that it was heartbreaking to see that.”After the first meeting, Katsoudas and her team discussed the comments so they could address what went wrong. The following week during a worldwide videoconference with staff, she read some of the most offensive posts and explained what the San Jose, California-based company considered legitimate debate.“You have a framework where red absolutely is crossing the line,” Katsoudas said. “But if someone has a question or they don’t understand something, there’s a way for them to ask that question. We went through and just placed things on that spectrum.” In 2019, 3.8% of Cisco’s U.S. workforce and 2.2% of leaders and people managers were Black, according to the company’s diversity report.“A few” employees who had written some offensive posts during the video meetings sent notes acknowledging their mistakes and said they were learning, Katsoudas said. But the remarks remained seared in the minds of some Black employees, who were shocked by the audacity of the display.“Wow…and these people work at Cisco?” one outraged employee wrote. “If they are bold enough to say those things at work for all to see, imagine what is said behind closed doors.”Several employees said Cisco was guilty of hypocrisy because it wanted to silence those who disagreed with the movement to improve Black lives. “No place for contradictory opinions or feelings,” one wrote. “Wow. This is my first and last comment, then.”LinkedIn, a social network for professionals, also held an all-employee meeting about racism last month that ended up mired in bitterness, an event that was reported earlier by the Daily Beast. The company had an anonymous comment section, which some workers filled with vitriol against Black people. Among the posts were those saying Black people weren’t hired as much because they weren’t qualified; that LinkedIn was trying to foist White guilt on workers; and that law-enforcement killings of Black people weren’t important because more African-Americans were murdered by members of their community.The meeting devastated many Black employees, who were outraged by the remarks and became suspicious of some of their White colleagues, according to people familiar with the situation. Since the meeting, some Black workers at LinkedIn have been angered by what they see as a failure by senior executives to adequately respond to the incident, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the internal communications.Executives at LinkedIn didn’t seek to unmask those making the offensive statements because they had pledged anonymity for the online comments section to create a “safe space” and felt they needed to honor that pledge, a spokeswoman said. LinkedIn’s leaders also suggested the incident was the result of a few bad apples rather than any larger issues with the culture at the Mountain View, California-based company, the people said. LinkedIn has one Black executive in its C-suite, Chief People Officer Teuila Hanson, who joined in June. The company’s workforce is 3.5% Black -- in line with its tech peers -- according to its most recent diversity report.After the meeting, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky said the display was “appalling,” apologized to employees and promised anonymous feedback wouldn’t be allowed in future virtual gatherings.Building AccountabilityThe spokeswoman pointed to other subsequent executive blog posts for the company’s response. Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Melissa Selcher said in June that LinkedIn would redouble efforts to diversify its people managers, teach employees through a companywide curriculum and develop an “accountability framework.”“We will do the hard work to build an anti-racist culture at LinkedIn, hiring and growing employees from under-represented groups and investing in a diverse and inclusive environment where all talent thrives,” Selcher wrote in the post.The company said it has donated $500,000 to the National Urban League, Southern Poverty Law Center, NAACP, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and other groups that work on advocacy and economic justice for the Black community. LinkedIn is also matching employee donations of as much as $15,000 to these types of organizations.The company is soliciting feedback from employees on what it should do next, the people said.Even before Floyd’s death, some tech companies had been forced to deal with contentious internal debate about gender, race and politics. Alphabet Inc.’s Google fired engineer James Damore in 2017 after he wrote a memo claiming the internet company was an ideological echo chamber that discriminated against men in favor of less talented women. Pundits such as Tucker Carlson of Fox News, then-Republican U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher and media outlets including Breitbart News came to Damore’s defense, pointing to the dismissal as an example of the company’s political bias against conservatives.Higher ExpectationsNow, with greater focus on issues facing the African-American community, Black tech workers have higher expectations for their employers. HashiCorp Inc., a software startup valued at more than $5 billion, recently announced a donation pledge to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which gives bail money to low-income people awaiting trial, and the Southern Poverty Law Center in response to protests against policy brutality and racism in May and June. A vocal minority of its 1,000-person workforce complained in memos to human-resources executives, saying the company was supporting “looters and rioters,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Many other staffers told executives in written messages and calls that they wanted HashiCorp to go even further in support of Black lives, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the situation.“Overwhelmingly, our employees have been supportive of the company’s actions and donations of support to the Black Lives Matter movement,” a HashiCorp spokeswoman said in a statement. “We heard from a couple of employees who expressed their disagreement through internal private channels. While we understand that some employees might have differing opinions, we stand by our actions.”As this debate plays out at their workplaces and across the country, some Black tech employees have been left feeling adrift -- unwanted by some colleagues, unsupported by some employers.“We still have work to do as a nation,” one Cisco employee wrote on an internal message board seen by Bloomberg. “I pray my daughters have a better world to live in soon.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Fires Workers for Racial Comments During Diversity Forum

2020-07-31,"Back on June 8, I wrote that Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock may actually be worth a gamble for speculative investors willing to tolerate extreme risk. Since that story was published, NIO stock is up 110%.Source: xiaorui / Shutterstock.com I still believe Nio may have a bright future. But an already risky stock has become even riskier thanks to a bubble in electric vehicles stocks. At this point, I believe NIO stock traders should stay on the sidelines and wait for a better entry point. The Good News For NIO StockThe good news for NIO stock investors is that the company's fundamental outlook has dramatically improved. Nio reported 3,740 vehicle deliveries in June, up 179% from a year ago and 8.8% from May.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio's sales numbers bottomed in February, and its growth story is back in full effect. But most importantly, Nio finally appears to have its financial situation under control. The company raised $428 million in mid-June at just 6.9% dilution to shareholders.  * 10 Gaming Stocks That Will Power Through the New NormalNio finished 2019 with a dangerously low $161.7 million. However, Nio had upped that level to $338.6 million by the end of March. The latest $428 million equity offering and a reported $1.42 billion deal with Hefei City have seemingly eliminated Nio's cash problems until at least 2022, according to Bank of America analyst Ming Hsun Lee.Looking ahead, Lee says the launch of the EC6 electric SUV in the third quarter and a 100kWh battery pack in the first quarter will be further catalysts for the company in the second half of 2020.&quot;We believe NIO's fundamentals have bottomed out, demonstrated by improving volume sales and margin,&quot; Lee says. &quot;It is achieving faster than expected sales channel expansion and strengthening brand equity.&quot; The Problem For Nio InvestorsThe problem with Nio stock is its valuation, and it's not alone. A bubble in EV stocks has pushed the valuations of stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and others to absurd levels. Nio is no exception.One of the deceiving things about stock market bubbles is that they inflate the share prices of good companies right along with the bad companies. High-quality growth stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) were caught up in the dot-com bubble as much as Pets.com and GeoCities.Goldman Sachs is projecting Nio's revenue will grow 80%, 86% and 72% in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Analyst Fei Fang is also projecting 2030 earnings per share of around $2.50 for Nio. That profitability level is a far cry from the $1.44 net EPS loss the company has reported in the past four quarters.However, despite those impressive growth estimates, Fang recently downgraded Nio stock from &quot;hold&quot; to &quot;sell.&quot;&quot;We believe the current share price reflects over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations,&quot; Fang says.Her $7 price target for Nio is based on those very same aggressive projections mentioned above.&quot;Our target P/E multiple of 7.7X is the average of the Chinese OEMs, large cap auto parts makers, and global luxury auto peers for 2020E,&quot; Fang says. How To Play NIO StockThe same story is playing out over and over again with these EV stocks in 2020. Whether it be Tesla, Nikola, Nio or dozens more, analysts are all bullish on the EV growth outlook. But the absurd valuations have their hands tied.Bank of America's Lee, who has such bullish things to say about Nio in the comments above, has a &quot;buy&quot; rating for NIO stock. However, Lee also has just a $7.30 price target, about 44% below the current share price.Personally, I would recommend long-term investors that are bullish on EVs and China and like the Nio story just be patient for now. NIO stock is already down more than 20% from its 2020 high. At some point in the next few quarters, I'm sure investors will get a change to buy the stock much closer to the $7 price targets the analysts have calculated.It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a market bubble. It's especially easy when you are bullish about a company's long-term outlook, like I am with Nio. But whether it be Microsoft in 2000, bitcoin in 2017 or cannabis stocks in 2018, long-term investors are always rewarded for their patience when it comes to buying bubble stocks.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

2020-07-31,"Shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $46.45.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-07-31  * Strike Price: $46.00  * Volume: 1390  * Open Interest: 10253 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way option activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceAlthough the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish option activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 24, 2020  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 16, 2020  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 9, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Technology giants may join the rush to sustainable finance after this week’s record bond sale from Google parent Alphabet Inc. Issuance aligns with growing investor focus on social and environmental matters, and it’s being done at very low rates.“You’re going to see tech companies continue to follow this model,” said Scott Kimball, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages about $100 billion in fixed income assets. “Google is a leader in technology and they were able to raise a lot of money pretty cheap.”Companies from a wide variety of sectors are expected to offer bonds to investors focused on environmental, social and governance themes this year. The tech sector is expected to be a major participant amid growing scrutiny of its social impact given its dominance in the global economy, as well as its focus on renewable energy.Alphabet sold $10 billion of bonds on Monday at record-low rates, including $5.75 billion of sustainability notes -- a corporate record. Investors placed almost $40 billion in orders for the deal, which paid about $4 million in fees to minority-owned underwriters, a sum the company claims was the highest ever.“When Google does something people notice, whether they are in the tech space or not. This will definitely lead to more issuance in the sustainability market, social market and certainly the green market,” said James Rich, senior portfolio manager of sustainable fixed income at Aegon Asset Management, which has about $395 billion in global assets.Big technology companies like Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. or even Facebook Inc. could also look to tap the ESG bond market, according to Kimball, who bought some of the Alphabet bonds and doesn’t have any specific knowledge of a deal from those other companies. Representatives for the three tech firms did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment on debt sale plans.Issuance of social and sustainability bonds, dominated by governments and supranationals, is on track to double to more than $100 billion by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ESG analysts Simone Andrews and Adeline Diab.“Alphabet’s deal certainly sets a new high watermark for anyone to consider coming to the sustainability bond market,” said Jonny Fine, head of investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a lead manager on the Alphabet bond sale, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.“We are getting calls from a very diverse corporate set of issuers wanting to understand more,” Marilyn Ceci, global head of ESG debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an interview Thursday. “You’ll continue to see active participation from corporates globally in the sustainable finance space,” she added. JPMorgan was also a bookrunner on the Alphabet sale.Better PricingAlphabet will use this week’s bond sale to fund organizations that support Black entrepreneurs, businesses impacted by Covid-19, affordable housing and green buildings among others. It hopes to “help develop this new market,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer at Alphabet and Google, wrote in a blog post Monday.“As investors that focus on both financial and impact returns, what is most important to us is that Google has committed to providing impact measurements for the projects that are funded through this issuance,” said Stephen Liberatore, head of the responsible fixed-income strategy team at Nuveen.Alphabet saved about three to five basis points on the funding cost by doing the deal in an ESG format, according to Goldman’s Fine. Borrowers with more debt outstanding could save as much as 15 basis points, he said.Sustainable finance may also become more widespread in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, according to Fine. Pattern Energy Operations LP raised $700 million to help finance sustainable projects last month, the biggest green junk bond sale since 2017, according to according to data compiled by Bloomberg.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Sustainable Finance Sees Big-Tech Boom After Record Google Deal

2020-08-12,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks briefly surpassed the all-time closing high reached before the coronavirus pandemic, propelled by surging technology shares. The dollar weakened and Treasury yields rose to five-week highs.The S&P 500 climbed 1.4%, momentarily topping the 3,386.15 level reached on Feb. 19, and capping the more than 50% rally since the market lows in March. Ten of the benchmark index’s 11 industry sectors rose Wednesday, led by technology, health care and consumer discretionary shares. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed the S&P as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. jumped. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose for a fourth day.“The main force that’s been driving markets the last few weeks has really been momentum,” said Kevin Caron, portfolio manager for Washington Crossing. “We’ve got a market that’s focused on the good case outcome for the virus, we’ve got a market that has taken a great deal of comfort in that fiscal policy is going to be there to support an economy through tough times.”Treasury yields dropped from the highs of the day after the government’s sale of $38 billion in 10-year notes attracted stronger-than-forecast demand.Silver joined gold in rebounding, as investors decided the flight from precious metals driven by advancing bond yields had gone too far.“It was just a matter of time. Once we hit 3,300, I think everybody knew we’d get to the new record before long,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “The question is whether we’ll rally further now that we’ve got it. I think we’ll take a breather now that we’ve reached the new high, which would actually be quite healthy.”After setting a new peak on Friday above $2,070 an ounce, bullion had since tumbled as much as 10%. Crude futures posted a five-month high in New York trading after an industry report pointed to a third straight weekly drop in American crude stockpiles.Elsewhere, Europe’s corporate bond spreads narrowed to their tightest since early March, just a few basis points off pre-virus levels, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index.Here are some key events coming up:Earnings include Tencent, Cisco Systems, Swiss Life, Tui AG.China releases a slew of data for July on Friday, including industrial production and retail sales.These are the main moves in markets:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Stocks Briefly Erase Pandemic Losses; Oil Rallies: Markets Wrap

2020-08-12,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $47.83 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $50.00  * Volume: 5042  * Open Interest: 300163 Indications of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Earnings Scheduled For August 12, 2020  * Earnings Preview for Cisco Systems(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Not all technology stocks are treated equally. While the major companies have led the market off the March lows, much of old tech has stumbled. Another example of this is the price action in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), which is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.All-Time Highs - What Are you Talking About? When looking at the long-term relative performance of Cicso since late 2000, it's horrible. Of course, it took many years for many technologies to recover and make new all-time highs, but Cisco hasn't even come close.From its peak in September of 2000 at $69.63, the best it could do was reach $58.26 in July 2019 and now is quite some distance from that level.Always Beats And Then Gets The Beats: Gong back to the first quarter of 2011, the company has beat for EPS in all but two quarters. It's similar for sales, with only one miss over the same period of time.View more earnings on CSCOOn a few occasions, the issue has rallied, but on most, it has been slammed, certainly not a good sign when it has met or exceeded estimates, which is reflected in its share price. The fickle finger of Wall Street always seems to find something it doesn't like in the report.The Song Remains The Same: After the close on Wednesday, the company announced a fourth-quarter EPS beat of 6 cents along with a sales beat of $434 million. However, the Street is more focused on its lower guidance for Q1, which fell well shy of Street estimates, and sales to be down around 10% year over year.After-Hours Price Action: Traders that chased the headline number got smoked as the issue immediately cleared the major resistance at the $48 area, reaching $48.50 and sharply reversing course. In a matter of minutes, it saw major step-down sellers to the $45 area. It ended the after-hours session at $44.99.Price Action When Being Covered On The Show: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading at $44.80.

2020-08-13,Cisco shares fell over 6% in extended trading Wednesday after the network equipment and software company issued a cautious earnings outlook.,Cisco Tumbles After Soft Q1 Earnings Guidance
2020-08-13,"Shares in Cisco Systems sank more than 6% in extended market trading on Wednesday after the network equipment maker warned about a spending slowdown and forecast fiscal first-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates.The stock dropped to $45 in after-market trading as Cisco (CSCO) forecast current-quarter revenue to decline between 9% and 11% from the same period last year, implying a range of between $11.71 billion and $11.97 billion. The analyst consensus is for $12.25 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings of 69 cents to 71 cents per share, which is below analysts’ estimates of 76 cents.“The pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders, driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery,” said Cisco CEO Charles Robbins. “Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety.”Robbins disclosed that Cisco plans to cut costs by $1 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters.For the fiscal fourth quarter, sales declined 9.5% to $12.15 billion year-on-year, topping estimates of $12.08 billion, as the work-at-home shift drove demand for Cisco’s web security and virtual networking products. In the quarter ended July 25, the company earned an adjusted 80 cents per share in the quarter, exceeding estimates of 74 cents. &quot;We executed well in Q4, delivering strong margins despite the very challenging environment,&quot; said Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer. &quot;Software subscriptions now make up 78% of our software revenue and remaining performance obligations continued to grow strongly in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our portfolio of software and services.”In addition, Cisco announced that Kramer will retire from the company once a replacement is found.Following the earnings results, five-star analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver at Robert W. Baird lowered the stock’s price target to $46 from $48 and maintained a Hold rating saying that he expects overall Cisco growth to remain under pressure as macro headwinds persist. (See Cisco’s stock analysis on TipRanks).“Our $46 price target represents an EV/CY21E FCF of ~12.2x, a discount to peers trading at a median of ~15x,” Ruykhaver wrote in a note to investors. “We see this discount as justified given our expectations for continued macro and secular pressures though believe the multiple could expand if Cisco shows better than expected growth.”Overall, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock’s outlook. The Moderate Buy consensus is divided between 12 Buys and 8 Holds. The $50.38 average price target implies 4.7% upside potential in the coming 12 months.Related News:   Qualcomm Wins US Antitrust Ruling, Lifting Stock Overhang   Logitech Ramps Up Annual Profit Outlook As Q1 Income Leaps 75%   Zoom Video Drops 8% After Salesforce Sells Off Stake More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Argentina, Mexico To Produce AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate   * Piper Sandler Lifts NIO’s PT After 'Solid' 2Q Results   * Facebook, Snap Held Talks To Buy TikTok Rival Dubsmash - Report   * Deutsche Bank Cuts Micron To Hold Amid Lower Memory Pricing Bet",Cisco Drops 6% On Disappointing 1Q Profit Guidance As Spending Slows

2020-08-13,"(Thursday Market Open) Some welcome news on the jobs front might give stocks just enough support today to push them toward another test of record highs. Initial jobless claims last week totaled 963,000, the government said. That's the first time they've been under one million since this crisis began. The number was down a decent amount from the 1.1 million that analysts had been expecting, and might provide more indication that the economy continues to recover. That said, any figure this high would be historically huge in normal times, so we still have a long way to go.Stock indices had been under pressure in pre-market trading ahead of the data but began to trim losses once the number hit the tape. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) sits just below the all-time record high of 3393 and the all-time record close of 3386. Aside from claims, investors might keep an eye on Washington today, where politicians continue to haggle over a possible new stimulus package. If this sounds like a broken record, well, it's been going on for a couple weeks now. Progress looks thin, judging from this morning's media reports. Not much changed overnight, aside from Cisco (CSCO) shares getting beaten up after the company issued a disappointing outlook (see more below). The CSCO weakness might weigh a bit on the Nasdaq (COMP) today. Other than that, jobless claims remain the key story this morning. Crude is unchanged and bonds are down a tick. Overseas, Wednesday brought some tough news for Anglophiles as the British economy plunged into a deep recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell more than 20% in Q2, official data showed. The stock market there dropped 1% Thursday, with shares down across Europe, too. Asia did better, but the Shanghai market has been leveling off after last month's huge rally.Like Deja Vu All Over Again To continue yesterday's baseball analogy, the market always seems to throw a curveball when investors expect a fastball. It definitely felt that way Wednesday. Going into the session, the dominant talk both online and on the news was about a possible rotation out of Tech and into value and cyclical sectors. Then Tech stepped up after the opening bell and left everyone else in its wake. Well, maybe that's an exaggeration. Tech did recover a lot of its losses, helped by Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and the semiconductor stocks regaining their footing, but the other sectors didn't do badly, either. Instead, Wall Street enjoyed an old-fashioned broad-based rally that carried across most of the key parameters. Nearly every S&P 500 sector climbed 1% or more. So-called &quot;defensives,&quot; cyclicals like Energy, bond proxies...you name the sector, it was on the rise. By Wednesday's close, the SPX was right up near its all-time record high close of 3386 posted back in February before you-know-what dominated the headlines. For the record, this has been one very quick comeback from the sudden bear market that occurred in March. If the SPX does set a record high in the coming days, it would shatter the old record of 310 trading days between the previous bull market high and the next bull market high. That record was set in 1967, Barron's noted. As of Wednesday, it's been just 122 trading days since the last bull market high. Yes, folks, we're in a new bull market. That bear market didn't last long, did it? In one exception to the general exuberance Wednesday, Financials lost ground after a strong 10-year auction. This suggests demand for government debt remains elevated, which could ultimately keep a lid on rates. As we've been noting, Financials really face a tough headwind thanks mostly to weak profit outlooks weighed on by low rates. That said, the 10-year yield is sitting above 0.67%, up from lows near 0.5% a week ago. Another cautionary note beyond the Financial pain is that trading volume continues to be lighter than average, possibly a seasonal effect, with some people perhaps taking whatever passes for a vacation these days. Wednesday's rally came despite the two sides in Washington remaining far apart on a stimulus. There hasn't been much headway on this key issue, but the market has been resilient despite that. Maybe to some extent people are assuming it will eventually happen, which means we might see some &quot;sell the fact&quot; pressure if Congress and the White House get together on something. We'll have to wait and see.Don't Forget Key Reason for Rally If nothing else, Wednesday's action shows why some analysts say stocks might continue to be strong despite valuation concerns. One reason for this is the Fed.Unlike, say, in 2016 when rates were at all-time lows and stocks were setting new highs, there isn't that background alarm that the Fed might step in at any time and end the party. That's arguably exactly what the Fed did in 2017-2018 as it raised rates on a regular basis before the market took a beating in Q4 2018. This time, with the pandemic still raging, unemployment in double digits, and economic growth far weaker than even during the slow-growth period of late 2015/early 2016, the Fed has basically committed to keeping its foot off the brake. This can be helpful for all sectors, including defensive ones like Utilities and Staples that tend to do better when rates are low. While the average S&P 500 yield is now back down to around 1.8% from above 2% at the peak of the pandemic selloff, it's still very high vs. the 0.67% yield of 10-year Treasuries. This tends to push many investors into stocks from fixed income. At the same time, the low interest rates can help companies that need to borrow (think Energy). They also can help the housing market, automobile makers, and other manufacturers of big-ticket items by generating more consumer interest as people look to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Only banks truly miss the rate party, but they'd arguably benefit if housing remains firm.And Remember Why Caution Lingers All this doesn't mean the stock market goes straight up or even continues to rally at all. There are a bunch of bearish arguments you could make against stocks right now, mostly having to do with pressure from the China trade dispute, valuations, worries about whether consumers can keep spending if a second stimulus doesn't come around, and, most obviously, the incredible amount of uncertainty about the pandemic. Gold is down the last two days, but it's still above $1,900 an ounce, which shows the caution out there. There's also the election looming less than three months away. That could create more volatility and help steer various sectors in certain directions if one party or the other appears to be pulling away. Though past isn't precedent, defense contractor and big pharma shares have often come under pressure historically when Democrats shine in the polls, while education and alternative energy shares can suffer when Republicans look more likely to be victorious. We'll obviously be talking more about election-related matters as the voting gets closer.All these worries could lead to some potential hedging as investors now see the market back at February levels where it was before the crisis. Arguably, the SPX is a lot more expensive now than it was then, because earnings expectations have come down so far. On that note, Q2 earnings are looking better than analysts had expected but still pretty awful by any historic standards. S&P 500 earnings likely fell 35.2% in Q2, research firm CFRA said Wednesday, which beat its initial pre-earnings estimate for a 45.7% decline. For all of 2020, the firm now sees EPS falling 21.8% vs. the initial estimate of 24.8%, followed by 27.4% earnings growth anticipated in 2021. From a technical standpoint, resistance is seen at the old SPX high of 3393, with support seen between a range of 3212 and 3259, CFRA wrote. The SPX briefly traded above the record closing high of 3386 yesterday but couldn't hold that level.The bias, CFRA said, remains bullish. Still, these kinds of quick recoveries historically are often followed by pullbacks, the firm added. With that in mind, it wouldn't be too shocking to see a drop of 5% to 10% for the SPX at some time in the few months, though history isn't guaranteed to repeat.  CHART OF THE DAY:  BREAK IN THE PATTERN? For weeks, the dollar index ($DXY--candlestick) had been steadily falling while gold (/GC--purple line) soared to new all-time highs. This week changed that, but whether it's a temporary or more permanent shift remains to be seen. As long as economic data continue to show the U.S. economy recovering, that could keep pressure on gold and provide support for the dollar. Data sources: CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange.

Cisco, Lyft Fall After Earnings: The latest earnings news came late Wednesday from Cisco Systems, Inc.  (NASDAQ: CSCO), which beat on earnings and revenue but saw shares get slammed nearly 7%  in pre-market trading after issuing disappointing guidance. It sees fiscal Q1 earnings per share below the Street's estimates and sales down 9% to 11% year over year. Not pretty. Investors generally gave companies a break when they pulled guidance earlier this year, but now seem to be back to punishing firms that disappoint with weak forecasts. With CSCO, the guidance miss is actually a bit concerning because usually they're pretty good at figuring out what's going on and how it might affect their financials. The pandemic might be throwing a lot of companies into confusion. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ: LYFT) shares fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading after the company reported a 61% drop in revenue for Q2 as the pandemic limited demand. Lyft said active riders dropped 60% from a year ago. How to Stop Worrying and &quot;Love&quot; Inflation: The numbers are in and investors are wondering, should they worry about inflation? Not necessarily. Instead, maybe the 0.6% rise in core and headline consumer prices for July sends a different message, one that's more positive. When inflation starts to show up, it often reflects consumers stretching their muscles. Remember, prices took a sharp dive earlier this year with the arrival of the pandemic and the economy coming under pressure. Now they've gone up 0.6% two months in a row. That might sound a little concerning, but the 12-month rise is just 1.6%, well below the Fed's 2% target. Speaking of which, the Fed has made very clear it has no plans to raise rates any time in the near future. Some analysts say no rate increase may come until...wait for it...2025! In normal times, maybe consecutive 0.6% CPI readings might be reason to think the Fed could turn hawkish. Not this time. That's good news for the market not only because it means rates are likely to remain low, but also because if the Fed keeps allowing inflation to grow, retailers and other businesses could possibly see their profits benefit from higher prices. At this point, gasoline and food lead the price increases, the government said. Health care and housing also are more expensive, but airline fares, apparel, motor vehicle insurance, and used cars and truck prices all declined over the past 12 months. Split-Screen: As we suggested might happen, Apple turned out to be a trend setter when it announced its four-for-one stock split a couple of weeks ago. Now it's Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) going five-for-one and seeing shares rise meteorically Wednesday. That raises the question of who might be next. There are plenty of FAANG and other Tech stocks that come to mind, though we won't speculate here. You can probably name a few yourself. Meanwhile, &quot;A&quot; shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) recently traded above $320,000. While a stock split sometimes seems to lift shares (which appeared to happen with AAPL and TSLA), they don't offer much else for current shareholders other than maybe bragging rights about how you owned the stock way back when. However, if you're an options trader and hold shares of a company that's planning a split, there are some things you might want to know about how that works.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-08-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares tumbled Thursday after the company gave a lackluster sales forecast, signaling that businesses are spending less in the pandemic-driven recession.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins pledged to reduce expenses by $1 billion through a reorganization that will include job cuts and early retirement for some workers. The plan will cost about $900 million, which will include severance and other “termination benefits,” the company said in a regulatory filing. Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer is also leaving.Revenue will fall 9% to 11% from a year earlier in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in late October, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average had projected a decline of about 7%. Adjusted profit will be 69 cents to 71 cents a share, lower than Wall Street expectations of 76 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Cisco shares fell 11% to $42.88 in trading Thursday in New York.Analysts were broadly disappointed by the news, with Cowen writing that the results and outlook “were at best uninspiring and at worst raise some concern.” However, the longer-term view was more positive. Multiple firms cited Cisco’s dividend and valuation as factors that would limit much additional downside risk, and the narrative in 2021 “could get materially better,” according to Evercore ISI.A large chunk of Cisco’s revenue comes from government agencies, small and medium-sized businesses and providers of internet and online video services. While some larger companies are still spending, many smaller customers have cut spending to adjust to an economic slowdown sparked by Covid-19 lockdowns.In Cisco’s Americas region, where sales dropped 12%, demand hasn’t improved in the last 90 days and the U.S. needs Congress to provide another stimulus package, Robbins said in an interview.“As you move down the customer stack, things just get weaker and weaker as the customers get smaller and smaller because they just don’t have the financial wherewithal,” he said. “This country is still driven by small and medium-sized business for hiring and everything else. I’m concerned about what happens next.”Robbins said that optimism about a rebound in tech company earnings has been stoked by consumer demand in certain areas. But major investments in corporate infrastructure will require more evidence of an improving economy, he cautioned.Robbins is trying to reduce Cisco’s reliance on expensive proprietary hardware and increase sales of software and services. After returning to growth in 2018, revenue has started to decline again this year, showing how Cisco’s business is still exposed to economic cycles.Cisco said net income in the fiscal fourth-quarter rose to $2.6 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $12.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 80 cents a share. Analysts were looking for profit of 74 cents on revenue of $12.1 billion.Infrastructure platforms, its hardware business and main source of revenue, suffered a 16% sales drop to $6.6 billion. Applications, the software business, saw revenue fall 9%, while security-related sales increased 10%.(Updates share price in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Tumbles After Weak Forecast Shows Recession Biting

2020-08-13,"Over the past three months, shares of Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) fell by 0.93%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Cisco Systems has.Cisco Systems's Debt Based on Cisco Systems's financial statement as of May 18, 2020, long-term debt is at $11.58 billion and current debt is at $4.51 billion, amounting to $16.08 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $10.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $5.72 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Cisco Systems has $91.39 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Cisco Systems Q4 Earnings  * Understanding Cisco Systems's Unusual Options Activity  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Dow Jones Stocks to Trade: Cisco Systems (CSCO)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCisco Systems announced its results Wednesday evening. A profit beat of 6 cents on earnings of 80 cents was easily swept under the carpet in favor of a weakening revenue trend compounded by management's sales warning for the upcoming fourth quarter.Technically, a bearish drop just over 11% has provided pattern confirmation for a downward-sloping resistance line seen on the provided monthly chart. The price action also marked a second breach of a steeper uptrend dating back to 2016 and shares are now signaling a bearish stochastics crossover.The observation is Cisco could revisit its March bottom and Fibonacci zone support from roughly $28 - $33 before all is said and done. The October $40 / $37.5 put spread priced for 55 cents is a favored way to gain limited and reduced bearish exposure to CSCO stock. Chevron (CVX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCVX joins the other standout Dow Jones stocks to trade after the company reported a worse-than-forecast loss of $8.3 billion and much weaker than expected sales of $13.49. Could it get any worse for the energy giant? Maybe.Reduced guidance from Chevron's management tied to a still challenging Covid-19 driven operating environment suggests that the company isn't out of the woods. But investors have managed, albeit ever so modestly, to see things differently in a bullish sort of way.Technically, and in the wake of the report, CVX stock rallied just enough to narrowly confirm a corrective pullback of 21%.Admittedly, it's easier to appreciate a more visible bearish topping candle put together in June and bearish price action in 2020, which overall has a rather slippery look to it. But it's fair to say and see there's been a lot of deep technical testing supportive of being upbeat, like only a contrarian can be.  * 7 of the Smartest ETFs to Buy Right Now Unlike management's warning to Wall Street, I'd simply urge investors to use a collar strategy for stronger risk-adjusted positioning in this Dow Jones stock to trade. Intel (INTC)  Source: Charts by TradingViewIntel, the world's largest semiconductor company by revenues, topped profit and sales views roughly three weeks ago. But a six-month delay for its 7-nanometer chips has put the company further behind competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This led INTC stock investors to drive the stock down 16.24%.Now, INTC stock is stationed at what should prove a major inflection point. On the one hand, shares have confirmed a weekly chart test its former highs from 2000. Stochastics is also on the cusp of a bullish stochastics crossover within oversold territory. Furthermore, shares remain positioned above the chart's 2015 and 2009 uptrend lines.Alternatively, a failure to hold this week's inside doji pattern low could be the beginning of a larger correction, where both trend-lines are at risk. With Intel facing company-specific problems on top of more universal Covid-19 issues, I'd say buying a weekly bottom has technical grounds. However, accumulating on weakness is another matter.For the time being, a long Sept $50 / $52.50 call vertical for 75 cents looks like an acceptable risk-to-reward trade-off for bullish investors.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

2020-08-21,"Since the equity markets hit a bottom in March, the bull run has been the strongest since the Great Depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. But sustaining this will not be easy. If anything, it's probably a good idea to consider safe stocks to buy for your portfolio.One of the risks for the markets is the upcoming election. With the novel coronavirus, there will be a much larger portion of the population that will vote by mail -- and this could easily delay the results. The uncertainty could mean a spike in volatility. In fact, this happened during the election in 2000.Next, there are signs of frothiness. Many tech stocks and IPOs have seen parabolic moves on the upside. Perhaps the most notable example of the exuberance is when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock jumped because of an announcement of a stock split. Keep in mind that this kind of market action was common during the later stages of the dot-com boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd finally, there are signs that the economic recovery has stalled out. The lack of a stimulus agreement will also likely weigh on growth.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now OK then, in light of all this, what are some of the safe stocks to buy now? Well, here's a look at seven:  * Visa (NYSE:V)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Safe Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa's future still looks bright. It certainly helps that the company has built a powerful platform with significant barriers to entry and network effects.It's true that the pandemic has weighed on the company. In the latest quarter, earnings dropped by 23% and payments volume was off by 10%. A big reason for this was the steep fall in travel activity. But keep in mind that Visa has been able to offset some of this through improvements in other parts of the business.For example, the volume of activity for card-not-present transactions -- such as for those online -- jumped by 25% each week since the start of April. This is a doubling of the growth rate compared to before the pandemic. For the first half of this year, Visa issued over than 80 million contactless cards in the U.S.In the meantime, the company has been paring back its expenses. This has been largely due to lower spending on advertising and marketing.Visa has also been investing aggressively in fintech technologies. Earlier in the year, the company shelled out $5.3 billion for Plaid, which is a top integration platform for connecting to third-party financial systems. And with V stock fetching a valuation of $450 billion and a hefty cash balance, there is plenty of resources to continue the deal-making. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com When it comes to safe stocks to buy, Coca-Cola has the essential factors. The company's moat includes over 500 strong brands and thousands of different products. There is also a massive distribution footprint in over 200 countries. Consider that Coca-Cola provides over 1.9 billion servings a day of its beverages.Although, the company has definitely not been immune from the impact of the pandemic. Of course, there has been a fall-off in business from restaurants, theaters and stadiums.But for the latest quarter, Coca-Cola's management did indicate that it appeared that the worst was over. There was also talk to accelerate the transformation efforts of the company, such as with increased investments in digital technology and even artificial intelligence.Another advantage of KO stock is the dividend. There has been an increase for 58 straight years. Safe Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com The healthcare industry definitely has many safe stocks to buy. The industry continues to grow and there are long-term secular trends like the aging of populations across the globe.One of the safest healthcare stocks is Johnson & Johnson, which has been around since 1886. The company's platform is massive and covers the main categories of healthcare:  * Consumer: These are personal, beauty, oral care and wound products. Some of the brands include Aveeno, Sudafed, Nicorette, Neutrogena, Listerine and Pepcid.  * Pharmaceuticals: They cover areas like immunology, infectious diseases, oncology and pulmonary hypertension.  * Medical Devices: The products are for surgery, eye health and orthopaedic procedures.Last month, JNJ started its first human clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine and the plan is to have a large Phase 3 trial in September. The company has invested in its infrastructure to be able to manufacture as much as 1 billion doses for next year.Something else: With relatively stable cash flows, JNJ stock has been a solid dividend payer, with the current yield at 2.7%. The company has increased its dividend payout for 57 consecutive years. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The tech sector has plenty of safe stocks to buy. But there's a problem: The valuations have gotten a bit excessive.Yet there are still some interesting value plays, such as Cisco Systems. The stock recent took a hit because of the delays in sales due to the pandemic.  But the result is that the valuation is much more reasonable, with the price-earnings ratio at 16x. The dividend on CSCO stock is also at 3.3%, which is one of the highest for the tech industry.Note that the company is taking swift action to reduce its cost structure. The goal is to realize savings of $1 billion. But Cisco is also looking at ways to increase its growth.To this end, the company expects to ramp up its research and development on cloud computing as well as security solutions. CSCO is also seeing a spike in interest in Webex, which is a leading video conferencing platform. According to Cisco CEO Charles Robbins: &quot;We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions.&quot; Safe Stocks to Buy: Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com In January, Nike appointed John Donahoe as CEO. Prior to this, he was the CEO of tech companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Nike's move was another indication of why the company has been so successful -- that is, it is always looking for ways to innovate and be creative. And by selecting Donahoe, there was a clear sign that digital transformation would be critical for the future.And yes, Nike has already benefited from this expertise. When the coronavirus hit, Donahoe acted swiftly to bolster the company's e-commerce platform. The result has been that -- during the latest quarter -- there was a 75% spike in the business.True, there was still an overall drop in the sales. But the e-commerce sales did soften the blow. Besides, another key advantage for NKE stock is its highly valuable brand. Its icon swoosh is recognized across the globe and commands premium pricing. As Donahoe said on the latest earnings call: &quot;Nike's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers, amid a global shift toward health and wellness.&quot; McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com When Ray Kroc came on board McDonald's in 1954, he had big plans. He set out to transform the restaurant industry and be the leader in the emerging fast-food category. And it did not take him long to do this.Fast forward to today: McDonald's has over 36,000 locations across more than 100 countries.Building this empire has included a variety of innovative strategies, such as with creating an efficient process for cooking food, coming up with creative menu items and keeping costs low. But the company has also been smart with its business model, such as by relying on franchises.While the pandemic has depressed sales -- which has been the case throughout the restaurant industry -- MCD has been finding ways to deal with the challenges. The company has been able to quickly make operational changes to its chain of locations, say with safety measures, new menus and contactless systems. There has also been material improvements to the speed of service for the drive-thru business. During this period, customer satisfaction has actually increased.Then again, McDonald's has the benefit of a trusted brand as well as a rock-solid balance sheet. There is also an attractive dividend. Note that the yield on MCD stock is roughly 2.4%. Safe Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Verizon is the No. 1 mobile carrier in the United States, with 119.9 million subscribers. And even with the pandemic, the company has continued to grow its base. In the latest quarter, VZ added roughly 173,000 postpaid phone connections. Then again, for millions of people, their smartphone has become a necessity.But in the next few years, VZ should benefit from the megatrend of 5G. This technology will supercharge the speeds of mobile networks -- spurring the creation of innovative apps for consumers and businesses. Technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things will become more pervasive.To capitalize on this, VZ has recently acquired Blue Jeans Network, which operates a videoconferencing platform. Of course, this market has seen a surge in growth because of the pandemic. But 5G will be another important catalyst.VZ stock is currently trading at attractive levels as the price-earnings ratio is at 12.7x and the dividend is at 4%. The company also has a reasonable debt load and continues to crank out strong cash flows, which have come to nearly $16 billion for the past year.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

2020-08-25,News Summary:,Cisco Announces Intent To Acquire BabbleLabs To Improve Video Meeting Experience
2020-08-26,"Cisco (CSCO) has announced its intent to acquire privately held BabbleLabs, to help users control unwanted noise in meetings.BabbleLabs uses advanced AI techniques to distinguish human speech from unwanted noise, enhancing the quality of communications and conferencing applications.According to Cisco, BabbleLabs goes beyond existing solutions by distinguishing speech from background noise; removing background noise in real-time; and enhancing the voice to elevate communication, regardless of language.Indeed, Cisco’s survey showed that 98% of workers experience frustration from distractions during video meetings when working from home. Two of the top 5 frustrations called out are about background noise.With BabbleLabs, Cisco says it will bring native noise removal capability to its entire Collaboration portfolio, although first it will focus on bringing BabbleLabs to Webex Meetings.The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of Cisco’s FY21, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon completion, the BabbleLabs team will join the Cisco Collaboration Group, which is part of the Cisco Security and Applications Business.Shares in Cisco have dropped 12% year-to-date, and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock’s outlook. That’s with a $50.50 average analyst price target, indicating 20% upside potential from current levels.Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron recently reiterated his Cisco buy rating with a $50 price target. He made the call after Cisco reported 4QFY20 results that came slightly ahead of the Street; however, guidance for 1QFY21 was below consensus.“COVID-19 has made for a challenging spending environment, yet it has also caught Cisco unprepared for an acceleration in the shift to cloud/ work-from-home” the analyst commented.  Specifically, legacy portions of Cisco’s portfolio are under pressure (VoIP, DC) whereas growth areas (Webex, AppDynamics) remain too small and face competitive challenges.According to Kidron, a more aggressive M&A approach is needed to address product gaps. “What keeps us engaged is Cisco’s aggressive cost-cutting measures, software/subscription traction, strong BS ($11.8B), and easier upcoming comps” the analyst concluded.

2020-08-27,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved down to $42.21 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $36.00  * Volume: 941  * Open Interest: 43913 Signs of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * What Does Cisco's Debt Look Like?  * Recap: Cisco Systems Q4 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-28,"There is no end in sight to the ongoing pandemic, especially in the United States. Even if daily infection rates fall, the flu season and the cold weather will drive people to stay indoors more often, causing the virus to spread more quickly. To mitigate the virus' spread, companies will continue to have their employees work from home if at all possible. As schools re-open, small outbreaks among students will increase the need for remote teaching. As a result of these trends,  Zoom Communications' (NASDAQ:ZM) subscriptions will rise, providing a positive catalyst for ZM stock.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Recently, the shares reached a new high of $302, and their trailing price-earnings ratio now exceeds 1,700. But, anticipating a sharp increase in Zoom's revenue and profits, driven by higher demand in many facets of society,  markets are pricing in the company's future value. More Video MeetingsThe number of Zoom's corporate customers that had more than ten  employees soared 354% in the first quarter.  Overall usage of the system increased impressively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor example, the peak number of daily meeting participants (including those who are paying for the service and those who are not) soared by 300 million, and the company often benefited from similar user-growth levels.On the company's Q1 earnings conference call, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan reported that individuals who join multiple meetings in a day are counted as multiple users. For example, he noted that an individual who joins five meetings in one day on Zoom would be counted as five separate users.  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run But investors cannot deny that the company looks poised to generate very strong revenue growth. Zoom's sales soared 169% year-over-year to $328 million amid the growing demand for its service by companies and organizations. At the end of Q1, the number of Zoom's customers that were  generating over $100,000 of annual recurring revenue had jumped by 500 year-over-year. Higher CostsIn Q1, Zoom gave a one-time bonus to its employees who are not paid based on commissions. As a result,  Zoom will benefit from higher staff satisfaction.Also pushing up the company's costs was its increased use of  the public cloud. Its leverage of the cloud allowed it to increase its capacity and meet unprecedented demand. As it increases the capacity of its own data centers, its costs per user will drop, lifting its gross margin back to the mid-70% range within a few quarters.Zoom's research and development costs rose 66% year-over-year to $21 million. With ZM stock continuing to climb, shareholders are rewarding the company for investing in its business.But Zoom needs to make its product more secure. In consultation with top IT security firms, it must develop ways of protecting its customers from eavesdroppers. OutlookZoom forecast non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.21 - $1.29, so its forward P/E ratio is over 230 times Based on the five-year discounted cash-flow-revenue-exit model below,  ZM stock has a fair value of over $400:Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 12.0% - 10.0% 11.00% Terminal Revenue Multiple 15.0x - 10.0x 12.0x Fair Value $501.48 - $368.34 $421.12 The data was obtained from finbox.The average price target of Wall street analysts is bearish, coming in at under $240.00, according to  Tipranks. That price target might be justified if investors cared more about valuations at this point.But it is important to note that the launch of a coronavirus vaccine would slow the work- from-home trend. Also, a permanent drop in new infections in the U.S. would cause the current restrictions on business travel and offices to ease. Both of theevents would hurt Zoom's profitability. The Bottom LineZoom is at the heart of online communications. Despite competing video-chat options from Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) Webex and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams, Zoom has become a household name. Its high brand recognition gives it an edge over the competition.The valuation of ZM stock is unfavorable, but the shares are still compelling for traders.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It also addresses corner cases such as beer and liquor sales, where a whole different set of tax rules apply.For many quarters, Avalara was riding a 2018 Supreme Court decision that made it far easier for states to collect taxes online. Businesses had to spend on software to get their systems ready before states started penalizing firms that didn't comply.However, things have accelerated to a whole new level in 2020. As you probably know, companies like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) have exploded in popularity this year. With folks stuck at home, all sorts of new businesses are emerging in various e-commerce niches. And those new entrepreneurs end up having to pay sales tax, just like everyone else.Avalara is built right into Shopify, and thus is positioned to ride along as Shopify soars. AVLR stock is up nicely this year, but it's not up anywhere as much as Etsy or Shopify … yet. Duck Creek Technologies (DCT)Source: Shutterstock Take that same basic idea as Avalara, but apply it to insurance instead of sales tax, and voila! You now have Duck Creek Technologies.The company is probably unfamiliar to most readers, as it just launched its initial public offering (IPO) last month. However, with more than $200 million in annual revenue, Duck Creek is already a decent-size business.Now, Duck Creek Technologies isn't a screaming value stock at this price, I'll grant you that. 22 times sales isn't a great multiple by any means. However, revenue growth is in the mid-20 percent range and has been accelerating nicely in recent quarters.The company is transitioning from one-time sales to subscription revenues; that's a tried and true method to strong earnings growth in the software space. And the company is already solidly cash flow positive, and not far from achieving profitability either.Additionally, shares have come down nicely since the recent tech sell-off. In fact, DCT stock hit its lowest point in its brief trading history last Friday, as shares dipped to $37, well off the recent $44 peak. The stock IPO'd at $27, so it's not all that far above the original offer price, either.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America Reopens I love these software-as-a-service stocks with big niches and long growth runways. Global insurance is a huge market, and one where a software company should be able to build a large moat to keep out the competition. ZoomInfo (ZI)Source: Shutterstock ZoomInfo is an enterprise software-as-a-service company targeting the information and marketing verticals. I covered the stock back in June, saying it offered significant promise. However, as is usually the case around fresh IPOs, there were concerns about the valuation.In this case, it's well worth revisiting ZI stock now. Shares are down 50% from their post-IPO peak, and just hit their lowest levels ever in last week's tech sell-off. If you thought ZoomInfo was interesting at $50, it could be quite the steal down here at $33.That's because while the market will always be volatile day-to-day, the demand for key data isn't going anywhere. As marketing goes digital, ZoomInfo's databases of sales and contact information will only become more valuable to advertisers and sales representatives. The company demonstrated that in its most recent quarterly results, with revenues up 62%.The tech sell-off is creating a big opportunity to enter stocks like ZoomInfo at their lowest levels of the summer. If you're bullish on the tech space into 2021, these sorts of plays should pay off nicely in coming months. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com While there are a few expensive stocks on this list, Cisco should appeal to value fans. That's right, even in 2020, there are some cheap Nasdaq stocks to buy out there. CSCO is selling at just 13x forward earnings. It's also one of the few tech names selling closer to 52-week lows than 52-week highs.Some of that pessimism may be justified. A lot of networking gear orders that would have happened this year have been delayed into 2021 thanks to the pandemic slashing budgets. Hardware sales have suffered in comparison to cloud services that can often be sold without in-person contact.Still, the long-term need for new and upgraded networking equipment isn't going anywhere. Meanwhile Cisco's transition toward subscriptions and recurring revenues continues at a respectable speed.We've seen plenty of other tech stocks blast off once the market realizes that the quality of revenues has gone up. If and when Cisco demonstrates a similar move to a stickier sales model, it could enjoy a similar boost.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America Reopens In the meantime, CSCO stock is cheap and offers a juicy 3.5% dividend yield. Datadog (DDOG)Source: Shutterstock Cisco was a player in our next pick as well. When Datadog was launching its IPO last year, Cisco reportedly offered $7 billion to acquire the company. Instead, the data and security monitoring company chose to go it alone, in a decision that has been exceedingly profitable for its shareholders. The pandemic has only intensified the secular trend toward storing everything in the cloud, and thus, intensified the need for robust security and monitoring of said infrastructure.Datadog has fetched a huge multiple from the market, as it now trades for around 50 times revenue. The market cap is now up to $24 billion, leaving Cisco's offer in the dust.Still, for investors that are taking the long view toward cloud stocks, there's a play in DDOG stock here. Since July, shares have slid 20%, making the price more palatable. While Datadog is still highly valued, it may well be worth the sticker price given the 68% revenue growth rate and 106% earnings growth. Costco (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com While the Nasdaq is known for technology companies, you can find a variety of other attractive businesses on the exchange as well. Take Costco, for example.Even before the novel coronavirus, Costco was on a roll. And this year, it's gone on to even greater heights.You probably don't need me to tell you, but the pandemic has obviously boosted Costco's standing in the world of retail. With so many businesses shut down, essential stores became a lifeline for worried consumers looking to stockpile before hunkering down at home. Costco's no-frills, buy-in-bulk approach perfectly met the needs of the crisis. Going forward, the company's already higher membership renewal rates should move up even more.The obvious gripe with COST stock is that it's expensive, as it currently sells at 36 times earnings. But I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that analysts may be missing the inflection point here.Consider this: Over the past five years, Costco grew earnings at 11% per year. Now, going forward, analysts only see 6% annual growth over the next five years.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America Reopens But does it really seem likely that Costco's earnings growth will slump after it proved itself so adept during the recent crisis? I'd bet that analysts will have to raise their price targets and earnings outlook as Costco's dominance of big box retail only further consolidates. Nasdaq (NDAQ)Source: Shutterstock An obvious choice to round out a list of Nasdaq stocks to buy is the Nasdaq stock exchange itself. If you're bullish on innovative companies such as those listed above, then it only makes sense to own shares in the company facilitating all this trading.The Nasdaq is riding several powerful waves right now. Higher share prices and trading volumes push up the amount of fees and revenues that the exchange can bring in. Its data sales division -- which is an increasingly important part of the overall mix -- also benefits from a rising tide. More hedge funds and traders are willing to pay for proprietary information in a volatile fast-moving market like this one.There are also corporate actions as well. The Nasdaq earns money every time a new company launches an IPO, a secondary stock offering or other such corporate actions. It also offers services and software that serve to aid its other lines of business. All-in-all, NDAQ stock has many ways to grow, and most of them benefit from the current bull market for tech stocks.Meanwhile, Nasdaq is selling at just 22 times forward earnings. That's pretty incredible for a business that has grown earnings at 14%/year in recent years. In Nasdaq, you can benefit from the hyper-growth in the digital economy without paying a nosebleed price.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held long positions in NDAQ, AVLR stock.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-09-16,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $40.58 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-06-18  * Strike Price: $35.00  * Volume: 550  * Open Interest: 12745Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Understanding Cisco Systems's Unusual Options Activity  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Cisco Systems  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. ban on Huawei Technologies Co. was supposed to hand leadership of the lucrative market for wireless base stations to Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj. It’s not working out that way.The crackdown on China’s largest technology company has given startups such as Altiostar Networks Inc. and new entrants including Qualcomm Inc. a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the $35 billion the telecom industry spends each year on this crucial part of mobile phone networks.“This could break up that tech vendor lock-in that’s been around for decades,” said Andre Fuetsch, chief technology officer of network services at AT&T Inc., the third largest U.S. wireless carrier. “It’s about how do you create a much more competitive, innovative ecosystem.”Base stations are the heart of cellular networks, powering millions of antennas that perch on cell towers and city rooftops all over the world. Until recently, these boxes were a proprietary combination of processors and software that had to be purchased all at once. Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia account for three quarters of this market, which is worth as much as $35 billion a year, according to researcher Dell’Oro Group.Open radio access network, or O-RAN, changes this by creating an open standard for base station design and ensuring all the software and components work well together -- no matter who is supplying the ingredients.This is a potentially radical shift. When telecom giants such as AT&T and China Mobile Ltd. want to expand their network they usually have to call their existing supplier and order more of the same because a box from Nokia won’t work with one from Ericsson. The new technology lets wireless carriers mix and match more easily.The initiative also means that new suppliers can succeed by focusing on one or two components, or a single piece of software, rather than spending lots of time and money building a whole base station from the ground up.O-RAN gear has been used sparingly since an industry alliance was formed to promote the technology in 2018. But when the U.S. toughened its stance against Huawei last year and encouraged other countries to crack down, interest in O-RAN adoption increased. The Chinese tech giant is a low-cost provider. Now it’s unavailable in some markets, carriers are more willing to look at alternative suppliers embracing the more flexible O-RAN approach.“Increased geopolitical uncertainty is helping them to get an invite to the table they would not normally have had,” Dell’Oro Group analyst Stefan Pongratz said. “Multiple vendors, not just in Europe but across the world, are basically reassessing their exposure to Huawei.”How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeOpen standard base stations will generate sales of about $5 billion in the next five years, more than originally predicted, according to Dell’Oro.Ericsson questions the performance and cost-efficiency of current O-RAN offerings. But the telecom companies, who decide where the money is spent, aren’t being shy about telling incumbent providers to get on board or risk being left behind.“We’ve been candid with them: This is the architecture that the operator community is pursuing,” said Adam Koeppe, who oversees technology strategy, architecture and planning at Verizon Communications Inc., the biggest U.S. wireless carrier.The list of companies vying to fill the gap left by Huawei is a mixture of some of the oldest names in technology and newcomers. Qualcomm, Intel Corp., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. are offering various parts of the new base station technology. Startups such as Altiostar, Airspan Networks and Mavenir Systems are trying to carve out niches, too.O-RAN proponents point to the success of Rakuten Inc., a Japanese e-commerce provider that has used the technology to break into mobile phone services. The company began 4G wireless service in April and is upgrading to 5G now, using O-RAN suppliers including NEC, Qualcomm, Intel, Altiostar and Airspan. Rakuten said using this more open approach has cut capital expenditure by 40% and reduced operating costs 30%.Dish Network Corp. is building a 5G wireless network in the U.S. with help from Altiostar. New projects like this are great, but the real opportunity is with operators that are shifting their existing networks to O-RAN, according to Thierry Maupilé, Altiostar’s executive vice president of strategy and product management. The Tewksbury, Massachusetts-based company has raised more than $300 million from investors such as Rakuten, Qualcomm and Cisco.Why 5G Mobile Is Arriving With a Subplot of Espionage: QuickTakeO-RAN is part of a broader push to make all kinds of computer networks more flexible and easy to control. By standardizing hardware and using more software in centralized data centers, companies can run networks more cheaply, while fixing and upgrading them more easily. 5G will need this flexibility to work well.For AT&T, the new approach has already started to help. The company has introduced Samsung equipment based on O-RAN in areas where it had previously been limited to Ericsson gear, AT&T’s Fuetsch said.Nokia expects to have a full range of O-RAN offerings available in 2021. Some of the final standards aren’t yet set and they need to be completed and tested which will take time, according to Sandro Tavares, global head of marketing.“O-RAN is supported by more than 20 major operators around the world, so it is pretty clear that there is a strong push for it to happen,” he said. “This is a big move for our industry, and it is clear for the main players that we should not be cutting corners in this process.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Huawei Ban Spurs New Competition for Ericsson, Nokia"
2020-09-18,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been very strong during the pandemic. Based on factors including cash flows and continued growth in core businesses, it's logical that MSFT stock has performed pretty well.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Still, the company recently suffered a few setbacks. The recent market correction took shares from $230 down to near $200 in the span of a week. So while most spectators remain bullish on the company in the long term, trepidation is still there. Investors want to know if further corrections will pull shares down again. CEO Satya Nadella has presided over a period in which MSFT stock has risen several fold. His tenure has been nothing short of stellar from that perspective. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough the company's recent failure to acquire TikTok will only fuel negative speculation, these minor setbacks don't make Microsoft a sell by any means. TikTok and MSFT StockMicrosoft has been bold in its acquisition strategy under Satya Nadella. The company purchased LinkedIn, GitHub, and Mojang AB which owns the game &quot;Minecraft&quot; during Nadella's tenure.  * 20 Election Stocks to Buy if Joe Biden Wins in 2020 TikTok has instead chosen to partner with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). It could be argued that this is a loss simply because Microsoft's competitor won out contract negotiations. Yet, some Microsoft owners see upside to the conclusion. &quot;I'm actually relieved that they didn't win it,&quot; said Jensen Investment Management portfolio manager Kevin Walkush. &quot;I think it would have added complexity to the business.&quot;Jensen Investment Management controls 4 million MSFT shares.  MSFT Stock Dividend IncreaseMicrosoft just announced that it will increase its dividend to 56 cents. The dividend will be paid on Dec. 10, and represents a 10% increase over its prior payment. The company has undertaken a continuous dividend increase since 2004. The increased dividend should serve to pull more conservative investment capital into the company. This should be a net positive as blind investment into all things tech goes on pause. Investors who feel Microsoft, and tech at large, are overpriced and due for a greater correction can breathe a bit easier. Again, the more Microsoft can play up this aspect of MSFT stock, the better. However, as with all things in business, there is a fine line to tread. An over-reliance on dividends signals stagnation to many in the stock markets. Payouts themselves necessarily divert money from potential growth investment. But perhaps Microsoft will increase its dividend yield in coming quarters. There is certainly room to do so with a trailing and forward dividend yield of 0.99%, and a modest dividend payout ratio of 0.35.  Microsoft's ValueLet's take a look at some comparable companies to try and get a feel for where Microsoft should trade relative to its peers. The first step in doing so is to determine which firms are truly comparable to Microsoft. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are often compared to Microsoft. So I'll use them. The point here is not that Microsoft should be viewed purely through the lens of value investing. Rather, the point is to apply other perspectives to a stock that has grown quickly but may face a pullback. If a cooling of the markets recurs, investors may apply value investing principles to the tech sector. In that case, investors should know where capital may flow. Since Apple and Cisco are in the same industry, we can use P/E ratio for comparison's sake. Using this very simplistic model we find that P/E ratios of 35.66, 34.1, and 15.37 for Apple, Microsoft and Cisco, respectively. This shouldn't surprise readers: investors are much more willing to pay for a piece of AAPL or MSFT earnings than CSCO. Yet, perhaps it is time to at least consider sifting through the tech sector wholesale, and applying value principles. It could be a worthwhile exercise.  Verdict on MSFTMicrosoft is a great company. Shares have been champions for years. The company's Azure cloud services, government contracts, acquisition strategy and position in a changing work environment give owners plenty to look forward to. I agree with markets that it is a buy. Yet, I also believe that investors should exercise caution and prudent fundamental analysis. This is doubly true in tech where herd mentality is strong.

2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. pledged to increase the number of Black employees and leaders, adding its name to a list of technology companies promising to try to fix the lack of diversity in their workforces.The biggest maker of networking equipment said its goal is to increase the company’s workforce of Black people by 25% by 2023 in the entry-level to manager levels. In the director to vice president ranks, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday that it wants to raise black representation by 75%. Overall, Cisco pledged to create pay parity and promotion fairness.Silicon Valley companies are under pressure to match their in-house actions to the proclamations of support they made in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May, an event that energized the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted a nationwide focus on racial inequity. Statistics show that most U.S. technology companies don’t have enough Black employees to make their workforces representative of the general population.Cisco was relatively quick to respond after Floyd’s death, but has faced some internal difficulties in the process. It fired some employees for their behavior during an all-hands meeting on video to discuss race.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said the companywide video call was part of the process of creating an atmosphere that makes it OK for such difficult topics to be discussed. That’s the role leaders should take and the response of employees, in this case Cisco’s Black workers, should help determine what action is taken, he said in an interview at the Bloomberg Equality Summit.“Empathy is nice, but it’s time for action,” Robbins said. “We have a lot to learn. We have a long way to go, but we’re making progress.”In the U.S., 3.8% of Cisco’s workers are Black, according to its most recent corporate and social responsibility report. For technical positions roles, the number falls to 3.3%, followed by 1.8% of vice presidents. There are no Black executives on Cisco’s leadership team.The company said it will invest in the next generation of Black technology leaders by providing money and support to historically Black colleges and universities. It will also create a $50 million venture investment fund to help startups with diverse founders and leadership and will advocate for social change, police reform and give employees a paid day off to vote.(Updates with CEO comments in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Promises to Increase Black Representation in Workforce
2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard wouldn’t say the company would stop selling controversial skin lightening creams that have come under scrutiny for perpetuating harmful racial stereotypes. “At a minimum,” though, the consumer products giant will rename them. Kewsong Lee, co-chief executive officer of Carlyle Group, said that his company has not had an issue finding diverse talent.* See a full lineup here. Watch on LIVE throughout the day. Click here to read daily coverage from Bloomberg Equality.P&G Walks a Fine Line on Controversial Skin-Lightening Creams (5:20 p.m. NY)P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the company is looking at every product in its portfolio to address any biased messages. When asked if he would stop selling controversial skin-lightening creams that perpetuate racist stereotypes, he said P&G will start by renaming them “at minimum.” Pritchard also weighed in on comments made by Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf on the limited black talent pool.“It’s a myth. It’s untrue -- it’s absolutely inaccurate,” Pritchard said. “I’ve heard that before and the reality is there are talented people out there. There are talented Black people, brown people and Asian people.”Performer John Legend, also on the panel, added “Wells Fargo in particular has caused significant harm in our communities by deceiving people and duping them into taking mortgages that they shouldn’t have taken.”LL Cool J Wants Black Artists to Get Their Due (4:19 p.m. NY)Rap legend LL Cool J said he’s trying to capitalize on the huge spending power of Gen X fans. He is the chief executive officer of Rock The Bells, a music and apparel company that promotes classic hip-hop music.“Generation X has $2.4 trillion in spending power,” he said. Classic hip-hop fans make up a huge portion of that group. “They’ve been ignored.”He’s also trying to solidify the legacy of early rap artists like Salt-N-Pepa and Eric B. & Rakim. “The Bob Dylans and the Mick Jaggers, they get the love and the respect as they should,” he said. “But you know what, the Rakims and the Nases and the LL Cool Js should get their respect. The Big Daddy Kanes, they should be lifted up as well.”HBCUs Are Seeing 10X Donations This Year (3:19 p.m. NY)Since June, Historically Black College and Universities have received almost a half-billion dollars in gifts, said Michael Lomax, CEO of the United Negro College Fund. In a typical full year, donations would be about a tenth of that, he said. The combined endowments of 101 HBCUs is only a fraction of the endowment at Harvard University, so the surge in resources is a welcome change, Lomax said. The average HBCU has about a $12 million endowment, one third that of peers, he said.Ruth J. Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University in Texas, said that enrollment is up, perhaps because the HBCUs students don’t have a lot of choices. Students are eager to be on campus for in-person learning and socializing, not to stay home for virtual classes.“That’s not what they bargained for when they came to university,” she said.Carlyle’s Lee Says His Firm Has a Pipeline of Diverse Talent (2:47 p.m. NY)Kewsong Lee, Co-CEO of Carlyle Group, said he didn’t want to comment on Wells Fargo directly, but he said that his company has not had an issue with finding candidates with diversity and he does have a pipeline of talent. About half of recent hires are either women or people of color and about 1-in-5 people of color, Lee said.In July, the company spelled out a number of measures to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace. By 2023, Carlyle said it wants 30% of the corporate boards of companies controlled by its private-equity group to be composed of women or minorities.TPG’s Winkelried Laments Lack of Investor Interest in Diversity (2:19 p.m. NY)Jon Winkelried, co-chief executive officer at TPG Holdings LP, said he wished TPG’s own investors, which include public pension plans, would take more of an interest in diversity.While there has been a steady increase in inquiries from investors on the topic, Winkelried said it wasn’t enough. “The providers of capital are slowly recognizing that they can’t be silent,” he said, pointing to how those investors’ constituencies are very diverse.A year ago, TPG started an initiative requiring that at least one woman be included on the board of each of its portfolio companies. Since then, Winkelried said that more than 80 women have been added to the boards with 21% of them considered racially diverse.Ursula Burns, the former CEO of Xerox Holdings Corp. and one of the leaders of the Board Diversity Action Alliance, said that diversity in companies has to start in the boardroom because those directors hire the CEO and set the tone of leadership.“One of the reasons there needs to be diversity on the board is so the discussion doesn’t get pushed out of the boardroom,” said Burns, who was speaking on the panel with Winkelried.Dow CEO: It’s Up to Companies to Set Tone for More Civil Discourse (12:35 p.m. NY)Society has become too polarized, and companies and their chief executive officers have a responsibility “to set the tone” for more civil discourse, said Jim Fitterling, CEO of Dow Inc. “We’ve forgotten what civil society is all about,” he said, and “missed the boat on how we treat people.”Dow has relied heavily on employee groups to craft its response to the unrest this year over racial injustice. The Dow board, with three Black directors, has also helped, Fittlerling said. In addition, the company has used input from diverse workers to shape its products, such as developing razors that work better for Black men.The CEO also weighed in on the work-from-home debate. Two-thirds of Dow’s workforce has been stationed at home, and “It’s been seamless,” he said. “We got closer to customers and we did a better job servicing them.”But it’s harder to build and maintain a company culture when most of your workers, and especially newer employees, aren’t together in the office, he said. “We can’t stay 100% work from home forever.”Cisco’s Pledge to Improve Black Representation (12:00 p.m. NY)Cisco Systems Inc. today announced it will increase the number of Black employees and leaders. Chuck Robbins, chairman and CEO, said Black employees pointed out the steps that need to be taken. “We have a lot to learn. We have a long way to go, but we’re making progress,” he said.The biggest maker of web networking equipment said its goal is to increase the company’s workforce of Black people by 25% by 2023 in entry-level to manager roles. The San Jose, California-based company said it wants to raise Black representation by 75% in its top ranks. There are no Black executives on Cisco’s leadership team.Softbank Has Funded 15 Companies Run by People of Color Since June (11:06 a.m. NY)Shu Nyatta, a managing partner who co-heads the Opportunity Fund said Softbank has funded almost 15 companies out of 600 that it evaluated since launching a $100 million Opportunity Fund in June, which exclusively invests in firms led by people of color.A key part of the Opportunity Fund’s strategy is to target early stage Black and Latinx companies, Nyatta said. “The pipeline is rich and the pipeline is young and we just have to accept that and help it grow up.”‘There Is No Pipeline Issue,’ Goldman Sachs’s Jemma Wolfe Says (10:57 a.m. NY)Jemma Wolfe, of the Goldman Sachs initiative Launch With GS, said the investing world doesn’t have a pipeline problem, but a network problem. Earlier this week, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charles Scharf was criticized for reported remarks blaming the bank’s lack of diverse talent on a “very limited pool” to recruit from. Wolfe was saying she sees no such issue in investing.The Case for and Against Reparations for Slavery (10:29 a.m. NY)The U.S. and the U.K. have already paid reparations to slave owners, but continue to debate, what, if anything can and should be done for the descendants of more than 10 million former slaves.The price tag is at least $4.9 trillion, and may be nearly triple that, said Kehinde Andrews, Professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University. Because of the legacy of slavery, it will take the average Black family in the U.S. 288 years to catch up with White households, said Katherine Franke, James L. Dohr Professor of Law, Columbia University. She proposes a trust that would be funded by higher estate taxes.Glenn Loury, Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences and Economics at Brown University, argued against reparations, saying they would exacerbate the political divide in the U.S. and racism. Reparations may also give a sense that the issue is settled, rather than ongoing, he said.Bank of England Unlikely to Reach Its Diversity Goals for 2020 and 2022 (9:48 a.m. NY)The Bank of England is working to remove artifacts and take down portraits of governors who had connections to the slave trade as part of a public apology for the bank’s role in slavery, said Joanna Place, chief operating officer of the Bank of England. Some of the artifacts may be relocated to a Bank of England museum as part of process of acknowledging past issues, she said.The bank is unlikely to meet goals for people of color and women in senior leadership roles. The bank had aimed to have women make up 35% of leadership roles by the end of this year and people of color in 13% of senior management by the end of 2022.Bank of America Says It Can’t Solve Inequality on its Own (9:24 a.m. NY)Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said financial firms can’t solve racial and income disparities on their own -- that “you need some catalyst” from public officials to push forward projects that address inequalities. Banks can lend money to housing developments in low- and moderate-income communities, for example, but government officials can speed up construction by authorizing projects more quickly, Moynihan said in an interview for the Bloomberg Equality Summit. “Really what the public side needs to do is to permit -- drive the authorization part of it,” he said.NatWest Continues Hiring During Pandemic for Racial Balance (8:57 a.m. NY)NatWest Group Plc’s employee-led task force is meeting with bosses this week to discuss ways to promote inclusion in the British bank, according to CEO Alison Rose.Rose said there had been awkward conversations throughout the company in recent months on issues such as white privilege and speaking up on bias. “This isn’t up to our Black colleagues to talk about it -- it’s up to all of us to talk about it so we can build understanding and solutions.”NatWest has continued to hire during the Covid-19 pandemic to help bring in diverse talent, with 260 graduates joining next week and summer internships carried out online, she said. Rose, the first woman to run a major U.K. lender, said she was “always going to be impatient that progress isn’t fast enough.”Delta’s Plan to Improve Black Representation (8:11 a.m. NY)Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that the company is committed to bringing better representation of Black employees, who are under-represented both among the overall workforce but even among other people of color.“That’s a pretty wide gap that we need to commit to closing,” he said. “Our company does not have a great record on this in the past and may have some challenges it needs to correct for in order to be a more just company.”It’s essential for Delta to go beyond its recruitment pipeline and into colleges and universities, and even to elementary education, to find talent early and improve opportunities, he said.“We’re all in a period of trying to understand what we have to do,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of great role models among corporate CEOs, which is evidence of the fact our Black colleagues have not had the same access to the C suite.”Clinton Decries Rush to Fill Ginsburg’s Seat (7:37 a.m. NY)Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Republican rush to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court could spell the end of Obamacare, but that she opposes increasing the size of the court in response. Clinton cited Ginsburg’s reported last wish -- that the seat she had held since 1993 remain vacant until the presidential election was decided. She acknowledged that Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm an appointment from President Donald Trump before the Nov. 3 election.Fauci Says Covid Sickens Minorities, Essential Workers (7:21 a.m. NY)Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, highlighted how Covid-19 disproportionately sickens people of color, and said they must be strongly represented in the race to find a vaccine.Fauci, who heads the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that people of color often hold essential jobs that don’t allow them to work from home. At the same time, they have higher prevalence of conditions including diabetes, hypertension and obesity.It’s a toxic combination that’s translated into higher Covid-19 hospitalization rates than the population at large, according to Fauci.“There’s almost a double whammy on the minority populations,” he said.Fauci called the pandemic the biggest challenge he has seen in the four decades he’s been in his post, rivaled only by the HIV/AIDS crisis. He also said it’s “aspirational” to get all Americans vaccinated by April of next year, it’s more likely to happen toward the middle to the end of 2021.See the full story here: Double Whammy for Minorities Key in Vaccine Race, Fauci Says(Previous versions of this story were corrected for misspellings of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s and Glenn Loury’s names and the timeline for a vaccine from Anthony Fauci.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",P&G Will Rename Skin Creams ‘at Minimum’: Equality Summit Update

2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Plans by China to draw up a blacklist of U.S. technology firms might sound great to hardliners as a retaliatory measure against Washington, but would most likely backfire. Pulling the trigger on such a threat could end up proving that the importance of the world’s most populous country as a global buyer may be smaller than many imagine.Beijing has sped development of a catalog of companies it could target, yet debate remains in the halls of power over whether to release it before November’s U.S. election, if at all, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing officials it didn’t name. China has been mulling what it calls an unreliable entities list since at least May last year, though little has been heard of it since then.You can understand Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s possible frustration as U.S. President Donald Trump rolls out ban after ban on companies from national champion Huawei Technologies Co. to booming upstart ByteDance Ltd.Still, Xi’s own agenda to build China into a technology powerhouse makes him more reliant on the very firms likely to appear on any blacklist. In addition, there are also companies Beijing no longer needs — often because their technology has already been pilfered — that have already started reducing their reliance on the Chinese market, weakening the real power of any threat.Cisco Systems Inc., a global leader in communications technology, is a likely target of possible bans, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the Silicon Valley company posted a 16% drop in sales from China last year, with the entire Asia-Pacific region (including Japan) accounting for just 15% of revenue in fiscal 2019. Of the 26 competitors it identified by name in its annual report, only two are Chinese, Huawei and Lenovo Group Ltd.In fact, the list of major U.S. technology companies can be roughly categorized as those having almost no exposure to China because they’ve already been banned (Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.), or are of such crucial importance that Beijing can’t do without them, at least for now. Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., and Microsoft Corp. would fall into the latter. Then there’s a third group, like Apple Inc. China could ban Apple, I suppose. The nation can survive without iPhones and Macs, but America’s largest company also spends a significant amount on parts and labor in China. It would be less than wise for Beijing to bite the hand that feeds millions of its citizens. Similar to Cisco’s experience, the country is declining in importance to Apple, with sales from the Greater China region falling 16% last fiscal year. It’s hard to argue that China isn’t an important market for American firms. If you look at the chief exports, the reality becomes more clear. Civilian aircraft, including engines and equipment — think Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. — topped the list last year at $10.4 billion, accounting for 9.8% of total U.S. goods sold to China. That’s followed by semiconductors (8.5%) and soybeans (7.5%). It’s notable that while aerospace tops the list of 10 American advanced technology products shipped to China, the value is roughly on par with the U.K. and Canada, while France tops them all. Looking at this subcategory of high-level U.S. goods, accounting for roughly 32% of exports to China, the country is rarely the top buyer. Canada, for example, spent more last year on American information and communications products. A lot of what China does import is just re-exported anyway: Most of those chips it buys head straight back out the door inside iPhones and PlayStations bought by foreign consumers.Trickiest of all is semiconductors. Chinese imports of American chips is a weakness for Beijing, not Washington, and has already been exploited by the Trump administration, most notably by cutting off Huawei from the American technology to manufacture them. It would be a fruitless move for China to ban any chip companies simply out of spite.An unintended byproduct of China copying U.S. technology over the past two decades is that it can no longer hold those companies to ransom, while at the same time it can’t simply afford to kick out those it hasn’t yet been able to replace with local versions. Blacklisting any of them, however, might make an effective piece of theater, and at little cost if the sacrifices are limited to companies it doesn’t really need. China’s rulers will want to calculate whether there’s a pre-election benefit, or if they’d be helping Trump. Even if they wait until after the next president is known, such a move would present a show of strength.That feeling of power might be fleeting. Enforcing such a list is more likely to reveal China as weak.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. was told to pay $1.9 billion after losing a trial brought by a Virginia company that claimed the networking giant copied patented cybersecurity features and shut the smaller company out of government contracts.Cisco infringed four patents owned by Centripetal Networks Inc., District Judge Henry Morgan in Norfolk ruled. The judge heard the month-long trial over video conference in June after canceling the use of a jury because of the coronavirus pandemic. Cisco said it would appeal the decision.Centripetal Networks, based in Herndon, Virginia, said it developed a network protection system, funded in part by a grant from the Department of Homeland Security, only to see Cisco integrate the inventions into its own networks after meetings and presentations by Centripetal officials.“The fact that Cisco released products with Centripetal’s functionality within a year of these meetings goes beyond mere coincidence,” Morgan said.The judge said Centripetal was owed $755.8 million for past use of the inventions, which he increased by two-and-a-half times after finding that Cisco’s infringement was “willful and egregious.” He also ordered that Cisco pay a 10% royalty on sales of some of its products for the next three years, and then 5% in royalties for three years after that.Jonathan Rogers, Centripetal’s chief operating officer, said the company was “thrilled” with the ruling.“It’s been a long time coming and was very hard fought,” he said in an interview.The total damage award accounts for less than three months of profit for Cisco. The company reported net income of more than $11.04 billion for calendar year 2019. It’s also one of the most cash-rich companies in technology. In August it reported cash, cash equivalents and investments of $29.4 billion.Cisco said its cybersecurity features were developed long before Centripetal was founded a decade ago. San Jose, California-based Cisco said Centripetal hasn’t been successful in getting government and university contracts because its ideas were too complicated.Cisco said it will appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law.“We are disappointed with the trial court’s decision given the substantial evidence of non-infringement, invalidity and that Cisco’s innovations predate the patents by many years,” Cisco said in a statement.Centripetal said sales had been doubling each year from 2015 until it met with Cisco for a partnership and “got close to getting married but got left at the altar,” as Centripetal lawyer Paul Andre of the firm Kramer Levin put it in opening arguments. He said Centripetal told Cisco about its inventions in 2016 and “Cisco kept coming back and asking for more.”After the judge’s decision was released, Andre called it a “significant win for all small, innovative companies” and said Morgan “rejected the primitive doctrine that might makes right.”In June 2017, Cisco announced its Encrypted Traffic Analytics, which David Goeckeler, then head of Cisco’s network and security, said “solves a network security challenge previously thought to be unsolvable.”Cisco lawyer Dabney Carr of Troutman Sanders said Cisco, founded in 1999, has a long history of developing network security products and even has written books on the topic.“Cisco is proud of the network security it provides; it just doesn’t infringe these patents,” Carr said in closing arguments. He said there is a “cavernous gap” between what the patents cover and Centripetal’s infringement allegations.The judge found that the introduction of the cybersecurity features resulted in “a dramatic increase in sales which Cisco touted in both technical and marketing documents.”The trial was originally supposed to be held before a jury but the courthouse is closed to the public because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, Morgan, who became a federal judge in 1991 and took senior status in 2004, conducted the trial over the Zoom teleconferencing app.The opinion was released after Morgan issued an order denying Cisco’s request that he recuse himself from the case. The judge’s wife owns shares of Cisco, bought at the recommendation of a broker. Morgan said he had already reached his conclusion on the case, though not finished writing the opinion, when he learned of the ownership.The case is Centripetal Networks Inc. v. Cisco Systems Inc., 18-94, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk).(Updates with comments beginning in sixth paragraphs.

Almost all of the respondents were uncomfortable returning to work because they fear contracting the virus, the poll found.Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment, recently surveyed 1,569 executives, knowledge workers and others who are responsible for employee environments in the post-Covid era.

It’s also faces rising competition from Zoom Video Communications Inc.For employees who do return to the office, Webex is adding environmental sensors that plug into its current video-conferencing gear.

2020-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Just 28% of Americans say they already have or expect to return to workplaces before the end of the year, indicating the coronavirus pandemic is making remote work more mainstream, a Conference Board survey showed Thursday.Nearly one-third of respondents said they would be uncomfortable getting back to offices, shops and factories, while half said their greatest concern was contracting the disease at work, according to the Sept. 16-25 online survey of more than 1,100 workers. Only 17% of employees said they were very comfortable or even wanted to return.The coronavirus continues to spread across the U.S., with 34 states recording higher seven-day averages of new cases compared with a month ago. While progress is being made on a vaccine, it will be months before it’s available to the general public. Even when it is ready, the Conference Board’s survey showed just 7% expect a return to their workplace.“For knowledge workers and others where remote working is an option, you’re going to see more of a remote or hybrid working arrangement become the standard way,” said Rebecca Ray, executive vice president of human capital at the Conference Board.A cultural shift to working from home and the pause or stop in business reopenings have upended the commercial real estate market. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren warned that a resurgence in the virus could lead to troubles in the financial sector via commerical real estate.Commercial Real EstateThe “commercial real estate sector is going to be impacted in the long term as we now need much less space for offices, retail, and probably higher education,” said Gad Levanon, head of the Conference Board Labor Markets Institute.The Conference Board’s survey echoed with a recent poll of company executives by Cisco Systems Inc. More than half plan to downsize their offices as remote working will become commonplace after the pandemic subsides, according to the Cisco survey.The Conference Board survey also showed that lower-ranking employees are more concerned about returning. Some 20% of rank-and-file workers and 21% of front-line managers indicated they feel pressure to return in order to keep their jobs, compared with just 4% of executives. Individual contributors are also the least comfortable coming back to job sites.Some 29% of respondents said they had little faith that their colleagues would adhere to safety protocols and guidelines upon return.

2020-10-08,"News Summary    * Companies introduce new model for streaming media delivery leveraging Open Caching architecture deployed at the edge of the service provider networks; it offers unprecedented levels of quality with open, global APIs endorsed by the Streaming Video Alliance  * Innovative business model enables zero-capex and limited-risk deployment, helping service providers generate new revenue as active participants of the content delivery value chain  * BT has adopted this solution to deliver high-quality streaming experiences across its network to its customers on behalf of global content providers  SAN JOSE, Calif. and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cisco, Qwilt and Digital Alpha (DA) announced today how together they are disrupting the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) market with a new as-a-service offering based on Open Caching, with BT as the flagship customer.Streaming content is increasingly delivered in 4K and soon 8K, supporting augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications across multiple devices, over wireline and wireless connections. This drives network capacity demands, with consumer internet video traffic expected to comprise 82% of all (consumer) internet traffic by 2022, (up from 73% in 2017.)1Resulting performance requirements are accelerating the shift away from traditional content delivery models, opening up the opportunity for service providers to use their edge assets to deploy their own distributed CDN capabilities and become more active participants in the streaming media delivery value chain.Open Caching, an open architecture developed and endorsed by the Streaming Video Alliance, offers a platform that federates content delivery infrastructure deployed deep inside service provider networks, into a global CDN with open APIs for content publishers. It is designed to help service providers easily deploy an edge CDN footprint, offering them more control over content flows. It also caters to the needs of global and regional content providers for more capacity, consistency in content delivery and performance assurance.Featuring Digital Alpha as the investing partner providing a unique funding solution, this partnership combines Qwilt’s innovative content delivery platform based on Open Caching, with Cisco’s edge compute and networking infrastructure to deliver the solution as-a-service to service providers of all sizes around the world.BT, the UK’s leading telecommunications and network provider, in partnership with Qwilt, Cisco and DA has deployed this solution to add multiple terabits per second of capacity and provide cost-effective, high-quality streaming video to meet its growing demand in 2020 and beyond. Its decision to make the transition to Open Caching is based on the following requirements:  * Deliver the highest-quality streaming experience across its entire network  * Support an open architecture endorsed by the Streaming Video Alliance  * Drive new revenue by becoming an active part of the content delivery value chain  * Reduce content delivery costs by deploying CDN capabilities inside its network  * Eliminate deployment costs using the innovative capex-free model  Industry and streaming ecosystem support for Open Caching is growing, with over 50 global service providers, technology vendors and content publishers actively involved in moving the content delivery industry in this direction.“At BT we connect for good and streaming video has never been more important than in today’s challenging times,” said Neil McRae, Chief Architect, Managing Director for Architecture and Technology Strategy at BT. “Our mission at BT is to ensure our customers have the best experience every time and with record levels of streaming we needed to disrupt the status quo. Qwilt’s pioneering open caching platform together with Cisco’s cloud infrastructure gives BT the first 5G MEC capability in the UK to deliver premium quality video and on demand services.”“Streaming video may be the killer app for the internet, but it doesn’t have to KILL the internet,” said Jonathan Davidson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Mass Scale Infrastructure Group, Cisco. “With streaming video expected to represent north of 80% of traffic flowing through service provider networks in the coming years, content delivery is the first of potentially many services they can deploy from within to monetize their edge footprint in the 5G era. Marking this milestone together with Qwilt and Digital Alpha to enable edge cloud services for service providers, we can change the economics of the internet for the future, partnering with customers like BT to help them manage video traffic more effectively.”“The way we consume video has changed, and content delivery must change with it,” said Alon Maor, CEO and Co-founder of Qwilt. “Our shared vision is to help service providers enable Open Caching in their networks and leverage edge computing as a fundamental component of their architecture. Together, we are helping many customers such as BT to accelerate their digital transformation in the UK and establish a content delivery platform that will serve as a foundation for today’s applications and new experiences coming in the future.”“Digital Alpha is a trusted business partner, actively working with leading technology companies to support their market needs and growth opportunities with unique funding solutions,” said Rick Shrotri, Co-Founder, Managing Partner, Digital Alpha. “Our domain background and expertise lets us structure this innovative outcome-based model to support global service providers deploying their own CDNs with zero capex and limited risk. Working with our partners in conjunction with the leading content providers, we are committed to scaling this platform to service providers globally in the months ahead.”Supporting resources:  * Qwilt Edge Cloud for Content Delivery  * Open Caching Architecture from the Streaming Video Alliance   * Cisco UCS  * Cisco Nexus 9000 Series SwitchesAbout Cisco   Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.

2020-10-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s time for Foxconn Technology Group to come clean. Fanciful plans to create a leading-edge 10.5-generation display plant in Wisconsin never made sense. The sooner the company admits as much, the sooner it can restore its reputation as a reliable business partner.Two years after agreeing to a massive investment, the Taiwanese company is at the heart of one of the most infamous subsidy-for-investment debacles in American history. Once touted by newly-elected President Donald Trump as the eighth wonder of the world, promises have turned to disappointment and the failure threatens his re-election campaign in Wisconsin, where his narrow 2016 win helped him reach the White House.With the global supply chain fracturing and the days of mega-factories over, Foxconn needs to rebuild goodwill around the world. Gone are the days when a big-talking billionaire could get politicians on the phone at a whim and talk them into handing out millions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits in the hope of attracting massive jobs-creating projects. A letter this week from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. is a stark reminder that promises need to be kept, or the consequences paid. The Recipients are ineligible for tax credits because of their failure to carry out the Project.As Chief Legal Officer Jennifer H. Campbell outlined, the agreement includes a “Generation 10.5 TFT-LCD Fabrication Facility,” investment of up to $10 billion, and generation of as many as 13,000 jobs within a defined economic zone. She went on to note that Foxconn has  “acknowledged that they have no formal or informal business plans to build a 10.5 Fab within the Zone.”That fab has since been downgraded to a much-lesser 6G factory, and Foxconn has missed its hiring target for a second straight year after falling short by 82% in the first. It has invested less than 10% of the money and employed fewer than a quarter of the 2,080 full-time jobs targeted for the end of 2019, even failing to meet a minimum hiring quota of just 520 people, Campbell wrote.Foxconn says it is still on course to invest in Wisconsin and will abide by the agreement signed with the state, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported, citing a statement released after news of the WEDC’s letter.Nobody should be surprised that Foxconn didn’t come through.For the past four years, I’ve been warning readers to beware of tycoons bearing big job promises. According to one anecdote, a satirical letter I wrote from Foxconn’s founder Terry Gou to President-elect Trump even made it into a briefing packet for Wisconsin’s then-Governor Scott Walker (before being pulled by a sharp-eyed aide). I couldn’t verify this perhaps apocryphal tale, but it speaks to how little political leaders knew about Foxconn before jumping into bed.There are numerous stories to be told about Gou’s big ideas — from Indonesia, to Pennsylvania, to Brazil — that never quite panned out. In the same week that Trump was inaugurated, it was already obvious that Foxconn’s plans for a U.S. display factory didn’t add up. But Trump’s vision to restore manufacturing glory to America intersected with voters’ hopes, Gou’s bravado and Walker’s political ego. Nothing could stop the state from going ahead. Wisconsin was eager to offer tax incentives, clear out houses, and build infrastructure. But progress was slow from the beginning, and it quickly became clear that Foxconn’s targets wouldn’t be met.Today, Wisconsin has a new governor: The Foxconn debacle helped Democrat Tony Evers defeat the Republican Walker in a state that has straddled America’s red-blue divide for a decade. What Evers has inherited is a Wisconsin with dozens of displaced families, a mountain of new debt, a ratings downgrade, and ignored  environmental standards. Foxconn, too, has new leadership. Inspired by Trump’s victory in 2016, Gou stepped down last year to seek the candidacy of Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang, leaving long-time lieutenant Young Liu in charge. (Gou didn’t get the nomination, and the KMT lost in a landslide to incumbent Tsai Ing-wen).Liu’s challenges could grow as big as those Gou faced a decade ago, when a spate of worker suicides at its factories in China forced the founder to reassess how he deals with working conditions. Foxconn came out of that saga maintaining its role as the key assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones. Now, the tech Cold War between Beijing and Washington necessitates that the company decentralize manufacturing away from China, while rising costs make its hubs in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou less attractive. Instead of employing up to a million people in China during peak iPhone season, expect more devices from Apple, Sony Corp., Dell Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. to be assembled at an assortment of locations around the world.This means expanding existing sites — such as in Mexico, the Czech Republic, India, Brazil and Taiwan — and opening new facilities elsewhere. To ensure it has the infrastructure, land and labor to make this happen, Foxconn needs to work with local governments.After this fiasco in the Midwest, you could forgive any politician for being wary. It certainly doesn’t help that Foxconn clings to public claims that all is well in the state of Wisconsin.New management deserves praise for a more open attitude toward investors and the media, installed since Liu took over. He needs to go further in regards to Wisconsin. His team should admit that Foxconn’s plans aren’t what was first promised, explain what went wrong, and outline changes to its global expansion policy. Liu could swallow this bitter pill, as he wasn’t in charge when the deal was signed, yet also contend with the reality that Gou remains a presence despite semi-retirement. But it needs to be done. The path forward to build new partnerships around the world starts with coming clean in Racine County, Wisconsin. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. said it’s rolling out a promised end-to-end encryption feature to secure user meetings and announced a raft of new products, seeking to put safety concerns behind it and maintain the company’s lofty growth.End-to-end encryption, the strongest data security standard, will be generally available to free and paid users next week on an optional basis, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The software maker also unveiled OnZoom, an event platform in which users can host free, paid or fund-raising events with an integrated payment system. A public test version of the service began Wednesday for some users.Zoom, a maker of a videoconferencing service, has been among the most prominent corporate beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of people to work and study from home. The software maker reported that quarterly revenue surged 355% to $663.5 million in the period ended in July, the second consecutive period of triple-digit sales growth. The outsize gains have propelled Zoom’s stock more than sevenfold this year, to a market value of more than $147 billion. Shares declined 3% to $503.41 at 1:17 p.m. Wednesday in New York.Zoom is the rare business application that also has been adopted by consumers en masse, with more than 300 million daily meeting participants depending on the service to connect with colleagues, communities and loved ones. Yet the platform has faced months of controversy for security and safety lapses. Researchers discovered some instances when Zoom’s calls were routed through servers in mainland China, even though no meeting participant was based there. And trolls began invading calls with profane, pornographic and racist content, in a phenomenon known as Zoombombing that continues to plague the system.Town hall incidentU.S. Representative Jahana Hayes, a Democrat from Connecticut who is Black, wrote Tuesday in a Medium post about a racist Zoom attack during a town hall with constituents. A series of participants hurled racial epithets and told her to “pick cotton.” When one individual was kicked out of the meeting, another would pick up the baton, causing the disruption to last six minutes, she said.“We are deeply upset to hear about this and we take the privacy of Zoom Meetings very seriously,” the company told the lawmaker on Twitter, after she shared her story. The company said it would investigate the issue. The Washington Post earlier reported on the incident.Zoom has touted full encryption and changes to give meeting hosts more control over participants as solutions to these issues.Even with its popularity among consumers, the company recognizes that most of its future growth will come from businesses, so Zoom is trying to expand in the unified communications market occupied by RingCentral Inc. The idea is to combine videoconferencing, phone calls and text messaging on one platform and sell it to companies looking to modernize their communications systems.Tools aimed at business efficiencyZoom, which competes with videoconferencing services from Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. among others, also announced new tools to help software developers better integrate Zoom into their products. Among the offerings introduced as part of Wednesday’s Zoomtopia conference was Zapps, which are apps that users can access without leaving the Zoom platform, including tools from Slack Technologies Inc., Box Inc. and Atlassian Corp. The company said more than 25 launch partners joined this effort. Zoom also updated its software development kit to better let other businesses embed Zoom in their own applications, and they will be able to customize the user interface and meeting controls.Finally, Zoom rolled out smaller product updates to improve user experiences, such as the ability to give all participants the same background in a meeting as well as new breakout and debrief rooms during large webinars.“Zoom is built for this moment and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan said in the statement. “We have the platform to support what the world needs -- today, tomorrow, and well into the future.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Zoom Rolls Out Strongest Data Encryption, New Event Platform"

Cisco Stock on Sale
Cisco is a global firm that works in many facets of the networking market. It sells switches, routers, and data center products. Last year, Cisco shares traded at multi-year highs near $60. This is still below the over $77 peak during the infamous dotcom bubble.

Cisco trades at a price-to-earnings that is half of its high-flying peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Shares also pay a $1.44 dividend, so even though it is down this year, investors get some income.
When the courts ordered it to pay $1.9 billion for infringing on cybersecurity patents, markets ignored the news. Cisco is appealing a ruling that it infringed on four patents that Centripetal Networks owns.
Judge Henry Morgan said, “Cisco did not advance any objectively reasonable defenses at trial.”
The comments suggest that Cisco’s appeal will not succeed, even though the market thinks otherwise.

Cisco shares are on sale for a reason. Although the company posted strong results, it shared downside guidance. In the fourth quarter, revenue fell by 9% to $12.2 billion. It earned 62 cents a share on a GAAP basis (80 cents non-GAAP).
In the first quarter, Cisco expects revenue to fall 9% to 11% year-on-year. EPS will come in the range of 41 cents to 47 cents. So, if readers input a 10% revenue loss every year through to the fiscal year 2025, then Cisco shares are worth $27.37.
In hindsight, Cisco’s WebEx is a lost opportunity. It let Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) offer an easily sharable online meeting experience.
Conversely, Cisco kept its video tool the same. WebEx required a subscription. Its strength of powering online presentations did not match up to Zoom’s free version. This let Zoom meetings proliferate and become a verb. Now, corporations set up a “zoom meeting.”
The lost opportunity for expanding WebEx’s reach reflects Cisco’s low P/E multiples.
Opportunity
Cisco is a slow-moving technology titan that is falling behind young rivals. It could spin-off some of its businesses, just as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) announced on Oct. 8. The $19 billion separations of its infrastructure services lifted IBM stock.
If Cisco does something similar, the stock should at least trade back to the $44 – $48 range.
Besides, Cisco could increase its dividend to appeal to income investors. It would need to aggressively buy back shares at current levels to maximize shareholder returns.
In doing so, Cisco’s stock could establish an uptrend again instead of under-performing its peers.
On Oct. 7, the company won a small 5G deal with Verizon Communications (NASDAQ:VZ). It will increase fan safety amid the Covid-19 pandemic by providing mobile edge computing capabilities.
In practical terms, the 5G wideband network will enable crowd density and crowd flow management.
Currently, sports events currently have limited seating, if any. In the future, governments will require physical distancing standards. Both Cisco and Verizon have a workable solution.
Your Takeaway
Technology stocks could stay out of favor for a long time until a catalyst unlocks its value.
Cisco is unlikely to reverse its revenue decline next quarter. So, it will need to reward its patient investors for now, until the under-performing segments rebound.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. charged six current and former members of Russia’s military intelligence agency for allegedly carrying out some of the world’s most destructive hacking attacks from 2015 to 2019, including knocking out Ukraine’s power grid and causing almost $1 billion in damage to three American companies.The hackers allegedly carried out attacks against the 2017 elections in France and the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games, according to an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department on Monday.“According to the indictment, beginning in or around November 2015 and continuing until at least in or around October 2019, the defendants and their co-conspirators deployed destructive malware and took other disruptive actions, for the strategic benefit of Russia, through unauthorized access to victim computers,” the department said.Read the grand jury indictment unsealed on MondayThe hackers from the military intelligence unit known as GRU allegedly spread what is known as NotPetya malware, which damaged computers used for critical infrastructure, including impairing the administration of medical services by a hospital system in Pennsylvania.“The attack caused the unavailability of patient lists, patient history, physical examination files and laboratory records,” according to the department.The NotPetya attack also caused about $400 million in damages to a subsidiary of FedEx Corp. and more than $500 million in damages to a large U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer, which the indictment didn’t identify. Merck & Co. has been previously identified as one of the targets.None of the charges involved the current U.S. presidential campaign, although the FBI and other agencies say Russia continues trying to interfere in U.S. politics.“No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages and fits of spite,” John Demers, head of the department’s national security division, told reporters during a news conference on Monday.Demers said the release of the indictment wasn’t particularly intended to send a message to Russia against interfering in the 2020 election. He said U.S. agencies haven’t seen evidence that hackers can compromise voting in this year’s election.“Americans should be confident that a vote cast for their candidate will be counted for that candidate,“ Demers said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia “has never conducted any hacking attacks,” calling the charges a reflection of “blatant Russophobia.”The Justice Department also said the investigation was aided by social media companies Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Cisco Systems Inc.‘Voodoo Bear’The hackers are part of a group known variously as “Sandworm Team” and “Voodoo Bear” among cybersecurity experts. The group’s espionage and sabotage hacking operations are “highly advanced” and consistent with “Russian economic and national objectives,” according to an analysis by the firm Crowdstrike Inc. The group has an interest in “targeting critical systems” and disrupting infrastructure, according to an analysis by the firm FireEye Inc.The timing of the indictment, weeks before the U.S. presidential election, is notable. A separate hacking unit that is associated with Russia’s GRU meddled in the 2016 U.S. election, and Microsoft Corp. recently found that group attempting to hack political targets ahead of the 2020 election.In addition, one of the defendants in the indictment unsealed on Monday was also charged in 2018 by the U.S. for hacking tied to the 2016 election. He conspired “to gain unauthorized access into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the administration of the 2016 U.S. elections,” according to the Justice Department.The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia is attempting to help President Donald Trump succeed and hurt his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The U.S. also indicted hackers from GRU in October 2018, before the midterm elections. Russia denies any role.The U.K.’s Foreign Office said Monday that the GRU had conducted “cyber reconnaissance against officials and organizations” involved in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games that were to take place in Tokyo over the summer. The games were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Foreign Office added that the GRU tried to make it look like its attacks on the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea was the work of North Korean and Chinese operatives.“The GRU’s actions against the Olympic and Paralympic Games are cynical and reckless. We condemn them in the strongest possible terms,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. “The U.K. will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious cyber attacks.”(Updates with Russia reaction in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Charges 6 Russian Agents for Hacking That Cost Billions

Many will remember the company from the dot-com bubble burst in the late 1990s. Cisco stock reached some astronomical numbers during that time. And although it hasn’t scaled those heights since, it is one of the most consistent stocks around, up approximately 33% over the last five years.
And why not? Cisco has an excellent balance sheet with very little debt. It also boasts excellent operating metrics, juicy dividend yield and is trading at a steep discount to the sector. With so much going for it, it’s hard to argue against Cisco stock right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Cisco Stock Is a Bargain
Although Cisco stock has recovered a bit from the drubbing it received at the height of the pandemic in March, shares are still trading at a 25.79% discount to the 52-week high of $50.28 per share. You can chalk that up to the global economic slowdown brought about by the pandemic. However, not all is doom and gloom. Several companies are in the race to manufacture a commercial Covid-19 vaccine. So, the slowdown should start letting up soon, and hopefully, pent up demand will make up for any lost sales.

Cisco is often regarded as an industry bellwether. So, if the company is facing issues, you can bet your bottom dollar that the rest of the sector is also not doing well. And let’s face it. Small and medium-term businesses are suffering, and they serve as the primary customer base for the company. Still, I believe the markets are being exceptionally unkind to Cisco stock. Yes, there will be lower demand for Cisco’s networking and communication products, but even the estimates indicate that the sluggishness will last for a couple of years. And despite the pandemic, even then, revenues are expected to be around $48 billion to approximately $49 billion during this time before the resumption of growth.

Lock on the Future
If the pandemic has done one thing, it has exponentially increased the importance of essential IT infrastructure. People are understanding that they need fast, reliable networks to manage their workload. You could argue that Covid-19 is actually a boon for Cisco.
Hence, I wouldn’t be too perturbed by the 9% year on year revenue decline during Q4’20. Overall, cash flows and revenues are moving north, while total operating expenses are going down. Another heartening sign is the share count. Cisco was one of the dot com bubble’s original darlings and inked several all-stock deals during its initial heyday. As a result, outstanding share capital ballooned.
Hence, shareholders will be happier that the company has used excess cash to fund buybacks. Cisco has spent a massive $42 billion to repurchase shares between 2017 and 2019, leading to a 12% reduction in outstanding shares.
Heart in the Right Place
Effective management is key to the long term success of any company. It may seem like tech giants like Cisco can go ahead and print money. But success is not a guarantee. And even the best companies can fumble without a reliable, stable guiding light. That’s where Cisco is lucky to have Chuck Robbins as its CEO.
After assuming his duties, in 2015, he initiated a strategy focused on shifting the company’s business mix to increase recurring revenues by using software and services. They now represent 50% of Cisco’s revenue, with subscriptions representing 80% of aggregate software revenue.
Additionally, Cisco is implementing a $1 billion cost-cutting plan to streamline operations during the pandemic. In announcing these initiatives, the company said it was looking to exit from unprofitable areas and focus its attention on transitioning most of Cisco’s portfolio to high growth areas like cloud security, cloud collaboration,and analytics.
My Final Word on Cisco
Cisco’s share price does not reflect the underlying fundamentals of the company. Markets are reacting to the lowered guidance Cisco is putting out. And yes, the company is grappling with short term headwinds that will have a bearing on the bottom line for a few quarters. But the long-term growth story is intact.
That’s why I believe Cisco stock is fairly valued at the moment. Shares are trading at 15.57 times forward price-to-earnings, while the sector is trading at 32.87 times. As of this writing, the company offers a juicy dividend yield of 3.66%, and it has grown at 13% per annum over the last five years. Overall, analysts seem to agree that this guidance shortfall is a minor issue. The 12-month consensus estimate stands at $47.20 per share, a 20.8% upside to current prices.
Long story short, not only is Cisco stock trading at a steep discount to the median, but it also offers a lot of upside by all reports. It’s gotten burned a bit due to its lowered guidance, but that provides you with several more incentives to pick this one up.

Shares of the tech giant have fallen 15% in 2020.IBM reported a 3% year-over-year decline in third-quarter revenue to $17.6 billion. The company said its Cloud & Cognitive Software segment had 7% year-over-year growth.Overall cloud revenue across all IBM business segments was up 19% year-over-year to $6 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, cloud-related revenue has increased 25% year-over-year to $24.4 billion for the company.""The strong performance of our cloud business, led by Red Hat, underscores the growing client adoption of our open hybrid cloud platform,"" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna.The company could be a great play on the increased shift to the cloud during the pandemic. The company said it is well-positioned to ""seize the $1-trillion hybrid cloud opportunity.""IBM pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.63. The company increases this amount for its February payout and could announce a raise during its next quarterly earnings report.Related Link: How The 2020 Presidential Election Could Impact Tech StocksCisco Systems: Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) are down over 20% in 2020.

For all of the relevant information, here is your guide for Thursday's Q1 earnings announcement.Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Cisco Systems analysts model for earnings of $0.7 per share on sales of $11.85 billion. Cisco Systems reported a profit of $0.84 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $13.16 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on CSCOThe Wall Street consensus estimate for earnings would represent a 16.67% decrease for the company.

2020-11-12,"Over the past three months, shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) fell by 6.10%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Cisco Systems has.Cisco Systems's Debt Based on Cisco Systems's financial statement as of September 3, 2020, long-term debt is at $11.58 billion and current debt is at $3.00 billion, amounting to $14.58 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $11.81 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.77 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Cisco Systems's $94.85 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.15. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-13,"Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) shares are trading solidly higher after the networking giant  reported  strongly quarterly results and issued an upbeat forecast for the running quarter.The Cisco Analysts:  Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Overweight rating and $54 price target.Needham analyst Alex Henderson maintained a Hold rating.Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold maintained an Outperform rating and $49 price target.Cisco Analyst Says Networking Footprint Overlooked: Cisco reported first-quarter revenue roughly in line with estimates -- a better-than-feared result, given the lingering weak enterprise spend environment, Morgan Stanley analyst Marshall said in a note.""Ability to perform with relative stability through a significantly weakened macro environment, preserve earnings power and maintain cash flow flexibility highlights our OW investment thesis on CSCO,"" the analyst said. Cisco has the flexibility to grow earnings relatively in line with the S&P 500, she said.The company delivered first-quarter results with a markedly improved tone as opposed to the uncertainty expressed in the fourth-quarter report, Marshall said.With business activity improving and earnings surprising to the upside due to more resilient margins than expected, investors are likely to heave a sigh of relief, the analyst said.Full recovery in the enterprise and commercial environment is a few quarters out, but positive offsets due to diversification came to fruition in the first quarter, she said.Cisco's uniquely large networking footprint spans across product categories, including higher-priority security and collaboration software products and across customer verticals including more resilient public sector and service provider cohorts, according to Morgan Stanley. ""We think this is too far overlooked, with CSCO trading near a historical high discount relative to the S&P500.""Related Link:  Firm Results from Disney, Cisco Help Market Back After Thursday's Slide Cisco Comps Get Easier, Needham Says:  Cisco reported a 9% year-over-year decline in revenue, dragged by a steep 13.1% drop in product revenue that came on top of a decline in the year-ago period, Needham analyst Henderson said in a note. Orders declined 5% year-over-year, with only the public sector bucking the downtrend with a 5% increase, the analyst said.The company said order linearity in the quarter was relatively stable, suggesting there wasn't a pick up in orders later in the quarter, he said. ""Given the Y/Y declines in Orders in each of the last 5 quarters, the comps are bound to get easier."" View more earnings on CSCOEPS held up reasonably well in the quarter as well as in the guidance, Henderson said, adding that the 7% reduction in force Cisco implemented should help margins.RayJay Says Cisco Can Return To Year-Over-Year Growth: The 1% year-over-year drop suggested by the second-quarter revenue guidance came as a surprise, as expectations were for a decline between 3.4% and 10%, Raymond James analyst Leopold said in a note. ""Considering negative sentiment, management's constructive tone, and improved fundamentals, we expect short-term appreciation above the after-hours ~7%,"" the analyst said. RayJay is of the view that Cisco can return to year-over-year growth with the easy comparisons beginning in April.Rosenblatt Says Security, Video Are Bright Spots:  Strong first-quarter linearity enabled management to convey a much more confident tone than in the last quarter, Rosenblatt analyst Koontz said in a note. Among product areas, security was strong, driven by work-from-home upgrades, and the Webex collaboration also remained solid within the applications group, the analyst said.Cisco, which still holds a very strong share in enterprise, is doubling down on its effort to fend off continued share loss to Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM), he said.Webex reportedly now totals 600 million users in October, double from March, Henderson said.In comparison, Zoom Video boasts of 300 million daily users, including free ones, the analyst said.Infrastructure products, accounting for 53% of revenue, saw a 16% year-over-year decline even as key rivals such as Arista Networks Inc (NYSE: ANET) and Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR) continued to gain share, with both posting mid-single digit enterprise infrastructure declines, he said.""CSCO strengths in select product segments such as security and video collaboration bode well, including areas it has strong but declining share.""Further Upside Exists For Cisco, Tigress Says:  Cisco is seeing improving demand, as corporations and governments are resuming spending on networking equipment as the economy slowly recovers, Tigress Financials analyst Iven Feinseth said.Cisco's industry-leading position and strong brand equit enable it to benefit from key secular IT trends, including cloud migration, AI development, the  high-speed 5G network rollout, WiFi 6 and the increasing connectivity needs of the IoT, the analyst said.Additionally, new product offerings, including AppD, Catalyst 9000 and HyperFlex, will continue to drive accelerating growth, he said.""I believe further upside exists from current levels and continue to recommend purchase.""Cisco also has a dividend yield of 3.72%, Feinseth said.CSCO Price Action:  At last check, Cisco shares were soaring 6.69% to $41.26.Related Link:  Zoom Video Is A Battle Between Fundamentals And Technicals, Says Jenny Harrington Latest Ratings for CSCO  DateFirmActionFromTo  Nov 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsNeutral  Oct 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsNeutral  Oct 2020CitigroupDowngradesBuyNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for CSCO   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Li Auto Hits Fresh Highs As Q3 Revenues Surge, Loss Narrows In First Quarterly Report  * The Daily Biotech Pulse: Urovant In M&A Deal, Sanofi's Binary Event, Conference Presentations(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-13,"Shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $41.1.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-18  * Strike Price: $41.00  * Volume: 585  * Open Interest: 6347Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 12 Technology Stocks Moving In Friday's Pre-Market Session  * 12 Technology Stocks Moving In Thursday's After-Market Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares jumped as much as 9.6% after the company’s second-quarter forecast indicated it will beat analysts’ projections and suggested corporations and governments are beginning to resume spending on networking gear as the economy slowly recovers.Revenue in the quarter ending in January will be flat to down 2% from a year earlier, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts on average had projected a decline of 3%. Profit, excluding certain items, will be 74 cents to 76 cents a share. Wall Street was looking for 74 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the company traded as high $42.38 in extended trading, after closing at $38.67 in New York.“Our customers worked very hard to get workers set up from home then they took a breather,” Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in an interview. “In this past quarter many of them have started executing on projects. Businesses are saying: ‘I don’t know when this is going to end, but it’s going to end, so we need to do this to be ready.’”A large portion of Cisco’s revenue comes from purchases of expensive network hardware by government agencies, corporations and video and phone service providers. That makes its results an early indicator of business confidence. Robbins is trying to get more sales from software and subscriptions, but progress has been disrupted during the pandemic by a drop off in demand for internet switches and other gear.In Cisco’s Americas region, sales fell 10%. Robbins has called on U.S. politicians to agree on a stimulus package to help the economy weather the impact of the pandemic. The outgoing Trump administration has pulled back from those negotiations, though, leaving it to Congress. In other regions, attempts to boost economies hurt by the pandemic helped to lift government spending on infrastructure, Robbins said.Robbins’s focus on software and services is a response to changes in networking technology, which relies less on pricey hardware these days. The strategy helped Cisco return to growth -- until the pandemic hit. In the company’s 2020 fiscal year, which ended in July, revenue fell 5% and analysts are predicting another decline this fiscal year.The company is making progress with some of the biggest purchasers of technology -- cloud service providers, Robbins said. Cisco is getting orders from the group, which includes Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., by breaking with its past. Instead of offering expensive proprietary boxes of locked-down software built on custom components, the company is selling individual parts, just software or whatever combination these customers want, he said.Cisco also hired Scott Herren to be the company’s new chief financial officer. Robbins said Herren‘s background at software company Autodesk Inc. will help Cisco accelerate its efforts in that area.Cisco said fiscal first-quarter profit fell to $2.2 billion, or 51 cents a share, from $2.9 billion, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 9% to $11.93 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco made a profit of 76 cents a share. Analysts projected profit of 71 cents a share on sales of $11.85 billion.Infrastructure platforms, Cisco’s hardware business and main source of revenue, suffered a 16% sales decline, while services rose 2%. Applications, the software business, saw revenue fall 8%.

2020-11-13,"After a week that's been all over the place, stocks begin Friday with a firmer tone thanks to two sturdy earnings reports. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) led the charge in pre-market trading. Both surprised investors with stronger than expected results late Thursday, and CSCO also provided a hefty dose of positive guidance. Shares of DIS rose 4% before the bell and CSCO rose 7%. CSCO had a really, really nice report. They're a company with a great grasp on business conditions worldwide, so when they talk about things getting better, it often gives people confidence. We say it often, but be ready for a choppy ride that could last the rest of the year. This week has plenty of examples, though volatility eased early today as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) fell below 25. The market soared Monday and plunged Thursday as sentiment quickly changed based on virus developments. Now it looks like Friday has a chance to move back into the green. Investors could be in for a lot more of this see-saw ride in weeks to come.Thursday's slide wasn't all that surprising considering the negative headlines about potential and actual shutdowns as COVID-19 cases keep steadily rising around the country. There was a lot of hope earlier this year that Q4 could be a time of economic recovery. It's a bit harder to imagine that now as restaurants, gyms, airlines, and other businesses face virus-related pressures. It's beginning to dawn on many people that while a vaccine could ultimately be great, a lot of logistics go on around it. Who's going to get it first? How does it get distributed? It may be May or June before it's widely available to the least vulnerable people, meaning some analysts now don't see things getting back toward normal till late summer or fall. Disney Results Reflect Bifurcated Nature Of Company That would be bad news for DIS. Theme parks have become its number-one source of revenue, and those continue to suffer, along with the movie franchise being off a bit. The launch of Disney+ streaming ended up being fortuitous timing for DIS, but now is overshadowed a bit by strict rules in California that might prevent Disneyland from reopening for quite some time. Company leaders expressed disappointment on that front.Generally, it looked like a good quarter despite the theme park struggles. Investors sent shares higher in pre-market trading in response to a nice gain in Disney+ subscribers, lower than expected losses and better than expected revenue. The parks and entertainment segments remained under huge pressure during the company's Q4. Media networks and direct-to-consumer did well. It's kind of a bifurcated company until the virus dies down. DIS also has a big business in China. Stocks there have chopped around for several months since that amazing summer rally, and recently came under pressure from regulatory fears surrounding China's tech sector. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) remains in the spotlight as Beijing seems to be locking horns with the company's leader. This remains worth watching for any potential impact not only on Chinese tech stocks but on many U.S. tech stocks with exposure there. On a positive note, both sides in Washington still seem to want some sort of stimulus before the end of the year. It's looking less likely that Democrats will get the large number they wanted, considering how close the election ended up being. Either way, getting some money back into the economy could help, especially if it's a long wait for the vaccine. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated the Fed's desire for a stimulus package. He also said it could be tough sledding for the economy in coming months, which probably weighed on stocks. So, apparently, did comments from the Republican Senate majority leader that he prefers a smaller stimulus than Democrats proposed. Treasury yields drew back from recent highs in the 0.95% range for the 10-year, but don't seem to be on a swift ride back toward the lows, either. The yield of 0.88% early Friday probably reflects recent firm economic data, including lower than expected weekly jobless claims. While claims continue falling, there's not much relief for the travel sector. Those stocks have been all over the place this week depending on virus and vaccine news, so care is warranted for anyone investing there unless you're ready for a lot of fast swings. These companies remain fragile in the current environment, to say the least. Some cruise stocks ended Thursday down as much as 30% from their Monday highs.Less Taxing Holiday Season Ahead? One healthy development for stocks could be less pressure toward the end of the year from tax-related selling. The same close election that probably doomed a huge stimulus package might also have reduced chances of any major tax legislation next year. Before the election, there was concern a potential ""blue wave"" might raise chances of rising corporate and capital gains taxes in 2021, preceded by some investors rushing toward the exits before the end of 2020 to take advantage of the old rules. The way it looks now, there might be some tax legislation introduced in the next Congress, but the close political divide makes any dramatic changes appear less likely. Meaning, perhaps, less selling pressure late this year than we might have seen otherwise. Lack of a major new tax bill could also mean less of a brake on the economy next year, which might be one factor behind the recent strength in Treasury yields. The good thing that's not really publicized much around higher rates is that they allow the Financial sector to potentially come out and play a bit more, and that's the second-largest sector in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Speaking of the SPX, it still hasn't managed to close above its all-time high finish of 3580 record in early September. Failure to top that close in a couple of rallies early this week means it remains the technical level to watch. A finish above that--which would take a pretty strong move today--might suggest further gains to come. However, valuations remain near historic highs despite what's been a generally nice earnings season, so that might be a barrier. Looking ahead to next week, retail earnings come into focus as Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) report. Data-wise, the standouts include retail sales and existing home sales for October.CHART OF THE DAY: LOWER HIGHS FOR TECH, STAPLES CATCHING UP. One sign of technical weakness analysts often track is a series of lower highs. This chart of the Tech sector (IXT--candlestick) shows it struggling to make new highs over the last three months. Meanwhile, the Consumer Staples sector (IXR--purple line)--which generally is seen as a more conservative place to invest--is nibbling at Tech's feet with only a slightly worse performance over that time frame. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  No News Not Good News: Yesterday's consumer price index (CPI) for October was as flat as a pancake, and that's not the best thing to hear. Both the headline and core inflation numbers resembled a famous movie frat brother's grade point average: 0.0. Investors, and the Fed, for that matter, had probably been hoping for something a little bigger, because inflation tends to be a sign of economic growth. While no single month is a trend, these numbers didn't deliver. On the one hand, you could say flat prices are good for the market because they leave pressure off the Fed to consider raising rates, but that's in normal times. The times we're in aren't normal, and the Fed has said it could let inflation swing above 2% for a while to get employment back on track. Numbers like these don't get you there. What's in Your Basket? You might read that note above on inflation and ask how it's possible CPI could be so low when your receipts tell a different story. Fair enough. There's long been people calling for the government to change how it measures inflation, saying it doesn't fully account for the average costs of many goods and services. Maybe the price of a television, for instance, went down, but who buys a television every time they go to the store? Some argue that the inflation report doesn't measure more meaningful things like how much you pay for your daily commute on the train (have you checked those prices now vs. 10 years ago?) or how much you fork out for your kids' college education. The Fed, for that matter, has long said that its favorite inflation measure isn't the monthly CPI and producer price index (PPI) reports, but the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report. This monthly data breaks down expenditures on goods and services a little more than the CPI, and also adjusts for changes in consumer behavior. That said, recent PCE reports haven't shown much inflation, either, so if that leaves you grumbling, you might still not be satisfied with the accuracy. Note From Washington: While this isn't a political column, it's obvious that Washington remains on a lot of investors' minds. Some market participants question how volatility could be down so much since the election even while drama continues around the results. The VIX finished up moderately Thursday amid the virus worries, but ended well below its early peak near 27. It's quite a bit below peaks of 40 in the lead-up to the election. Without any attempt to take sides, let's just say the market (meaning the sum of everyone participating) appears to be communicating that it's not concerned with these legal challenges to the election results. If things changed and the results did get unwound (which, from an objective standpoint, seems unlikely), that would probably inject a ton of volatility into the mix. Volatility staying in check (for now, anyway) likely reflects widespread sentiment that ultimately things will proceed normally. If there's any change in that sentiment, it would probably show up first in VIX, so it's worth watching.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-11-20,"5G stocks may be one of the next hot stock market trends to monitor in 2020 and beyond. In a recent article on The Wall Street Journal, investors could get an idea about how important the 5G network is not only for the future but for now.
“The U.S. military is preparing to fight on a new battlefield: the 5G networks going up around the world,” according to the article. “The Pentagon is testing how lightning-fast 5G networks could transform warfare, from training and logistics to mission planning and communications to new battlefield tactics like the deployment of drone swarms. It is throwing a lot of money at harnessing the new technology—partly, analysts say, with an eye on China, which has made 5G a military priority.”
The numbers in the sector are eye-popping. “The global 5G services market size is estimated to reach USD 41.48 billion by 2020 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.9% from 2021 to 2027,” according to a Grand View Research report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The growth of 5G should impact many business sectors, from manufacturing, energy, and utility to media and entertainment, retail, and construction.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a special section on its website explaining what 5G is, and mentioning that 5G’s applications include “enhanced mobile broadband, mission-critical communications, and the massive IoT.” The critical communications sector is one of the priorities set by the Pentagon.
Tech stocks have outperformed the stock market compared to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, and the Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSEARCA:FIVG), which is composed of companies that have business activities focused on the development of 5G network, has outperformed the broader market in 2020. Some of the top holdings include Qualcomm, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI).


					7 Cyclical Stocks Still Hoping for Another Stimulus Round				

Here are three 5G stocks that you can consider buying based on their prospects, fundamentals and valuation:
Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)

5G Stocks: Skyworks (SWKS)

As the 5G network requires substantial capital expenditures, the majority of the companies involved in this future of telecommunications turn to debt financing for the expansion of their business activities.
Skyworks has almost zero debt and a very strong balance sheet. Its forward dividend and yield are $2 and 1.45% respectively. Not much, but what I like about this stock is its five-year trend of revenue, profitability, and free cash flows.
For the past five years, it has shown a relatively stable trend in key financial metrics, which is not easy. And with a current net margin of 24.28%, profitability is very attractive. Zacks estimates an expected earnings-per-share of growth of 12.44% for the next three to five years. And with an increased dividend for the past few years, prospects look good for a stock that balances between value and growth.

AT&T (T)

For AT&T, wireless communication remains its largest business, and the company offers nationwide 5G network plans to cover most of the consumer’s needs.
It’s another company with a strong cash position, a strong balance sheet, and good positive free cash flows. The 5G network expansion is a very important priority as AT&T “has revealed that it has stepped up its Capex related investment in networks to $5 billion in the first quarter of 2020 as compared with capital expenditures of $3.8 billion in Q4 2019.”


					7 of the Best Stocks to Buy as We Head Into the Holidays				

While the expected growth for the next three to five years is 3.42%, this stock has an attractive dividend yield. Its forward dividend and yield are $2.08 and 7.27% respectively, compared to the average S&P 500 yield of about 1.64%.

Cisco (CSCO)
Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com

	
Another 5G stock to consider is Cisco. The most recent quarterly earnings report released on Nov. 13, 2020, was a strong one, as both revenue and earnings were better than expected. “The company said it earned 76 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter, above consensus forecasts of 70 cents. Sales fell 9.6% to $11.9 billion, though came in slightly above analysts’ forecasts.” as reported on TheStreet.
CSCO stock is another value stock with decent yet not excessive growth. Zacks estimates an expected growth of 6.67% for earnings-per-share for the next three to five years. The forward dividend and yield of $1.44 and 3.48% respectively are attractive.
2018 was a year of challenge for CSCO stock, with a collapse in the profitability. Its net margin for 2018 fell to 0.22% compared to 20.02% in 2017. But a turnaround seems to be underway and be resilient too. Profitability has grown and the stock has a net margin of 22.75% for 2020. Free cash flows are strong. Plus, the two past consecutive increases in dividend show a stock that could provide income and price appreciation.
These 5G stocks have the potential to perform well as 5G infrastructure investments are set to increase in 2020. But as always, investing comes risks, and competition in the 5G market is expected to be intense.

2020-11-20,"Hacks happen to the most conscientious among us. Your credit cards, bank accounts, retailer-held account information and other types of individual identification data and information are all lucrative opportunities for all sorts of bad actors around the globe.
And hacks occur every day on a 24/7 basis every second. The Breach Level Index from major defense contractor, Thales (OTCMKTS:THLLY) tracks data hacks. That measure reported more than 9.7 billion record hacks over the trailing six-plus years. And according to the same sources, the U.S. is the leading target, with 85% of all global identity thefts directed at Americans.
Thales goes on to say that on average, hackers hit and steal 75 record every single second of every single day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
And if you think that traditional firewalls and antivirus security keeps you safe? Nope — Thycotic, a Washington-based data security company (private) has interviewed “black hat” hackers, 73% of whom say the traditional security you depend upon is pretty much irrelevant.
And just hacking and getting data, and credit card and every other type of data isn’t the goal of hackers. Using it for fortune or fame is. And this is where the Dark Web – the underbelly of the internet – is there for all of the illicit transactions for any an all bent on mayhem.
The Clock is Ticking
Not a second goes by when you, your family or your company aren’t under attack. Your phone, tablet, laptop wi-fi network and even your smart appliances — if it’s on a network, somebody wants access.
It starts with phishing, where legitimate-looking emails asking for account confirmation can open up hell for those that click “continue.” Malware can embed itself into any device, providing all sorts of tracking or other data. And hackers also know social engineering can get you to willingly click on a link with disaster at the ready.
And all sorts of organizations have suffered at the hands of ransomware, which can lock up data and even entire networks unless a payment is made.
Companies also face all sorts of even more threatening actions that can include distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, which inundate servers with requests to lock up the site, causing webpages or webservices to completely shut down.
These and plenty of other threats are being developed and improved on a daily basis, making cybersecurity an absolute necessity. And you can see that shown via business investment in hardware, software and services, all of which have seen significant rise in spending. And even for 2020, with business capital expenditures dropping significantly overall in the U.S. and beyond, investing in global cybersecurity products and service continues to rise and rise strongly.

The International Data Corporation is one of the leading data and intelligence companies for information technology, communications and general technology. IDC recently reported that from 2016 through 2021, spending on cybersecurity products and services should see growth around 8.00% on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
And that’s a big growth rate when it comes to a multi-billion-dollar market.
The companies behind our various devices and networks are increasingly a bigger and bigger deal. And even with all of the market mayhem this year has wrought, the leading companies are grabbing business and generating more revenue, and the stock market has taken notice.

As remote work and quarantines persist around the world, the need for network capabilities and security has soared. And with Covid-19 cases skyrocketing again around the U.S. and beyond, optimism isn’t high when it comes to getting back to our old normal.


					7 Cyclical Stocks Still Hoping for Another Stimulus Round				

Here are 7 cybersecurity stocks to buy for defense against the dark web:
Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA)
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)
CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD)
Cloudflare (NYSE:NET)
Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS)
Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP)
Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW)
If and when vaccines and treatments are developed and more importantly deployed — network capabilities and security needs are still going to firmly remain as IDC data and compiled forecasts present. So, even as plenty of the product and services companies have gotten a lot of market attention this year — there are plenty of reasons to nibble on their stocks in a very growing market sector.

7 Cybersolution Stocks To Buy: Okta (OKTA)

Okta is a company that makes life simpler for users. When you log into your Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Box (NYSE:BOX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or even your Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounts you will be using the security of Okta. And it makes it easy to access accounts from any type of device with similar high-level security. Plus Okta keeps track of password and usernames for users while keeping them safe on various platforms.
The company states that it has over 3,000 corporate customers serving millions upon millions of users. And all this from a company that only just came public back in 2017.
Revenue for the trailing year is up by 46.80% and this continues to be par for the course as annual revenues for the past five years continues to climb at a CAGR of 55.89%.
Source: Okta Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
So sales growth is working. But cost control and investment for growth aren’t helping margins. Operating margin for the company is running at a negative 31.7% for a negative return on shareholder’s equity.
Yet this stock continues to grab investors’ attention, including via participation in various technology ETFs. The stock has returned a whopping 1221.18% since its initial public offering — growth is being bought and keeps getting bought.
Source: Okta Total Return – Source: Bloomberg

	
Now, it does have a lots of cash and equivalents on hand to provide coverage over liabilities out a year running at 290%. But it also has debt which is pretty high at 56.5% of assets. But given its client base and users and the go-go growth in revenue, the company should continue to garner positive stock market attention as well as from creditors if needed or wanted.

Cisco Systems (CSCO)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com

	
Cisco Systems continues to be one of the go-to providers of what makes networks, networks. Routers, switches, servers and the software to make them work securely are among the products and services Cisco is well-known for. And data centers around the globe, including those in my favorite data center real estate investment trusts (REITs) Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) and Corporate Office Properties (NYSE:OFC), keep Cisco services humming away behind windowless walls.
Cisco may be an old-line company, but it is still very relevant for networks and cybersecurity. Without at least some of its products, other, more popular companies would be severely curtailed.
Revenue was challenged this year given the company still relies upon one-off hardware sales. But growth in revenue over time has been dependable if not that huge, with gains over the past thirty years expanding by an average of 24.38% on a CAGR basis.

Cisco still sells stuff and services — but it does so at a much more profitable basis than some of its peers that I’m discussing here. Operating margins are fat at 27.60%, and in turn fuels a return on shareholder equity at a very attractive 28.80%.
The company has ample cash on hand, amounting to 170% of current liabilities out one year. And it has low debt, at just 16.40% of assets.
The stock has returned 82.59% over the past trailing five years, close in line with the general S&P 500 Index.

And despite those returns, the stock is still a value play compared to many of its peers in networking and security. CSCO is valued at only 3.70 times trailing sales and only 4.66 times its intrinsic value (book).

And then we come to the dividend — it yields 3.40% and has been climbing in the distribution by an average rate of 11.76% for the past five years.

CrowdStrike is an appropriately-named company providing all sorts of protections for companies, networks, service companies and end-point users and customers. Revenue over just the trailing year is up by 92.70%. But there’s clear evidence that the company isn’t just a flash in the pan. Over the past five years, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for company revenue has been running at an astonishing 92.26%.
Source: CrowdStrike Holdings Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
Now for the less than stellar news. Like other hyper-tech companies, the company is so fired up over sales and growth that margins are not that great. In fact, operating margins are running at a loss of 30.30% making for not-so-positive return on shareholder equity. But the company has no real debt and piles of cash amounting to 240% of liabilities going out for the next twelve months. So it can be forgiven for the fixation on growth.
The stock reflects that attention to growth, as it has returned 316.93% since March 16 to date alone.

The stock recently took a pause on October 13, and has pulled back by 9.97%. Valuations, as for its peers, are sky-high, but that’s the market for this sector, making this stock a buy on the pull-back.

So far, aside from Cisco, our list has a theme of sales growth unconcerned with margins, and that continues for Cloudflare. Operating margins are negative 37.60%, leading to a negative return on equity.
But the good news beyond soaring sales is that the company has little to no debt, with debt to assets running at only a barely-there level of 1.30%. Plus cash and equivalents are running at 820% of near-term liabilities over the next year.

This stock is newer to the public market, with a September 2019 IPO. But since then investors have seen a return of 336.47%.

Valuations are about parity for its peer group, making for a value-proposition on a buy.

Zscaler is a company focused on cybersecurity. It provides cloud-based internet security controls for both fixed and mobile devices. This company is a gate keeper for companies around the U.S., protecting companies and their customers from all of the usual threats and attacks.
It is one of the more respected companies in the security market, with a good track record and a wide customer base that is expanding rapidly.
Sales are up over the trailing year by 42.40%. And this is part of a longer-term proven record of sales gains. Over the past five years, revenue is up on average by 53.39% on a CAGR basis.

While growth for growth’s sake is the history of the company,  its negative margins are still deemed manageable and in line with some of its peers in this discussion, with operating margin at a negative 26.40%. But again, that still results in a negative return on equity.
The company has also been tapping credit and debt markets to pad its capability, resulting in debts amounting to 49.40% of assets. However, cash and equivalents are running at 370% of current liabilities going out for a year.

But negative margins for now and a bit more debt don’t seem to bother stakeholders. The stock has been working well for investors and traders. Since its IPO in 2018 it has returned 738.94% — so growth is good even without profits for now.

Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP)

Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is an information technology security company focused on corporate networks and internet service providers. For companies with remote workers as well as online customers, Check Point provides verification and control products and services. And for service and internet providers, the company provides secure logon and protection from various attack types such as DDOS.
The company has also been expanding by buying and integrating companies  including Cymplify and ForceNock.
Check Point is a bit more of a slow and reliable grower of revenue, with sales continuing to advance. Over the past ten years quarterly revenue has been gaining at an average CAGR of 4.92%.

But the slower but very steady approach to sales growth comes with actual profitability. Operating margins are very good at 44.20%. And in turn, the company has a very positive return on shareholders’ equity, at 24.50%.
The stock is reflective of the steady gains in revenue and the profitability of the company. Shares have returned 176.04% over the trailing ten years.

No dividend, but debt is nearly zero compared to assets and the company has ample cash and cash equivalents amounting to 150% of current liabilities.

Plus this stock is a comparable value at only 4.98 times intrinsic value (book) and 8.30 times trailing sales.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW)

Palo Alto Networks is another network security company with heavy-duty firewall products and services to limit hacks and DDOS attacks as well as data theft. It was initially based in fixed networks, but has since expanded for mobile devices and become a go-to company during the ramp up in remote work and stay-at-home this year.
PANW focuses on quickly identifying approved usersand also works to limit access per customer needs and wants. This means that customers can use its services to customize not only who can get access, but to what and when. This is increasingly important and provides the company with some competitive advantages in the market for network security.
Revenue is up by 17.50% over the trailing year. And the company has similar history of ramping up revenues year after year with the average for the trailing five years running at an increasing rate of 25.11% on a CAGR basis.
Source: Palo Alto Networks Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
The company is getting better on cost controls with operating margins now running at a lower rate of negative 5.30% — but this still means negative return on shareholders’ equity. Debt is controlled at 38.40% of assets and the company is in good shape with current cash and cash equivalents running at 190% of current liabilities.
The stock has delivered a pretty good return since its IPO back in 2012, with a total return of 584.11%.

The company is delivering security for customers and good returns for shareholders. And this stock is a comparable value for the sector group, valued at 7.70 times trailing sales.

Over 80 years ago, economist Benjamin Graham, who later inspired Warren Buffett, among others, first put forward the idea of investing in shares that sold at a discount to their intrinsic value.
Markets have had an incredible run-up since the lows hit in mid-March. Thus, it may feel as it there are no bargains to be found in the universe of robust shares. However, our markets are large and diverse enough to offer solid companies that are selling at discounts.

Investors should ideally not overpay for a firm’s growth potential. With that information, here are seven of the best cheap stocks for December:


					10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investors Under 30				

AT&T (NYSE:T)
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)
FedEx (NYSE:FDX)
Fulgent Genetics (NASDAQ:FLGT)
International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT)
PPL (NYSE:PPL)

AT&T (T)
Source: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock

	
52-Week range: $ 26.08 – $39.55
Dividend yield: 7.12%
Our first stock on this list of cheap stocks is Dallas, Texas-based tech group AT&T, which has global operations in telecommunications, media and entertainment. So far in 2020, T shares are down over 25%, pushing the dividend yield to over 7%. A juicy payout is an important reason for the continued interest in the stock.
AT&T reported Q3 earnings in late October. Consolidated revenues of $42.3 billion showed a decline of 5.1% YoY. Five main segments contribute to revenues:
Mobility (revenue up 1.1% YoY);
Entertainment Group (revenue down 10.2% YoY);
Business Wireline (revenue down 2.5% YoY);
WarnerMedia (revenue down 10% YoY);
Latin America (revenue down 19.3% YoY).
Quarterly adjusted net income of $2.8 billion means EPS of 76 cents. In the year-ago quarter, comparable metrics had been $3.7 billion and 94 cents. Free cash flow was $8.3 billion.
CEO John Stankey said, “Our strong cash flow in the quarter positions us to continue investing in our growth areas and pay down debt. We now expect 2020 free cash flow of $26 billion or higher with a full-year dividend payout ratio in the high 50s%.”
We believe the shares offer an opportunity for both capital appreciation and passive income.

Cisco (CSCO)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com

	
52-Week range: $32.40 – $50.28
Dividend yield: 3.38%
San Jose, California-based Cisco focuses on networking, communications, security, collaboration, and the cloud. The tech giant helps customers transport data, voice and video traffic.
The group reported FY21 Q1 in November. Revenue was $11.9 billion, a 9% decrease of YoY compared to $13.2 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $3.211 billion, representing a diluted non-GAAP EPS of 76 cents. Last year, the respective numbers had been $3.6 billion and 84 cents. Net cash flow provided by operating activities in the quarter was $4.1 billion.
Chuck Robbins, chairman and CEO, was pleased with results. CFO Kelly Kramer commented:
Our Q1 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a challenging environment. We continued to transform our business through more software offerings and subscriptions, driving 10% year over year growth in remaining performance obligations. We delivered strong growth in operating cash flow and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders.
In past quarters, Cisco has, at times, found it difficult to grow its top line and its stock price has reflected the growth challenge. Nonetheless, transformation efforts are well underway as management diversifies into software and cloud support services.

Future quarters are likely to see top-line increases from recurring, high-margin, cloud-related and subscription services.

CVS Health (CVS)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com

	
52-Week range: $52.04 – $77.03
Dividend yield: 2.92%
Rhode Island-based CVS Health is an integrated pharmacy healthcare company. As the parent company of CVS Pharmacy, it is the largest pharmacy services group stateside. Since this spring, it has been offering Covid-19 testing in 4,000 CVS Pharmacy locations.
CVS Health operates through three segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits. In early November, it released Q3 results. Revenue totaled $67.1 billion, up 3.5% YoY. The increase was driven by growth in the Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.66. A year ago, it was $1.84, a 21% decrease from $1.17 during the same period of the previous year. Net income also decreased 20.3% to $1.22 billion.
Management increased the full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.35-$7.45 from $7.14-$7.27. Cash flow from operations guidance range was also increased to $12.75 billion-$13.25 billion from $11 billion-$11.5 billion.
As of this writing, forward P/E and P/S ratios are 8.79 and 0.33, respectively. We find CVS shares undervalued and would look to buy the dips in this integrated healthcare powerhouse.

FedEx (FDX)
Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com

	
52-Week range: $88.69  – $293.30
Dividend yield: 0.89%
Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx offers transportation and logistics services worldwide.
FedEx delivered robust FY21 Q1 results in mid-September. Total non-GAAP revenue for was $19.3 billion and increased 13.5% YoY. Adjusted non-GAAP income was $1.28 billion and increased 60% compared to same period FY20 ($800 million). Non-GAAP diluted EPS came at $4.87.
Management highlighted, “Operating results increased due to volume growth in FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services, yield improvement at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and one additional operating weekday. These factors were partially offset by costs to support strong demand and to expand services.”
Put another way, the effect of the pandemic has so far been mixed on the results. Investors also noted various ongoing costs related to the integration of TNT Express, which FedEx acquired in mid-2016. These costs affect the GAAP results reported and will continue to do so for several more quarters.


					7 Weak-Looking SPACs to Avoid Right Now				

The company is likely to benefit from sales around the holiday season as well as international shipments. If you believe that increased e-commerce activity will continue to affect parcel carriers like FedEx positively, you should keep the shares on your shopping list of cheap stocks.

Fulgent Genetics (FLGT)
Source: Connect world / Shutterstock.com

	
52-Week range: $6.70 – $52.47
Dividend yield: N/A
Founded in 2011, California-based Fulgent Genetics develops flexible and affordable genetic testing, such as cancer, neo-natal, and pre-natal screening. Its tests can also be customized as per customer requirements by combining next generation sequencing (NGS) with its technology platform. In recent weeks, it also started offering FDA-authorized Covid-19 testing solutions to businesses and schools.
Fulgent Genetics released Q3 results in early November. Record revenue of $101.7 million meant an increase of 883% YoY. Non-GAAP income for FY20 Q3 was $49 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $2.08 per share.
Paul Kim, CFO, cited, “Our third quarter results represent a meaningful inflection point in our business, with our test volume growing almost 5,000% year over year and revenue growing almost 900% … finally, we recorded deferred revenue of approximately $18 million as of September 30, 2020.”
Investors were pleased with these robust top-line and bottom-line metrics. FLGT stock is up significantly from the lows seen in early spring. However, the business is not yet richly valued and we would look to buy the dips in this genetic screening company. In the coming quarters, Fulgent Genetics could also become a takeover candidate.

International Game Technology (IGT)

52-Week range: $3.59 – $15.56
Dividend yield: 5.96%
The next stock on this list of cheap stocks comes from the other side of the Atlantic. London-headquartered International Game Technology manufactures and sells computerized gaming equipment and software, including slot machines, interactive gaming machines, and lottery technology. The company works with governments and regulators in over 100 countries.
The group announced Q3 results in November. Consolidated revenue was $982 million and decreased 15% YoY. International Game Technology reports revenue in two segments:
Global Lottery (quarterly revenue up 3% YoY);
Global Gaming (quarterly revenue down 31% YoY).
Adjusted net income was $54 million and increased 25%. Adjusted net income per diluted share were 26 cents compared to 21 cents in the prior year. The company also delivered $220 million in positive free cash flow in the quarter.
CFO Max Chiara commented: “Robust cash flow generation during the quarter and year-to-date periods have enabled us to improve our liquidity and reduce net debt… [T]he improvement in our profitability should support our continued focus on reducing debt.”


					7 Upcoming IPOs to Watch Heading Into 2021				

During the quarter, the group signed 2-year contract extension with New York Lottery. The continued re-opening of casinos and betting establishments should provide further tailwinds for the shares. However, a potential pullback toward $11 would improve the margin of safety.

PPL (PPL)

52-Week range: $18.12 – $36.83
Dividend yield: 5.41%
Headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, PPL Corporation is a utility group providing energy services to more than 10 million customers in the U.S. and the U.K. The company generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky.
PPL released Q3 results in early November. Revenues was $1.89 billion, a 2.5% decline from $1.93 billion during Q3 2019. Three segments contribute to revenues, namely U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. Adjusting earnings were $450 million, or 58 cents per share. A year ago, they had been $445 million, or 61 cents per share.
Vincent Sorg, president and CEO said:
While COVID-19 and milder weather through the first half of the year have impacted PPL’s ongoing earnings, we are on track to achieve the low end of our earnings guidance and have narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
Earlier in the year, management announced plans to sell the U.K. business, a large contributor to the operations. Such a sale would enable PPL to pay down long-term debt or buy U.S.-based assets. Therefore, potential investors may want to keep an eye on the developments. Nonetheless, we like the shares for the long-run.

2020-11-25,"On Wednesday, shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $42.41.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-04-16  * Strike Price: $35.00  * Volume: 1125  * Open Interest: 1657Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

While the broader situation didn’t look too hot for NOK stock, especially with rivals like Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) faring so much better, the Finnish telecom-equipment provider has demonstrated occasional signs of life.

But with shares looking decidedly bearish since late August of this year, I’m afraid NOK stock is running out of time.
This isn’t meant to be a hit job. Rather, I’m speaking to the reality of the market. No matter how much management tries to conjure up a recovery narrative, the longer shares disappoint, the more likely it is that investors will punch out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Forget fundamental or technical factors for a moment; this is just simple human psychology.


					7 Cheap Stocks Ready for Big Gains in 2021				

But critically, even if Nokia has a few tricks up its sleeves, the competition is also boxing the organization into an awkward position. That’s the claim that my InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blakenhorn made. Specifically, Blakenhorn argues convincingly that 5G isn’t just about carriers. Indeed, data centers that underline cloud-based innovations could be the real benefactors.
Lack of Credibility Is Hurting NOK Stock
Now, this allows opportunities for Nokia, but also opens new challenges. Blankenhorn stated that “it means Nokia can now compete against companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) and Juniper Systems (NYSE:JNPR) in the fiber world. But it also means the fiber world can compete with Nokia in the wireless world.”
As I’m sure my colleague would agree, Nokia doesn’t need to make its life more complicated. But that complexity is coming, whether management is ready or not. Unfortunately, the incoming threats are also damaging the technical picture for NOK stock.
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto
	
First, since March of 2010, Nokia shares have been trading inside a negatively tilted trend channel. Worse yet, NOK stock hasn’t convincingly challenged this channel’s upper resistance level.
Second, Nokia has failed to maintain crucial horizontal support lines. From $7 to $6 to $5, prior support became resistance. With the stock trading barely above $4 at time of writing, it’s becoming increasingly doubtful that NOK can bounce back.
Nearer-Term Picture Is Also Cloudy for Nokia
Fundamentally, one of the most distracting headwinds against NOK stock is that the main competitor to the underlying company, Huawei, essentially got sidelined due to geopolitics. Of course, this is a complex scenario. However, Nokia should have been able to get something out of its rival’s misfortune.

When you look at Ericsson, you can’t help but feel the company did take advantage. On a year-to-date basis, ERIC is up more than 40%. NOK stock? It’s looking at less than 9%. Moreover, if Nokia isn’t careful, the equity unit can end up in negative territory.
Personally, I believe NOK’s price chart says it all. I’m going to ignore the first half of this year due to the novel coronavirus’s effect. But even setting that aside, the price action has been all over the map. To me, this reflects severe uncertainty among investors about where shares are ultimately heading.

As I mentioned earlier, NOK stock has been struggling inside a bearish trend channel since late August. At the beginning of this channel, shares were trading hands at around $5. It closed down to $3.27 before bouncing to the time of writing price of $4.06.
Judging from the technical trajectory, I believe Nokia stock stands at a make-or-break moment. I can’t emphasize this enough: shares need to punch through the upper resistance line. Otherwise, we could see more volatility, taking shares well below $3.
Time to Face Reality
When I last discussed NOK stock at length in late October, I mentioned that new CEO Pekka Lundmark didn’t help matters in his first earnings report with Nokia. True, the company really stunk up the field with its third-quarter disclosure, with one of the lowlights being the withdrawal of long-term guidance. However, Lundmark blaming Covid-19 for the shortfall wasn’t a good move.
Generally, people don’t like excuses. Further, by talking about the coronavirus when rivals comparatively gave it a passing reference, it emphasized that the leadership team didn’t have a great recovery strategy in mind. What was apparently an attempt at buying time may have actually drawn increased scrutiny.
But here’s the thing — even if I’m wrong about my psychological assessment, it really doesn’t matter. Clearly, the investment community is spooked about NOK stock. Given the ugly technicals, I don’t see any reason to play the contrarian hero.

2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker of networking equipment, is upgrading its Webex conferencing service to beat back challenges from Zoom Video Communications Inc., the upstart whose stock has risen six-fold this year.The company announced a raft of enhancements going live on Tuesday and promised a number of others will be added soon. Webex calls will now enhance speech and cancel background noise, Cisco said at a corporate event. The service will include closed captioning, transcriptions, voice commands and impromptu meetings that don’t require advanced scheduling.Cisco is trying to bolster Webex, a longtime favorite corporate tool, to fend off a raft of relatively new entrants such as Zoom and enhanced offerings from other technology companies that have grown rapidly during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.The strategy is part of Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins’s drive to wean the company off a reliance on sales of pricey hardware and make the company a provider of networking services. Cisco hasn’t kept pace with Zoom or other corporate darlings of the pandemic. The stock is down about 8% this year.Other new features on Webex include the ability to read gestures by participants. A physical thumbs up will translate into a virtual reaction conveyed to a speaker. Templates will help meetings progress in a more orderly way and finish on time. For example, attendees might be locked out of speaking again until everyone has had an equal chance to speak. Cisco is also adding real-time translation, starting in February, in 10 languages.Cisco Senior Vice President Jeetu Patel, who heads the business unit, said the company is aiming to make Webex interactions 10 times more effective than in-person meetings by automating time-consuming follow-up activities and making the software and hardware able to read and respond to human behavior.Webex has about 600 million monthly users.

2020-12-15,"(Bloomberg) -- At the epicenter of the most sprawling cyber-attack in recent memory is a two-decade-old, Austin, Texas-based software maker called SolarWinds Corp. Little known outside of tech circles, its customer list boasts of every branch of the U.S. military and four-fifths of the Fortune 500.Many of those customers found themselves ensnared in the attack because suspected Russian hackers inserted a vulnerability into a popular SolarWinds’ software product, designed to give users a bird’s eye view of the varied web of applications that keep their operations humming.In a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, SolarWinds said it believed its monitoring products could have been used to compromise the servers of as many as 18,000 of its customers. Those clients include government agencies around the globe and some of the world’s largest corporations.The company “has been made aware of a cyber-attack that inserted a vulnerability within its Orion monitoring products which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run,” according to the filing. “SolarWinds has been advised that this incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state.”SolarWinds fell 6% in early trading Tuesday. The company fell 17% on Monday, the worst drop since it went public in October 2018. The company said it has sent mitigation steps to relevant customers and is providing an additional “hotfix” update Dec. 15.APT 29, a hacking group linked to the Russian government, is suspected of being behind the breach. The Department of Commerce was breached, as were the departments of Homeland Security and Treasury, Reuters reported.The global hacking campaign also included the Dec. 8 cyber-attack on the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc.The Russian Embassy has denied any involvement in the hack, saying that Russia “does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain.”Governments and companies are now racing to determine how such a security disaster materialized, and how it is that an obscure company founded by two brothers in the 1990s now appears to be at the heart of a potentially major Russian intelligence coup.According to its website, SolarWinds has more than 300,000 customers. Outside the U.S., SolarWinds has picked up contracts for the U.K. National Health Service, European Parliament and NATO, according to its website.The company was founded in Tulsa more than two decades ago by brothers David Yonce and Donald Yonce after they heard friends “griping about a long, specific list of frustrations managing their infrastructures,” according to an article from January on the company’s website. “They were part of the same perennial discussion we all share in tech. ‘Why can’t somebody just make a tool that X?!’ The difference was they decided to do something about it.”SolarWinds provides network monitoring needs for government agencies and private sector companies, marketing itself on its LinkedIn page as “Everybody’s IT.” SolarWinds has taken down its webpage that details its U.S. government and private-sector clients.Its Orion product is a powerful and important monitoring tool, allowing computer systems administrators to see the status of a company or organization’s network at a glance. Because Orion provides information on the entire network, it also has privileged access to sensitive parts of the network.“It gives you visibility across our entire network and allows you to quickly respond when a server or router goes down,” said Ben Johnson, chief technology officer of Obsidian Security. “But if you’re trying to do global monitoring of systems and traffic, that has very trusted access.”Hardly a household name, SolarWinds is the number three maker of IT operations software, behind Splunk Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., according to data provided by Gartner Inc. SolarWinds’ other main competitors are Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft.Hackers penetrated Orion’s update system, introducing malicious code disguised as legitimate Orion updates, according to blog posts by FireEye and Microsoft Corp. The malicious vulnerability existed in updates between March and June, the company said. The hacking tool embedded within the update even stored stolen data within the Orion software as to evade detection, according to FireEye. The result was that hackers could snoop on a company’s network all while appearing as legitimate traffic.As of mid-day Monday, the malicious update was still available for download on SolarWind’s website, according to Karim Hijazi, founder and chief executive of Prevailion Inc., a Maryland-based cybersecurity firm. Hijazi said his team compared the available download with security alerts identifying the tampered update, and it’s an exact match.That appears to contradict a statement the company made earlier in the day that Orion products downloaded after June didn’t contain the vulnerability. When asked about continued access to the malicious file, SolarWinds denied the claim and referred a Bloomberg reporter back to the company’s statement to the SEC. Following the email exchange, the web page that previously hosted the malicious software update was taken down, Prevailion said. It now reads, “Not found.”The number of victims is likely to climb as companies and governments comb their computer systems for traces of the hackers.“The victims have included government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East,” according to FireEye. “We anticipate there are additional victims in other countries and verticals.”The breadth of the damage caused by the hacking campaign is still unknown. The Russian hackers most likely prioritized the most valuable intelligence targets first, meaning it wouldn’t have had time to penetrate every SolarWinds customer. “Once you’re discovered, that’s when you start to pull everything you can,” Johnson said. “It’s going to be a crazy week.”(Updates with details on SolarWinds’ stock beginning in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Hackers Used Obscure Texas IT Vendor to Attack U.S. Agencies

2020-12-18,"On Friday, shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $45.28.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-08  * Strike Price: $46.00  * Volume: 667  * Open Interest: 1347Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. was compromised as part of a suspected Russian campaign that has roiled the U.S. government and private sector and left security experts across the country racing to assess the extent of the damage.Some internal machines used by Cisco researchers were targeted, the networking equipment maker said. The company said its security team moved quickly to address the issue and that the “affected software” has been “mitigated.”“At this time, there is no known impact to Cisco offers or products,” the company said in a statement. “We continue to investigate all aspects of this evolving situation with the highest priority.”Cisco used a popular software internally from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp. that has been at the center of the attacks so far. Hackers inserted a malicious backdoor into SolarWinds’s Orion software that they then used as a staging ground for later attacks. SolarWinds customers who accessed updates between March and June were infected with the backdoor -- as many as 18,000 customers, according to the company.The number of Orion software users who were actually attacked by the hackers isn’t known but almost certainly far less.“While Cisco does not use SolarWinds Orion for its enterprise network management or monitoring, we have identified and mitigated affected software in a small number of lab environments and a limited number of employee endpoints,” according to the company’s statement. Endpoints refer to employee devices such as computers.Network management and monitoring are key parts of Cisco’s machinery and software that directly look at data traffic moving through a network. Access to that flow could provide a malicious actor with multiple avenues to cause harm.About two dozen computers in a Cisco lab were compromised, according to a person familiar with the incident.Cisco is the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment and provides hardware and software that are the backbone of the internet and central to corporate and government computer networks across the world.A company spokesperson declined to comment beyond what Cisco said in a written statement.The toll of victims compromised by a sophisticated suspected Russian cyber-attack has continued to rise since Dec. 8 when the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc. announced it had been hacked via SolarWinds’s software.Cisco’s breach comes a day after Microsoft Corp. said its systems were exposed to the malicious update.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Latest Victim of Russian Cyber-Attack Using SolarWinds

That’s true I guess, depending on the heads involved.
In this case, I prefer … “Great minds think alike.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Regular MoneyWire readers know how bullish I am on the coming year and the massive hypergrowth investing themes and trends that continue to play out.
I believe in my research and analysis and have had great success with it. I don’t go looking for confirmation from anyone else.
But when a legendary growth investor speaks, I take notice.
And when the opportunity comes along to work together again to pick a portfolio of stocks that we agree are set up to crush the market, well, I’d be a fool to say no.
I believe what we’ve come up with is groundbreaking …
Quite simply, Louis Navellier’s work in quant-based analysis is groundbreaking and world-class.
I’m fortunate that I’ve gotten to know him through the years as an InvestorPlace colleague.
We don’t always take the same path, but when we find ourselves at the same destination, the results so far have been spectacular.
And as we get ready to turn the calendar to 2021, we are in complete agreement that the year ahead has all the makings of a big year in the market… and an even bigger year in the stocks we’ve picked together for what we call Power Portfolio 2021.
We just sat down Thursday evening to talk through our analysis and the opportunities we see. You can watch the full replay here.
I discussed how I believe we’re about to witness one of the biggest stock booms in U.S. history … and that carefully selected, high-quality stocks will go up 300%, 500%, and even 1,000% over the next few years.
I believe what’s coming will be so big and monumental that I’ve come up with my own name for it — The Roaring 2020s. It fits given the massive undercurrent reshaping the world today.
The last time we saw something similar was in the early ’90s. It was also a time of low inflation and incredible innovation.
The rollouts of the cellular phone networks and powerful personal computers and the advent of software and the internet converged to unleash a tsunami of productivity.
This resulted in higher profit margins for virtually every business across America.
In a relatively short timeframe, our ability to communicate, transact, process data, analyze data, and manage supply chains was revolutionized.
The massive productivity increases from the new technologies of the 1990s were like a huge shot of adrenaline to the economy.
They also paved the way for truly innovative companies harnessing these new technologies to hand their shareholders incredible returns. Companies like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) went up 113,000%.


I said in our Early Warning Summit 2021 that the exact same type of story is unfolding now. We’re about to see several once-in-a-generation technologies come together at the same time and totally reshape every aspect of our lives.
The convergence of innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G, precision medicine, the Internet of Things, driverless cars, and the blockchain are recreating the very framework of modern society.
And the impact these technologies will have on the global economy will dwarf the internet.
Louis agreed with all of that. He said he hasn’t seen the types of bullish readings he’s seeing now since the early 1990s … before the market went on a 1,400% tear.
That decade created some of the biggest winners in stock market history.
And he added another reason why we believe 2021 will be one of the greatest years in history to be an investor …
Never in history has there been so much cash sitting on the sidelines.
There’s nearly $5 trillion on the sidelines right now, which is roughly 25% of the entire economic output of the United States.
The uncertainty and volatility of 2020 caused investors and hedge fund managers to move trillions of dollars into cash or money market funds. But the consensus is that we’re turning a corner.
Businesses and consumers are sitting on record amounts of money — and more is likely to come in additional stimulus from the government — just anxiously looking to spend it.
In other words, we’re sitting on a powder keg.
This flood of cash and economic activity will be a massive boost for the economy and the markets.
We’re confident this huge pile of money is going to start pouring into the markets at a historic rate, and given the sheer amount of money, the broad market should go up considerably. Many sectors should do very well.
I’ll wrap up with one other point we agree on: If you really want to have a great year … and have the chance to make an absolute fortune … focus on the small corners of the market that will see the lion’s share of the growth.
We analyzed over 5,000 stocks and uncovered the investing themes with the most immediate upside for 2021. And then we combined our two systems to narrow them down to a small portfolio of select stocks we think have big upside potential for the coming year.
We call it our “Power Portfolio 2021.”
We did the same thing last year, eager to see what would happen if we combined our two different approaches and handpicked stocks that would absolutely crush the markets over a 12-month period.
Well, we now know exactly what can happen.
We helped a small group of readers learn how to beat the markets by 6X.
So a few months ago Louis and I got back to work, employing both a “top down” and “bottom up” analysis on over 5,000 stocks.
I think we’ve outdone ourselves and again created something truly groundbreaking.

2021-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. won a temporary court order blocking Acacia Communications Inc. from abandoning a planned merger between the two companies.Networking giant Cisco announced in July 2019 that it had reached a deal to acquire Acacia, an optical component maker, for about $2.6 billion, saying the merger would help it capture a bigger chunk of spending on 5G telecommunications networks. Acacia said in a statement Friday that it was free to terminate the deal because it didn’t receive Chinese regulatory approval within the time-frame of the merger agreement.Cisco sued Maynard, Massachusetts-based Acacia in Delaware Chancery Court on Friday. After a hearing Chancellor J. Travis Laster granted Cisco’s request for a restraining order and to expedite the proceedings.William Lafferty, a lawyer for Cisco, said during the hearing that Acacia was trying to exit the deal because it believed its valuation had increased since entering into the agreement and hoped to negotiate a more generous offer.“It has every motivation to walk away and terminate the deal that it has struck and that is what is ultimately driving this,” Lafferty said. On the other hand, for Cisco, “the termination or loss of a unique strategic merger like this one is a classic case of irreparable harm,” he argued.Read More: Cisco Systems Sues to Stop Acacia From Ending MergerAcacia’s decision to walk away from the deal reinforces Cisco’s challenges in navigating China’s regulators amid the U.S.-China trade dispute, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho wrote.Cisco said in a separate statement that it’s seeking confirmation from the judge that it has indeed met “all conditions for closing” the deal. The company said it was notified Thursday by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation that its submission was “sufficient to address the relevant competition concerns.”Cisco shares climbed less than 0.5% Friday to $45.06 in New York trading.

And at this point, the valuation is getting close to ridiculous. Electric vehicle charging station provider ChargePoint, with which SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) Switchback is merging, now has a pro forma market capitalization over $13 billion. (Switchback has estimated that once the merger closes, there will be 305 million shares outstanding.)
It is exceedingly difficult to justify that kind of valuation. The question is if, and when, that will matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A 200%-Plus Rally
On Oct. 30, Switchback Energy stock closed at $13.23. The stock had seen a reasonably swift pullback, dropping 18% in seven sessions, but that aside the price didn’t see notably out of line. After all, ChargePoint had agreed to merge with Switchback in September at a price of $10 per share.
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
Since then, in less than three months, SBE has gained 210%. The question is why.
It’s hard to pin down, truthfully. ChargePoint hasn’t disclosed any news that’s particularly noteworthy. Switchback itself is just a shell company.
An SBE bull could point to the elections in early November as a catalyst. The win by Democrat Joe Biden ostensibly is bullish for EVs in the U.S. But that case seems thin.
A Biden win was widely expected (by the betting markets as well as the again-unreliable polls). In fact, it was believed that Democrats were likely to sweep all three branches of government. After the run-offs in Georgia, the more pro-environment party will have narrow control of the U.S. Senate, with a single defection able to block any major legislation.
The answer seems to be that the rest of the market has gone nuts. EV stocks of all kinds, and particularly EV-related SPACs like SBE, have soared. Small-cap stocks have been on a tear. Anything with growth potential seemingly has gone parabolic or close, no matter the valuation. Switchback Energy stock has not been an exception.

Another Bubble?
As I’ve written before, I saw the peak of the dot-com bubble first-hand through 1999 and early 2000. And since then, I’ve bristled at comparisons to that time.
Honestly, I’m not bristling anymore, and Switchback Energy stock is an example why. A 200% rally in three months on no news (at least, no unexpected news) is not normal. It’s not healthy. And it’s not sustainable.
To be clear, this is not to say that ChargePoint is a fad, or akin to Pets.com and the other dot-com names of the late 1990s. But the late 1990s bubble wasn’t built solely, or even mostly, on weak companies.
Indeed, the telecom bubble was broader and larger. Meanwhile, at the peak, the most expensive and most valuable names in the market included Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and EMC, which is now part of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL). Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was the 30th-most valuable company in the world.
Those are some of the best tech companies of the past two decades. Cisco and Oracle still have market capitalizations well below their March 2000 levels. As recently as April, Qualcomm sat below its peak.
Simply put, those companies delivered on their potential. Their stocks did not, because the valuations had run too far.

Switchback Energy Stock Goes Parabolic
At $40, SBE stock is running into a similar problem. This is a company that, in its merger presentation, estimated revenue of $1 billion once EV penetration reaches 3% of cars on the road. The industry is a long way from that goal, given that EVs represented less than 3% of new car sales last year, leaving tens of millions of ICE (internal combustion engines)
That estimate is precisely that: an estimate. And since ChargePoint is going public via the SPAC route instead of via a traditional initial public offering, it can make such a claim with less verification and lighter disclosure. EV investors should have learned from Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) the dangers posed by such thin disclosures.
Even assuming the estimate is correct, SBE stock is trading at more than 13x a revenue level that’s likely five to seven years in the future. Given gross margin targets in the range of 40% to 45%, it’s valued at something like 30x gross profit on the same basis.
Those are massive multiples, even in a market that’s soared to new highs this year.
And they’re even more massive than they were two months ago, due to a rally that seems to have little justification beyond widespread investor optimism. In that context, the rally looks questionable at best. ChargePoint might succeed, but that no longer makes SBE stock a buy.

2021-01-11,"MAYNARD, Mass., Jan. 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acacia Communications, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACIA) (“Acacia” or “the Company”) today announced that it filed its answer and affirmative defenses in response to the complaint filed by Cisco Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO) (“Cisco”) in the Delaware Court of Chancery and simultaneously filed a counterclaim against Cisco seeking a declaration that Acacia validly terminated the merger agreement with Cisco because the required Chinese regulatory approval was not obtained and the merger did not close before the agreed-upon termination date under the agreement.   As previously announced, on January 8, 2021, Acacia delivered to Cisco a notice to terminate the merger agreement for the proposed acquisition of Acacia by Cisco. The transaction was conditioned on the satisfaction or mutual waiver of agreed-upon closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. The merger agreement afforded the parties 18 months to obtain the necessary antitrust approvals from the Chinese government before, as Acacia asserts, either Acacia or Cisco could terminate the agreement on January 8, 2021. Such approval was not received before January 8, 2021, and Acacia delivered a notice of termination of the merger agreement on that date. Cisco has initiated litigation against Acacia in Delaware challenging the Company’s termination of the merger agreement, claiming that the Chinese Government’s State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) approval was received on January 7, 2021.Acacia believes that a January 7, 2021 email from a SAMR employee stating Cisco’s submission was “sufficient to address the relevant competition concerns” does not constitute regulatory approval, as Cisco claims. Acacia intends to vigorously defend itself against Cisco’s claims and vindicate its decision to terminate the merger agreement.Acacia continues to be bound by the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to a temporary restraining order granted by the Delaware Court of Chancery pending resolution of the litigation with Cisco or as otherwise agreed by the parties. Further information regarding these matters can be found in the Company’s regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. About Acacia CommunicationsAcacia Communications develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost. By implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process Acacia Communications refers to as the “siliconization of optical interconnect,” Acacia Communications is able to offer products at higher speeds and density with lower power consumption, that meet the needs of cloud and service providers and can be easily integrated in a cost-effective manner with existing network equipment. www.acacia-inc.com.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes statements concerning the Company and its future expectations, plans and prospects that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding: the proposed merger; termination of the merger agreement and challenges to such termination, including the litigation instituted by Cisco against the Company and the Company’s counterclaims against Cisco.

2021-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. raised its offer for Acacia Communications Inc. by more than 70% to close a deal that its target tried to walk away from.Acacia shareholders will get $115 a share in cash in the revised bid, for a total deal value of $4.5 billion, Cisco said in a statement Thursday. Acacia, which agreed to the revised proposal, rallied as much as 32% in New York trading Thursday. The companies aim to complete the deal by the end of the first quarter.The new terms reflect the difficulties of trying do transactions that require approval in China and the surge in public market value of technology stocks. Approval from the largest market for semiconductors and many other types of electronic equipment has become a more difficult and time-consuming process during the outgoing U.S. administration’s trade war against China.Networking equipment maker Cisco announced in July 2019 that it had reached a deal to acquire Acacia, an optical component maker, for about $2.6 billion, saying the merger would help it capture a bigger chunk of spending on 5G telecommunications networks.Last week Acacia said that it was terminating the agreement because Cisco didn’t receive Chinese regulatory approval within the time-frame of the merger agreement. Cisco disputed that saying that an email it got from China constituted approval and took legal action to enforce the terms of the deal.Cisco’s move to renegotiate follows a similar tactic by Applied Materials Inc. which earlier this month said it raised its offer for KKR & Co.-owned Kokusai Electric Corp. by 59%, citing higher valuations in a growing industry. The deal also extended the target closing date to allow for regulatory approval from China, the final remaining jurisdiction where sign-off is needed.Cisco shares were little changed at $45.35 in New York following the announcement.

Among other requirements, the combined entity should continue to provide Chinese customers with access to its products “based on the principles of fairness, reasonableness and non-discrimination,” according to the statement.Last Thursday, Cisco raised its offer for Acacia by more than 70% to close a deal that the target company had tried to walk away from.

2021-01-22,"Investors and non-investors alike admire Warren Buffett’s extraordinary success in the business world. One of the key strategies the Oracle of Omaha follows is to buy stocks when they are trading at sale prices. That is to say, undervalued stocks. Buffett and his team hunt for these, since sound stocks under pressure will reward holders when the prices recover. When it comes to not paying too much, most of us already do that in our daily lives. Before most folks buy a car, they research its value. Even if it’s not a complete match, the information provides an indication. The more research the buyer does ahead of time, the better. Applying this approach to identify undervalued stocks can become automatic for investors. All it takes is patience and practice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Here are 7 undervalued stocks that could perk up under Democratic leadership: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) General Motors (NYSE:GM) Allstate (NYSE:ALL) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) With the transition of power to President Biden, we can expect a serious shift in domestic policy over the years to come. These companies are well positioned to profit. Undervalued Stocks: Apple (AAPL) Source: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com Surprised to see one of the most valuable companies in the world on this list? Well, don’t be. The stock market doesn’t appraise stocks solely by how much money the company has in its accounts around the world. Many analysts agree that the value of AAPL stock is more than current prices. Moreover, there are compelling reasons to own this stock. Yes, Apple has very deep pockets. But it also has a stable of attractive products that have an impressively loyal following. Many of those fans are expected to trade their older iPhones for Apple’s latest version. This smartphone will also allow users to access the 5G communication networks being installed across the country. InvestorPlace writer Tyler Craig recently explained why Apple is an attractive to stock to buy. Alibaba (BABA) Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com Alibaba is a massive company engaged in e-commerce and cloud services. This company is an increasingly diversified operation. But its share price is dampened at present. The United States and China have been in a trade war for much of the last four years. A recent volley was a threat to delist several China-based companies from U.S. exchanges. Additionally, recent legislation aims to force Chinese companies to meet U.S. audit guidelines to remain on U.S. exchanges. Although investors need to monitor geopolitical currents, I agree with my InvestorPlace colleague Wayne Duggan that Alibaba won’t be delisted here. He writes in a recent article that too many leading U.S. institutions are heavily invested in BABA stock for that to happen. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Alibaba is a well-run company serving a growing market. It’s a clear buy on the dip. General Motors (GM) Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com U.S. automakers have been in a slump for a while now, including General Motors. As a result, share prices are depressed. But the company, which restructured under bankruptcy protection during the Great Recession, was nimble enough to continue its forward-look even during the novel coronavirus pandemic. This work has GM on the cusp of several electric vehicles. Yes, this legacy automaker is poised to compete with names more associated with EVs, such as Elon Musk’s pioneering Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In fact, GM is accelerating its schedule for launching EVs. The company plans on having 30 EV models by 2025, according to Car and Driver magazine. This means investors can buy shares of an undervalued-yet-established company competing in the EV revolution. Allstate (ALL) Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.com Next on our list of undervalued stocks is Allstate, a leading insurance company in the U.S. since it was launched by Sears back in 1931. Thanks to the company’s consistent advertising, Allstate enjoys tremendous name recognition. And luckily for Allstate, the company was spun off by Sears in the mid-90s and was spared a slow death by the parasites that ruined Sears. Allstate is known for customer service and a large network of agents. These days, however, ALL stock is on sale. It’s trading below price targets set by several analysts who follow the Illinois-based company. Nevertheless, the company has been performing well. Earnings per share for Q4 are projected to be $3.69, compared to $2.94 reported by the company in Q3. The median price target by analysts is $122.50 per share, which is about 13% more than ALL’s current prices around $108. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day In addition, ALL stock currently pays a dividend of about 1.99%. Undervalued Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Network specialist Cisco Systems, the world’s largest hardware and software provider, is trading below the average price target of $49 set by analysts who follow the company, per Tipranks., CSCO stock is rated a “buy” or “hold.” CSCO stock is poised to rise once the global economy regains momentum interrupted by the global pandemic. The company enjoys a significant protective moat and is an attractive stock to own in a long-term portfolio. CSCO also pays a 3.17% dividend. Looking ahead, Cisco is poised to deliver improved performance with earnings per share forecast to increase more than 6% for 2021. A likely key tailwind is the aftermath of the SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI) hacking scandal revealed in late 2020. Cisco is seeing an increase in its business as companies look elsewhere. Cisco’s network software is an important alternative to the Solar Winds product. In general, Cisco is viewed as a stable entry in a volatile stock market. And, as InvestorPlace contributor Faizan Farooque recently noted, “Cisco’s firewall and software-defined security products are more relevant than ever.” Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com Another tech company making our undervalued stocks list is semiconductor and software creator Qualcomm. QCOM stock is one to watch as the company also is poised for a strong year. One reason: 5G. Qualcomm makes chip components that are key to 5G operations. And investors know that we are in the midst of a global 5G telecommunications rollout. A Motley Fool columnist recently wrote that Qualcomm also is attractive because the demand for its 5G chipset is expecting to increase. He also said the company’s valuation “does not reflect the opportunity.” 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Also, the 5G conversion likely is not tied to performance of the global economy. Put another way, the rollout is expected to continue regardless. The world is ready to embrace the improvements offered in the 5th Generation. Undervalued Stocks: Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Defense contractor Lockheed Martin is the final company on our list of undervalued stocks. The company is positioned to benefit from strong demand for its F-35 and F-16 fighter jets as well as its missiles and other defense and aerospace products. Lockheed reported strong Q3 numbers in October, when earnings beat estimates by 18 cents. Its EPS rose 24% over the last three years. Aerospace operations are expected by some analysts to be the area for fastest growth. In addition to expected strong demand for its defense products, LMT stock holds appeal because of its dividend yield of nearly 3%. This beats many income stocks. Writing in InvestorPlace recently, Bob Ciura recently described Lockheed Martin as “a top blue-chip stock for dividend growth investors, as well as the rare security that sidesteps the typical growth versus value tradeoff.” On the date of publication, Larry Sullivan held a long position in AAPL.

2021-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Chuck Robbins, chief executive officer of Cisco Systems Inc., said he is optimistic about collaboration between Joe Biden’s White House and the technology sector.“The administration has been very active reaching out to CEOs, to have a dialog about how to work together to solve problems in the country and attack opportunities,” Robbins said in an interview at the Bloomberg Year Ahead conference Wednesday.Biden’s response to the pandemic shows he’s committed to science, and the new U.S. President will likely take the same approach to technology, Robbins added, citing infrastructure, broadband and “bridging the equality divide” as examples.The private sector should work with the government to provide nationwide broadband and technology skills training to help narrow the digital divide, the CEO said. He also welcomed regulation of the tech industry and said he’s open to discussing how to do this with the Biden administration.Robbins has been outspoken about social justice and he continued that theme on Wednesday, saying companies don’t have the option “of sitting on the sidelines any longer.” Cisco has a team that is working on a “social justice strategy” to guide the company’s investments, he noted. In September, the company promised to increase Black representation in its workforce.The pandemic has taught Cisco that employees can be productive from anywhere, and that will have a lasting impact on where the company hires talent, Robbins added. The crisis also forced the company to reassess its ability to support remote workers, both in terms of collaboration and security. “I think it’s going to be the future of hybrid work,” the CEO said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco CEO Is Optimistic About Tech Collaboration With Biden Team

2021-01-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether it was opportunity, strategy or sheer chutzpah, the suspected Russian hackers behind a massive cyber-attack revealed last month focused particular attention on technology companies, including cybersecurity firms entrusted to find malicious activity in their clients’ networks.Four cybersecurity companies announced this week that they had been targeted as part of the attack, adding to a list of at least eight other tech companies that the hackers tried to breach. Many of the companies said they successfully blocked the attackers, but some others acknowledged that their networks were infiltrated.The hackers may have focused on technology and cybersecurity companies simply because, after government agencies, they were the next best targets. For hackers, cybersecurity companies represent the gatekeepers guarding the computer networks they so desperately wish to exploit, said Allan Liska, senior security architect at cybersecurity analytics firm Recorded Future Inc.Also, cybersecurity and technology companies often have remote access to customers’ computer networks, potentially giving hackers entry to their clients and partners. Such digital supply chain hacks are an efficient method to corral hundreds, if not thousands, of potential victims, Liska said.“If you can compromise security infrastructure, you essentially have the keys to the kingdom and can run around undetected,” he said. “And we’re dealing with an advanced adversary who’s looking for this kind of access.”In the case of SolarWinds Corp., for instance, the hackers installed malware in its Orion software, which is used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The Texas-based firm said that as many as 18,000 customers may have received the malicious code in software updates, though far fewer are believed to have been subject to further attacks from the hackers.In addition, the hackers targeted at least one reseller of Microsoft Corp.’s Office 365 tools, likely by digging up login credentials and then compromising the resellers’ clients, cybersecurity experts say. The suspected Russian attackers used those tactics to target the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, which wasn’t ultimately breached.The cyber-research firm Malwarebytes Inc. was also targeted after a third-party application that protects its Office 365 email was hacked, and the hackers gained access to a “limited subset of internal company emails,” Malwarebytes said.There’s not yet any evidence that cybersecurity companies were a launching point for a broader attack, only that the Russian adversary attempted to do so.”This is a persistent, sophisticated attack that requires organizations to look carefully at the supply chain of their IT infrastructure, which cybersecurity is a part of,” said Ryan Gillis, vice president for cybersecurity strategy and global policy at Palo Alto Networks Inc. “When you look at the consequences, from that we’ve seen so far, everything points back to the IT supply chain.”Hacking into cybersecurity companies also provides attackers with advantages when launching further attacks, potentially providing them with detection tools or source code that they can use to avoid being caught, according to cybersecurity experts.“If I am trying to break into your house, the best way to go through is to disable cameras, electronic clocks; this will give me a tactical advantage,” said Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer at Hold Security. “Knowing how to evade detection in cyber is almost the entire battle. If they have the detection tools in their pocket, they’ve taken our safeguards to use against us.”Mimecast Ltd., an email security provider, said Tuesday that hackers had turned one of its security tools against it to view its customers’ Microsoft 365 accounts. Fidelis Cybersecurity Inc. said that the company is investigating evidence that it might have been targeted. Another cybersecurity company, Qualys Inc. was also targeted but said in a statement that “there was no impact on our production environment nor exfiltrated data.”Palo Alto Networks said it was targeted by the same hackers in October but successfully stopped the attacks.The hack was disclosed in December by the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc., which itself was attacked. About 10 U.S. government agencies were infiltrated as part of the attack, including the departments of Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security. Among the other technology companies that were targeted for further attacks were Microsoft and Cisco Systems Inc. U.S. officials have said they believe hackers associated with the Russian government are behind the attack.The attack isn’t the first time that cybersecurity firms were compromised by hackers. In 2011, for instance, EMC Corp.’s RSA unit was breached, and two years later, the security firm Bit9 revealed that it had been hacked. Juniper Networks Inc. said it too was compromised in 2015.Even so, trying to target cybersecurity companies comes with its own perils. After all, the alleged Russian hackers could still be roaming undetected through U.S. government networks, and those of various companies, if they hadn’t decided to break into FireEye’s computers.“Attackers are getting more sophisticated, and pursuing persistence over time instead of smash and grab techniques,” said Jim Jaeger, a former U.S. Air Force brigadier general who is now president and chief cyber strategist at the cyber investigations firm Arete Advisors LLC. “Now they’re aspiring to use cybersecurity tools to get inside our networks. They’re taking our safeguards and using them against us.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Suspected Russian Hackers Gained Edge Through Tech Firm Attacks

2021-01-30,"Nowadays it’s not really popular to focus stocks selling at a discount — that is, the so-called value investing approach. Instead, the interest is mostly on momentum. For the most part, this approach has gotten… well… crazy! The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds. These investors have targeted heavily shorted stocks to gin up epic squeezes. The result is that there have been huge surges with companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But whenever there is this level of speculation, the markets are likely close to reaching a peak. And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2021-02-04,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $47.2 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $40.00 Volume: 303 Open Interest: 8311 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. See also: Best Telecommunications Stocks Right Now The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-08,"On Tuesday, February 09, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Cisco Systems EPS is expected to be around $0.75, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $11.92 billion. In the same quarter last year, Cisco Systems reported EPS of $0.77 on revenue of $12.01 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on CSCO The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 2.6% decline in the company's EPS figure. Revenue would be down 0.71% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 EPS Estimate 0.70 0.74 0.71 0.76 EPS Actual 0.76 0.80 0.79 0.77 Revenue Estimate 11.85 B 12.08 B 11.88 B 11.98 B Revenue Actual 11.93 B 12.15 B 11.98 B 12.01 B Stock Performance Over the past 52-week period, shares of Cisco Systems have declined 0.22%.

2021-02-09,Expectations had been rising before the results were released. The stock fell in late trading Tuesday.,"Cisco’s Earnings Top Estimates, but Apparently Not by Enough"
2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares fell after the company reported a big decline in enterprise sales and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins warned Covid-19 is still crimping growth.Sales in the fiscal second quarter totaled $12 billion, in line with a year earlier. Product revenue was $8.57 billion, down from the same period a year ago. Service sales were $3.39 billion, up about 2%, the company said in a statement Tuesday.Revenue from Cisco’s Enterprise segment, which serves large companies, fell 9% year-over-year in the period. During a conference call with analysts, Robbins said the pandemic is “not fully behind us.” Cisco shares slipped more than 5% in extended trading.A large portion of Cisco’s revenue comes from purchases of expensive network hardware by government agencies, corporations and video and phone service providers. That makes its results an early indicator of business confidence.“Enterprise business accounts for about 50% of sales, and that’s dependent on how quickly the economy opens,” said Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “We’re all working from home, so the last thing we’re doing is sitting behind our office desk, and we don’t need too many upgrades now.”In November, Cisco suggested corporations and governments were beginning to resume spending on networking gear as the economy slowly recovered. The latest results suggest otherwise.“Investors didn’t like that,” Ho said. “The CEO said on this call that large orders are getting pushed back until the re-opening of offices.”Robbins has tried to shift sales more toward software and subscriptions, although the pandemic has disrupted the effort. On Tuesday, the CEO disclosed $3.6 billion in quarterly software revenue, the first time Cisco has reported that separately.However, that was overshadowed by Cisco’s weak enterprise sales. Ittai Kidron, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said that segment experienced a “significant lag relative” to other parts of the business.Net income came in at $2.5 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter. That was down 12% from a year earlier.Cisco said revenue will grow 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year in the current period. Earnings should come in at 64 to 69 cents a share, or 80 to 82 cents a share excluding certain items.(Adds net income and forecast in final paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Shares Fall After CEO Says Pandemic Drag Is Lingering

2021-02-10,"Right now, Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price is at $46.53, after a 4.06% decrease. Over the past month, the stock increased by 2.60%, but over the past year, it actually fell by 1.65%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 43.62%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Communications Equipment stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. View more earnings on CSCO The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Cisco Systems Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 60.07 of the Communications Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

2021-02-10,"Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported second-quarter results late Wednesday that came in ahead of expectations. Here's what the Street has to say. The Cisco Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Overweight rating and $54 price target for Cisco shares. Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold maintained an Outperform rating and nudged the price target from $49 to $50. Needham analyst Alex Henderson maintained a Hold rating. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Alex Kurtz maintained a Sector Weight rating. Cisco Positioned For 2021 Recovery, Morgan Stanley Says: Cisco reported modest upside to Morgan Stanley's estimates as demand slowly recovers, Marshall said. ""CSCO is our preferred way to capture upside with return to work, a recovering macro environment more broadly, and closing of a valuation gap that remains too steep relative to the S&P 500,"" the analyst said. The commentary around expectations for enterprise networking needs in a hybrid work environment is encouraging, along with improving product orders, she said. The second quarter will likely be Cisco's last challenging quarter, with difficult compares on back of a strong IT spending environment in the prior year, Marshall said. The second half could see high single-digit growth thanks to easier comparisons, the pending acquisition of Acacia and IMImobile and one-year-plus delayed enterprise project activity, the analyst said. Although Enterprise remains the laggard, an improving trajectory in commercial business is a positive sign that demand is positioned for recovery as employees return to work, according to Morgan Stanley. Related Link: Cramer Advises Viewers On Halliburton, Churchill Capital Corp IV And More Why Raymond James Continues To Like Cisco: The negative stock reaction to Cisco's earnings may have to do with the April quarter guidance, which looks inadequate considering the fact that the quarter has an extra week, Leopold said. Additionally, component shortages, the pandemic and exchange rates present challenges, the analyst said. Orders from the important Enterprise vertical remained challenged, but every other vertical showed improved orders, he said. ""With a recovery underway, we continue to like the stock, and our price target goes to $50."" View more earnings on CSCO Rosenblatt On Read-Through For Cisco's Peers: Cisco's results were at the high end of the guidance, and the fiscal year third-quarter guidance reflected continued macroeconomic improvement, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Ryan Koontz said in a note. The retreat in the stock in reaction to the results was due to inflated investor expectations for Cisco, the analyst said. Cisco's results have positive read-through for cloud communications sector leaders such as RingCentral Inc (NYSE: RNG), Five9 Inc (NASDAQ: FIVN) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM), all of which are all poised to see strong share gains, he said. Koontz also sees positive implications for Arista Networks Inc (NYSE: ANET), which the analyst said is likely to see surging near-term hyperscale demand for its switch products, but minimal opportunities for share gains in hyperscale routing. Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR) could see increasing share loss in hyperscale routing to Cisco, he sad. Needham Says Cisco Likely To Perform In-Line: Cisco is seeing a rebound as spending intentions across Enterprise, Service Providers and Cloud are poised to rebound or accelerate, but the magnitude is underwhelming, Henderson said in a note. ""We think CSCO is reasonably priced based on current forecasts,"" the analyst said. The bias is for some upside to the estimates as the recovery accelerates, he said. Cisco has limited risk, but it is expected to perform just in-line, according to Needham. Why KeyBanc Says Cisco Is Fairly Valued: Order growth is improving, having rebounded to 1% year-over-year growth in the second quarter compared to a 5% decline in the first quarter thanks to strength in public sector and service providers, Kurtz said in a note. Enterprise was impacted by elongated deal cycles and weakness from COVID-19-impacted verticals such as retail and travel, the analyst said. Historically, commercial orders have led Enterprise, giving some confidence in a continued gradual recovery, he said. Among products, Webscale saw double-digit order growth, and Webex and Security saw double-digit growth, Kurtz said. ""We see CSCO fairly valued at 13x FY21E EPS (historical 10-17x) given ongoing challenges within its Enterprise customers and a modest outlook for FY22 margin growth.""

2021-02-10,"Over the past three months, shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose by 8.84%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Cisco Systems has. Cisco Systems's Debt According to the Cisco Systems's most recent financial statement as reported on November 17, 2020, total debt is at $14.57 billion, with $9.56 billion in long-term debt and $5.00 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $10.82 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $3.74 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Cisco Systems's $95.00 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.15. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-02-10,"Cisco Systems’ shares slipped 4.6% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading session, as the company’s revenues in the second fiscal quarter came in at $12 billion, flat year-on-year, but ahead of analysts’ estimates of $11.9 billion. The technology giant reported second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $0.79, that came in ahead of the Street consensus of $0.76. Cisco’s (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins said, “We are seeing encouraging signs of strength across our business showing how our technology will be a powerful engine for recovery and growth. Our team delivered a strong performance as we partnered with customers on accelerating their digital transformation and driving secure, remote work.” Segment by segment results showed that the company generated $3.6 billion in revenues from its software business in 2Q with 76% of that revenue coming from software subscriptions. Cisco also increased its quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.37 per share from the previous quarter, which will be paid on April 28 to all shareholders on record as on April 6. (See Cisco Systems stock analysis on TipRanks) In the fiscal third quarter, the company expects sales to grow between 3.5% to 5.5% year-on-year. EPS is forecasted to land between $0.64 to $0.69 in 3Q. Following the earnings results, Robert W. Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver maintained a Hold rating and price target of $46 on the stock. “Cisco experienced improved order growth across all major geographies and customer segments,” Ruykhaver wrote in a note to investors. “However, while improved QoQ, enterprise remains under pressure from the macro environment, apparent in weak product orders and performance in the infrastructure platforms segment.” “Positive takeaways include strength in Catalyst 9K switches, collaboration, security, and webscale,” the analyst added. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 6 analysts recommending a Buy and 7 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $49.89 implies 2.9% upside potential to current levels.

2021-02-16,"Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date. What Happened? On this day in 1990, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) held its IPO. Where The Market Was: The S&P 500 was at 332.72 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 2,635.59. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1990, the U.S. launched Operation Desert Shield in Kuwait and “The Simpsons” aired on FOX for the first time. The average cost of a new car was $16,950. Dot-Com Darling Is Born: Cisco has been one of the biggest success stories in the history of Silicon Valley, yet its story will forever be tied to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Cisco was founded in 1984 by Leonard Bosack, who had worked to develop the Advanced Gateway Server based on Stanford University’s router. By the time Cisco went public in 1990, its market cap was $224 million. Over the next decade, Cisco would log an incredible 30,000% gain, becoming the poster child for dot-com mania. By March 2000, Cisco’s market cap had expanded to more than $500 billion, making it the most valuable company in the world. For perspective, a $500-billion market cap is more than twice the size of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) in today’s dollars. From March 27, 2000, to March 27, 2001, Cisco lost 77.4% of its market cap when the bubble burst. Today, Cisco’s market cap has bounced back significantly to $200 billion, but it's still less than half of the peak.

Cisco said, “This new offering will bring together cloud contact center, artificial intelligence, experience management, collaboration and Communications Platform as-a-Service to create a single solution that will give organizations the ability to provide the exceptional experiences that customers expect.” On Feb. 9, Cisco reported better-than-expected 2Q results, with revenues and earnings of $12 billion and $0.79 per share, respectively, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $11.9 billion and $0.75. (See Cisco Systems stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the quarterly results, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a Buy rating and price target of $54 (18.2% upside potential). In a note to investors, Daryanani stated that 2Q results came in ahead of estimates while management's 3Q forecasts were “largely in-line” with expectations. The Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 10 analysts recommending a Buy and 10 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $50.88 implies 11% upside potential from current levels. Shares have lost 1.3% over the past year.

2021-02-26,"Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is getting left out of the market’s incredibly strong performance. Aside from the Jan. 27 short-squeeze from Reddit users that lifted NOK stock to a $9.79 high, the company has no catalysts ahead. Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Nokia’s prospects in the telecom space are not entirely lost. Demand for high-performance networking gear is increasing. Mobile device usage is soaring and internet traffic volumes continue to rise. Nokia management must restructure its business to report higher profit margins. NOK Stock Fades Nokia posted good gross margins and revenue in its fourth quarter. The stock failed to get a lift from the report. Strong buying volumes the month before at higher prices will leave a mark on its stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Retail investors who overpaid for the stock will look for any opportunity to sell the stock, while long-term investors who missed the chance to sell the stock at between $7 and almost $10 will get frustrated. Unless it gets a buyout offer, Nokia will lag while the market soars to new highs. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) might offer to buy Nokia for its intellectual property (IP) and 5G positioning. Yet Cisco has its problems. 8 Stocks to Buy for March Cisco failed to capitalize on the telework boom due to the pandemic as Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) ate its lunch. If it had the foresight to develop WebEx for video meetings, its growth would not have stalled. Patent Revenue Nokia’s IP is still a cash cow that will give gross margins a lift. Management does not tout its value because of the uneven IP payment schedule. More recently, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) reportedly settled a long-lasting legal battle with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on the former’s patents. The settlement suggests that companies are now willing to set aside disagreements. Last October, Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) lost its case against Nokia. A Regional Court in Munich, Germany, ordered a sales ban on Lenovo’s laptop because Lenovo infringed on Nokia’s video coding patent. Cases like that imply that Nokia may amass a growing stream of patent revenue. It needs a growing cash flow to invest in the business. Plus, buying back shares, reinstating the dividend, and increasing research and development activities are critical steps in increasing shareholder value. A growing worldwide ban against China-based Huawei is a one-time opportunity for Nokia. Growing competition in 5G and other wireless technology will encourage a country to protect its domestic companies. As long as the momentum for countries to ban Huawei remains strong, Nokia will have a chance to grow its wireless base station market. Outlook Without the Huawei tailwind, Nokia forecasts a strong full-year 2021. Net sales will be between 20.6 billion euro and 21.8 billion euro. The company ended the fourth quarter with a strong liquidity position of 8.1 billion euro in cash and investments. It has no major debt due until 2024 and beyond. The healthy financial positioning suggests that Nokia may take advantage of its low stock price. Nokia has 5.61 billion shares outstanding. It could increase its earnings per share by buying back stock. Shares may fall to the $2.34-$3.00 range in the coming months as frustrated investors sell. That gives Nokia a chance to lower the share float at lower costs. Source: Data from Stock Rover As you can see in the chart to the right, Nokia scores fairly well on value. Nokia’s Capital Markets Day is on March 18. It will assess its dividend policy and update its investors by then. With a short float of only 1.01%, Nokia has no incentive to reinstate its dividend. Investors are not buying the stock for the income potential. They are betting on the growing 5G network upgrade demand lifting revenue. At a forward price-earnings ratio of around 18 times, Nokia stock is cheap. Investors are better off holding the stock now instead of chasing expensive speculations. A buyout, a dividend reinstatement, or a surprisingly strong quarter would quickly put an end to the stock’s weak performance.

2021-02-27,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether to declare unconstitutional a system that technology companies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., have used to invalidate hundreds of patents and head off litigation.In an argument at the intersection of intellectual property and the separation of powers, the justices on Monday will consider a challenge to a congressionally-created board that critics have dubbed a “death squad” because of its tendency to toss out patents.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has invalidated more than 2,000 patents since it began work in 2012. Apple says it alone has used the board to successfully attack almost 200 patents, many held by entities interested only in filing lawsuits and extracting royalties. Congress set up the board, known as PTAB, in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to litigation.But some smaller inventors see a chance to undercut the board, saying it’s become an anticompetitive tool for large companies.The case “has the potential to shut down the PTAB, if only for a moment until Congress can do something to get it back on course,” said Jim Carmichael, a former PTAB judge and now managing director of Carmichael IP. “For many inventors and patent owners, that’s a very exciting prospect.”At issue is whether more than 250 PTAB judges are serving in violation of the Constitution. The federal appeals court that handles most patent disputes said the judges have important enough powers that they need to be appointed directly by the president.Should the Supreme Court agree, it could go as far as barring the board from continuing to review and invalidate patents. The justices could also issue a more limited ruling that would strip the judges of their job protections but leave the board’s powers intact. Either way, a decision against the board could mean that hundreds of cases would have to be reconsidered.Constitutional FightThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the judges are “principal officers,” a constitutional category that requires presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. The court said it reached that conclusion in part because patent judges’ decisions, typically issued by three-person panels, aren’t subject to review by a presidentially appointed official at the agency.The Justice Department is urging the Supreme Court to leave the system in place, saying patent judges are “inferior officers,” who the Constitution says don’t have be presidential appointees. In a brief filed before leaving office, President Donald Trump’s administration said the Patent & Trademark Office director and the Commerce secretary together have broad control over the work of the judges. Among other tools, the patent office director can decide which judges sit on a review panel.The Supreme Court said in a 1997 case involving Coast Guard judges that inferior officers are people “whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.”The case before the justices involves an Arthrex Inc. surgical device patent invalidated by PTAB after a challenge by Smith & Nephew Plc. The court has deferred action in dozens of other cases likely to be affected by its ruling.Technology CompaniesApple, the single biggest user of the review boards, filed a brief backing Arthrex. The iPhone maker said it relies “on Congress’s promise of a fair and efficient forum to challenge what often prove to be woefully weak patents that should not have issued in the first instance.”Other companies backing PTAB include Intel Corp. and an alliance whose members include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.A group describing itself as “39 aggrieved inventors” said intellectual property rights are “under attack by large corporations that are motivated to devalue patents and quell competition.”“There is no place for overlooking constitutional violations and contrived, convoluted administrative shortcuts when the future of small businesses and their owners’ livelihoods hang in the balance,” the group said.The drug industry is largely staying out of the fight, though a trade group for the generic-drug industry urged the court to preserve the PTAB.So many patents have been invalidated that it’s been called a “death squad,” a term coined by Randall Rader, the former chief judge of the Federal Circuit, which oversees all patent disputes in the country. The patent office has since altered its rules, giving patent owners a better shot at surviving the challenges.PTAB already survived one challenge at the Supreme Court. In 2018, justices found the panel wasn’t unconstitutionally wielding powers that belong to the courts.The court is scheduled to rule by late June. The lead case is U.S. v. Arthrex, 19-1434.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","‘Death Squad’ That Tossed 2,000 Patents Challenged at High Court"
2021-03-01,"(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. has publicly released its hybrid cloud service, furthering its plan to pivot the business toward the fast-growing market for storing large amounts of data on the internet.The expanded offering, called IBM Cloud Satellite, allows customers to control how they store their information, with some of it held internally in what’s known as private cloud, and other data stored in public clouds such as Amazon.com Inc’s AWS, or Microsoft Corp’s Azure. As a latecomer to cloud services, IBM is targeting highly-regulated industries such as banking and health care, which have been slow to adopt internet-based storage solutions due to security concerns and scale.For these industries, the integration of public and private clouds has been “too complex, too expensive, and a huge amount of risk,” said Howard Boville, head of hybrid cloud at IBM. To accommodate such clients, Cloud Satellite is designed to streamline cybersecurity, and make regulatory compliance “invisible,” Boville said.IBM sees the evolution as a crucial step in Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna’s vision to transform the century-old company into a modern enterprise focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. IBM has collaborated with 65 companies, including Dell, Intel Corp., and Cisco Systems Inc., to help customers run workloads and to provide input on Cloud Satellite’s development.Lumen Technologies, previously known as CenturyLink, will be a Cloud Satellite partner, and deploy the service at 180,000 enterprise locations. The ability to offer the Cloud Satellite service to companies where the data now lives, will help offer reassurance to businesses whose data is highly sensitive and who have been hesitant to move it to a public storage site, according to IBM.“Only 20% of enterprise data is in the cloud today, we have an opportunity to help migrate 80% of mission-critical workloads to the cloud,” IBM said in a statement Monday.Since becoming CEO last spring, Krishna has moved quickly to implement the transformation plan for IBM. During an investor call in January, Krishna said that he was confident the company’s focus on those areas can help it achieve revenue growth in 2021, reversing a ten-quarter trend of no growth or declines in sales.Krishna, who previously headed IBM’s cloud division, was the driving force behind the company’s $34 billion purchase of open source software provider Red Hat in 2018, the first step toward transitioning IBM into what it sees as a $1 trillion hybrid-cloud market. The company is also expected to complete a spin off of its managed infrastructure services unit into a separate publicly traded company this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","IBM Expands Hybrid Cloud Service, Targeting Banks, Health Care"

2021-03-03,"Shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $45.1. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-06-18 Strike Price: $42.00 Volume: 1217 Open Interest: 14885 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-03-22,"Shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $49.37. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $48.00 Volume: 750 Open Interest: 8964 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Uniphore Software Systems Pvt, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and improve customer support provided over the phone, raised $140 million to expand its services to areas such as video calls.The Series D round was led by Sorenson Capital Partners, with new investors including Cisco Investments and earlier backers such as March Capital Partners and Chiratae Ventures participating, the startup said in a statement. Uniphore, with its main offices in Chennai, India, and Palo Alto, California, has now raised a total $210 million.The company is targeting a niche in a cloud-based enterprise software industry led by Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. The coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for video and voice calls, and Uniphore’s software helps companies improve their service by, for example, detecting and predicting customers’ intent.“Because of the pandemic, people can’t get to their bank, shopping mall or doctor so customers reaching out online or via call centers quadrupled,” said Umesh Sachdev, co-founder and chief executive officer. “Labor-intensive contact centers couldn’t handle the deluge so AI and automation products like ours stepped in to fill the gap.”Sales tripled in the fiscal year ending March 2021 and the company is set to reach $100 million in annual subscription revenue, Sachdev said, speaking via video conference from Silicon Valley. The startup plans to double its headcount to about 600 in the fiscal year ending March 2022.Uniphore’s software listens in to customer-support conversations, helps detect what the caller wants and provides coaching to agents. Its applications help as many as 75,000 customer-service agents to handle about 160 million engagements every month. Customers such as NTT Data Corp. and WNS Holdings Ltd. typically pay an annual fee for its software.The company is conducting trials for AI technology that analyzes real-time video interactions. On a Zoom or WebEx video call with potential customers, a salesperson can use the software to detect which participant is disinterested or distracted. A human-resources executive can use the technology to analyze a candidate’s facial expressions during a job interview -- a controversial area that has faced criticism for potential flaws or bias.By 2023, 75% of companies providing customer-support outsourcing will adopt AI and analytics because such technologies reduce costs and provide competitive advantage, Tervinderjit Singh, an analyst at Gartner in Auckland, said in a January report.Sachdev, 35, founded Uniphore in 2008 with his engineering classmate Ravi Saraogi. Its existing backers include former Cisco CEO John Chambers, Analog Devices Inc. founder Ray Stata and Kris Gopalakrishnan, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Ltd.Uniphore is in early conversations about going public either via a direct listing or special purpose acquisition company. “Going public is a natural outcome and we are starting to look at doing it in the next couple of years,” Sachdev said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Uniphore Raises $140 Million to Expand AI to Video-Call Analysis

2021-04-02,"Cybersecurity stocks remain one of the hottest sectors for investors looking for growth in 2021. The global pandemic spawned by the novel coronavirus became the catalyst to a massive technological shift to support remote work. Once thought to be too expensive, too complicated, too (fill-in-the-blank) to consider, it suddenly became a necessity. Cybersecurity is at the forefront of this technological shift. And it’s a trend that’s likely to continue. The reason for that is that remote work, in one form or another, is likely to continue. According to a Gartner HP survey, up to 41% of employees are likely to work remotely at least some of the time once the pandemic ends. And with cybercrime one of the largest issues facing every business today, it’s not a surprise that businesses are looking for companies that are capable of managing their cybersecurity. In 2020, many cybersecurity stocks moved steadily higher. That narrative continued into 2021 until recently. As part of the tech selloff, many of these stocks have not been left out. However this is creating an opportunity for savvy investors to pick up these stocks at a discount they may not see for some time to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds Here are seven cybersecurity stocks that will remain vital as the world continues to work from home: Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) Cloudflare Inc. (NYSE:NET) Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Cybersecurity Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Cisco Systems bucked the larger trend with cybersecurity stocks. Shares of CSCO stock dipped dramatically in late summer of last year and didn’t start to recover until November. However, the stock has also not seen the dramatic dip that has gripped other stocks in this sector. One reason for that, perhaps, is that Cisco is seen these days as a value stock. The company’s revenue has been a bit flat for the liking of some investors. However, Cisco offers a compelling dividend. The company has increased its dividend for the last 10 years and has a payout ratio of just over 50%, which suggests the dividend will be safe for years to come. That means that the company has approximately half of its net income available for a variety of investments, stock buybacks and perhaps to increase the amount of future payouts. Growth investors will need to have some patience, but Cisco may reward them with strong growth to go along with a dividend. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Palo Alto Networks is an example of a company that is seeing its stock fall without a really good reason. Since the company posted earnings in February, PANW stock is down approximately 20%. Some of this may simply be profit-taking. However, with the stock price down to levels not seen since last December, investors should see this dip as a buying opportunity. Unlike Cisco Systems, Palo Alto doesn’t pay a dividend. But the company raised its full-year guidance. For the full-year, Palo Alto is forecasting revenue to increase 22% to 23%. This is higher than the company’s prior guidance for revenue growth of 20% to 21%. And the company also expects adjusted earnings to grow between 19% and 21%. The 8 Biggest Growth Stocks of the First Quarter Some of this is due to Palo Alto’s introduction of two new platforms that are generating annual recurring revenue (ARR). And the company is realizing an increase in deferred revenue as well. It’s also music to investors’ ears, as Palo Alto has been on an acquisition spree as of late. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com CrowdStrike provides a wide range of solutions focused on real-time endpoint security, threat intelligence and cloud workload protection. All of this is done to prevent cyberattacks on and off an enterprise’s network. And during the pandemic, the company has put together a cybersecurity resource center that, in their words, “guide[s] you through the security risks, infrastructure challenges, and the sheer volume and variety of cyberthreats.” The company appears to be another exceptional buy-on-the-dip candidate. Despite posting a double beat in their earnings report, the stock dropped approximately 10% and was down almost 20% in the month of March. However, the company is a relative new kid on the block. It’s only been publicly traded since 2019 and is up 184% in that time. In its most recent earnings report, the company posted a 74% year-over-year increase in revenue, and, although the company is not yet profitable, it cut its posted negative earnings per share to 9 cents, which was significantly higher than the negative 14 cents in the prior year. Additionally, the company attracts significant interest from institutional investors that own about 74% of the stock. Zscaler Inc. (ZS) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Zscaler is another niche player that is set up to thrive as remote work becomes the new normal. The company helps users safely browse the internet and access applications regardless of their device, location or network. Zscaler just got an upgrade from Truist analyst Joel Fishbein, who gave the company a price target of $225, which is a gain of approximately 28% from its current level. Fishbein wrote, “Zscaler is benefiting from a favorable demand backdrop following the SolarWinds hack …” The analyst went on to cite the company’s secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud security and Zero Trust architecture. 7 Oil Stocks Being Squeezed by Weak Demand In the last 12 months, ZS stock is up 184%, and that is despite the company’s stock being down nearly 12% so far in 2021. The company has only been a publicly traded stock since 2018. However, the company has over 20% of the Fortune 500 among its customer base of approximately 4,000 customers. Cloudflare Inc. (NET) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Cloudflare is a niche player in the cybersecurity sector. The company is a leader in edge computing. It offers services like DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) mitigation and internet security to manage the traffic that consumers go through online. Cloudflare just had its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. But it’s already been garnering interest from hedge fund portfolios. In the last year, a total of 44 hedge funds include the stock. That’s above its previous high of 33. In the last year, NET stock is up 197%. This is despite the stock being down about 7% in the last month, largely due to getting caught up in the tech selloff. In the company’s most recent earnings report, the company posted revenue that was approximately 50% higher than the same quarter in the prior year. This leaves some analysts concerned that the company has little room for error. Okta (OKTA) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Okta operates in the sector of identity authentication. Essentially, the company seeks to help ensure that companies can easily identify, verify and enforce who accesses a network at any time. To do so, the company uses everything from traditional passwords to biometrics. The company is growing rapidly and now has over 8,000 clients. OKTA stock is up 92% in the last 12 months. In fiscal year 2021, the company grew revenue 43% on a year-over-year basis. The stock is down approximately 15% over the last month. Some of this was due to softer guidance in the company’s earnings report, and some of it was also due to the company’s announcement that they would be acquiring Auth0 for $6.5 billion. 8 Small-Cap Stocks With Plenty of Cred Analysts remain bullish on the stock, even though several have lowered their price target for the company. Okta is a clear leader in the niche sector it occupies, making it an ideal buy-on-the-dip candidate among cybersecurity stocks. DocuSign (DOCU) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Ending our list today is a company that wouldn’t necessarily be top-of-mind when it comes to cybersecurity stocks. However, DocuSign has a global enterprise security program that allows it to protect its customers from cyberattacks such as phishing, which remains a growing threat. One of the company’s signature products that help to that end is Pescatore, which is a unique URL classification system. The company’s cybersecurity services aren’t likely to supplant the revenue that DocuSign gets from its core e-signature business. However, it does help make the business more sticky, which should help the company retain customers and generate more recurring revenue. To that end, DocuSign CEO Dan Springer estimates the company got 10 extra percentage points of growth in fiscal 2021 due to shifting work requirements due to the pandemic. For next year, the company is projecting 31% growth. DOCU stock is up 124% in the last 12 months. But like many of the stocks on this list, it’s down 7% year-to-date.

2021-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Verkada Inc.'s security camera customers were livid. Hackers had breached footage from thousands of surveillance devices trained on their operations, including schools, prisons, hospitals and companies around the world. On a webinar with Verkada’s CEO, users wanted answers. Fast.One pointed question came from Sequoia Capital, Verkada's most prominent investor: How, inquired Silas Thomas, information technology manager at the venture capital firm, can we cut off Verkada employees from access to Sequoia’s cameras?Verkada Chief Executive Officer Filip Kaliszan told Thomas that access had already been disabled. In response to another customer’s query, he summed up the mood. “We understand that this definitely kind of made it difficult to trust us.”Once little known outside of Silicon Valley, Verkada gained unwanted notoriety in March after Bloomberg reported that hackers had accessed the internet-connected cameras in facilities of its customers, including the carmaker Tesla Inc. and cybersecurity firm Cloudflare Inc. Although some sales staffers allegedly marketed Verkada as “virtually unhackable,” the breach exposed alarmingly lax safeguards at a company selling powerful surveillance tools that include facial recognition technology and that promised security and privacy protections to go with them. In the weeks since then, current and former employees have told Bloomberg that the inattention to data protection was emblematic of a larger “bro culture” that was sophomoric and sales obsessed, and which tolerated the harassment of women, frequent partying and misleading marketing claims.Video footage of female employees was passed among male colleagues, who offered graphic comments, and in-office parties -- even during the pandemic -- were prone to excessive drinking and occasional drug use, according to the employees.“Verkada gives frat boys a bad name,” one former sales employee said. In a statement, a Verkada spokesperson said, “We acknowledge that early on, our internal policies did not initially keep pace with our rapid growth; however, we have taken several steps to ensure we are creating a supportive and inclusive environment.’’ A party celebrating the company’s first $100 million in sales, during which many employees didn’t wear masks despite the pandemic, was “a lapse in judgement,” the spokesperson said.“Excessive drinking in the office and illicit drug use of any kind — both of which are grounds for termination — have never been commonplace at Verkada,” the spokesperson said. In-office celebrations could include champagne toasts but didn’t mean employees were intoxicated. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV in March, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha praised Verkada for swiftly reacting to the breach. “They’re sending out very frequent updates on a daily basis as they’re investigating, and making sure this is an experience that is not repeated,"" Botha said.During the last year, Verkada has expanded its human resources team, completed a gender pay equity review and made compensation adjustments, implemented new training programs and strengthened mechanisms that employees can use to report abusive behavior with a 24/7 anonymous hotline, the company said. Verkada also has “refocused how we recruit and hire diverse candidates,” according to the spokesperson.“Verkada is committed to creating a workplace that is respectful and inclusive of everyone,” the spokesperson said. “We have clear policies around sexual harassment and workplace behavior and there have been and will continue to be consequences for anyone who violates them.’’The company declined to comment on some of the specific instances outlined in this article, nearly all of which three or more current or former employees confirmed. For this story, Bloomberg interviewed eight current Verkada employees and 15 former employees, all of whom requested anonymity either to protect professional relationships or because they weren't authorized to speak on the company’s behalf. Some praised Verkada’s sense of camaraderie and management, particularly recent efforts to address cultural problems such as hiring more women and cracking down on misbehavior. However, most spoke critically of the company and its work environment.Signs of internal problems emerged last year, after a group of men at Verkada captured images of female employees with internal cameras, without their knowledge, and posted them on a Slack channel, along with sexually graphic comments, several former employees said. The rogue Slack channel was initially reported in October 2020 by the trade publication IPVM . The organizers initially received a light punishment — they had their stock options reduced — but were later fired after news of the Slack channel spread, former employees said. In an October communication to his staff, Kaliszan said the initial discipline wasn’t adequate and apologized. In another episode early this year, Verkada fired a sales manager after he exposed himself to a female colleague at a late-night, out-of-office gathering involving some members of the sales team, according to three people familiar with the incident. The firing, which came swiftly after an internal investigation, was considered a turning point in the company's attitude toward inappropriate behavior, according to the people. The sales manager declined to comment.Verkada isn’t the only Silicon Valley startup in which employees — often young, single and flush with cash — have engaged in questionable behavior, including sexual misconduct and substance abuse. But Verkada sells security cameras that peer into offices, factory floors, intensive care units and other sensitive areas — the kind of product that demands professionalism and discretion. Based in San Mateo, Verkada was founded in 2016 by three computer science graduates from Stanford University — Kaliszan, James Ren and Benjamin Bercovitz — and an experienced technology hand, Hans Robertson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate. He had co-founded the startup Meraki — which sold cloud-managed networking devices — and was acquired by Cisco Systems for $1.2 billion in 2012.Figures provided by Verkada show that the company raised money quickly--$15 million in 2018 led by Next47, $40 million in April 2019 led by Meritech Capital Partners and Sequoia Capital, and $80 million in November 2019 led by Felicis Ventures. By then, the company was valued at $1.6 billion; it now has 550 employees. Its market share had grown rapidly too, from 38 customers in 2017 to more than 5,500 last year, according to the company’s website.But according to former employees and others, Verkada’s sales pitch to customers sometimes included misleading claims.In some instances, sales staffers told customers that Verkada’s system was “virtually unhackable,” and that Verkada had hired the cybersecurity company Okta Inc. to perform a penetration test to gauge the safety of its networks and determined that it couldn’t be breached.An Okta spokesman said the company conducted its own penetration test of Verkada as part of its due diligence as a customer and found some vulnerabilities, which it forwarded to the camera company. Okta said it never conducted a pen test on behalf of Verkada. “It is disingenuous to use the Okta brand in this manner,” the spokesman said.The Verkada spokesperson said, “We expect our sales team to accurately represent our products and answer questions truthfully.”Verkada also marketed itself to potential customers as a “Stanford/MIT company,” according to emails that Bloomberg obtained via public records requests. Stanford said it wasn’t affiliated with Verkada, and MIT said in a statement, “Companies should not refer to themselves as an ‘MIT company’ simply because of a founder’s alumni status.”At the same time, Verkada’s sales team engaged in behavior that went well beyond the norm in a profession that thrives on adrenaline and profits, the employees said. Drinking among the sales staff was allegedly excessive even by the often-casual standards of technology startups, where refrigerators full of beer aren’t uncommon. Two former employees said they saw cocaine use in the office.Impromptu celebrations would break out when a sales representative closed a deal worth more than $20,000, with alcohol flowing and music blaring, according to the employees. The sales team would regularly engage in a chant – “Mo-ney! Mo-ney! Mo-ney!” – that would become a roar, sometimes lasting minutes.A sales team scavenger hunt in 2019 included drunken employees filing into a Casper store in San Francisco, where they bounced on the mattresses, wrestled with each other and posed for pictures. The store manager called Verkada's customer service line to complain, saying their employer was obvious due to the group's logo-emblazoned T-shirts. A Casper spokeswoman confirmed the incident but provided no further details.One employee described being on the phone with a customer, when suddenly some members of the sales team turned on a speaker and began blasting a Cardi B song with sexually explicit lyrics. The employee recalled having to seek a quieter place in the office and apologize to the customer.Management at least acknowledged the disruption caused by the sales teams’ allegedly bawdy antics. They told some of the engineering staff to expense noise-canceling headphones, according to two former employees.Some former employees said they felt left out while working at Verkada, which grew up at a time when Silicon Valley was reckoning with the MeToo movement and companies from Google to Uber were addressing challenges faced by female employees. At Verkada, meetings and events routinely began with Robertson saying, “OK boys” or “Yeah, gentlemen,” seemingly ignoring the women in the room, the former employees said. Two other former staffers described a loud discussion in the open-plan office about a well-qualified job candidate. A Verkada marketing executive said he didn’t want to hire her because she was a mother and wouldn’t be motivated to work on weekends.The marketing executive didn’t respond to a message seeking comment. The Verkada spokesperson said the company rejects that characterization. “Verkada looks for the best people for every role, and we would never discriminate.” Many of its employees are parents, including those on the executive’s team, the company’s spokesperson said. In November 2019, at an all-hands meeting where employees could submit inquiries anonymously via an app, one pointed out that a female director had departed, leaving no women executives, while another questioned Verkada’s “pervasive hyper-masculine culture,” according to screenshots reviewed by Bloomberg. The questions were read aloud and answered by Kaliszan, who said a group of friends who happened to be male founded the company. But he said Verkada needed to make an effort to hire more women. ​​​​In responses on the app, which employees could view in real time, one wrote anonymously, “Some employees are too concerned with a liberal agenda.” Another wrote, “Proud to work at a company that is hiring the best people for the job regardless of their gender.”According to a Verkada spokesperson, the company hired a new head of human resources, Dervilla Lannon, in March 2020, and she was promoted in November, joining the executive team. Of its employees, 21% identify as female, and they make up 23% of management positions, according to the spokesperson, who added the company still has a way to go. The recent hack raised new questions within the company. Two current and three former employees said they believed the aggressive focus on sales and growth, paired with the allegedly boisterous office environment, contributed to a lack of attention on security.Three former engineering employees said they had raised concerns internally between 2018 and 2019 about the widespread use of Super Admin accounts, which gave staffers access to customer cameras. The accounts didn’t always require extra security settings to login, such as two-factor authentication, making them potentially vulnerable to hackers if passwords were leaked or otherwise compromised.Last year, the company began reducing the number of employees with those accounts and tightened settings, ensuring that newly created Super Admin users would have to use two-factor authentication, according to two former employees. However, the employees said, the new settings weren’t applied to some older accounts, and it remained possible for someone with Super Admin credentials to login and view camera footage through a Verkada website that was accessible on the internet.Those oversights would come back to bite the company. In March, Verkada hired Kyle Randolph, an experienced chief information security officer. But Randolph, a former security engineer at Twitter Inc. and Adobe Inc., had little time to patch up the vulnerabilities. In his second week on the job, an international hacker collective gained access to a Super Admin account and breached Verkada, gaining entry to customer cameras and throwing the company into crisis.Randolph didn't respond to messages seeking comment.“I wasn’t shocked by the hack – the way we did some things could be prone to abuse,” said one former Verkada engineer. “We were not mature enough as a company. We were driven too much by numbers.”(Updates with Sequoia comment in ninth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","‘Bro Culture’ at Camera Maker Verkada Pushed Profits, Parties"

2021-04-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it will open an engineering hub in North Carolina, marking its first major campus on the U.S. East Coast as part of an increased commitment to investing domestically.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant said Monday it will spend $1 billion in the area around Raleigh Durham and Chapel Hill, known as the Research Triangle and home to other big companies that have a significant presence there including IBM, Cisco Systems Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Apple said it will create 3,000 jobs at the new site in machine learning, artificial intelligence and software engineering.Apple joins other tech peers in expanding beyond West Coast headquarters to take advantage of more diverse work forces and investment incentives. In 2019 Apple broke ground on a second, $1 billion-campus in Austin that could eventually house 15,000 employees. Apple said staff could start moving in next year. Facebook Inc., Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc. and Oracle Corp., have also been drawn to the Texas city, while Amazon.com Inc. is building a second headquarters in Northern Virginia and has also been expanding in New York.Apple’s announcement comes as part of the iPhone maker’s planned 20% increase in U.S. investments over the next five years, allocating $430 billion in direct spending on U.S.-based suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the U.S., and other projects, including dozens of Apple TV+ productions and research and development on technologies like custom silicon and 5G. The effort will result in 20,000 new jobs, including in San Diego, Los Angeles, Boulder, Colorado, and Boston by 2026, the company said in a statement Monday.“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to U.S. innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.Apple’s rapid expansion comes as the pandemic and other forces such as lower cost of living elsewhere make Silicon Valley less appealing for engineering talent. Apple’s main campuses are The Apple Park and the Infinite Loop, about 40 miles south of San Francisco.The moves show that Apple is willing to go to where the talent lives and where the cost of doing business is cheaper. Los Angeles is a hub for entertainment, San Diego is home to many chip and wireless networking experts, while the Raleigh-Durham area has established itself as a major U.S. technology research hub. Before Apple settled on Austin for its 2019 expansion, North Carolina pushed hard for an Apple campus by offering tax breaks.Over the past three years, Apple’s investments have outpaced its original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018, the company said. But Apple has also been growing. Its shares have gained about 200% since the last investment plan was announced in January 2018, and the company is now worth more than $2 trillion. Apple said it’s also the U.S.’s biggest taxpayer, having shelled out $45 billion in domestic corporate income taxes in the past five years.Increasing investment in the U.S. also comes as President Joe Biden has announced new plans to boost taxes on overseas profits to help foot the bill for domestic infrastructure projects. Apple and other big tech companies disclosed more than $100 billion in profit outside the U.S. in their last fiscal years, making them prime targets of the president’s proposal.Apple is on track to meet its 2018 goal of creating 20,000 new jobs in the U.S. by 2023, the company said. The new commitment will include growing its San Diego team to more than 5,000 employees by 2026, a 500% increase from its 2018 goal. Apple is also boosting its engineering team in Boulder, Colorado, by 700 people and adding hundreds of jobs in Massachusetts, Washington, Iowa and Colorado. As it grows, Apple said it’s committed to doing so in an environmentally sustainable way. Almost 60 of Apple’s U.S. sites are LEED certified, the company said. Apple said it’s carbon neutral for all of its operations in the U.S. and around the world, and last year committed to be 100% carbon neutral for its entire supply chain and products by 2030.Apple’s shares were little changed at $134.94 at 3:14 p.m. in New York.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Pledges $1 Billion for New North Carolina Engineering Hub

2021-05-10,"(Bloomberg Law) -- Civil rights advocates are calling on a U.S. agency to recognize that caste discrimination is illegal under existing federal law, an issue growing more prominent as tech companies are hit with litigation by South Asian workers alleging bias based on social status.A dozen groups, including the International Commission on Dalit Rights, pressed the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to acknowledge that the practice of discriminating against historically oppressed South Asian groups is “an urgent contemporary U.S. civil rights and social justice issue,” according to a memo sent to the agency on Monday and obtained by Bloomberg Law.Caste prejudices parallel race bias in the U.S. because both “are social constructs designed to uphold systems of domination, exclusion, injustice, inequality, and discrimination,” the memo says. Advocates for the Dalit population, or the lowest caste in the hierarchical social system, say the mistreatment is more prevalent in workplaces with large populations of South Asian employees, such as in the technology sector.Cisco Systems Inc. last year was sued by a California agency for allegedly discriminating against a Dalit worker because of his caste. That case, brought under state law, remains pending. Apple Inc. is also defending a similar lawsuit, while Microsoft Corp. has said it’s fielded complaints of caste discrimination. Read more: Big Tech Is Importing India’s Caste Legacy to Silicon Valley The EEOC enforces federal workplace anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits bias based on race, national origin, and other protected statuses. The groups say those provisions encompass caste discrimination, as well. But very few caste bias allegations have made their way through courts to test whether Title VII or state laws protect against that form of discrimination.“The EEOC’s recognition of the intertwined nature of caste and race is an urgent and crucial step towards promoting human dignity, and ensuring justice, equality and nondiscrimination in the workplace,” the memo states.The EEOC doesn’t have a formal “policy position” on how Title VII may apply to caste discrimination, said Joseph Olivares, an EEOC spokesman, before receiving the memo.Ongoing LitigationCaste discrimination occurs within South Asian communities, with workers at the bottom of the hierarchy experiencing harassment, bullying, and exclusion “in private, public and places of work,” the memo states.“Every day, on a covert basis, many Dalit Americans face discrimination that can be addressed by the American legal system,” the groups said. “All Americans must be treated with dignity and respect at work and in all other aspects of their lives regardless of caste or race, descent and national origin or another protected classification.”American companies, and their human resources departments, are being forced to grapple with these prejudices as they’re imported with workers from other cultures. In the Cisco case, for example, an unnamed Dalit employee identified only as John Doe alleged he faced a hostile work environment, and received less pay and fewer opportunities.“We have zero tolerance for discrimination and take all complaints of unfair treatment very seriously. In this case, we thoroughly and fully investigated the employee’s concerns and found that he was treated fairly, highly compensated, and afforded opportunities to work on coveted projects,” Cisco spokeswoman Robyn Blum said in an email Monday. “If we had found any discrimination or retaliation, we would have remediated it.”Microsoft declined to comment and Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.Not all groups agree that caste discrimination is prevalent in the U.S.“Caste has no legal, social, or cultural definition in the United States, and is not an observable or objectively determinable trait or characteristic,” said the Hindu American Foundation, a religious advocacy group, in the group’s motion to intervene in the Cisco case. The organization alleges the California employment agency’s lawsuit violates the constitutional rights of Hindu Americans.To contact the reporter on this story: Paige Smith in Washington at psmith@bloomberglaw.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jay-Anne B.

2021-05-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other large technology companies added their voices to the chip industry’s calls for U.S. lawmakers to provide $50 billion in funding for legislation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor production.The Semiconductors in America Coalition, which also includes Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., is sending letters to Congressional leaders asking them to fund the CHIPS for America Act passed earlier this year, according to a statement from the Semiconductor Industry Association, which is a member. Public money would go to provide incentives for manufacturing and research in the U.S.Semiconductor production and plant locations have increasingly come into focus amid shortages that have hurt shipments of everything from iPhones to pickup trucks, caused by spikes in demand as parts of the economy recover from the depths of the pandemic. The U.S. is home to companies that dominate the chip industry’s revenue, while the majority of manufacturing of the crucial electronic components is done in Asia.Technology companies want the government to partially foot the bill for stemming a slide in U.S. production, which has seen its share of the market drop to 12% from 37% in 1990, according to the SIA. But they don’t want government to step in to mandate where more immediate chip supply is channeled. Automakers, who weren’t mentioned as members of the coalition in SIAC’s release, have lobbied to have semiconductor output assigned to their needs to help return their plants back to full production.“The current shortage of semiconductors is impacting a broad range of industries throughout the economy. To address this problem in the short term, government should refrain from intervening as industry works to correct the current supply-demand imbalance causing the shortage,” the new organization said in the statement provided by the SIA. “But for the longer term, robust funding of the CHIPS Act would help America build the additional capacity necessary to have more resilient supply chains to ensure critical technologies will be there when we need them.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Tech Giants Urge Congress to Fund Chip Act, Focus on Long-Term"

2021-05-17,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) plans to acquire privately-held California-based Kenna Security in a bid to enhance its security offerings. The technology company develops and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products. The deal is likely to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. However, the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kenna Security, Inc. is a cybersecurity company that provides vulnerability management technology. It uses machine learning (ML) and data science to track, predict, prioritize and find solutions for cyber risks. Per the terms of the deal, Cisco plans to integrate Kenna’s threat and risk-based vulnerability management technology into its SecureX platform. The integration is likely to expand Cisco’s security platform and help businesses to discover and prioritize assets and vulnerabilities. This will ultimately help the IT and security teams to reduce attacks, speed up and automate decision-making with personalized information, and handle vulnerabilities in a better way. Cisco Security and Collaboration’s senior VP Jeetu Patel said, “Hybrid work is here to stay, and the increasing complexity of cybersecurity is our customers’ biggest challenge. We must radically simplify security to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.” Patel further added, “Our goal is to unify all critical control points into a single platform. With the addition of Kenna Security, we will fundamentally strengthen our platform experience by giving customers the ability to prioritize vulnerabilities based on a robust risk methodology that is tuned to their unique needs.” (See Cisco Systems stock analysis on TipRanks) On May 14, Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold increased the stock’s price target to $55 from $50 (4% upside potential) and reiterated a Buy rating. Leopold said, “We think the April quarter meets expectations; supply chain constraints and a more gradual recovery dampen prospects. Checks at resellers and distributors revealed weak trends through March with modest improvement in April. Supply chain checks did not reveal challenges.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 8 Buys versus 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $57.10 implies almost 8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 17.4% over the past year.

Here’s Why.
2021-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares fell after the company said its profitability is being squeezed by the cost of securing components needed to meet a surge in orders driven by a rebound in spending on computer networks.The biggest maker of gear that’s the backbone of the internet gave an optimistic revenue forecast helped by what it called the strongest demand in a decade. But its profit projection was below Wall Street estimates after the company chose to “endure short-term pain” to make sure it has enough chips to meet its order obligations, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said.Like many other companies, Cisco is feeling the pinch of a shortage of semiconductors available to meet rising demand as chunks of the world economy rebound from the worst of the pandemic-driven recession. Cisco is paying more per component and having to fork out fees to expedite shipments.“We had a couple of choices, we could say ‘no’ and our customers would suffer and we suffer over the next few years because we lose share to those who say ‘yes,’” Robbins said in an interview. “We’re feeling more momentum than we have in a long time and I didn’t feel like that was the right decision for the company. We decided to take it on the chin.”Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said he expects those shortages will last until the end of 2020. Absent the constraints, Cisco’s revenue projections would have been higher.Cisco shares fell more than 5% in extended trading, after closing at $52.47. The stock had rallied more than 17% this year.Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter will rise 6% to 8% from a year earlier, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That indicates revenue of $12.9 billion to $13.1 billion, compared with an average analyst projection of $12.8 billion. Profit excluding certain items in the period will be 81 to 83 cents a share, shy of the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The profitability squeeze overshadowed commentary and an earnings report from the company that provided strong evidence the economy is rebounding from the low point of 2020.Sales in the fiscal third quarter totaled $12.8 billion, an increase of 7% from a year earlier. Profit, minus certain items, was 83 cents a share, beating the average estimate by a penny.Under Robbins, Cisco is trying to recast itself as a provider of networking services and software. While revenue is increasing from those newer offerings, Cisco still gets the majority of sales from hardware. Software revenue grew 5%, security was up 13%, and infrastructure platforms - gear such as switches and routers - expanded 6% from a year earlier.Lead times, or the amount of time between placing an order and getting it filled, are on the rise for the semiconductor industry. Many companies are more willing to give chipmakers longer-term commitments and pay upfront.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fourth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Cisco Shares Slip on Profit Forecast Hurt by Component Costs

2021-05-20,"Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) expects a gross profit margin hit by 150 basis points in the current quarter from the pandemic fueled supply chain crisis, the Financial Times reports. Cisco also issued a cautious quarterly revenue growth guidance between 6%-8% after factoring in the crisis. The ongoing semiconductor chip crisis triggered by the pandemic induced higher demand for home electronic gadgets, leading to an acute semiconductor crisis leading to inflated prices and supply chain costs. Higher stockpiling by the manufacturers drove the prices. Cisco shares lost 6% in after-market trading following the statement despite the Q3 earnings beat. Cisco was paying a premium to ensure chip delivery, other key components, and higher expedite fees to keep production lines running. It expected the conditions to prevail till year-end. Cisco took a margin hit at present instead of passing on the higher price burden to the customers. However, it expects to raise the price in the future at a more suitable time. Chipmakers Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) estimated the semiconductor chip crisis to linger beyond 2021. Price action: CSCO shares traded lower by 0.55% at $52.18 on the last check Thursday.

Shares of the manufacturer of networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products plunged 5.6% in Wednesday’s extended trading session. Cisco reported adjusted Q3 earnings of $0.83 per share, up 5% year-over-year. Analysts had expected the company to report EPS of $0.82. Revenues surged 7% year-over-year to $12.8 billion and outpaced the consensus estimate of $12.56 billion. Strong performance across the business drove results. Adjusted gross margin was 66% in the quarter, down 60 basis points year-over-year. (See Cisco stock analysis on TipRanks) Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented, “We are confident in our strategy and our ability to lead the next phase of the recovery as our customers accelerate their adoption of hybrid work, digital transformation, cloud, and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based offerings.” For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, revenue is expected to reflect 6% – 8% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS is forecast in the range of $0.81 – $0.83, versus analysts’ expectations of $0.85. On May 17, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $57 (8.6% upside potential) on the stock. According to Marshall, the company remains well-positioned amid a recovery in the IT spending environment. Furthermore, the analyst argues that the coming rebound has not yet been priced into the stock’s current valuation. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 8 Buys versus 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $57.10 implies 8.8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 15.5% over the past year.

2021-05-21,"(Bloomberg) -- The notion of the teenage and twenty-something technology entrepreneur looms large. In reality, the most successful companies are more commonly founded by people in their 30s or older. Among startups valued at $1 billion or more created over the last 15 years, the median age of the founders when starting their businesses was 34, according to research in a new book called Super Founders: What Data Reveals About Billion-Dollar Startups.The finding offers new evidence that leaders with some experience bring advantages, said Ali Tamaseb, the author and a partner at the venture capital firm DCVC. “There are, indeed, many successful billion-dollar startup founders in their early twenties,” Tamaseb wrote in the book, “but most of them aren’t.” His takeaway: Age doesn’t matter.The profile of a prosperous tech founder in many people’s minds is distorted by some big outliers. Steve Jobs was 21 when he co-founded Apple. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg were 19 when they dropped out of Harvard University to start their companies. Often overlooked is that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, the two richest men in tech, were in their 30s when they created their most successful businesses.A widely cited study three years ago in the American Economic Review: Insights chipped away at the popular perception that Silicon Valley’s greatest entrepreneurs are all fresh college dropouts. Researchers found the average age of a successful startup founder was 45. The paper’s authors defined success based largely on growth rather than valuation and compiled a list of the 1,700 fastest-growing U.S. companies.“Super talented people are going to do great things even when they’re young,” said lead author Pierre Azoulay, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. “That doesn’t mean they’re not going to even better things when they’re older.” He pointed out that Apple’s arguably biggest success, its iPhone, didn’t come until Jobs was 52.Yet, the myth around youth has persisted. So Tamaseb took a narrower view of success that reflects the business world’s obsession with unicorn startups and examined several factors, including age. His pool is limited to about 200 companies. While that group of founders skews a decade younger than the average from the earlier study, it shows the top entrepreneurs often draw on experience formed earlier in their careers.For example, Zoom Video Communications Inc. founder Eric Yuan started the business at 41 after leaving a senior position at Cisco Systems Inc. WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum came up with his messaging app at 32 after spending a decade as an engineer at Yahoo.Founders of heath and biotech unicorns are older on average than those of other types of startups, Tamaseb said. The oldest of the bunch is Philip Greenberg, who was 68 when he started Juno Therapeutics, later bought by Celgene Corp. for $9 billion.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",The Typical Unicorn Founder Started Their Business at 34

2021-05-21,"Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is like your favorite sports team, assuming you’re a real fan and don’t just follow whoever wins. It’s always wait until next year. Since its glory days during the dot-com era, when it was briefly the world’s most valuable company, CSCO stock has been regularly disappointing investors. It’s still about 35% below its year 2000 high. Last year, when everyone was go-go on technology, I even told you to dump it. Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com But a decade after becoming a value stock and instituting a dividend (which now yields 2.8%), Cisco may finally be getting out of first gear. The company has bought yet another security start-up, and delivered what looked like strong earnings, with revenue up 7% and earnings up 5%. The market’s reaction has been a yawn. They didn’t like its conservative guidance. They didn’t like its supply chain issues. Never mind that orders were up 10%, and 17% from service providers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CSCO Stock: Disbelief is Strong Today Cisco is trading around $52.46 per share. That’s a market cap of $221 billion and a price to earnings ratio of 21.95. Cisco is delivering strong earnings and it’s a cheap stock. Analysts have given reasons for its sluggish movements. The sales number has barely budged in years. Earnings growth is in the single-digits. But Cisco has been executing a strategic turn, from relying on hardware sales (which are spotty and seasonal) to relying on software subscriptions (which are steady). This is reflected in its acquisitions, 11 in just the last year. The Top 7 Ways to Invest In Semiconductors Now Cisco seems to have regained its footing just as investors turn away from technology, toward retailers and other reopening plays. There remain 17 analysts following CSCO stock, and their average price target is just 11% ahead of its current price. The irony this time is that Cisco was hit in hardware, which it’s moving away from. The cause wasn’t a shortage of demand, but a shortage of chips, which hurt deliveries. Those shortages will likely ease in time. Cisco Software Meanwhile, Cisco has its fingers in most of software’s fast-growing pies. Cisco’s WebEx conferencing software and security offerings work together to win enterprise contracts over newcomers like Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM). Its software run rate is up to $14 billion/year. Subscriptions now represent 81% of that total, so its $3.8 billion handle for the quarter is a floor, not a ceiling. Cisco is poised to do big things in the Machine Internet, in point of sale software, and in video content analysis, all of them fast-growing niches. Software is becoming a cash cow, generating $15 billion in operating cash flow each year. This makes the $1.48/share annual dividend, which costs $6.3 billion per year to service, very safe. It also means Cisco can keep making acquisitions to keep its products on the leading edge. These are areas where scale is starting to matter. When problems are found they must be patched quickly. Cisco is patching quickly. CSCO Stock: The Bottom Line Cisco isn’t going to get you rich in your 60s, as it might have done in your 30s. Big numbers are hard to shift. But the modest, software-based strategies of CEO Chuck Robbins do mean that income investors can do well with Cisco. You buy it when it looks cheap, like now, and hold it. You let speculators bid up hot sectors and, when Cisco gets a little warmer (as it will), or when value comes into favor (as it will) you stand to benefit. Cisco is a get rich slowly stock.
