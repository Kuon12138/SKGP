## Attractive valuation

Last year’s ~57% plunge in General Electric (GE) stock has made its valuation attractive in the industrial sector. At current market prices, GE trades at a PE ratio of 9.96x, a significant discount to the industrial sector’s (XLI) PE ratio of 24.32x.

The stock also trades at a lower PE multiple to its top peers. The company’s main competitors such as Honeywell International (HON), 3M Company (MMM), and United Technologies (UTX) are trading at PE multiples of 16.77x, 19.50x, and 14.65x, respectively.

Furthermore, based on analysts’ next-12-month earnings projections, GE is trading at a discount to competitors. Forward PE ratios for GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 8.91x, 16.70x, 17.68x, and 13.71x, respectively.

The PE valuation multiple is used widely because of its simplicity, but the measurement has some flaws. For example, earnings of a company can be easily manipulated, thus making the ratio meaningless. Therefore, we’ll compare these companies based on EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) multiple.

Currently, GE has an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 31.54x, which is higher than HON, MMM, and UTX’s EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 10.87x 15.10x, and 10.87x, respectively. However, based on analysts’ next-12-month EBITDA estimates, GE is trading at a discounted EV-to-EBITDA multiple against HON and MMM, while at a premium to UTX. Forward EV-to-EBITDA ratios of GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 9.40x, 11.85x, 12.38x, and 8.71x, respectively.

## Analysts’ rating and target price

GE has received a consensus “hold” recommendation from analysts polled by Reuters. Of the 20 analysts tracking the stock, four recommended a “strong buy,” five recommended a “buy,” nine recommended a “hold,” and the remaining two recommended a “strong sell.”

Analysts have lowered their target price and EPS estimates for General Electric since its third-quarter results. The stock’s current 12-month consensus target price of $12.37 is ~20% lower than its target price of $15.50 on October 30, the day it reported its third-quarter results.

The mean estimate for GE’s 2018 EPS fell to $0.71 from $0.83 on October 30. The company’s 2019 EPS estimate has been revised downward to $0.85 from $0.93.

## Honeywell in collaboration with Optoro

On January 10, 2019, Honeywell (HON) announced that it plans to collaborate with Optoro. As a part of this collaboration, Honeywell’s Mobility Edge mobile computers will use Optoro’s cloud-based data-driven solution to help retailers better manage returned purchases and excess inventory. Optoro’s proprietary algorithms help to determine how to dispose of a returned item to get maximum value. HON didn’t disclose the financial aspects of this collaboration.

The latest data from the National Retail Federation suggests that returns from consumers have been growing every year, and retailers estimate that more than 10% of their annual sales are returned.

Peter Howes, Honeywell’s president for Productivity Products business, said, “Reverse logistics is becoming a complex challenge for retailers as they need to move returned goods within the supply chain as quickly as possible to reduce bottom-line impact. With Optoro running on our Mobility Edge Platform devices, retailers can quickly connect returns with best available opportunities to turn the products into revenue.”

## Stock price movement

Honeywell stock gained 2.0% and closed at $137.36 for the week ending January 11, 2019. The gains helped HON to narrow its 100-day moving average gap. The stock traded 6.7% below the 100-day moving average price of $147.19. Honeywell underperformed the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA), which gained 3.8%. PPA invests 7.0% of its portfolio in Honeywell.

So far in 2019, Honeywell has gained 5.0%. United Technologies (UTX), Textron (TXT), and Boeing (BA) have risen 4.4%, 5.2%, and 11.5%, respectively. The company’s 14-day RSI (relative strength index) is at 53, which indicates that the stock isn’t overbought or oversold. An RSI of 70 and above shows that a stock has temporarily moved into the “overbought” position, while an RSI of 30 and below indicates that a stock has temporarily moved into the “oversold” position.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



As a result, a number of large-cap stocks are pushing strongly higher as the major indices hold above critical resistance levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has spent three days above its 50-day moving average and looks ready to close in on its 200-day average next.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In anticipation, here are five large-cap stocks to watch:

### Comcast (CMCSA)

Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) shares have punched up and over their 50-day moving average to return to the highs last seen in early December. This after a bounce on the 20-day average on Tuesday. Watch for a run at the prior high of $39.50, which would be worth a gain of roughly 7% from here.

The company reported results before the bell this morning. Earnings of 64 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on a 26.1% rise in revenues thanks to a 5.2% increase in Cable Communications sales. Previously, the company reported on Oct. 25 with earnings of 65 cents per share beating estimates by 4 cents on a 5% rise in revenues.

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are pushing to fresh highs, testing above the $96-a-share level, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and raising forward guidance. Earnings of $1.25 per share were a 5% increase from the prior year driven by a lower tax rate. Organic sales growth clocked in at 4%, which is healthy in this environment.

  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy for Income 



Looking ahead, management raised the upper end of their organic sales growth guidance by 1% to a range of 2% to 4% for fiscal 2019. The company seems to be avoiding issues such as price pressure and higher transport costs hitting competitors like Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB).

### United Technologies (UTX)

United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) shares are on the move in a big way, testing above their 50-day moving average and marking a near-20% rise off of the late December low. Watch for prices to chase down the 200-day average, which would be worth another 10% move from here.

The company reported results this morning before the bell. Earnings of $1.95 per share beat estimates by 42 cents on a 15.1% rise in revenues. Forward guidance was raised above estimates as well. Previously, the company reported on Oct. 23 with earnings of $1.93 per share beating estimates by 42 cents on a 15.1% rise in revenues.

### Starbucks (SBUX)

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares have been a rare bright spot for the market, rising steadily since the summer, they have shrugged off the nastiness seen elsewhere. SBUX stock is back over its 50-day moving average and is closing in on its prior high set in November. This comes despite a downgrade by Goldman Sachs earlier this month.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Lost 20% Over Past 90 Days 



The company will next report results on Jan. 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 66 cents per share on revenues of $6.5 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 1, earnings of 62 cents per share beat estimates by 2 cents on a 10.6% rise in revenues.

### Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares are rising out of a two-month consolation base, setting the stage for a run at the 50-day moving average. A return to the prior highs would be worth a 4% gain from here. Analysts at UBS resumed coverage on the stock back in December with a Buy rating. CEO James Quincey was also on CNBC last month discussing the potential for a cannabis infused drink.

The company will next report results on Feb. 14 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 43 cents per share on revenues of $7.1 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 30, earnings of 58 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents despite a 9.2% drop in revenues.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-24,"Shares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) rallied nearly 5.3%  on Wednesday following the company's latest earnings report. While the set up for more upside on the surface looks good, UTX stock as a result of this latest pop has now also rallied into a major area of technical resistance where upon a bearish reversal active investors and traders could look on the short side of the stock.

One of the pillars of my approach to trading and investing in stocks is the understanding that the stock market as a whole is a highly correlated asset class. While it is entirely possible to find stocks that completely diverge from the masses, the reality is that at any given point around 70%-80% of stocks will trade up and down together directionally. As such, my analysis of stocks always starts with the broad market first and then digs deeper into individual sectors, industry groups and eventually into single name stocks.

To wit, shares of United Technologies have rallied along with the broader market as represented by the S&P 500 for the past few weeks and thus through the lens of technical analysis look eerily similar in that they are near term overbought with marginal upside left for the time being.

Moving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 week

Before looking at a particular trade setup, let us gain some perspective from the big-picture multiyear weekly chart. Here we see that UTX stock in late 2019, along with the broader stock market, plummeted right into its long-term 2009 support line and thus also retested the lower end of the up-trending channel for the first time since early 2016.

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



The stock has bounced strongly since and, while still vastly oversold from a momentum perspective, on this chart is definitely reaching a layer of technical resistance on the daily chart.

  
Click to Enlarge

Moving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 day

On the daily chart, we see the recent bounce a little more clearly. UTX stock since late December has now rallied just shy of 20% and on an intraday basis on January 23rd reached a well-defined area of simple horizontal resistance (blue bar) around the $120 area.

Also note that the stock on Jan. 23 closed the day for trading right at its yellow 50-day simple moving average, which as can be seen on the chart that I marked with green arrows has offered a good reference level for support and resistance since the spring of 2018.

From here, active investors and traders could leg into short-side bets in UTX stock once it gives a bearish reversal, i.e. a next down day of at least 1%-2%. This would confirm the aforementioned technical resistance and then allow a downside target at $110 and a stop loss at $120.

2019-01-30,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the markets haven't been sailing smoothly lately. A variety of issues -- from the trade war to the government shutdown -- have made investors nervous. And with those nerves have come plenty of volatility and big swings. For investors -- especially those near retirement -- the volatility can cause plenty of restless nights. But there is a way to get over the malaise.

And that's dividend stocks.

The steady stream of payments from dividend stocks can act as some ballast in the rough seas. After all, if you're already getting a 3 to 4% return in cash, market swings may not matter as much. Moreover, reinvested dividends can provide an extra boost when the markets return to gains once again. All in all, dividend stocks can be a portfolios best friend in markets like these. The question is which dividend stocks to buy.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



High yield isn't everything. It takes a certain combination of payout growth and current yield that makes a dividend stock great. And with that, here are five dividend stocks that are perfect for the market's current situation.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)

Dividend Yield: 4.46%

If you read the headlines, traditional brick & mortar retail is dying a quick death. However, that simply isn't the case. Retail in non-prime areas is suffering. Those malls, power centers and shopping plazas in high-income, growing areas are thriving. And one of the best dividend stocks of the all hones in on these areas.

Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is one of the largest mall operators around -- with hundreds of properties across North America, Europe, and Asia. After a spinout a few years ago -- before online shopping really took off -- Simon became focused strictly on A or Prime retail space. Because of that focus, occupancy is a high 95% and SPG has continued to see record sales/cash flows from its tenants. Last quarter alone, its tenants saw a big 4.5% increase in their retail sales per square foot.

This has translated in a big jump for the dividend stock's cash flows and net income.

For investors in SPG stock, its meant a long history of dividend payouts and increases. Since the recession, SPG has managed to increase its dividend by over 230%. And with the continue record results and focus on upper-income areas, those increases will continue.

With a current yield of 4.45%, Simon Property could be a wonderful dividend stock to help surf the tide of market volatility.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Union Pacific Corporation (UNP)

Dividend Yield: 2.0%

Monopolies are great for investors. And one of few legal monopolies left in the world happens to be the railroads. That's great news for dividend stocks in the sector like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).

UNP happens to have the largest rail networks in the U.S. But perhaps, more importantly, that rail network connects all the major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways as well as connects to Canada's rail system and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. It literally covers all of North America. That's a great place to be as other railroads need to pay UNP to use its system. Even better has been the fact that the economy has improved.

Because of this, volumes across the board have continued to rise at the railroad. And with some moves to reduce waste, improve reliability and lower taxes, UNP saw a whopping 29% increase to its per-share net income for the full year 2018. Naturally, these continued profits have resulted in a strong set of dividend increases and rich buyback program.

  * 5 Top Consumer Stocks for 2019 -- According to Wells Fargo 



And while investors may get nervous because UNP is an economic play, the dividend stocks low payout ratio of 41% provides plenty of cushion for its payout.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Apple (AAPL)

Dividend Yield: 1.89%

A lot of ink has been spilled on the state of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), slowing iPhone sales and perhaps the lack of recent innovation at the company. And those are all valid concerns. But looking at Apple through a different lens may be helpful. The reality is, AAPL may not be a &quot;growth stock&quot; anymore and that's alright for income seekers.

Apple still sells a lot of products, but the real driver last quarter was its strong services and cloud product portfolio. Like many former tech darlings -- think Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) -- Apple is shifting its resources to the cloud. And so far, the results have been impressive. During its latest results, Tim Cook mentioned that cloud services revenue was up 40% year-over-year and the number of Apple Pay transactions more than doubled to 1.8 billion. This very important and shows that even though iPhone growth has slowed, Apple can still keep the cash flows coming as users start using apps like Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

And speaking of that cash, Apple still managed to end the quarter with more than $245 billion on its balance sheet. That's a staggering amount of money and provides plenty of runway for Apple to develop new gear, pay dividends and even buy opportunities through M&A.

With a P/E of under 13 and 1.89%, Apple is cheap and now represents a big value. Looking at it like as you would dividend stocks, there's a lot to like.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Medtronic (MDT)

Dividend Yield: 2.31%

One of the best places to find dividend stocks is the healthcare sector. Demand tends to be steady in all sorts of market environments and that allows many healthcare firms to be strong dividend payers. And you can't get much strong that Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). MDT has now been paying a steady and increasing dividend for over 40 years.

Since producing a wearable pacemaker back in the 1950s, Medtronic has become a juggernaut in the field and now offers a variety of medical appliances that hospitals need every day. This includes some very high-tech solutions to well everyday items. As a result, sales at MDT continue to be robust. The medical-device firm managed to pull in just under $30 billion in total sales last year. Increasingly, it's been turning those sales into higher profits as it devotes more time to higher-margined, higher-tech devices. New A.I. diabetes monitors and pain stimulation devices are now on the menu.

For investors, all of these sales and better margins have continued to help the firm's dividend growth and buyback programs. Over the last five years, the focus on higher-margined goods has allowed MDT to see annual dividend growth of 12%. Medtronic has a current yield of 2.31%.

With healthcare demand only increasing and a huge portfolio of must-have devices, Medtronic investors stand to profit over the long haul and during the current market meltdown.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: United Technologies Corporation (UTX)

Dividend Yield: 2.49%

What global slowdown? That's exactly what investors in United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) are asking themselves after the firm's last results. The results were splendid and showed plenty of growth. All in all, UTX managed to pull in more than $66 billion in total sales and see a huge 29% jump in its full-year profits.

Driving that has been United Technologies new forays into the &quot;connected aerospace&quot; sector and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With software now joining traditional jet engines, margins at the firm have continued to jump. That's resulted in a big boost to profitability and 5% increase to its dividend.

But the story at UTX isn't just about last quarter. It's about the future. And that's because the firm is planning on separating into three different stocks. One will cover the fast-growing aerospace market, the other two with cover Otis Elevators/infrastructure products and heating, cooling and building automation.

For those investors looking for dividend stocks, this is great news. One stock will have a smaller yield, but potentially faster dividend growth, while the other two will larger initial yields and steadier profits. Buying UTX today gets you a whole portfolio's worth of dividend investing styles tomorrow. Meanwhile, you're paid to wait with UTX's current 2.49% yield and great profit profile.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

2019-01-31,"If you're looking for stocks to buy, you can start by considering some of those S&P 500 stocks that have already reported their Q4 2018 results. 

According to the Jan. 23 Institutional Brokers Estimate System data from Refinitiv, 76 S&P 500 companies have already reported their fourth-quarter results with another 424 still left to do so. 

Of the 76 reporting, almost 78% delivered earnings above analyst expectations, 12 percentage points higher than the long-term average. On the revenue side of the ball, almost 61% of those who've already reported beat analyst expectations, about the same as the long-term average.  

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Overall, once all of the S&P 500 companies have reported, earnings are expected to grow by 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter with revenues expected to increase by 5.6%.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



The big winners from a sector perspective are consumer discretionary, industrials, and financials. However, it's important to remind readers that of the 76 who've already reported, financials account for 38% of the total.

### Lennar (LEN)

Lennar (NYSE:LEN), one of America's largest and best-known homebuilders, reported its fourth-quarter results Jan. 9. Analysts were expecting $1.93 a share. It delivered $2.42, 25.4% higher than the consensus and 87.6% higher than a year earlier. If you exclude the 58-cent profit from the sale of its Rialto asset management platform, though, the beat was more like 1.6%. 

Now, I'm aware that 1.6% is hardly tearing up earnings. However, the sale of Rialto makes Lennar a more focused company, and that should mean further profit and revenue growth in the future. That's a big reason why I made Lennar one of &quot;7 Downtrodden Stocks to Fish From the Bottom&quot; in early January. 

At the time, I wrote that Lennar's chairman, Stuart Miller, was very confident about the company's growth in 2019. 

Looking at both the company's home growth year over year -- 14,154 homes in Q4 2018 vs. 8,633 in Q4 2017 -- and increase in average sale price -- $421,000 in Q4 2018 vs. $388,000 in Q4 2018 -- I, too, am confident that Lennar's got the goods in 2019. 

Trading at just eight times forward 2019 earnings, it's about to become a favorite of investors in the know.

### VF (VFC)

VF (NYSE:VFC) didn't have a good 2018 in the markets, generating a total return of -1%. On the bright side, it was still better than the S&P 500, which was 334 basis points worse in 2018.  

The company is best known for Vans sneakers and The North Face outdoor clothing. It delivered Q3 2019 earnings on Jan. 18. Analysts were expecting $1.10 a share. It delivered $1.31, 19.1% higher than the consensus and 31% higher (excluding currency) than a year earlier. 

Vans remain the company's best producer. In the third quarter, Vans saw sales increase by 27% on a global basis with especially strong numbers in Asia and the Americas. The company, which is in the middle of a five-year strategic growth plan, will spin off its Wrangler and Lee denim business in 2019 into an independent publicly traded company to be called Kontoor Brands.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



The move allows its slower-growth denim business to do what it needs to do to increase its growth rate while leaving VF to focus on its leading brands such as Vans. 

Expect a significant acquisition from VF in 2019. Don't expect it to be Skechers (NYSE:SKX) though.

### Starbucks (SBUX)

Former Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz is considering running for president in 2020 as an independent. Democrats might not like it, but he's precisely the type of person the country needs at the moment. I have no idea if he could win, but it would be fun to watch. 

The company announced its Q1 2019 results Jan. 24 and they were a lot better than some experts were expecting. On the bottom line, analysts were estimating earnings of 65 cents; they came in 10 cents higher at 75 cents. Compared to last year's Q1, they were 15% higher. 

What stood out for me in the quarter was the 14% year-over-year increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards memberships to 16.3 million people. That means approximately 5% of the U.S. population has one. Not bad for a company supposedly on the decline. 

Also, a big positive was the fact its same-store sales in the Americas increased by 4% in the quarter, double what they were a year earlier. 

The biggest downside in the quarter might have been operating margins, which were lower in all of its regions, but they're still very healthy (22% in the Americas, 18% in China, and 10% in EMEA). 

Starbucks remains one of my favorite consumer-facing stocks.

### United Technologies (UTX)

It has been a couple of months since United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) announced that it would break itself up into three separate companies: United Technologies, which would house its aerospace business; a second company called Otis to own its elevator and escalator business; and a third company to be called Carrier, which will own its HVAC and fire safety businesses. 

The conglomerate is dead … at least in the U.S. Elsewhere, it's still a very popular investment vehicle. 

United Technologies announced its Q4 2018 earnings Jan. 23 and they were better than expected. Analysts were looking for $1.55; they came in 26% higher at $1.95 a share due to strong demand for aircraft parts, 

&quot;We are seeing really solid trends in aerospace across the board, with continued (airline traffic) growth and production increases at both Boeing and Airbus,&quot; CEO Greg Hayes said on earnings conference call.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Investors didn't like the plan to break itself up, which is a big part why its stock is down since the announcement. These earnings are likely to shove that skepticism aside. 

This is one spinoff play I'd seriously consider.

### J.B. Hunt (JBHT)

It seems like almost every earnings beat in Q4 2018 has come with an asterisk or a question mark. J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) is no exception.

The trucking company reported its fourth-quarter results Jan. 18. It beat on both the top and bottom line. Revenues were $2.32 billion, $20 million higher than the consensus estimate of $2.3 billion. On the earnings front, analysts were expecting $1.48 a share; JB Hunt delivered $1.78, 20% higher than the consensus estimate. 

Naturally, its stock jumped on the news. 

However, not everything about the transport company's results was a home run. 

&quot;Digging a bit deeper, intermodal pricing was a clear standout (and we surmise key to JBI's 210 basis points year-over-year margin boost) as management was able to clinch outsized contractual renewals owed to an extremely tight truck market in 2018,&quot; Raymond James analyst Patrick Tyler Brown wrote in a note to clients.  &quot;This said, volumes were a tad disappointing as load growth turned negative.&quot;

It might not have been a perfect report, but from an earnings perspective, JB Hunt did plenty.

### Boeing (BA)

Following on the success of United Technologies, Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported tremendous results in the fourth quarter, helping the company go over $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in its history. 

On the bottom line, Boeing delivered adjusted earnings of $5.48 a share, 91 cents or 20% higher than analyst expectations. On the top line, it had sales of $28.3 billion, $1 billion higher than the consensus estimate.

If you like healthy margins, Boeing increased its operating margins in the fourth quarter by 400 basis points to 15.6%. Other nice tidbits include adding 262 net orders in the quarter with a backlog of $412 billion at the end of December. 

&quot;The story is in place and they have the cash to deploy as well,&quot; Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said on CNBC Jan. 30. &quot;We view any pullback as an opportunity on the stock.&quot;

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



I couldn't agree more. I'd say Boeing's latest earnings report is the most well-rounded of the seven stocks on my list.

### Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Linda Su continues to make a believer out of me. 

The company reported its Q4 2018 results on Jan. 30. While revenues were less than expected at $1.42 billion, $20 million less than analyst estimate, earnings were 8 cents a share, in line with the consensus estimate. 

Why did the stock jump 20% on the news? Su's words had a lot to do with it. 

&quot;In 2018 we delivered our second straight year of significant revenue growth, market share gains, expanded gross margin and improved profitability based on our high-performance products,&quot; Su said in a statement. &quot;Despite near-term graphics headwinds, 2019 is shaping up to be another exciting year driven by the launch of our broadest and most competitive product portfolio ever.&quot;

In 2017, I was one of the company's biggest bears, suggesting Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a much better buy. Now that Nvidia's sputtering, I'm rethinking my position. 

If it can deliver on its guidance for 2019 of high-single-digit growth rates, it could challenge $40 by the end of the year. 

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-11,"What happened to General Electric (NYSE:GE)? The once-steady industry stock with a respectable dividend has been anything but reliable over the past 18 months. Even after GE stock price collapsed to $6.66 per share, GE stock still remains wildly volatile, as it surged more than 50% from those lows before its recent retreat.Source: Shutterstock The gyrations of GE stock price have left long-term investors -- assuming there are any left -- scratching their heads. Will GE be forced to divest its top-notch businesses in an attempt to repair its balance sheet, leaving it with no productive units? Or will GE's management be able to strategically offload enough assets and turn cash-flow positive, enabling GE stock to get back on track?  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio That remains unclear, but even under the rosiest of circumstances, the time frame of the recovery of GE stock price has now been moved back.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE's Recovery Takes a DetourAs I've written previously on InvestorPlace, GE stock price has been a bit hotter that its fundamentals justify. GE stock went from a low of $6.66 (before the market bottom in late-December) to more than $11. We've seen big rallies in Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) too, but they are doing much better from a business perspective. But aside from a few asset sales, the fundamentals of General Electric stock really weren't improving all that much.Its cash flow is still under pressure, its balance sheet is still weak and GE is being forced out of multiple businesses. Basically, I don't think that General Electric stock deserved to rally more than 66% in a few months.JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who's bearish on GE stock, agrees with me  or should I say, I agree with Tusa, who was the first analyst to raise the alarm on General Electric stock. He continually slashed his price target on the way down, nailing every bit of the decline before it happened. Around the lows, Tusa bumped his rating from &quot;sell&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;, but maintained his $6 price target.He now calls that price target &quot;generous&quot; after the company's latest news. Earlier this week, GE CEO Larry Culp said that the conglomerate's industrial-free-cash flow would be negative this year. He painted a no-nonsense picture that basically said the turnaround won't start for a long time. Tusa says the turnaround will take a couple of years, arguing that GE stock probably hasn't bottomed yet.On Mar. 14, General Electric will provide its outlook. Those who are bulls on General Electric stock  will view the event as an opportunity for GE's management to reignite the shares. Those with more bearish views on General Electric , like JPMorgan's Shawn Quigg, think that optimism is likely too high going into the event. For traders, this event will also be an opportunity. Trading GE Stock How far can GE stock fall on negative news? If the shares reach Tusa's $6 price target, we're talking about more than 36% downside from their current levels. Also keep in mind, though, that if General Electric does hit Tusa's price target, it will have taken out its 2018 lows as well.When trading GE stock, there are a few levels to keep in mind. The first is $8.86. If General Electric stock falls below this mark, GE stock will be below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as its prior downtrend support. That would open up the possibility of a drop below $8 and increase the odds of a retest of the stock's lows.If General Electric stock gets to $10, I want to see how it handles that level. At $10, there is short-term downtrend resistance, as well as the 21-day moving average of $9.86 (not pictured above). It will be significant if that area becomes resistance.Ultimately the charts are losing some of their bullish luster, and new lows could be on the way. However, we need to monitor this name and some of the existing support levels before making that call. Stay flexible with General Electric stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-27,"Give the industrial sector and the related industrial ETFs some credit. Against the backdrop of recent struggles in shares of Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), one of the sector's marquee components, industrial ETFs are holding up pretty well.Year-to-date, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLI), the largest industrial ETF by assets, is up 14.20%, topping the S&P 500 by about 210 basis points in the first quarter. XLI currently allocates 8.93% of its weight to shares of Boeing, making the aerospace and defense giant by far the industrial ETF's largest holding.Impressive as many of the performances by industrial ETFs this year, investors arriving late to this party should exercise caution.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Brad Sorensen, managing director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab, told MarketWatch that industrial stocks' rise 'has gone too far, in part because the market is overly optimistic as to what the China trade deal will be,'&quot; reports MarketWatch.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 For investors willing to take on some risk in the immediate term, some of the following industrial ETFs could be rewarding bets for the second quarter. iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.43% per year, or $43 on a $10,000 investment. Some market segments are often beholden to Capitol Hill. That can be good or bad depending on the industry in question. For the aerospace and defense industry, politics have been rewarding over the past several years. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (CBOE:ITA), the largest aerospace and defense ETF, is up 71.20% over the past 36 months, easily topping traditional industrial ETFs and the S&P 500 over that period.While ITA has recently been hampered by Boeing's slide (the stock accounts for 20.62% of the fund's weight), this industrial ETF is a valid play on defense spending, which is trending higher. President Trump is proposing a fiscal-year 2020 defense budget of a staggering $750 billion.Investors considering ITA should note the following: this industrial ETF is a cap-weighted fund and is extremely top heavy. Boeing and fellow Dow component United Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UTX) combine for nearly 38% of the fund's weight, meaning those two stocks are the primary drivers of ITA's price action. Invesco SmallCap Industrials ETF (PSCI)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.29%. Many investors think of industrial ETFs through the large-cap lens, but the Invesco SmallCap Industrials ETF (NASDAQ:PSCI) proves there are opportunities with this sector's smaller constituents. PSCI follows the S&P SmallCap 600 Capped Industrials Index, the industrial offshoot of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index.The average market capitalization of PSCI's 97 holdings is $1.76 billion, putting this fund on the higher end of the small-cap spectrum. Thirteen industry groups are represented in this small-cap ETF, which is up nearly 11% this year.  * 3 Gold Stocks That Should Glitter With Rising Gold Prices While the industrial sector is usually considered a value or quality play, not a growth destination, PSCI has more of a growth feel to it, which is to be expected with a small-cap fund. This industrial ETF allocates 40.38% of its weight to growth stocks -- more than double its weight to value stocks. Invesco DWA Industrials Momentum ETF (PRN)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.60%. Most traditional industrial ETFs are cap-weighted funds, but there is always another way of approaching weighting methodologies in the fund universe. The Invesco DWA Industrials Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PRN) brings momentum to the industrial ETF table.PRN, which turns 13 years old later this year, follows the Dorsey Wright Industrials Technical Leaders Index and holds 38 stocks.&quot;The Index is designed to identify companies that are showing relative strength (momentum), and is composed of at least 30 securities from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. Relative strength is the measurement of a security's performance in a given universe over time as compared to the performance of all other securities in that universe,&quot; according to Invesco.PRN's weighting scheme makes this industrial ETF a growth fund as nearly 80% of the fund's holdings are classified as growth stocks. Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.47%. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (CBOE:PAVE) is not a dedicated industrial ETF, but it is an interesting thematic fund with ample exposure to industrial stocks. While not a pure play industrial ETF, PAVE does allocate more than two-thirds of its weight to the industrial sector.As is the case with some of the other funds highlighted here, PAVE can benefit from politics and the good news on that front is twofold. First, infrastructure spending is one of the rare bipartisan issues. Second, there is no doubt the U.S. faces an array of infrastructure projects that need shoring up and need those improvements immediately.  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos &quot;Making a real effort to update the U.S. infrastructure would make the most sense now while the economic environment can still support the investment,&quot; reports Forbes. &quot;Acting now would bolster and extend the current economic growth cycle and provide the foundation for decades of growth in the future. Conversely, putting it off until after a recession has begun would push the U.S. back even further. And with the U.S. already decades behind in terms of infrastructure development, waiting simply makes it more difficult.&quot; First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (AIRR)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.70%. The First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (NASDAQ:AIRR) is another unique alternative to the traditional industrial ETF. This fund focuses on mid- and small-cap industrial and community bank stocks. AIRR's bank exposure is capped at 10% of the fund's overall weight and those bank stocks only come from states with heavy manufacturing exposure.AIRR's 53 holdings have a median market value of $1.48 billion, indicating that this is a small-cap industrial ETF. The structure of this industrial ETF makes it sensitive to manufacturing data and fluctuations in the broader small-cap space.AIRR is up 11% this year, but on a technical basis, the fund may need to rally above $26 to lure in new buyers.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-16,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Far too often, investors view stocks through a one-dimensional lens. A search for dividend stocks may lead one to only consider current yields, for instance, while ignoring the pace at which that company's payout improves over time. At the other end of the spectrum, many solid growth stocks may have been overlooked only because investors didn't factor in an impressive dividend or dividend growth history.In other words, there's often more to the story, and those details can really matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of some of the market's top dividend growth stocks … names that aren't getting the respect they deserve because traders are ignoring details that matter. They may not lead either the dividend or growth categories as they stand, but on a bigger-picture basis, these picks ultimately offer up better, risk-adjusted bottom lines. They just need time to prove it.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile In no particular order… United Technologies (UTX)Dividend Yield: 2.23%United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) presents investors with something of a choice -- or will soon anyway. That is, by the end of next year it's going to be split into three separate companies. They'll each be standing on their own once that happens, for better or worse, relying on their unique strengths and working to abate their weaknesses.Still, the same management teams that made each division a part of a great whole will remain intact, doing their thing, and achieving the same success they're achieving now. At least one of the three will keep the company's streak of 25 consecutive years of dividend increases alive. And, odds are good the most dividend-oriented unit's payout will become even (relatively) bigger as each division goes its separate way, upping the combined company's current yield of 2.23%.Most likely, it will be the aerospace and defense arm that continues to carry the torch. Becton Dickinson (BDX)Dividend Yield: 1.23%The current yield of 1.23% is anything but a jaw-dropper, but Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) can't fairly be boiled down to one metric. The medical equipment maker has a long history of above-average revenue growth and even more impressive earnings growth. Sales are expected to improve a little more than 9% this year, driving a 10% increase in per-share profits.But still, does BDX stock offer anything to income-minded investors? Actually, it does. It has upped its dividend for 47 straight years, with the most recent one by a respectable 2.7%.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Paying it is a quite comfortable matter too. Its average payout ratio is historically only about one-fourth of its profits. Outfront Media (OUT)Dividend Yield: 6.06%Outfront Media (NYSE:OUT) isn't exactly a household name. The company offers a variety of outdoor advertising options well beyond billboards, but as an organization that makes a point of featuring clients' brands rather than its own, consumers rarely even think about who's making those ads possible.Still, as an REIT, it's a name built from the ground up to pay dividends. Its current yield is a head-turning 6.06%, and its total payout has grown slowly but reliably since early 2016. Revenue and income growth have been almost as steady.The secret of Outfront Media's success has been overwhelming market domination. It's established in 140 markets with a variety of traditional and non-traditional assets, and in areas where it's not as strong, it's able to buy its way into consumers' views. Case in point: Early last year the company began the deployment of more than 50,000 &quot;liveboards&quot; in New York's most-traveled transportation stations. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.5%The market has been doubting Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) since late 2017, when the stock stopped rallying and spent the better part of last year dwindling its way to lower lows.Big mistake. Revenue never stopped growing. Neither did earnings. In fact, both reached record levels in 2018. Investors now recognize the mistake, and are working to correct it. Even with the 36% gain since July's low, though, AVGO is still a bargain by almost any standard. The  forward-looking earnings multiple of 12 is cheap.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Best of all, the yield of 3.5% is downright incredible by tech stock standards. Indeed, it's even high compared to the most typical, garden-variety dividend stocks. Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Dividend Yield: 2.7%Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is trying to put a tough 2018 behind it. The stock fell from a January 2018 high of $179 to a low near $118 in December of last year.This is another case, though, where doubts in this dividend stock have been mostly unmerited. Organic revenue growth reached 1% in Q4, driving a 70-basis-point increase in operating margins. It's not stellar, but it's more than good enough to support the current yield of 2.7% … an annualized dividend that has expanded for more than 50 consecutive years. Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR)Dividend Yield: 2.65%Don't come to the wrong conclusion about Cullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE:CFR). It offers traditional consumer-facing banking services through its Frost Bank. Its strengths lies in business banking though, and less traditional banking activities like investment services and insurance.Regardless of the revenue and earnings mix, Cullen/Frost has earned its spot on a list of the market's top dividend stocks. Its yield of 2.65% is in line with its peers, but the bullish case is bolstered by 25 years' worth of dividend increases that have proven more than affordable.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Earnings of $5.51 per share in 2017 improved to $6.90 last year, and are expected to reach $7.09 this year. With four straight earnings beats to its credit though, that outlook may underestimate what the company's actually got in store in terms of future profits and dividend improvements. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Dividend Yield: 1%It's still a paint company, but Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) isn't just a paint company any longer. The outfit offers a variety of coatings that cater to the special needs of several industries including automobiles.Its product diversity hasn't helped a whole lot of late. Sherwin-Williams missed its fourth-quarter earnings estimate, and the company couldn't soothe worried investors with a compelling 2019 earnings outlook. The dividend yield of 1% isn't much to write home about either.All the same, this is a name that is still logging steady increases in its payout, and if you can look past its acquisition-related expenses, is still growing its top and bottom lines. Same-store sales were up 5.1% in Q4, and full-year operating cash flows reached a record-breaking $2.04 billion in 2018. A.O. Smith (AOS)Dividend Yield: 1.63%A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) may not have the clout it used to, as the world has moved on and left old-guard industrial names behind. This &quot;old school&quot; manufacturing outfit still has a few tricks up its sleeve though.The numbers confirm it. Last year's top line of $3.2 billion was up from 2017's $3 billion, and earnings improved from $296.5 million to $444.2 million. Both were records.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Where A.O. Smith really shines among dividend stocks, however, is when you look at it as a dividend growth stock. Not only has it boosted its payout for 13 straight years now, it has boosted them in a big way.  Caterpillar (CAT)Dividend Yield: 2.45%This dividend stock may be surrounded by concerns about the tariff war with China, but take a good look at the results Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has achieved of late. For all the caterwauling it and its peers have dished out, revenue has grown every quarter since the beginning of 2017, and operating income has grown almost as reliably.Dividends have continued to grow as much as they ever have too. CAT has had 25 straight years of dividend growth, and the industrial machinery outfit has never really struggled to pay it.One big upside to the unmerited doubt -- the stock's big pullback from the early 2018 peak translates into an attractive yield of 2.45%. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Dividend Yield: 2.7%Finally, auto parts retailer Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) -- you may know it better as NAPA -- currently yields a healthy 2.7%. That's a dividend, however, that has grown for 62 consecutive years.It has been big-time growth too. The trailing-12-month payout of $3.05 is markedly better than the annualized payout of $1.15 from just ten years ago, but only reflects the company's earnings growth for the same timeframe.Those who know the company well will know earnings growth has stagnated over the course of the past three years, with a frenzy of new auto sales crimping demand for repairs. A huge swath of newly made automobiles are now between three to five years old now, however, and will start showing some wear and tear that drives sales of replacement parts. At the same time, nearly half the cars on U.S. roads now are at least 12 years old, and as such are also flirting with the need for a repair.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Both trends play right into Genuine Parts Company's hands, making it one of the smart dividend stocks to look at now.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Broadcom and Illinois Tool Works.

2019-04-23,"The first quarter earnings season is well and truly upon us, as Wall Street turns its attention away from catalysts such as the Federal Reserve and U.S.-China trade talks and focuses instead on fundamentals like revenues and profit margins.So far, results are beating expectations but still showing a slide on the bottom line. Through April 18, 15% of the companies in the S&P 500 reported results. Of those, according to FactSet, 78% beat estimates with results that were 5.7% ahead of analyst expectations. But earnings on a year-over-year basis are down 4.3%.If the earnings decline holds, it will mark the first pullback in profits since the middle of 2016.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains However, investors seem to be focusing on the positive … so far. They're rewarding stocks that are beating estimates instead of focusing on the overall decline in earnings. Here are four stocks that are rallying today following earnings results: Twitter (TWTR)  Click to EnlargeTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) shares are soaring, up more than 16% as I write this, after reporting better-than-expected results. The move pushes the stock up and out of a sideways consolidation range going back to last summer. And it even caught the eye of President Trump, who took to the Twitter platform to claim credit for its success and warn against alleged anti-conservative bias.The company reported earnings of 37 cents per share, 22 cents above estimates, on an 18.3% rise in revenues. Daily average users came in at 134 million vs. estimates for around 128 million. United Technologies (UTX)  Click to EnlargeShares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are testing, within pennies, the prior high set last September marking a 40%+ rally off of the late December low. The company reported results before the open, with earnings of $1.91 per share beating estimates by 19 cents on a 20.5% rise in revenues.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of beating earnings estimates as the company enjoyed its best organic growth rate in over a decade. The seemingly insatiable demand for airliners is fueling solid results at its Pratt & Whitney engine subsidiary. Kimberly Clark (KMB)  Click to EnlargeToilet paper maker Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB) is enjoying an upside breakout after reporting results on Monday. The move pushes shares up and over multi-year resistance near the $125-a-share level that was first established in early 2016. The company reported earnings of $1.66 per share, 11 cents ahead of estimates on a 2.1% drop in revenues.A series of analyst upgrades have followed, including Argus and Macquarie. The highlight was on a 3% jump in organic revenues and a reaffirming of 2019 guidance. Management continues to focus on alleviating the impact of rising input prices and was able to trim $115 million from its expense line, partially as a result of closing two personal face facilities. Whirlpool (WHR)  Click to EnlargeShares of appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) are rallying to test prior highs set in late February, partially reversing the slide from the 2017 highs near $190. The company has enjoyed a lift following President Trump's trade action against imported washing machines and dishwashers. The result was the largest-ever three-month increase in the cost of washing machines, helping bolster Whirlpool's bottom line.  * 7 Red-Hot E-Commerce Stocks to Consider The company reported earnings of $3.11 per share, 26 cents ahead of estimates, despite a 3.1% drop in revenues. Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, including expectations of upwards of $900 million in free cash flow.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Canadian company said on Thursday it would unite its corporate and regional jet units, while selling off two aerostructures operations, including the Belfast plant, the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland.  Bombardier's retreat from Belfast comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is struggling to agree a deal to leave the European Union, in large part because of disagreements over the future of the Irish border.","Bombardier to shed Belfast factory in revamp, shares slide on forecast fears"
2019-05-03,"One of the greatest obstacles to share price appreciation is mediocre management, supported by a complacent board. But activist investors offer a solution, targeting poorly managed companies and lobbying them for changes they think will sweeten the share price.Activist investors look for issues such as weak corporate governance or executive compensation schemes when hunting new stocks to buy. They often then take a significant stake in the company and push for things such as asset sales or the return of excess cash to shareholders. Companies slow to implement change may be threatened with &quot;proxy fights&quot; that result in corporate officers and directors being forced from their seats.These activist investors sometimes create big windfalls for shareholders. For instance, Carl Icahn pushed eBay (EBAY) to spin off its PayPal (PYPL) business in 2015; since then, PayPal has tripled in value. Activist David Einhorn pressured Apple (AAPL) in 2013, urging the iPhone maker to return excess cash to shareholders. Since fiscal 2012, Apple has returned more than $350 billion in the form of buybacks and dividends, with the vast majority of that coming since 2013.Here are 17 stocks to buy if you believe in the ideas of their activist investors. Some have just recently come under siege, others are in the middle of proxy fights, and still others have already made truces and have implemented changes to unlock value. But all of these stocks carry significant risk - after all, activist investors typically target struggling companies, and no turnaround is a slam dunk. So invest in small amounts, with funds from the portion of your portfolio dedicated to aggressive holdings.

2019-05-15,"Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China have weighed on financial markets in May. Some analysts are calling these renewed trade tensions the beginning of a doomsday scenario. New tariffs have the potential to not only cut into corporate profit margins, but also push inflation higher in the U.S., especially against the backdrop of a full labor market. That will cause the Fed to come off the sidelines and raise rates.Thus, one potential outcome here is elevated trade tensions and a rate-hiking Fed. That is exactly what we had in late 2018, and that combo caused stocks to drop 20% into bear market territory. Consequently, some analysts are concerned that a new bear market may be right around the corner.But these concerns are overblown. In the big picture, U.S. President Donald Trump is married to the stock market, and because he has consistently tied his success to the success of stocks, he essentially has to keep the market afloat in order to improve his re-election odds in 2020. That's why the U.S. included a grace period for goods in-transit for this round of tariffs. Trump and company want to get a deal done. So does China because their entire economic improvement in 2019 has been predicated on stable trade conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThus, a deal will get done soon. Once it does get done, this little market selloff will reverse course, and stocks will proceed to march higher.With that in mind, it seems appropriate to reflect on how impressive the 2019 stock market rally has been. Year-to-date, the Dow Jones is up 10%. To put that in perspective, the Dow has risen by more than 10% in a year only seven times this century. We are already at that level, and it's only May.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Further, seven Dow Jones stocks are up more than 20% in 2019. That's largely unprecedented for the Dow, especially this early in the year. Which stocks fall into that category? And will they keep rallying as market conditions remain favorable going forward? Let's take a deeper look.  United Technologies (UTX)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 26.7%The top Dow Jones stock thus far in 2019 is United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), with shares of UTX up nearly 27% year-to-date.This makes sense. United Technologies is an economic stock. When times are good, the stock works. When times are bad, the stock doesn't work. That's the nature of business when you sell big ticket items in the commercial aerospace, defense and building industries. Those industries need favorable economic conditions to do well. United Technologies has benefited from favorable economic conditions in 2019 (full labor market, low rates, renewed business confidence, etc), and that is why UTX stock has rallied in such a big way.Will it continue? Sure. So long as the U.S. economy remains healthy and trade issues get resolved, then UTX stock has clear runway to head higher for the foreseeable future. I think both of those things will happen. As such, I see UTX stock staying in rally mode for the balance of the year. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Mike Mozart Via FlickrYTD Gain: 23.4%The second best performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2019 is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Shares of the global technology giant have risen more than 23% year-to-date.The story here is pretty simple. Microsoft is all about the cloud. As goes the company's various cloud businesses (Azure, Officer 365, Dynamics 365, so on and so forth), so goes MSFT stock. Those cloud businesses slowed in late 2018 amid deteriorating global economic conditions. But as those global economic conditions improved in early 2019, Microsoft's cloud businesses regained momentum. As they did, MSFT stock moved higher.  * 3 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Play on Gold Stocks So long as these businesses continue to gain momentum, MSFT stock will remain on a winning trajectory. For the foreseeable future, Microsoft's cloud businesses should continue to gain momentum, mostly thanks to continued fundamental improvements across the global economy. As such, MSFT stock should continue to move higher throughout the rest of the year. American Express (AXP)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 23.3%The third-best performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2019 is American Express (NYSE:AXP), the payments processing giant who has seen its shares rally more than 23% year-to-date.Broadly speaking, the big rally in AXP stock has everything to do with global economic improvements. When the economy is doing well, people tend to spend more on their Amex cards. Thus, as the global economy has improved over the past several months, consumer confidence has likewise improved and investors have implied this to mean that Amex's numbers are getting better.But that may not be entirely true. Amex's January quarter earnings report was a double miss. The April quarter missed on revenues. Across the board, growth is slowing, headlined by deceleration in volume and revenue growth. Thus, while investors are pricing in improvement, that improvement hasn't shown up yet. Meanwhile, AXP stock trades at a multi-year high valuation level of 15-times forward earnings.Overall, the rally in AXP stock may have come too far, too fast in 2019. This stock looks due for weakness here and now, as slowing growth will converge on a relatively rich valuation. Disney (DIS)Source: Richard Stephenson via Flickr (Modified)YTD Gain: 22.3%The fourth-best performing Dow Jones stock of 2019 is Disney (NYSE:DIS), as Disney magic has returned to the stock en route to a 22% year-to-date rally.The big story here? Streaming. Just as Microsoft is all about the cloud, Disney's gain is all about streaming. Long story short, the company has suffered over the past several years thanks to cord-cutting and a secular pivot away from linear TV, and towards internet TV. Now, Disney is aggressively pivoting into the internet TV arena. The company has already launched and built out ESPN+. Now, they have effectively bought everyone out and completely own Hulu. Next, they are launching their own streaming service, Disney+, which will be like the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for Disney content.Investors are rallying behind this huge streaming pivot. It also helps that 2019 features a blockbuster movie line-up and some major theme park expansions and upgrades.  * 5 Consumer Stocks Ready to Push Higher All in all, 2019 is set to be a record, ground-breaking, and revolutionary year for Disney. Investors are excited. All this excitement will lead to DIS stock staying in rally mode into the launch of Disney+ in late 2019. If that launch is a success -- which it should be, given Disney's content portfolio -- then DIS stock stay in rally mode for 2020, too. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock YTD Gain: 22.1%The fifth-best performing Dow Jones stock of 2019 is another payments stock which has rebounded meaningfully alongside the rest of the economy -- Visa (NYSE:V).Unlike American Express, though, Visa's numbers are actually improving. The company has reported two double-beat quarters this year, and while volume and revenue growth slowed in early 2019, growth is expected to rebound throughout the year, and exit 2019 at a similar rate it exited 2018. Broadly, then, Visa's growth trajectory is improving in-line with the economy. Thus, so long as the economy continues to improve, Visa's growth trajectory should continue to improve, too.Meanwhile, Visa stock remains off its mid-2018 valuation highs, so the stock has room to run higher in the event the numbers do continue to improve. This combination of healthy growth and multiple expansion should keep Visa stock on a winning trajectory. The Travelers Company (TRV)Source: Nancy",Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 — So Far

Watch for a test of critical support near the 200-day moving average, which would give way to a possible test of the late December lows, which would be worth a further loss of more than 20% from here.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.03 per share on revenues of $19.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of $1.91 per share beat estimates by 19 cents per share on a 20.5% rise in revenues. Caterpillar (CAT)Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) continue to melt lower, falling further away from their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The result is an ongoing retest of the late December lows, setting up a possible fall to the lower levels plumbed in October.

International Business Machines (IBM)International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock, which has been desperate to stay above its 200-day moving average for months, appears to be on the verge of a major breakdown, setting up a filling of the gap from January in what would be worth a loss of nearly 8% from here. In its most recent quarterly call, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance, which was disappointing considering a persistent inability to boost revenue growth after years of malaise.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 17 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.10 per share on revenues of $19.2 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of $2.25 beat estimates by a penny on a 4.7% decline in revenues. Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finds itself at the epicenter of the U.S.-China standoff, suffering from both critical supply chain ties to China as well as relying on Chinese consumers to provide critical demand growth for its products.

(TGI) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for May 30, 2019"
2019-05-29,"Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) have been holding their ground so far in 2019. GE stock, which was suffering from a precipitous decline going into the end of 2018, has drawn interest from retail investors for a long time. That's because for many years GE was an American industrial icon.Source: Shutterstock The power, energy, aerospace and consumer-staples sectors all used products with the well-known &quot;GE&quot; logo. Mismanagement, poor acquisitions, pension obligations and low-quality cash flows ultimately led to GE's demise, though. These issues were slowly (and rather painfully) uncovered as investors began to realize what the cash-flow statements and balance sheet were suggesting.GE stock entered 2017 at almost $30 a share. In December 2018, it hit a low near $6.50 and ultimately fell more than 75% from peak to trough.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June What do the charts of GE stock suggest now? Trading General Electric StockIf investors bought General Electric stock back in December, they're doing quite well. But even that massive rally -- during which GE stock jumped some 70% -- wasn't enough to propel GE out of its downtrend. As you can see on the daily chart above, GE continues to squeeze lower.The 200-day moving average isn't doing GE stock  any favors, and GE  is now below all three major moving averages. We've flagged $9 as support a few times, a level that has now held through two earnings reports. But as GE's highs continue to drop, this $9 level is starting to look suspect.If GE stock can't bounce back over its major moving averages and eventually exceed its downtrend resistance, its support could be in jeopardy. If $9 doesn't hold, sub-$8 prices don't seem unreasonable, particularly if sentiment towards GE stock sours as well.A similar scene is playing out on the weekly chart, as shown below.On this chart, downtrend resistance is much more prominent. A series of purple arrows highlights the &quot;lower highs&quot; theme we've seen playing out for some time now. Like the 200-day moving average, the 50-week moving average is still providing stiff resistance. While the 10-week moving average had been a support level from January through March, it has wavered over the past seven weeks. Last week, it gave way, and a test of $9 would not be surprising now.GE stock has &quot;descending triangle&quot; written all over it. That is, the stock is making continuously lower highs and moving ever closer towards its support level. If GE stock closes below $9, it will deal a big blow to the bulls. If General Electric stock closes over $10.40-$10.50, a lot of the recent damage could be repaired, potentially sparking a rally by GE. The Bottom Line on GE StockJPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa has very closely followed GE stock, and he's made some very good calls on it. He was the first to downgrade GE to &quot;sell&quot; and rode it all the way lower until December. That's when he raised his &quot;sell&quot; rating to a &quot;hold,&quot; but maintained his $6 price target. Tusa questioned where all the optimism was coming from and remains highly skeptical about General Electric stock.In April Tusa went back to a &quot;sell &quot;rating, cutting his price target on GE stock to $5 from $6. On May 1, he said the company's first-quarter earnings results were &quot;far from a disaster,&quot; which may seem encouraging, but he also said they were &quot;far from a blowout.&quot;So where are we now? I've been following the action of GE stock, and it's telling me one thing: General Electric is a &quot;show-me&quot; stock. Meaning,  GE needs to prove that it's got its groove back, and it is not worthy of benefit-of-the-doubt treatment. It doesn't help that Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M Co (NYSE:MMM), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all better companies and have been under pressure lately as well.On Wednesday, GE CEO Larry Culp reiterated the company's forecast for up to $2 billion of negative free cash flow (FCF) this year and flat  FCF in 2020. That has done little to instill confidence in GE stock lately, even though that type of outlook has boosted GE stock in the past. The failure of General Electric stock to rally on the guidance reiteration  makes me confident about avoiding the name for now,  even if I miss some gains as a result.Watch how GE handles $9. If it falls below that level,  it's in trouble. But if GE stock overcomes its resistance, it may be worth buying.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-10,"After weekend news regarding the cancellation of tariffs on Mexico, U.S. stock were primed for more gains on Monday. While not as explosive as some bulls had hoped, others are pointing out just how far we've rallied over the past few days. Let's look at some top stock trades as part of a busy Monday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: SalesforceSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) was part of a loaded &quot;Merger Monday&quot; after it snapped up Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) in an all-stock deal worth $15.7 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far though, shares aren't reacting too kindly, down more than 6% on the news. The move drops shares below range support near $152.50, as well as prior downtrend resistance (blue line). CRM stock was able to hurdle the latter mark on its post-earnings rally last week.So what now?  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 If Salesforce can't reclaim this $152.50 area, the 200-day moving average will be called upon almost immediately near $150. Should it fail to hold, the following levels will be on watch: The 38.2% retracement at $146.95, last week's lows and the 50% retracement at $140.58. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: United Technologies  Click to EnlargeTopping CRM's near-$16 billion deal is the mega-merger between United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN). The tie-up has even drawn early concern from President Trump, which is likely why both stocks are off their session highs as investors worry about regulatory approval.It was disappointing that $130 couldn't hold as support. Now bulls will want to see support in this $126 to $128 area hold up. It marks the backside of prior downtrend resistance, the 200-day moving average and the 38.2% retracement.If it holds, see if UTX can reclaim its 20-day moving average, then possibly its 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Boeing  Click to EnlargeBoeing (NYSE:BA) is finally over downtrend resistance, but it has bigger hurdles on the horizon. For instance, the 200-day and 50-day moving averages loom large at $360.40 and $364.25, respectively.Not to mention since the 737 MAX issues, the $360 to $362 area has been acting as range support for BA. That creates a very vital level just ahead. If BA can clear this area, $400 is back on the table.If it acts as resistance, look to see if the 20-day moving average and backside of prior downtrend resistance can act as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: McDonald's  Click to EnlargeMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has dumped lower since Monday's open, ultimately falling about 2% on the day. The bulls aren't in trouble yet though.I want to see shares hold over $200 and the 20-day moving average. Above that and all is well; new all-time highs are still on the table. Below this area calls the 50-day moving average into question at $195. Below the 50-day and $187.50 is next on the list.But before you get too bearish, just look at this stock during the month of May. It was a total beast and while the market was melting down, shares didn't even test the 50-day. Don't bet against MCD quite yet. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Netflix  Click to EnlargeNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is reminiscent of CRM, but without breaking back below prior downtrend resistance (blue line).Remember, almost all of FANG -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- are under watch for antitrust practices. NFLX seems to be safe of that risk, but that doesn't mean the other three can't weigh it down.Shares are teetering just above the 38.2% retracement near $350, with range support down near $340 and the 200-day at $337.50. Last week, shares temporarily broke below all of these support levels, but quickly reclaimed them with a big rally.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows For now, the 50-day is acting as resistance. If shares hold up over downtrend resistance and the 38.2% retracement, see if it can reclaim the 50-day. If they fail as support, see if $337 to $340 holds as support. Below could attract plenty of sellers, especially if FANG weighs it down.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its winning ways, jumping 0.3% on Monday.In late trading, more than two-thirds of the Dow's 30 components were trading higher. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), however, was not one of those names. The defense contractor tumbled over 3% on more than triple the average daily volume on news its is looking to acquire rival Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) in a deal valued at $121 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnited Technologies recently announced plans to spin off its elevator and heating and air conditioning businesses, prompting some market observers to characterize the offer for Raytheon, in which United Technologies is offering 2.33 shares for each Raytheon, as unusual. However, Seaport Global raised its rating on United Technologies to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; today.Additionally, there is already speculation that the Donald Trump Administration, which has been mostly friendly toward the aerospace and defense industry, has antitrust concerns about the potential marriage of these two companies.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows &quot;The deal will be reviewed by either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that it complies with antitrust law,&quot; according to Reuters. Fun With FinancialsFinancial services is the third-largest sector weight in the Dow and the S&P 500, so it was to investors' benefit to see some of those names contributing to Monday's upside. In late trading, three of the Dow's top four percentage gainers were financial services names.JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank, rose 1.06% after CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most widely voices in the banking industry, compared his company to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in a recent Barron's interview.Dimon told the financial magazine that the bank has a lot of &quot;subscription-like businesses&quot; and that its earnings volatility, over time, is low. He added that the bank plans to boost its dividend following the release of the Fed's stress test results.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the largest financial services stock in the Dow, was the blue-chip index's top percentage gainer today, adding 2.26%. Aside from reports that Goldman was Saudi Arabia's leading brokerage firm last month, there was not a lot of company-specific news pertaining to the name today.On essentially no news other than its home sector and the broader market climbing, American Express (NYSE:AXP) added 1.3% to hit a new 52-week high. The stock is up more than 27% year-to-date. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor investors tired of tariff talk, Monday brought a step in the right direction as the U.S. and Mexico continued making nice on the trade front. How, or if, this affects the U.S./China trade dispute is another matter altogether.On Monday, President Trump threatened to levy more tariffs on Chinese imports if his counterpart, President Xi Jinping, does not attend the G-20 meeting in Japan later this month. Trump believes the two sides will eventually reach some type of trade deal and that the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will be the catalyst for getting that deal done.Trump added that it was the threat of tariffs that facilitated a favorable outcome with Mexico on trade. The president also renewed his criticism of the Fed, stoking speculation that the central bank will acquiesce to the president's comments and lower interest rates this year.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Aircraft manufacturers and suppliers big and small will gather at the Paris Air Show next week to showcase new products and technologies, trumpet orders (both firm, tentative and recycled) and pontificate on the industry.This year’s event comes amid concerns that the robust commercial aerospace spending cycle that has fueled record backlogs is getting long in the tooth. Passenger traffic grew 4.3% in April, which was an improvement from a notably weak 3.1% expansion in March but off the long-term average of about 5%, according to data from the International Air Transport Association. The common thinking had been that secular changes like the burgeoning middle class in emerging markets and millennials’ preference for travel experiences would support traffic growth beyond that average rate, and that was what happened for a few years. Whether or not the slackening trend of the past two months lasts, commercial air-travel demand will most likely continue to grow in some capacity, Aengus Kelly, CEO of plane-lessor AerCap Holdings NV, said in a phone interview this week. The question is whether Boeing Co. and Airbus SE are already planning to build more planes than the industry will need and whether some customers may soon realize they’ve overpaid for assets or bought plane models that now look less desirable. “We have a view on the value of an asset, so where we see value and price intersect, we will be aggressive,” Kelly said. “You can’t say I’m going to buy growth at any price. If it’s a great sellers’ market, it can’t be a great buyers’ market.”Profit margins are already showing signs of wobbling at some airlines amid higher costs and competition for fares. That, combined with a slower economic backdrop and the continued grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jet, may keep a lid on fresh aircraft orders at the Air Show, write Bloomberg Intelligence analysts George Ferguson and Francois Duflot. American Airlines Group Inc. has pulled the Max from its schedule through Sept. 3, but CEO Doug Parker told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting this week that it’s highly likely the plane will be flying by then. That comment might mean more if the company hadn’t also said it was confident the Max would be recertified by Aug. 19, the previous estimate for returning the plane to American’s schedule. A Federal Aviation Administration official was more measured, saying the plane should be back in the air by December. Once the Max re-enters service, the impact on Boeing’s deliveries may linger for a few years, Kelly said. Boeing said this week it booked zero orders in May and delivered 30 planes,down substantially from the same period a year earlier. When asked whether the Max crisis may present an opportunity to negotiate a discount on the Max, Kelly replied “possibly” but said it’s hard to contemplate much of anything to do with the plane until regulators all across the globe deem it safe to fly again.There’s also the risk that some of Boeing’s other products get caught in the fray. Europe’s aviation regulator said this week that it would assess  commonalities between the 737 Max and the 777X jet that’s meant to enter service in 2020. Airbus, meanwhile, may unveil the A321XLR — a longer-range version of its largest-single aisle jet — at the Air Show in a bid to undercut the business case for a potential Boeing mid-market aircraft, a decision on which has likely been shelved for the time being amid the Max crisis. Airbus is also reportedly considering making the next version of its best-selling A320neo narrow-body jet a hybrid-electric model. The other hot topic at the Air Show will be the implications of the gargantuan merger United Technologies Corp. announced this week with Raytheon Co. The combined company — dubbed Raytheon Technologies Corp. — is set to have $74 billion in sales spanning missiles, commercial jet engines, airplane lavatories and avionics. That United Technologies felt the need to diversify through more exposure to the defense market doesn’t send the strongest vote of confidence that the commercial aviation boom will continue unabated. The combined company’s $8 billion R&D budget will be multiples above peers, and that has to be spooking some rivals, particularly General Electric Co., whose cash-flow challenges may keep it from responding in kind. Some analysts have pointed to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. as a potential next target, while others have debated tie-ups between Airbus and BAE Systems Plc or Safran SA and Thales SA. MEET MEGATRONOnly four aerospace and defense deals in the past decade have been bigger than $10 billion, and United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes has played a role in three of them. The all-stock deal with Raytheon will make United Technologies a more legitimate counterweight to Boeing and would seem to give it a better shot at protecting its margins and market share from the planemaker’s squeeze. Some criticized the deal as effectively turning United Technologies into a conglomerate again, just after it announced a three-way split that will make the Carrier building-controls and Otis elevator units stand-alone companies. I disagree; I think this deal fits perfectly within the anti-conglomerate game theory. Sprawling diversity is out, but sheer scale and focused vertical integration is in. The appeal of the deal for Raytheon is less obvious. The company seemingly has the more attractive growth and free cash flow profile, so it seems a bit odd that CEO Thomas Kennedy was the one who reached out to Hayes and then was willing to accept no premium; a minority stake in the combined entity; and the abdication of his title in favor of an executive chairman post. Maybe Raytheon felt it needed the heft of a bigger company to properly invest in priorities like hypersonics and cybersecurity. Or maybe the company was worried about being sidelined with Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies Inc. merging and Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. striking deals of their own over the past few years. Two people not yet on board with this transaction are President Donald Trump and activist investor Bill Ackman. Trump ruminated to CNBC about whether the deal may squelch competition for military contracts, causing shares of both companies to dip even as they insisted there’s little overlap between them and vowed to share about half of the $1 billion-plus in targeted annual cost savings with the Pentagon. Ackman, who built a stake in United Technologies last year and supported its breakup plan, wrote a letter to Hayes lambasting the use of the company’s undervalued stock as a deal currency and deeming Raytheon an “inferior” business. Those strike me as shortsighted critiques. The one thing you can say about this deal is that it’s another big undertaking when United Technologies is already juggling the $30 billion takeover of Rockwell Collins Inc. and a breakup. Execution risk is high, but if management can pull it off, this deal has the potential to be a game-changer.TARIFF ME, TARIFF ME NOTTrump’s latest tariff dance with Mexico ended up lasting only about a week. He announced late last Friday that he wouldn’t impose sweeping levies on Mexican goods after the country agreed to do more to address the flow of immigrants across its border into the U.S. The New York Times reported that most of the actions Mexico agreed to take had already been negotiated months earlier, an article that Trump took issue with on Twitter. Later this week, Trump threatened Mexico with “a much tougher phase” if it didn’t deliver a demonstrable drop in migrant traffic. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said his country has 45 days to prove it’s following through on its commitments. Those comments raise the prospect of the tariffs going into effect after all at a later date. So while manufacturers have avoided this particular trade headache for now, the uncertainty this latest spat has introduced isn’t going anywhere. On the China front, Trump said he’s personally holding up a trade deal and threatened to put tariffs on $300 billion of goods if the country’s president, Xi Jinping, doesn’t meet with him at the G-20 summit later this month. There are signs that China is girding for a protracted trade war, even with its economy on shakier ground. So the industrial pressure points continue to pile up. Macquarie analyst Sameer Rathod warned this week that Caterpillar Inc. is likely to face a serious drop-off in demand and margin erosion amid a slowdown in China excavator sales. Research firm LMC Automotive sounded the alarm on a “sustained downturn” in the global automotive industry, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said expectations of an improvement in the Chinese market later this year are too optimistic. Of note, a report this week showed U.S. car brands were losing market share in China to German and Japanese models. The data is from the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, so take that for what you will.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCERoper Technologies Inc. scrapped the sale of its Gatan electron-microscope instruments business to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. after running into “challenges” in getting U.K. regulatory approval for the $925 million deal. Roper management previously expressed optimism that they could overcome inquiries from the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, but the asset sale was announced about a year ago, and the two sides may have just run out of hope and patience. While Roper won’t get the $700 million in net proceeds it was anticipating from the divestiture, it will still have plenty of M&A firepower. The company has said it could deploy about $7 billion over the next four years. RBC analyst Deane Dray said that Thermo Fisher was the most logical buyer for the Gatan business and that Roper may struggle to find an alternative suitor willing to pay a similarly high valuation. This underscores why it can be difficult for Roper to divest even those businesses that no longer fit with its current software-driven identity. On the flip side, Dray now estimates Roper’s 2019 earnings per share could be as much as 25 cents higher now that Gatan is likely staying in the fold.Avis Budget Group Inc. has a better shot of selling a potential merger with Hertz Global Holdings Inc. to U.S. antitrust regulators as ride-hailing services Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. take sales away from the traditional car rental market, Macquarie analyst Hamzah Mazari argues in a report this week. Avis’s and Hertz’s market share each shrinks from the low 20% range to high single digits if Lyft and Uber are treated as commercial-travel competitors, he writes. That’s even after making a conservative assumption about the percentage of Uber and Lyft’s vehicle miles that might have otherwise gone to rental companies. That may make regulators more amenable to a deal that would create a stronger challenger to rental giant Enterprise, which itself has 56% of the U.S. car rental market excluding ride-sharing services, Mazari writes, citing conversations with antitrust lawyers. Mazari says he’s not aware of any deal talks and isn’t outright advocating for them, but he notes scale is beneficial in the car rental industry when it comes to IT systems, car procurement and pricing discipline. Ferguson Plc, a plumbing-products merchant formerly known as Wolseley, has attracted the attention of sometimes-activist investor Trian Fund Management. The fund, run by Nelson Peltz, has built a 6% stake in Ferguson and says it will push management to correct the stock’s discount to U.S. peers. That’s sparked speculation about whether Trian could seek to press the company to shift its listing to the U.S. from the U.K. Ferguson derives nearly 90% of its revenue from North America, but its position on a U.K. stock exchange may keep it out of the jurisdiction of U.S. fund managers. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Chris Hughes points out that engineering a U.S. listing is easier said than done and that it may be oversimplifying things to blame all of Ferguson’s discount on its British address. Worries about a slowdown in the U.S. and lackluster margin improvement could also be a factor, he writes.  BONUS READINGReassessing Jack Welch’s Legacy After GE’s Decline: Joe Nocera Saving Earth With Electric Cars Means Wrecking a Fragile DesertOutback Town That Rivaled Manhattan’s Prices Now Gathers Dust Trump’s Goods-Sector Jobs Boom Has Fizzled Out: Justin FoxOil’s 2019 Weakness Has Roots in 2018’s Strength: Liam Denning VW’s $18.6 Billion Truck IPO to Test CEO’s Overhaul PlanTo contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-06-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- United Technologies Corp. CEO Greg Hayes dropped the bombshell news of his company’s merger with missile-maker Raytheon Co. just days before the start of the Paris Air Show, thereby ensuring rivals would have to answer questions about the deal at the industry’s premier event. The deal will turn United Technologies into a $74 billion commercial aviation and defense powerhouse, with the kind of scale and negotiating leverage that was previously only enjoyed by Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Management at General Electric Co. and Honeywell International Inc. don’t seem in any rush to respond in kind, and they aren’t so sure bigger is better. But the United Technologies-Raytheon merger is so big that it will be impossible for them to ignore it.“We’ve never really considered scale as a part of our strategy,” Tim Mahoney, CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview at the Air Show on Monday. The company prioritizes differentiated products that are more than a “me-too” and believes that will ultimately give it an advantage with manufacturers and airlines, he said. GE’s David Joyce, who heads up the company’s aerospace business, echoed that thought in a Bloomberg TV interview: “That merger may have scale but we have the right technologies and engines to be competitive.”During a media briefing earlier in the day, Joyce touted the advantages of GE’s Leap engine over the rival geared turbofan from United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney arm, including what he says is a $1.4 million advantage in residual value and 6% better utilization. After the merger, GE’s biggest jet engine rivals will continue to be Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, and “I feel really good about our positioning relative to either of those competitors right now,” Joyce said. The “right now” part of that sentence seems key. No, GE isn’t gaining a new competitor, but it is going to see a very different one.United Technologies and Raytheon are targeting $8 billion in annual R&D spending. GE Aviation spent $1.5 billion on R&D in 2018, including contributions from customers, according to its annual filing. That would put the aviation unit’s R&D spending at about 5% of sales. At the media briefing, Joyce said GE Aviation spends about 8% of its sales on R&D, which is based on $2.4 billion in total “engineering” spend. Either way, it’s less than the nearly 11% of United Technologies-Raytheon’s combined sales that will be devoted to investing in new products. Honeywell doesn’t disclose R&D spending by division, but spent $1.8 billion on company-sponsored R&D across all its businesses in 2018, according to its 10K. That’s roughly 4.3 percent of its total sales last year.The dollar amount isn’t everything. As GE itself knows far too well from its experience going down the rabbit hole on its Predix software platform, it’s quite easy to spend a lot of money without anything to show for it. And United Technologies will admittedly be distracted while it integrates not only Raytheon, but the $30 billion acquisition of avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc., which only just closed in November. Not to mention it’s also trying to break itself in three parts. The company’s wager on scale is still highly untested and despite all the speculation about the sweeping consolidation its dealmaking might inspire, we haven’t seen much of that. Of the eight aerospace and defense deals larger than $5 billion over the past decade, United Technologies (or Rockwell Collins) has been involved as a buyer in four of them; United Technologies also sold its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion in 2015. The party of bigger is better is pretty much a party of one – again, for now.Joyce interestingly said that while the United Technologies-Raytheon tie-up doesn’t make him feel compelled to act, he “wouldn’t rule out anything” when it comes to a deal with a good value proposition, and that he talks to CEO Larry Culp on a regular basis. That echoes increasingly frequent comments made by Culp about going on offense. I do wonder whether GE is thinking more seriously about dealmaking – or if it just wants investors to think that it is. As for the much-debated possible combination of GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace, I don’t get the impression the latter is that interested. Honeywell views acquisitions as a way to extend the capabilities of its businesses, rather than double down on more of the same, Mahoney said. He gives the example of Honeywell’s purchase of fuel-efficiency software maker Aviaso in 2015 for an undisclosed amount. Mahoney said he wished Aviaso was a larger business, which suggests he’s not opposed to bigger takeovers but only if the technology is really compelling.So don’t hold your breath on that one. But could there be other deals?

And since that time it has grown its business into a global provider of parts and equipment for aircraft, defense and industrial companies.Source: Karen Neoh via FlickrGiven all the talk generated in recent days by the merger between United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), it seemed timely to discuss other specialized and successful companies in the sector that don't get many headlines on a regular basis. The Landscape for HEI StockOf course, there's also the issue with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and its 737 Max8 grounding, which continues. Initially the airlines that owned the planes thought this was going to be a brief suspension of service but it continues to drag on as BA has released a greater number of protocol issues in drips and drabs, rather than coming clean at the outset of the investigation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt this point, there are other models that are now getting a good look after some concerns in production have been unearthed in the Max investigation.Add to that the delays that are happening with General Electric's (NYSE:GE) GE9x new engines for BA's massive 777X.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half What all this means for Heico is extra business. You see, modern aircraft are precision machines, and that means they perform at optimal levels, and that means parts wear out quickly.With fewer new planes deployed in airlines' fleets, the demand for parts increases. And that's very good news for HEI stock. In the past year, Heico is up 72% and it's up 66% year to date. Yet, it's only trading at a 58x trailing price-to-earnings ratio. Granted that's not a bargain, but it's below its growth rate.HEI reported fiscal Q2 numbers in late May, and they easily beat analysts' estimates as a whole. Each division also performed well.Another strength for Heico is that it works on both the defense and aerospace side of things as well as commercial aircraft. This means it's not beholden to growing defense budgets or winning those long-term contracts.Its global presence also allows it diversification into the powerful growth happening in commercial travel and logistics in Asia, particularly China. Its long history in the business demonstrates its ability to compete in this dynamic and expanding market.And with just a $15 billion market cap, this could very well be a takeover target for an airplane maker or an industrial conglomerate looking to get a foothold in the sector.Certainly the U.S. defense sector has been the center of attention recently with the UTX-RTN merger, but it's the commercial side that holds the greatest long-term potential.And with private companies moving into the space race, this is another big opportunity for Heico to grow its business.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe Iran situation is worth monitoring over the next few days, particularly for investors owning any of the aforementioned aerospace or oil stocks. However, as that situation blows over, market participants will refocus their attention to monetary policy and if/when the Fed will cut interest rates.On that note, CNBC had an interesting piece out today highlighting the bullishness news of three Dow components against the backdrop of declining interest rates.

2019-06-20,The aerospace industry is on the brink of having the biggest merger in sector history.,3 Aerospace Growth Stocks to Consider
2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Aviation has long been considered General Electric Co.’s crown jewel, but with the company’s free cash flow turning negative this year, “crown jewel” is a relative term and the business is coming under increasing scrutiny. Some of it is deserved; some isn’t.GE Aviation CEO David Joyce seemed to be on a mission at this year’s Paris Air Show to prove his division’s worth. He arrived armed with more financial detail than GE had ever previously provided for the business, came out swinging against suggestions he was sacrificing price to score revenue wins, and announced some notable orders. And yet questions remain about what the business’s true financial profile would be if it was reconstituted as a stand-alone company and cut off from the tax and working-capital benefits that have historically come with being part of the mother ship. That matters, because many investors continue to value GE based on the sum of its parts, the argument being that the aviation unit alone can offset trouble spots in GE’s power, renewables and long-term care insurance operations and support a higher valuation for the stock.First, the positives: GE Aviation and its CFM International engine joint venture with Safran SA booked $55 billion in orders for engines and services at the Air Show, exceeding the $35 billion target Joyce laid out at a media briefing at the start of this week.(2) Like most order tallies from the event, not all of that is technically new business. The number includes an order from AirAsia that had initially been announced in 2016 and entails 200 of GE’s LEAP engines. The purchase was finalized at this year’s event and AirAsia also expanded a servicing agreement, bringing the total value of the deal to $23.1 billion before customary discounts. But there was also a significant new win: Indian budget carrier IndiGo agreed to a $20 billion order for Leap engines, spares and overhaul support.The deal is a blow to United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney arm, which had been the sole provider of engines for IndiGo’s Airbus SE A320neo jets. As with Boeing Co.’s face-saving win of an order for its embattled 737 Max jet, some analysts have wondered what GE had to give up in order to convince IndiGo to abandon Pratt. They were encouraged in this thinking by comments from Pratt President Bob Leduc, who said “GE was willing to be more aggressive than we were” on pricing. That may just be Leduc talking his book, though.(4) Unlike in the depressed gas turbine market, where every revenue win likely comes at a cost to GE’s margins, GE shouldn’t need to sacrifice profit to chase market share in aviation – both in general and in the case of this particular deal. Pratt’s GTF engine has had a series of glitches that ultimately proved fixable and relatively minor, but as one of the largest buyers, IndiGo has borne the brunt of the fallout, including in-flight engine shutdowns and grounded planes. Earlier this year, India mandated weekly inspections of certain engine parts and restricted some operations for Airbus planes powered by the GTF. GE has engine headaches of its own. Boeing’s CFO Greg Smith put GE on the hot seat earlier this month, saying its GE9X engine was holding up the aerospace giant’s new 777X plane. At a media briefing this week, Joyce said GE discovered a part of the engine was showing more wear than anticipated and because of the extensive testing required to prove it had fixed the issue, the 777X’s first flight likely won’t happen until the fall. Investors are understandably jittery over any product setbacks after the uncovering of durability issues with GE’s flagship H-class gas turbine. But given the GTF’s history of bugs, I find it hard to fault GE for making tweaks to its engine. In the wake of the voluminous criticism directed at Boeing and the FAA for not realizing the potential impact of a software system linked to the Max’s two fatal crashes, rigorous testing – before the planes start flying – would seem to be in everyone’s best interest.GE has argued it has a technology advantage that will continue to give it an edge even as United Technologies increases its R&D budget through a blockbuster merger with defense contractor Raytheon Co. That remains to be seen, and I don’t think GE’s order wins at the Air Show tilt the scale one way or another. A smart R&D budget is worth more than a big one, but United Technologies will have a lot of money to work with and that will make it difficult for GE and others to stand pat. GE Aviation’s ability to respond to that competition ultimately boils down to how much cash flow it generates – and that’s where confusion continues to reign supreme. At Tuesday’s analyst event, Joyce laid out the various inputs behind the unit’s reported $4.2 billion in free cash flow last year. It was a sign the company is taking investors’ demands for more transparency seriously, although it remains disappointing that these disclosures come in fits and starts. There were some positive takeaways: Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Kaplowitz noted the improvement in inventory turns in 2018 even as GE ramped up production of the Leap. But one sticking point was the allocation of corporate costs including pension, interest and taxes, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa and Gordon Haskett’s John Inch debating whether the unit was carrying its fair share.On the subject of taxes, GE didn't do itself any favors as far as illuminating what's really happening in the aviation unit. The presentation included a line that indicated taxes and other operating expenses deducted $100 million from the aviation unit’s cash flow, which seems quite low on the face of it. But the aviation unit actually pays more than that in taxes. And GE isn't hiding that burden from its calculation of the free cash flow. You just have to know where to look for it.The starting point for GE’s explanation of how it calculated the aviation unit’s free cash flow – $5.8 billion in net earnings after adjusting for depreciation and amortization – had already been adjusted for taxes accrued, based on its operations, according to a company representative. GE confirmed the aviation unit pays a tax rate in the low 20% range that CFO Jamie Miller has guided to for the entire company. The $100 million number for taxes and other operating expenses in the Air Show presentation is something different. That is the difference between taxes paid and accruals in 2018. Are you still with me?The fact that this is all so confusing underscores one of the issues I’ve had with GE’s efforts to be more transparent. Disclosures come in fitfully and often leave people with only more questions. I don’t think GE always does this on purpose; it’s partly a reflection of the fact that this remains an incredibly complex company and any given number is going to require a half-hour explanation. But you can’t have it both ways. Is GE Aviation a crown jewel? Yes. Is GE very good at explaining that? It could use some work in that department. (1) The total doesn't include engines for the 200 737 Max jets that British Airways owner IAG SA ordered at the Air Show. CFM is the sole engine provider for that plane.The list price for those engines is $5.8 billion.(2) The flip side of Leduc's comments was Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc CEO Warren East's description of GE as a &quot;very savvy commercial operator.&quot;To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-06-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Clouds of worry have been gathering over the commercial aviation industry, but the sun was shining in Paris this week as planemakers and suppliers gathered for the biennial Air Show.I mean that both literally — it was hot — and figuratively, with every executive I talked to adopting the same tone of cautious optimism. They conceded the market is slowing: Amid sputtering air traffic growth, weakening airline profits and a slowing global economy, orders at the Paris Air Show trailed the tally from last year’s Farnborough Air Show on both a unit and dollar basis, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence’s George Ferguson and Francois Duflot. And the orders that were announced weren’t always written in stone. Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard counted about 610 commitments for new planes between Boeing Co. and Airbus SE (short of his forecast for 800), but only about 160 of those are firm orders for large aircraft and all of those belong to Airbus.(1) Some orders for Airbus’s new A321XLR — a longer-range version of its top-selling narrow-body jet that was unveiled as expected this week — were converted from existing commitments for previous A320-family models. But there were orders, including a surprise bid from British Airways parent IAG SA for Boeing’s embattled 737 Max jets (more on that later). While everyone no doubt would have preferred a stronger showing, no one was panicking, either.Global growth in demand for commercial aviation is likely to slow to a pace of about 5% this year from around 7.5% to 8% in the past few years, according to the International Air Transport Association. “That’s still a pretty good place to be — look at what many other industries are doing,” Tony Wood, CEO of aircraft braking and fire-protection equipment maker Meggitt Plc, said in an interview. “It’s certainly quicker than the world is growing.” Tim Mahoney, CEO of Honeywell International Inc.’s aerospace unit, pointed out that airlines are filling the capacity they lost when two fatal crashes prompted a global grounding of Boeing’s Max through leases and older aircraft that are staying in service longer than planned. Jet Airways India Ltd. suspended operations in April after running out of cash and is heading to bankruptcy court, but some of its fleet has already been reallocated, Mahoney said. “It’s a validation that the demand from the flying public is there and it continues to grow,” he said. Boeing, meanwhile, now expects the commercial aviation market to need 44,040 new jets and $9.1 trillion of services over the next 20 years. That compares with last year’s prediction of 42,730 jets and $8.8 trillion of services.So, Boeing and Airbus’s backlogs are likely safe in their robustness for the time being. But as I said going into the show, the question is whether they’ve already saturated the market and whether those backlogs will continue to grow. Executives from CFM International, the engine joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA, weren’t super enthusiastic about production rate increases for Airbus’s A320 family. It’s not clear that the supply chain is capable of handling a more aggressive pace, particularly the forging and casting companies, which have been the primary source of delays over the past few years. At a media briefing on Saturday, CFM executives said they also want to be sure any production rate increase is sustainable and will serve the market over the long-term — not just at its peak. The relative dearth of orders at this year’s Air Show would seem to support their cautious stance.ALL’S FAIR IN LOVE AND THE MAXBoeing’s Air Show order tally fell about $10 billion short of Airbus’s haul, but IAG’s commitment to buy 200 Max jets means more for the company than the final total. IAG CEO Willie Walsh, a former 737 pilot, said he would feel comfortable boarding a Max tomorrow. He can’t actually do that because the planes remain grounded globally, but it was a huge vote of confidence when Boeing needed one desperately. That kind of endorsement most likely didn’t come cheap: the list price for the planes IAG intends to buy is $24 billion, but the true price is likely much lower after adjusting for standard discounts and probably a few extra incentives. It’s not a done deal just yet. IAG only signed a letter of intent, which gives it an out in case the Max runs into more problems or if Airbus comes up with a better offer. Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said his company was never invited to bid on the deal but would very much like to. Either way, IAG’s willingness to back the Max gets Boeing out of the aviation industry’s version of timeout. This was always inevitable. Customers have been resolute in their confidence that Boeing will make the fuel-efficient Max safe to fly again. IAG had previously relied largely on Airbus models for its shorter hauls, so the fact that it’s the one stepping up with a Max order is a testament to airlines’ desire to maintain competition between the two companies. But I do wonder whether that kind of dynamic properly incentivizes Boeing to address the transparency, communication and oversight issues that allowed the Max’s shortcomings to morph into a full-blown crisis. Meanwhile, a good chunk of Airbus’s orders were for the freshly rolled-out XLR, with American Airlines Group Inc. agreeing to buy 20 of the planes and convert existing orders into 30 more. Boeing’s sales chief Ihssane Mounir said in a closing press conference that the XLR addressed only a “sliver” of the middle market and that there’s still an untapped opportunity for a rival offering it’s contemplating. That was backed up by comments from the CEOs of JetBlue Airways Corp. (which ordered 13 XLRs) and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (which is thinking about buying the Airbus jet), with both advocating for the range advantages of a possible Boeing new middle-market aircraft. But while Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said there was no plan to accelerate the development of a successor to the 737 model, the Max crisis and advances in manufacturing and engine technology may force it to give that kind of project precedence over a middle-market jet. MEGADEAL SHOWCASEFor all the optimism about continuing growth, I thought it was interesting that Raytheon Co.’s CEO Tom Kennedy and CFO Toby O’Brien chose to cast their company’s merger with United Technologies Corp. as a bet on the long-term value of resiliency. Eventually, the booming growth the aerospace and defense sector have enjoyed simultaneously the past few years is going to come to an end; it’s rare that the two sectors move in tandem. Revenue for the combined United Technologies-Raytheon will split nearly equally between commercial and defense products and between domestic and international markets. “We didn’t have to do this,” O’Brien said. But the combination “makes for a really resilient company through all cycles. If you’re in it for the long haul, why wouldn’t you want that?” Kennedy said he’s not concerned about a slowdown in defense spending in the near-term, given governments’ continuing concerns about geopolitical turmoil. He pointed to backing from both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate for more increases in the Defense Department’s budget for research, development, test and evaluation. The deal with United Technologies will help Raytheon compete more aggressively for the next generation of military franchises by giving it new technological capabilities, Kennedy and O’Brien said. The potential for advancements in compact, high-energy power generation, thermal management and hypersonics is intriguing, and the combined company’s $8 billion annual R&D budget will give it an exorbitant amount of money to play with. But revenue synergies are notoriously more fungible than cold hard cost cuts. So the companies’ willingness to share about half of the $1 billion-plus in annual cost savings they’re targeting with the U.S. government may prove the bigger competitive advantage.The synergies number struck analysts as quite low at only about 1% of the combined company’s $74 billion in sales. O’Brien acknowledged the figure is conservative but said the deal was light on integration work because the Raytheon businesses will continue largely as their own units rather than having their contents strewn about between existing United Technologies operations. While that limits the cost savings, it also makes it harder for United Technologies to foul up the deal as it juggles the Raytheon purchase with the continuing integration of Rockwell Collins Inc. and a pending three-way split. With plenty of time and opportunity for something to go wrong here, United Technologies’ wager on scale is relatively untested and GE and Honeywell aren’t so sure that a bigger aerospace and defense company is necessarily going to be a better one. Both argue they have technology advantages that will keep them competitive. But GE again made interesting noises about possible M&A, with aviation head David Joyce noting that he didn’t feel compelled to act by the United Technologies-Raytheon tie-up but “wouldn’t rule out anything.”  SOMETHING TO PROVEWith the United Technologies-Raytheon merger looming large and questions mounting about cash flow for GE’s aviation unit, Joyce used the Paris Air Show to strike back at critics. GE Aviation and its CFM engine joint venture tallied $55 billion orders for engines and services at the event. Not all of that was technically new, but the haul was anchored by a legitimately impressive $20 billion order for Leap engines and services from Indian budget carrier IndiGo, which had previously relied exclusively on United Technologies jet engines to power its Airbus A320neo fleet. Joyce also laid out the most in-depth road map for a unit’s free cash flow that I’ve ever seen GE provide. But in what has become an unfortunate pattern for GE, what was probably a well-intentioned attempt at transparency sparked only more questions. Analysts continued to pick apart whether the aviation unit’s $4.2 billion in free cash flow last year reflects the full tax, pension and overhead cost burden it would bear if the business were to stand alone. While GE hasn’t voiced any plans to spin off the aviation unit —  and I’m highly doubtful it would be able to do that given continuing challenges in the power and long-term care insurance operations — many investors rely on a sum-of-the-parts analysis to determine the stock’s appropriate valuation. So the legitimacy of that $4.2 billion number as the basis for an independent aviation unit is at the crux of the debate over where the share price goes from here. After walking through the numbers with GE, I feel more comfortable about how they arrived at the $4.2 billion number. But no one knows for sure how all the numbers would shake out if aviation was ever detached from the mothership and the financial benefits inherent in that structure. United Technologies is taking about 18 months to split itself into three parts, and its structure is arguably less difficult to untangle.  So I don’t think this debate is going away.QUICK NOTE ON GECASGE’s jet-lessor arm announced a deal to lease 15 additional Boeing 737-800 converted cargo aircraft to Amazon.com Inc., expanding on an earlier agreement to provide the retail giant with five planes. Amazon aims to have 70 aircraft flying on its network by 2021 in just the latest reminder that its logistics aspirations are a real and growing threat to FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. In a presentation announcing the latest deal with Amazon, GECAS executives said it costs about $8 million to convert a Boeing 737-800 into a cargo plane. In a separate conversation, Sarah Rhoads, the director of Amazon Air, said the company put out requests for proposals to other lessors and that its ultimate choice had to be cost-effective. She said she felt good about partnering with GECAS. In a meeting with analysts this week, Alec Burger, who heads GECAS, acknowledged that the forecast for the air-cargo market was flat in 2019 amid escalating trade tensions but said the continuing shift to online shopping will continue to support demand in the long term and he’s looking to “modestly grow” the share of the lessor’s portfolio that’s devoted to that market. He said Amazon is not a “must-win account.”DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCECrane Co. is following through on its threat to take its $45-a-share takeover offer directly to Circor International Inc.’s shareholders. It’s rare to see a true hostile tender offer, so for the M&A nerd in me, this is exciting. Circor’s board said on Monday that it would review the offer and make a recommendation to shareholders within 10 business days. It had previously rebuffed Crane’s offer as opportunistic and said it undervalued the company, a point of view that some shareholders pushed back on, given the choppy — and lately lower — stock price. Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors Inc. is the largest shareholder of Circor, has also criticized the company’s lack of transparency in disclosing Crane’s interest. We are still awaiting the release of a business plan that Circor promised would show a path to greater valuation creation, but Crane’s willingness to go hostile forces Circor into an even tighter corner.  Delta Air Lines Inc.  bought a 4.3% stake in Hanjin Kal Corp., the largest shareholder in Korean Air Lines Co. Delta and Korean Air have a trans-Pacific joint venture that allows the two carriers to coordinate on flights in Asia and the U.S. Delta expects to boost its stake to 10% over time. The stake purchase is the latest in a string of similar deals with other partners including Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and China Eastern Airlines Corp. But the deal also puts Delta in the middle of an activist shareholder’s campaign to push Hanjin Kal to provide more transparency and improve corporate governance. Shares of Hanjin Kal, whose operations also span logistics services, plunged on news of Delta’s investment in an apparent sign that investors see the company’s stake as a roadblock to the activists’ goals.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. appears to be moving forward with its interest in acquiring Bombardier Inc.’s CRJ regional jet program. A takeover “would make a lot of sense,” Steve Haro, vice president in charge of global marketing and strategy at Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., told Bloomberg News at the Paris Air Show. He said news about “new strategic partnerships” would be forthcoming. Recall that Nikkei had reported earlier this month that Mitsubishi wanted to only carve out the aircraft maintenance network of the CRJ program, but Bombardier had insisted on the unit being sold in its entirety.BONUS READING New York Fed Factory Gauge Drops by Record to Two-Year Low Siemens to Cut 2,700 Jobs at Energy Unit Due for Listing Fight for Survival on Doomed Jet Came Down to Two Cockpit Wheels Southwest Pilots to Seek Recovery of 737 Max Costs From Boeing Airbus Says It Must Slash A350 Costs to Win Wide-Body Price War Craft Breweries Are Booming Even as Americans Drink Less BeerIf you’d like to get these weekly industrial insights delivered to your inbox, please email me directly at bsutherland7@bloomberg.net, and ask to join the list.

With the news of merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), the stock is marginally lower and currently trades at $128.90.I am of the opinion that this downside is a good buying opportunity and investors with a long-term investment horizon can consider exposure to UTX stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Benefit From Merger SynergiesWhile the initial market reaction to the merger announcement was negative and uncertain, the stock price stabilizing and consolidating is an indication that the market participants see long-term value creation from the merger.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains As a first positive, the merger will create the third-largest entity in the aerospace and defense space. Raytheon Technologies (name of merged entity) will be only behind Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) considering 2018 sales. Importantly, the combined entity will be well diversified with 54% revenue from the defense sector and 46% from the commercial airspace sector.Even in terms of regional diversification, Raytheon Technologies has 55% market share in the United States and 45% market share in international markets. With rising geopolitical tensions, the combined entity will be well positioned to expand on the defense sector market share globally.It is also worth noting that both companies have complementary technology offerings and this will help in providing superior products and solutions. The key point to note here is that Raytheon Technologies is likely to invest $8 billion in research & development in 2019.The R&D is likely to focus on hypersonic and future missile systems and artificial intelligence for commercial aviation, among others.Raytheon Technologies is aiming to create cost-effective solutions for the defense sector, which is critical as defense budget escalate globally. Higher R&D is likely to translate into higher turnover and cash flows. Value Unlocking and Shareholder Value CreationAnother positive that has currently been overshadowed by the merger news is the fact that the business combination excludes Otis and Carrier. These entities will be separated from United Technologies in the first half of 2020 and that leaves room for further value unlocking for shareholders.It might still be too early to talk about shareholder value creation in the form of dividend and repurchases post the merger. However, the combined entity intends to return $18 to $20 billion to shareholders in the next 36 months.I believe that the target can potentially be achieved considering the fact that the pro-forma 2019 free for Raytheon Technologies is likely to be $6 billion and the company intends to boost free cash flows to $8 billion by 2021.In addition to higher dividends and share repurchase, I also believe that Raytheon Technologies will deleverage with the combined entity currently having a net debt of $26 billion. While the leverage stands at 1.92, debt reduction is likely considering the fact that Raytheon Technologies will be in a phase of capital expenditure investment cycle moderation. ConclusionFor the first quarter of 2019, Raytheon reported revenue growth of 7.4% with an order backlog of $41.1 billion. For the same period, organic sales growth for United Technologies was 8.0%.It seems very likely that the combined entity will continue to clock turnover growth in the range of 5% to 10%. If earnings per share growth sustains above 10%, Raytheon Technologies will see renewed interest from market participants.I therefore believe that the sideways movement in the near term is a good accumulation opportunity and R&D driven growth is likely to ensure that the stock momentum sustains in the long term.As of this writing, Faisal Humayun did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-28,"Third Point LLC, the hedge fund managed by activist Daniel Loeb, said Friday it plans to vote against the proposed merger of United Technologies Corp.  and Raytheon Co. , describing the deal as lacking a strategic or financial rationale. &quot;After careful consideration, we have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,&quot; the fund wrote in a letter to United Tech management. &quot;The contemplated transaction instead complicates the narrative of a more focused aerospace company that was intended to emerge from UTC's breakup.&quot; Third Point owns about 6.5 million United Tech shares, which were recently acquired, according to its latest 13-F regulatory filing.

2019-06-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The vast majority of Americans have air conditioning but in Germany almost nobody does. At least not yet.(2)So when temperatures in Berlin rose to an uncomfortable 37 Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) this week – a record for the month of June – I was uncommonly delighted to go to the Bloomberg office, where it’s artificially and blissfully cool.By letting people in overheated climates concentrate on their work and get a good night’s sleep, air conditioning has played a big part in driving global prosperity and happiness over the past few decades – and that revolution has still barely begun. About half of Chinese households have this modern tool, but of the 1.6 billion people living in India and Indonesia, only 88 million have access to air conditioning at home, Bloomberg New Energy Finance noted in a recent report.For many, relief is in sight. Because of the combination of population growth, rising incomes, falling equipment prices and urbanization, the number of air-conditioning units installed globally is set to jump from about 1.6 billion today to 5.6 billion by the middle of the century, according to the International Energy Agency.That’s encouraging news for U.S. manufacturers of cooling systems such as Carrier (United Technologies Corp), Ingersoll-Rand Plc and Johnson Controls International Plc. And because much of this growth will happen in Asia, Chinese companies such as Gree Electric Appliances, Qingdao Haier, Midea Group and Japan’s Daikin Industries Ltd should be big beneficiaries.There’s just one glaring problem: What will all this extra demand for electricity do to the climate? Carbon dioxide emissions rose another 2% in 2018, the fastest pace in seven years. That increase was alarming in its own right, given what we know about the unfolding climate emergency. But the proximate cause was especially troubling: Extreme weather led to more demand for air conditioning and heating in 2018, BP Plc explained in its annual review of energy sector.It’s not too hard to imagine a vicious cycle in which more hot weather begets ever more demand for air conditioning and thus even more need for power. That in turn means more emissions and even hotter temperatures.(3)That feedback loop exists at a local level too. Air-conditioning units funnel heat outside, exacerbating the so-called “urban heat island” effect, which makes cities warmer than the countryside. BNEF expects electricity demand from residential and commercial air conditioning to increase by more than 140% by 2050 – an increase that’s comparable to adding the European Union’s entire electricity consumption. Air conditioning will represent 12.7% of electricity demand by the middle of the century, compared to almost 9% now, it thinks.Thankfully, much of that extra requirement will be met by solar power (the need for cooling is highest during daylight hours). But because temperatures don’t always return to comfortable levels when the sun goes down, there’s a danger that some of the additional electricity will be supplied by fossil power.Buildings have long been a blind spot in climate discussions even though they account for about one-fifth of global energy consumption. The inefficiency of air-conditioning systems or badly designed homes and offices simply aren’t as eye-catching as electric cars and making people feel ashamed about flying. At least Germany’s “passivhaus” movement, a way of building homes that require very little heating or cooling, shows some people are starting to recognize the peril.There are lessons to be learned from the world of lighting too. The LED revolution was spurred by innovation but also by better energy efficiency labeling on products and the discontinuing of out-of-date technology. Something similar needs to happen with air conditioning. There was a big step forward in January when the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol came into force. Although not well known, its aim is to phase out the use of potent greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons, which are used widely in air conditioning systems. Unless substituted, these alone could cause 0.4C of additional warming by the end of the century.Yet true to form, President Donald Trump’s administration hasn’t yet submitted Kigali to the Senate for ratification, even though American manufacturers would benefit from demand for the new technologies that it would spawn.Trump knows all about the importance of good air con. He spends much of his time at his Palm Beach country club, a place that couldn’t exist without it. So he’d do well to remember this: You can air condition the 19th hole but not the golf course. And it’s starting to get awfully hot outside.(1) In the U.S. 90% of households have air-con, in Germany it's about 3%, which is similar to the U.K.(2) Warmer winters may obviate the need for as much heating in temperate countries, but the need for more cooling in densely populated tropical places will probably cause a net increase in energy demand and emissions.

The comment came after U.S. President Donald Trump this month expressed concern that United Technologies Corp's plan to combine its aerospace business with that of Raytheon Co could harm competition and make it more difficult to negotiate defence contracts.

2019-06-28,"Mr Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, which took a stake in the aerospace company in the first quarter of last year, said the proposed deal “is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,” in a letter to the company’s board today.  “Third Point will not support the merger in its current form and plans to vote against it,” the Mr Loeb said.",Loeb joins Ackman in opposing UTC-Raytheon merger
2019-06-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Dan Loeb came out against United Technologies Corp.’s proposed tie-up with Raytheon Co., saying the “ill conceived” deal makes neither financial nor strategic sense.The chief executive officer of Third Point, whose hedge fund owns a stake in United Technologies worth about $836 million, plans to vote against the deal, Loeb said in a letter to the company’s board. The agreement undervalues United Technologies’ aerospace unit and CEO Greg Hayes is pushing ahead for the wrong reasons, he said.“Since there is no strategic or financial rationale for this transaction, we can only conclude that the merger was motivated by empire building and Mr. Hayes’ desire to extend his already long overdue tenure as head of a Fortune 100 company,” Loeb said in the letter released Friday, confirming a report in Bloomberg News.Third Point invested in United Technologies in part because Hayes had promised that its plan to break up into three parts would lead to an orderly CEO transition over the next year or two and a potential upgrade in management, Loeb said.“We were alarmed to learn that Mr. Hayes signed a new sweetheart employment agreement that would entrench him for another half a decade ultimately as both CEO and chairman of the board,” Loeb said. “We believe this to be a case of disastrously bad corporate governance.”Biggest DeclineRaytheon fell 2.2% to $174.09 at 1:02 p.m. in New York, the biggest decline on an S&P index of aerospace and defense stocks. United Technologies rose less than 1%.While United Technologies welcomes the opinions of shareholders, it disagrees with Third Point’s &quot;assertions and conclusions,&quot; the company said in a statement.The board unanimously approved the deal following a thorough review and other investors recognize the merit of the transaction, United Technologies said.&quot;We remain focused on executing the transaction, and continue to expect that the transaction will close in the first half of 2020,&quot; it said.A representative for Raytheon didn’t respond to a request for comment.Reaction to the Raytheon tie-up has been thoroughly mixed, with both companies’ shares falling slightly since the deal was announced June 9, trailing the broader market. While analysts at Cowen and Vertical Research Partners have upgraded United Technologies recently, Agency Partners in a June 10 note called the merger “illogical” and said that “it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this deal is about size for size sake.”United Technologies and Raytheon are facing increasing pressure to explain the “economic rather than just strategic benefits” of the combination, Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co., said Friday in an interview. “They’re going to have to come up with a lot more granularity about the value of this transaction for shareholders.”Investor opposition would appear to be the biggest threat to the deal. Analysts expect limited pushback from antitrust regulators given the small overlap between United Technologies and Raytheon. The Pentagon has begun reviewing the deal and will submit its views to the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission.United Technologies plans to spin off the non-aerospace operations that make elevators and air conditioners before the deal closes.Strategic RationaleLoeb remained unconvinced of the strategic rationale for transaction, which management has said is primarily focused on technology.“We can appreciate why Raytheon is interested in UTC technology to further its competitive position in areas including hypersonics, directed energy weapons, and air traffic management,” he said. “However, Raytheon brings very little applicable technology to UTC’s aerospace offerings.”Raytheon’s cyber and data analysis, for example, could be replicated through commercial relationships or supply agreements, he said. He pointed to similar arrangements between General Electric Co. and Safran SA as well as Airbus SE and Palantir Technologies Inc.Loeb also questioned the timing of the deal and valuation ascribed to the remaining aerospace business. He said the deal undervalues aerospace division at roughly $80 a share. He believes it would be worth $115 apiece after stripping out $1.1 billion in expected losses. The company should wait until after the breakup before pursuing a deal as well because the shares were trading at a “heavily discounted valuation,” Loeb said.The projected free cash flows and synergies didn’t justify the need for the transaction, he said, adding that the combined company would also trade at a lower multiple than United Technologies would on its own.‘Irresponsible’ Deal“The merged entity will likely trade on a defense multiple when defense is out of favor and trade on an aerospace multiple when aerospace is out favor,” he said.He also called the timing of deal “irresponsible” and said it introduced unnecessary risk at a time when United Technologies is in the midst of integrating Rockwell Collins Inc. and splitting up the remaining parts of the company. He said he was worried that it may have already distracted from efforts to find a suitable partner for its Carrier unit.“We are concerned that execution will slip further as management becomes increasingly distracted,” he said.Loeb’s Third Point joins fellow activist Bill Ackman, who sent an email to Hayes when reports emerged about the deal in which he also questioned the strategic rationale. Ackman warned at the time he planned to oppose the deal, publicly if necessary, because it would be funded by a “highly dilutive” share issuance when the stock is already trading at a discount.Loeb said the Raytheon deal raised other issues at the company.“The merger proposal makes us increasingly uncomfortable with a management team that already has a poor track record. Under Mr. Hayes’ leadership and long tenure in the C-suite, most business units within UTC including Otis, Carrier, Pratt & Whitney, and Sikorsky have underachieved and trailed their peers in performance,” Loeb said.(Updates with United Technologies statement in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Third Point's Loeb Slams United Technologies-Raytheon Deal

2019-07-01,"The market doesn't seem to like the merger of equals that Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) presented on June 9. Shares initially popped on the news, but have come down as a host of interested parties have weighed in. RTN stock is off 4.5% since the announcement.Source: Shutterstock The deal has an estimated value of $166 billion. Raytheon shareholders are due to get 2.3348 shares of a new company for each of their shares. Combined, the units have $74 billion in revenue. This is already creating a ripple effect across the country as local reporters ask what it means for their economies. The combined company -- Raytheon Technologies -- will be based at Raytheon's suburban Boston offices.There has been some speculation that the merger, scheduled to close early in 2020, may not happen. The President is worried the merger could cut competition. The head of Air Force procurement has called it a security concern. Hedge fund managers Dan Loeb and Bill Ackman are questioning the deal's logic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Scuttle the Deal?The Air Force's primary acquisition executive, Will Roper, wasn't talking about scuttling the deal, however, just holding more frequent competitions in a bid to see more companies. Other aerospace companies were also trying to look on the bright side of the merger.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for a Dovish Fed Raytheon is best known for making missiles and the systems that find their targets. United Technologies' defense work is focused on avionics and airplane parts, including Pratt & Whitney engines. Much of UTC's work is done in Iowa, Raytheon in California and the Southeast U.S. There is little overlap between the product lines, which means the merger is likely to go through.  New CompetitorsWhen defense bureaucrats talk about &quot;new competitors,&quot; they're often dreaming of space weapons that might bring companies like Elon Musks's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to the party.SpaceX has been battling ULA, a joint venture of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), for Air Force launch contracts, including classified payloads. Blue Origin won a $500 million contract for rocket development last year.They may also be dreaming of companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which backed away from a drone contract last year after employees objected, but has recently been hedging on that. The Defense Department is also choosing between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a defense cloud. Monopoly PowerThe hope of the merger partners is that consolidations will create efficiencies. The hope of investors and analysts is that it will create monopoly pricing power.Companies that specialize in defense contracts, however, have been losing out lately to companies like Boeing, which do both military and civilian work.  * The Top 8 Tech Stocks of 2019 (So Far) The military budget has been quietly increased for five years now. It's now about $750 billion, levels achieved at the height of the Iraq War. While the Administration has been threatening war with Iran and Venezuela, it has yet to enter any new conflicts. But we're still in Afghanistan, and troops are still stationed in other hot spots around the world. Bottom Line on RTN StockThe deal is termed a merger of equals. It will be based at Raytheon's offices but Greg Hayes, United Technologies' CEO, will run it. UTC shareholders will have 57% of the new company. The merged entity will be the second-largest defense contractor after Boeing, passing Lockheed-Martin.War remains a very good business, an enormous source of jobs and a technology driver. The only risk in this deal is that peace breaks out. That seems unlikely.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Current holders of UTX stock need not panic, however, as the deal isn't slated to close until the first quarter of 2020.Nonetheless, United Technology stock holders might consider unloading some shares in anticipation of a rough landing, or at least setting a strict stop-loss 10% or even 5% below the current share price. While the two companies have touted the deal as a proverbial merger of equals, not everyone seems entirely comfortable with the formation of an aerospace-and-defense mega-company. Behold, the PushbackAmong the critics of the United Technologies-Raytheon deal is none other than President Trump, who has expressed concern that the merger could reduce competition and make it difficult for the government to negotiate defense contracts. Trump has been known to pillory companies and then forgive them soon afterward, but as a personal preference, I'm not a fan of holding shares of companies that are in the crosshairs of the U.S. government.  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 On the flip side is the government's ongoing need for defense-related services, which won't be slowing down anytime soon. Looking over the coming fiscal 2020 U.S. defense budget, we can see that the Senate has already passed a $750 billion defense authorization bill by a vote of 86 to 8. With the U.S. embroiled in a heated conflict with Iran and its allies, the defense bill is likely to pass and government spending in that sector should hold steady or increase in the near term at least.  Time to Play DefenseThis might not be enough to assuage concerned investors or prospective investors, though, as there's no shortage of criticism of the merger. One prominent example would be activist investor and Third Point CEO Daniel S. Loeb. Another would be Pershing Square Capital Management Founder and CEO Bill Ackman. They're both prominent UTX shareholders, and neither have been shy about voicing their strong disapproval of the merger.For his part, Loeb has uncategorically stated that Third Point won't support the merger &quot;in its current form and plans to vote against it.&quot; Moreover, he's described the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon as &quot;ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders.&quot;  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Ackman said that the merger &quot;makes no sense to us&quot; and that his firm &quot;cannot comprehend the strategic logic&quot; of the deal. The reasoning is complex, but to put it in a nutshell, the primary concern of these two hedge-fund managers -- and of concerned investors generally -- is that neither of the two companies will benefit from the proposed agreement in any appreciable way. Bottom Line on United Technologies StockI don't make it a policy to lean bearish on a name like United Technologies stock simply because a couple of famous financiers have expressed their concerns. Besides, given the political unrest happening in the world today, I'm decidedly bullish on the aerospace/defense market as a whole.Still, even if we assume that the proposed merger goes through without a hitch, it won't be the biggest company in its industry; Boeing (NYSE:BA) will still hold that title, at least in terms of annual revenue. Most importantly, I've been searching high and low for a solid rationale to justify this merger -- and as U2 front-man Bono once sang -- I still haven't found what I'm looking for.Therefore, I would steer clear of UTX stock for the time being at least; merger madness, powerful as it may be, need not affect our sanity.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-14,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hit an all-time high on Thursday, July 11, doubling down on Friday to end the week at 27,332. The rally came as Fed chief Jerome Powell made statements widely interpreted as supporting further interest rate cuts in the near-term. Regarding the economic situation, he said, “The bottom line is the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook and inflation continues to be muted, and those things are still in place.”With the Fed signaling lower rates ahead, investors naturally moved toward stocks. We’ve looked into TipRanks’ database to find three stocks that are leading the Dow’s gains, to drill down into specifics and find out if they still have room to grow in 2H19. Boeing Company (BA)Seems you can’t keep Boeing out of the news these days. The industrial giant, the world’s largest aerospace firm and the US’ largest manufacturing exporter, has had more than its share of bad headlines in recent months.It started with the crash, back in March, of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 airliner, with the deaths of all on board. It was the second crash of that model aircraft in less than five months, and on close investigation both accidents were attributed to the same flaw in the autopilot software. Airlines and industry regulators around the world reacted by grounding all operating 737 MAX 8 aircraft, globally. The result was both a business and public relations disaster for Boeing, as the company has struggled to reassure the public, build a fix for the software, and cope with a production line shutdown of its best-selling airliner model.But there is also good news. On the macro level, Boeing is one of just two major international manufacturers of commercial airliners, which limits the damage in lost customers. Also, despite some setbacks, Boeing is working on a viable fix for the for the software problem and predicting that the 737 MAX program will return to full production by the end of the year. The company has only had to close one production line. While the MAX 8 is the most popular model of Boeing’s most popular airliner, other 737 models remain in production, and the company’s wide-body airliners were not affected. And finally, with a market cap of $200 billion dollars, Boeing quite simply has the resources to weather this storm.Boeing’s investors can also take heart from the company’s stock performance since the March air crash. In the two trading sessions following the disaster, BA shares fell from $420 to $373, loss of 11%. But that has been the worst of the damage. BA stock has been essentially range-bound since then, with a high point of $393 and a low point of $337. Shares are currently priced at $365 and rising.Wall Street’s top analysts agree that Boeing has a clear path out of its current difficulties. From UBS, Myles Walton points to recent survey evidence that the traveling public is growing more willing to book seats on the 737 MAX. While acknowledging that consumer sentiment can be fickle, Walton sees this as evidence that the public will welcome the popular airliner’s return and justify the company’s continuing production. He gives BA a $500 price target, suggestive of a 36% upside.Vertical Research analyst Robert Stallard agrees that Boeing is a buy and that the 737 MAX will return to full production, although he sees that happening toward the end of the year. In a recent note, in which he gives the stock a $413 price target, Stallard says, “Boeing is having to do additional work on the MCAS software system… We had previously assumed a 6-month grounding in our Boeing estimates, taking the MAX out of action through to the end of 3Q19. We are now updating our numbers to factor in another quarter of grounding to the end of 4Q19…” Stallard’s price target indicates an upside potential of 13%.Finally, Cowen’s Cai Rumohr, an expert on the aerospace sector who has been following Boeing for over 10 years, has consistently maintained his ‘buy’ rating on BA since the March crash. Earlier this spring, Rumohr noted that Boeing had only had four net cancellations in the immediate aftermath of the groundings, evidence of the company’s fundamental strength. He has held steadfastly to his $460 price target on BA, believing that it will break out later this year. That price target suggests an upside of 25% for the stock.Boeing’s strong buy analyst consensus rating reflects the overall optimism and the company’s strong fundamentals. It’s significant to note that even the low-end price target, $367, is higher than the stock’s most recent close at $365. The average price target of $433 suggests that BA has a potential upside of 18%.View BA Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail United Technologies Corporation (UTX)United Technologies is another large-cap industrial standby, a major manufacturer in a variety of industries: HVAC, building systems, fire and security, elevators and escalators, and aerospace systems such as aircraft engines. UTX’s big news in recent months was the June 9 announcement that it has agreed with Raytheon to merge the two companies’ aerospace and defense segments into a new entity to be called Raytheon Technologies Corporation.Assuming approval of the merger, the new company will be the world’s second largest contractor in the aerospace and defense sector – after Boeing. And this brings us to an interesting point, underlining the different strengths that companies will show in the market. Where Boeing is generally perceived as a strong buy (see above), UTX is still seen as a moderate buy from the analyst consensus. But while the analysts’ optimism about Boeing is conditional on the 737 MAX restarting production in Q4, the outlook on UTX is showing strong improvement. Two five-star analysts have recently upgraded the stock from neutral to buy.The first upgrade, on June 10, came from Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Pointing to the Raytheon merger, Sullivan said it, “offers a compelling combination in defense as well as commercial aerospace business.” He specifically points out the proposed new company’s ventures in hypersonic and directed energy weapons as putting it “ahead of the curve” in defense industry trends. He believes the combination is sufficient to support a $165 price target for UTX. Sullivan’s target suggests an upside of 23% to the stock.The second, more recent, upgrade to UTX came on June 24 from Cai Rumohr, quoted above regarding Boeing. Rumohr notes that UTX dropped in the immediate aftermath of the announcement and has only now edged above its June 9 trading level. He says this puts UTX’s aerospace unit “at an inflection point,” with further gains possible if the merger is approved. He adds that, “the stock's relative weakness since the merger was announced suggests investors don't understand the benefits,” and describes UTX, at its current price, as a “win-win for attractive standalone valuation.” Rumohr puts a $150 price target on the stock, indicating room for a 12% upside.As mentioned, the analyst consensus on UTX is a moderate buy. This is based on 6 buys and 3 holds given in the past three months. Shares are selling for $133, and the average price target of $150 suggests an upside potential of 12%.View UTX Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)With Johnson & Johnson, we shift gears from industry and defense to pharmaceuticals and consumer products. JNJ is best known products like Band-Aids, Tylenol, and no-more-tears baby shampoo, but the company’s main revenue stream comes from is pharmaceutical line. To illustrate the difference in revenues between the segments, consumer/home health supports just under 17% of JNJ’s total revenues, while just two drugs – Remicade and Simponi – bring in over 11% of the total revenues by themselves.Whatever the base, Johnson & Johnson’s healthy revenues and reputation as a defensive stock that will outperform the market in a downturn keep it popular with investors. The company has shown a 24% return on equity over the trailing 12 months, along with positive trends in the 20- and 200-day moving averages. In the last quarterly report, JNJ beat the forecast by 3.3%, and in the coming report, to be released on July 16, is expected to show 15% year-over-year EPS growth.The analysts agree that JNJ is a stock with strong growth potential. Writing at the end of May, BMO’s Joanne Wuensch gave the stock a buy rating with a $157 price target, basing her outlook on an optimistic take regarding an opioid addiction case currently in litigation. Wuensch notes, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” She adds that Johnson & Johnson has offered a vigorous defense in the case, and adds that, having waived a jury trial in favor of a bench hearing, JNJ could look forward to the case’s completion by summer’s end, making it possible for the company to put the matter behind it fairly quickly. Her price target reflects her optimism, suggesting a 16% upside.Matt Miksic, of Credit Suisse, also weighed in on JNJ, initiating his coverage of the stock with a buy rating. He says the “key drivers” behind the stock are “continued growth in Immunology, driven by Stelera and Tremfya, sustainable growth in Oncology driven by Imbruvica, Darzelex and Erleada, and an attractive pipeline of filings in the 2019-2023 timeframe with greater than$1B potential each, and stable growth and cash flows in Consumer Health.” His price target, $156, like Weunsch’s, also indicates confidence in a 16% upside.Johnson & Johnson’s overall rating is almost identical to UTX’s. JNJ receives a moderate buy from the analyst consensus, based on 7 buys and 4 holds, with a current share price of $134 and an average price target of $150. The upside potential is 12%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailUse TipRanks’ database to find out what Wall Street’s top analysts are saying about the market’s leaders, to target your investments appropriately.",3 Dow Leaders with Double-Digit Upside

2019-07-18,"After a big rally, General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has stalled out. General Electric stock has traded sideways for about a four and half months now, staying mostly in a range between $9 and $10.25.Source: Shutterstock It's not terribly difficult to see why that is. After a long decline over the last few years - including two dividend cuts - investors and analysts don't entirely trust General Electric stock. To some, including InvestorPlace columnist Dana Blankenhorn, GE's debt and pension liabilities suggest years of pain ahead. To others, the long-awaited turnaround is at hand.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Increasingly, it seems like it will be GE Aviation that determines whether the bulls or bears will prove correct. That's not terribly surprising, of course: Aviation is GE's most profitable, and likely its most valuable, business. It generated roughly 60% of the company's segment-level profit last year, according to General Electric's 10-K filing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the gap between bulls' and bears' views of what Aviation truly is worth appears to be widening.  The issues at Boeing (NYSE:BA) add a dose of uncertainty to the debate. Skeptics and believers see the unit's performance at the recent Paris Air Show very differently. Indeed, they see the future of the unit very differently.Heading into the second half of 2019, with GE's Q2 earnings two weeks away, it seems likely that the continuing argument over GE stock is going to come down to GE Aviation. A Big Win for GE AviationOn its face, the Paris Air Show last month - the industry's biggest event - seems like a win for General Electric. GE Aviation and its joint venture booked a record combined $55 billion in orders, per a company press release. That was up from $31 billion the year before.Obviously, that $55 billion isn't turning into revenue in 2020  or even necessarily by 2025. But with commercial aircraft demand still strong, it suggests that GE Aviation at worst is keeping pace with competing engine builders. That notably includes United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney, which has taken market share in recent years.Meanwhile, the merger of UTX and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) potentially creates a more formidable competitor on the defense/military side as well. And the delays of GE's new GE9x turbine engine hampered Boeing's launch of its 777x. After that news, and with its competition improving, GE Aviation needed a strong showing - and got it.Right? General Electric Stock Stays StuckPerhaps. But GE stock bears weren't so sure  and apparently, neither were investors. Even as stock markets raced to all-time highs, the lid stayed on GE stock.And two noted skeptics cast doubt on the headline. Stephen Tusa, who has been a prescient bear on GE stock for years now, went as far as to call the order figure &quot;a smoke screen.&quot; He argued that new engines - including the GE9x and the LEAP, the latter of which is manufactured in a joint venture with Safran SA (OTCMKTS:SAFRY) - might not be as profitable as GE's past models.John Inch of Gordon Haskett seemed to agree. Both analysts argued that the unit's 2018 earnings - and remember, 2018 was a disastrous year for GE as a whole - were likely above its long-term averages. As a result, Tusa argued that GE Aviation was worth potentially less than $40 billion, with Inch citing a $50 billion ceiling.Of course, as Barron's noted, other analysts saw it differently. Both Citigroup  and Barclays  saw the order growth as impressive. Those analysts are among the bulls who value GE Aviation in the range of $80 billion -$100 billion.Those differing valuations have an enormous impact on GE stock. What Aviation Means for GE StockWhat seems to be a $30 billion-$60 billion discrepancy on Aviation's valuation leads to very different views on GE stock. On its own, that range suggests a $3.40-$6.80 per share impact to a &quot;sum of the parts&quot; model.But that's not the only impact. Again, GE has a huge amount of debt. A stronger Aviation business will produce more cash flow that can be used to pay down that debt. It also gives GE more ways to raise money; a spin-off or partial sale of the unit can be used to raise capital, for instance.A weaker Aviation business, however, leaves GE in something close to trouble. The Power business still is a mess. GE Healthcare's profits are coming down after the company sold GE Biopharma to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21 billion. Aviation matters not just in terms of paper valuation; it has to drive much of the growth and cash flow that GE needs to create.The importance of Aviation can be seen in the relative price targets of the four analysts, as Barron's pointed out. Tusa and Inch value General Electric stock at $5 and $7, respectively. Barclays sees GE stock getting to $13, and Citigroup  estimates that GE stock is worth $14 per share. On the SidelinesA weaker Aviation business would be bad news for GE stock. I argued last year in a detailed analysis that GE, in a breakup, likely was worth at most $14-$16 per share. Including the costs of a breakup, its value is something closer to $9-$11. That was based on an estimated valuation of Aviation, using its 2017 results, of nearly $100 billion.Not all that much has changed since then, though the arrival of new CEO Larry Culp has sparked optimism towards the company's future. But if Aviation &quot;really&quot; is a $50 billion or a $70 billion business, it gets tougher to argue that GE stock can rise. And given that I'm skeptical that the 737 MAX issues - which already are expected to hit GE's cash flow by $200-$300 million - will be resolved soon, I'm not expecting investors' sentiment towards the unit to improve much as the year goes on.As I've written before, I'm rooting for GE stock. It's an iconic American company, and I'd love for long-suffering shareholders to see a rebound.But its problems are real. Its current collection of businesses isn't all that attractive anymore. General Electric stock needs Aviation to be a big winner - and if there are any signs at all that it won't be, it gets very difficult to pound the table for GE stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-19,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. government officials in 2014 revealed an alarming safety issue: Passenger mobile phones and other types of radio signals could pose a crash threat to some models of Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes.More than 1,300 jets registered in the U.S. were equipped with cockpit screens vulnerable to interference from Wi-Fi, mobile phones and even outside frequencies such as weather radar, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which gave airlines until November 2019 to replace the units made by Honeywell International Inc. Honeywell estimates that 70 or fewer planes with cockpit screens in need of repair are still flying.Flight-critical data including airspeed, altitude and navigation could disappear and “result in loss of airplane control at an altitude insufficient for recovery,” the FAA said in its 2014 safety bulletin, known as an airworthiness directive.A Honeywell spokeswoman said there have been no reports of display units blanking in-flight due to high-intensity radio frequency/Wi-Fi interference. Airlines and Honeywell have argued that radio signals were unlikely to cause safety problems during flight. The FAA, however, concluded there were safety risks based on assessments it had received from a vendor and an operator.Boeing Co. found the interference in a laboratory test in 2012 and hasn’t seen similar issues on other aircraft, a company spokesman said. Honeywell is aware of only one case where all six display units in a 737 cockpit went blank, company spokeswoman Nina Krauss said. The cause was a software problem, unrelated to Wi-Fi or cellphones, that has been fixed and is currently being flight-tested, she said.The affected 737s are the so-called Next Generation model, a predecessor of the Boeing Max, which was involved in two crashes in less than five months. Cockpit displays on the Max were made by Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., not Honeywell. Boeing’s 777s also were covered by the FAA order.The FAA order didn’t quantify the amount of radio signals needed to cause interference problems. An agency spokesman said Thursday that the FAA bases the compliance time for its airworthiness directives on the risk that a condition poses. “A 60-month compliance time frame means the risk is low, and does not need to be addressed right away,” he said.Still, the radio-signal threat extends beyond that specific display system and FAA warning.Numerous mobile phones left on during any airplane flight “could be a real problem,” said professor Tim Wilson, department chair for electrical, computer, software and systems engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The greater the number of phones emitting radio signals, he said, the greater the potential for interference with a plane’s flight system.Airplane ModeMany airlines now permit passengers to turn their phones to “airplane mode,” which allows Wi-Fi transmissions. But mobile phones operate at higher power levels, Wilson said, since the signals must reach a cell tower and not just a local antenna or router. “So cellular service is potentially more impactful,” he added.The FAA in 2013 began the process of allowing wider use of electronic devices on planes, provided airlines could demonstrate it was safe. That prompted an outcry from consumer groups concerned about passengers being subjected to the mobile phone conversations of seatmates.No U.S. airlines allowed it and, in 2018, Congress barred the use of mobile phones for calls during flights.Honeywell says that 70 or fewer planes with affected display screens require repair. That may leave a lot of screens unaccounted for.A plane generally has six display screens. Back in 2014 Honeywell told the FAA that 10,100 display units -- or the equivalent of nearly 1,700 planes -- were affected worldwide. When asked this week about the progress of the fixes, Honeywell’s Krauss said that 8,000 of those screens were replaced and fewer than 400 components, or the equivalent of about 70 planes, still need to be fixed. That still leaves 1,700 units, or the equivalent of about 280 planes, unaccounted for out of the 2014 figure.Honeywell says its calculation of 70 or fewer assumes that some airlines might have had the work performed at non-Honeywell facilities, and regulators in other regions of the world might not have ordered the units replaced. In addition, some planes might have been taken out of service due to age. The actual number of planes operating with faulty components couldn’t be determined by Bloomberg.Krauss said that “even if a blanking incident were to occur,” the units are backed up by multiple redundancies.Both Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have completed their overhauls, according to the companies. American Airlines Group Inc. has 14 more jets that need refurbished units, and United Airlines still needs to replace components across 17 aircraft, representatives from those companies said.Ryanair Holdings Plc, the large Irish-based discount carrier, told the FAA in 2014 that its planes held 707 of the affected Honeywell units and argued at the time that changing out all of them “is imposing a high, and unnecessary, financial burden on operators.” A Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline hasn’t upgraded all 707 screens but that the carrier inspected all of its display units and “any affected DUs have been replaced.”(Corrects story first published on July 18 to clarify in the second and 13th-15th paragraphs the estimated number of planes still flying with affected display screens; rephrase Honeywell’s comment and clarify the FAA’s conclusions in the fourth paragraph; and provide more details on the cause of a blanking incident in the fifth paragraph.

2019-07-22,"Broadly speaking, stocks were somewhat listless Monday as traders await an absolute avalanche of marquee earnings reports this week.Source: Shutterstock The Nasdaq Composite was the leader among the major U.S. equity benchmarks to start the week, adding 0.71% while the S&P 500 gained 0.28%. Sapped by one of the largest members of the index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, finishing higher by just 0.07%.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio When the closing bell rang, just over half the Dow's 30 components were in the green for the day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Bad BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA), the largest member of the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and a company that reports earnings later this week, was dinged Monday, falling 1.07% after Fitch Ratings trimmed its outlook on the aerospace company to &quot;negative&quot; from &quot;stable.&quot; Fitch cited regulatory uncertainty stemming from the grounding of the 737 MAX passenger jet, but the ratings agency is sticking with an &quot;A&quot; credit rating on Boeing.&quot;The MAX situation also presents significant public relations challenges, and the impact on Boeing's reputation and brand will be a watch item for the next year or more,&quot; said Fitch.Boeing reports second-quarter results Wednesday before the open of U.S. markets with analysts forecasting a profit of $1.89 a share, down from $3.33 a year earlier. More Earnings: UTX and KOSticking with the industrial sector for a moment, shares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) added 0.44% today in advance of the company's Tuesday pre-market second-quarter earnings report. Wall Street expects UTX to post earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $19.6 billion.The stock is inexpensive compared to other large-cap aerospace names, but that probably isn't enough for investors over the near-term. United Technologies' earnings call is likely to revolved around the company's effort to merge with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), one that has been met with some push back on Wall Street.Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) traded slightly lower today ahead of its Tuesday morning earnings report. The shares are up a market-lagging 8.56% year-to-date, indicating the beverage giant better put some fizz in that earnings report and guidance.

Just one rates it at Sell. The average analyst price target is $52.48,&quot; reports Barron's. Dow Jones WinnersApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the best-performing names in the Dow today, adding 2.29% amid some bullish analyst chatter.

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Esper was confirmed by the Senate to be President Donald Trump’s new secretary of defense, ending a seven-month vacancy in the position as the U.S. navigates through key foreign policies crises with Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan.Esper won overwhelming bipartisan support in the 90-8 vote on Tuesday. He was sworn in hours later at the White House.Esper’s confirmation adds some stability to Trump’s national security team, which has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader at the Pentagon since Jim Mattis quit in December in response to the president’s announcement that he’d withdraw troops from Syria. Since then there have been two acting secretaries: Patrick Shanahan, who withdrew from consideration for the permanent job, and Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.A 55-year-old West Point graduate, Esper was previously secretary of the Army and is a former top lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon Co. He had been serving as acting Pentagon chief following Shanahan’s departure.The administration still lacks a confirmed ambassador to the United Nations and the Senate is considering the nominations to replace the current head and deputy head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president’s top military advisers.Iran, ChinaEsper steps into the top Pentagon job with a long list of crises on his plate. Tensions with Iran are soaring following a spate of attacks on cargo ships, the downing of an American drone and Tehran’s seizure of a British oil tanker. Turkey has begun receiving components of a Russian missile defense system that has prompted the U.S. to expel the NATO ally from the F-35 fighter jet program.He will also be steering U.S. defense strategy as it shifts to confront China and Russia as the department’s main challenges. China, with the world’s second-largest economy, is making major investments in military capabilities to challenge America’s dominance in the Asia-Pacific while Russia is expanding its influence in the Middle East.Esper will have to manage “an increasingly aggressive and successful Russia, increasing animus with China” and tensions among NATO members, particularly Turkey, said Paul Sullivan, an international security expert at the National Defense University. Esper will also be pressured to manage the department’s relationship with Trump, who “is hard on his staff,” Sullivan said. “It is difficult to judge how well this will go” but Esper needs to “carve out his own space very soon,” he added.Esper’s ChallengeThe top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee this month said that it was a matter of urgency to get Esper’s nomination through.Some Democrats expressed concern about whether Esper would stand up to the president. Saying that Trump’s “temperament and management skills are challenging,” Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island said Esper would need to be “willing and able to provide the president with your best policy advice even if the president disagrees.”Among the Democratic senators voting against Esper’s confirmation were presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand.Warren voiced opposition to Esper’s nomination after he declined to recuse himself, without exception, from all potential decisions involving Raytheon, the No. 3 defense contractor. United Technologies Corp. has agreed to buy Raytheon, forming an aerospace and defense giant with $74 billion in sales in one of the industry’s biggest transactions ever. Warren told Esper that his refusal to recuse himself in all circumstances “smacks of corruption.”“Secretary Esper has real conflicts of interest with Raytheon that he is unwilling to remedy by taking simple, reasonable steps,” she said July 16 opposing his nomination. “Until he is willing to make these commitments, he should not be confirmed as the Secretary of Defense, and I oppose his nomination.”Esper will receive $1 million to $5 million in deferred compensation from Raytheon starting in 2022, reflecting the broad ranges that officials must disclose for the value of their assets, according to his financial disclosure statement.Esper and his team have repeatedly said he will follow his signed ethics agreement, all applicable laws and the president’s Ethics Pledge. He’s said any Raytheon issues will be screened before coming to his desk and will be referred whenever possible to another official. In a July 19 letter to Warren, he added that he’s agreed to recuse himself from issues involving the Raytheon-United Technologies merger “even if the law would allow me to participate in discussions or decisions” about the transaction.Trump didn’t formally nominate Esper until the eve of last week’s hearing because a federal law required the nominee to step down from his position as acting secretary. That role was filled by Spencer, who is now expected to serve temporarily as the acting deputy secretary of defense. Trump on Tuesday said he’s nominating David Norquist for that post.(Updates with swearing in ceremony in second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Travis Tritten, Josh Wingrove and Laura Litvan.To contact the reporters on this story: Glen Carey in Washington at gcarey8@bloomberg.net;Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Larry LiebertFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Esper Confirmed as Trump’s First Pentagon Chief Since December

2019-07-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As investors pore over every earnings report for the very latest read on the economy, Caterpillar Inc. provided fresh evidence that the slowdown in manufacturing is no blip. The maker of bulldozers and mining machinery said Wednesday that its 2019 earnings would fall on the low end of its guidance range, snapping a streak of quarterly boosts to its outlook. Caterpillar’s pain points were similar to those that have routinely popped up in industrial companies’ results so far this second quarter: rising manufacturing costs, moderating demand and weakening confidence in the prospects for a second-half rebound. After a bizarre Tuesday turn in trading, when industrial companies including Pentair Plc and Sherwin-Williams Co. got resoundingly rewarded for cuts to their sales guidance, the glum outlook from an economic bellwether like Caterpillar seems to have shaken the market out of its reverie.  Shares of Caterpillar slumped about 5% in early trading.Caterpillar continues to expect a modest sales increase in 2019, but that assumes oil and gas markets recover toward the end of the year, and that dealers work through inventory buildups and are able to accept the price increases the company is banking on to offset increased costs. Those assumptions seem tenuous.Dealers’ inventories of machines and engines climbed by $500 million in the second quarter, compared with a $100 million rise in the year-earlier period. But Caterpillar’s backlog slumped by about $1.9 billion relative to the first quarter, implying a softer demand environment. Meanwhile, sales of oil and gas equipment in North America declined in the second quarter, in part because of weaker demand in the Permian Basin. Halliburton Co. earlier this week announced an 8% cut to its North American workforce and said it would park unused fracking equipment rather than chase after market share. The oilfield services provider echoed Schlumberger Ltd.’s expectations for further sluggishness in the region in the second half of the year, even as international markets deliver robust growth. It’s also worth noting that the competitive pricing pressure in Asia that so spooked Caterpillar investors in the first quarter isn’t fading away. Sales of construction products slumped 22% in the region in the second quarter.Caterpillar’s results came as IHS Markit’s euro-area manufacturing gauge signaled the steepest contraction in more than six years and Germany’s factory Purchasing Manager’s Index fell to the lowest level in seven years. A gauge of U.S. factories showed activity is hovering on the borderline between expansion and contraction in the lowest reading since 2009. The slowdown in this sector appears to be deepening and I remain skeptical that a quarter-point cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve would be enough to motivate the kind of investment surge that could reverse that trend.Elsewhere in industrials, aerospace has remained a haven this earnings season, with strong organic sales growth in the Honeywell International Inc. and United Technologies Corp.’s units that sell engines and aircraft parts. But it’s worth noting that Boeing Co.’s backlog is shrinking. The planemaker  also reported results on Wednesday, and said its commercial backlog included more than 5,500 airplanes valued at $390 billion, down from more than 5,600 planes valued at $399 billion at the end of the first quarter. That’s likely at least in part a reflection of the fact that the embattled 737 Max is now in the fifth month of a global grounding following two fatal crashes. But should aerospace start to wobble, then we’re really in trouble.  To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-08-06,Activist investor Bill Ackman has exited his position in United Technologies stock. The move could be another sign that United’s planned merger with Raytheon will likely proceed on schedule.,Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Exits Stake in United Technologies Stock. What It Means for the Raytheon Deal.
2019-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has liquidated its positions in United Technologies Corp. and Automatic Data Processing Inc. as the firm builds up its cash reserves for new investments.Ackman has decided to sell his stake in industrial company United Technologies rather than fight its takeover of defense contractor Raytheon Co., according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. He had vowed to oppose that deal in June, saying it lacked strategic sense.Ackman has exited payroll processor ADP -- the last company where he waged a proxy fight -- because much of the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, he said in a letter Monday to co-investors in a special purpose vehicle set up to invest in the company. A copy of the letter was obtained by Bloomberg News.ADP’s shares rose as much as 2% Tuesday and were trading at $162.66 at 11:32 a.m. in New York. United Technologies’ shares were up 0.6% to $126.46.The billionaire investor will use the proceeds from the sales in the companies for other opportunities. He already has a new position. The hedge fund’s publicly traded affiliate Pershing Square Holdings Ltd. has made a new, undisclosed investment that amounted to 12% of its net asset value, the firm said in a statement Monday, confirming a Bloomberg News report. As of July 31, Pershing Square Holdings’ total assets under management amounted to $5.6 billion, according to its website, meaning its stake in the new investment would amount to at least $672 million. It did not detail how much of the new investment was held by its private funds, which could increase the value of the stake.Separately, the firm raised $400 million issuing debt last month.Representatives for United Technologies and ADP didn’t respond to requests for comment.Ackman disclosed an 8.3% stake in ADP in 2017 and sought to replace three board directors in a proxy contest at the company. ADP shareholders rejected his proposal.It was still a successful investment, returning about 50% for Pershing Square’s co-investors, according to Ackman’s letter. Pershing Square acquired its ADP stake for its co-investors i at an average cost of $114.76 a share and exited on July 31 when its share closed at roughly $167 a piece, according to the letter.Ackman took credit in the letter for at least part of those gains by shining a spotlight on the company’s growth potential and spurring on management to improve its operations.“Our activism bore significant fruit,” he said. “As a direct result of our activism, ADP made commitments to accelerate revenue growth, bolster its competitive position in the enterprise market, and improve efficiency and margins.”ADP was Ackman’s last high-profile proxy fight. After several setbacks in the previous years, including his losing bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. and Herbalife Ltd., Ackman was forced to rethink his approach following a flurry of investor redemptions.Since then, Ackman has stepped back from the limelight and put a renewed focus on his investment strategy. Pershing Square’s investments have returned roughly 50% this year through July 31, according to its website.At the same time, his once-troubled investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has turned around, with its shares hitting a record high last month under the stewardship of its new chief executive officer, Brian Niccol.(Updates shares in fourth paragraph; adds Pershing Square statement in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Richard Clough.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew MonksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Ackman Exits Positions in United Techologies and ADP

2019-08-25,"Hedge funds have just released their portfolio trades for the second quarter. And now is the time to evaluate these trades for valuable investing insights. Here we focus on one particular aspect of hedge fund activity- new stock additions. That’s using an August 19 report from RBC Capital which analyzes the 2Q19 13f forms of 363 major hedge funds with significant stakes in US equities (single stocks). The firm used this data to pinpoint the top stocks where hedge fund ownership rose the most during 2Q19, in terms of the net number of funds that added new positions.Three names fall in Health Care (including the 1 name- Allergan (AGN)). Another three names fall in Industrials, notes the firm. But there is one key stock worth bearing in mind: “Note that UBER (UBER) does not qualify for this screen as it does not fall in the S&P 500 and it began trading mid way through the 2nd quarter. It was owned by 51 hedge funds at the end of 2Q19” points out the firm.With that being said, let’s take a closer look at five top new stocks hedge funds are making a bet on right now: 1&#92;. Align Technology (ALGN)Align Technology is leading an orthodontics revolution. The company invented the Invisalign- a clear teeth aligner system- that can replace traditional braces. In Q2, 14 new funds bought Align shares- bringing the total value of ALGN shares owned by hedge funds to $1,805 million. Unfortunately however the stock has declined in both Q2 and Q3. Despite strong Q2 earnings results, the company’s guidance left investors disappointed. &quot;Given the uncertainty in China,&quot; CEO Joe Hogan commented, &quot;our outlook for the third quarter reflects a more cautious view for growth in the Asia Pacific region.&quot;Don’t be disheartened, says Piper Jaffray’s Matthew O’Brien. This five-star analyst has just reiterated his ALGN buy rating with a $240 price target (37% upside potential). Align &quot;has much better products that will win in the marketplace&quot; he tells investors. O’Brien believes that an accelerated stock repurchase plan of $200 million demonstrates confidence in Align’s outlook.Overall, ALGN shows a Moderate Buy analyst consensus, with an average price target of $259. Interestingly if we look at only the best-performing analysts, this consensus shifts to Strong Buy.   2&#92;. Qualcomm (QCOM)Chip titan Qualcomm is an intriguing hedge fund pick. In the second quarter, 20 more funds owned QCOM stock vs the first quarter. As a result, 15% of the funds covered in RBC Capital’s study now own Qualcomm. Their total holding works out at $1,682 million.Despite numerous problems- most obviously the May 21 antitrust ruling - some analysts do see a bright future ahead. That’s thanks to the company’s prime 5G position. “We believe Qualcomm's bull case is unchanged, with global 5G roll outs expected to increase both royalty income and demand for semiconductors beginning in 2020,” Merrill Lynch’s Tal Liani said recently. “Press reports suggest that all of Apple's 2020 iPhones will contain Qualcomm's 5G chipset, which could drive a 5G cycle across the entire industry.” The analyst has just reiterated his QCOM buy rating and $100 price target (36% upside potential). No doubt hedge funds are also relieved to hear that Qualcomm has just won a critical partial stay from The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The company won’t have to grant patent licenses to rivals and can still require patent licenses for customers to buy chips while its appeal is ongoing. According to Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg, the company still believes “the district court decision will be overturned once the merits of our appeal have been considered.” In total, QCOM scores a Moderate Buy Street consensus with a $78 average price target.  3&#92;. Hologic (HOLX)Medical tech stock Hologic focuses primarily on women’s health and beauty; it sells medical devices for surgery and medical imaging. During Q2, 14 funds initiated positions in HOLX. RBC Capital reveals that funds now own a total of $748 million in Hologic stock. Of course, Hologic has a history when it comes to hedge funds. Back in 2013, hedge fund activist Carl Icahn swooped in with a 12.63% stake. Three years later he cashed in on what proved to be a successful intervention. “Yesterday our designees resigned from the [Hologic] board because the situation no longer calls for activism,” Icahn wrote on Twitter at the time. “Hologic is the quintessential example of activism at its best. We commend [Hologic chief executive] Steve MacMillan for a job well done.”Looking ahead, analysts are divided over HOLX’s outlook. Five analysts currently rate the stock a buy, while four analysts are staying on the sidelines. “Hologic is gradually executing over the course of this year as its breast health and molecular diagnostics businesses pace its growth, but are offset by slower growth or declining segments” states Canaccord Genuity’s Mark Massaro. This Top 50 analyst reiterated his hold rating on Hologic on August 1, but ramped up the price target from $49 to $52 (8% upside potential). “Near mid-single-digit growth and effective capital allocation (buybacks and tuck-in deals) are warming us up to the stock as HOLX delivered a 2% top-line beat, 2 cent bottom-line beat, and raised its FY top- and bottom-line guide” he explained. 4&#92;. United Technologies Corp (UTX)Like the previous two stocks, United Technologies Corp saw the addition of 14 new funds in Q2. This aerospace and defense stock now features in 16% of the portfolios scanned by RBC Capital. And the total hedge fund holding is valued at $4,552 million.Encouragingly, analysts are positive on UTX right now. The stock boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus, and a price target that indicates 23% upside from current levels. Indeed, both Vertical Research and Seaport Global upgraded United Technologies from Hold to Buy in the last couple of months.The analysts made their calls after the news of a proposed $120 billion merger between UTX and Raytheon (RTN) sent shares plummeting. The deal, which is set to close in the first half of the year, is currently undergoing an investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division. According to Vertical Research analyst Jeffrey Sprague the stock’s weakness created an attractive buying opportunity.More recently, five-star Cowen & Co analyst Cai Rumohr reiterated his UTX buy rating and $150 price target. Turning the cash flow corner, enthused Rumohr following Q2 earnings. “Q2's EPS/cash flow beat suggests cash consuming build in new aerospace programs is starting to reverse with a likely multi-year ramp in standalone CFPS [cash flow per share]. And the proposed RTN merger would accelerate cash deployment potential” summed up the analyst.  5&#92;. Roper Technologies (ROP) Roper Technologies is a diversified industrial company that produces engineered products for global niche markets. That includes everything from creative software technologies for visual effects and 3D content, to safety valves and radiotherapy solutions. Thirteen hedge funds started new positions in Roper during Q2, says RBC Capital.Indeed, the firm’s own Deane Dray shares this bullish outlook on Roper stock. He recently reiterated his buy rating while bumping up the price target from $391 to $393 (13% upside potential). “Outperform-rated Roper’s modest 2Q19 beat featured its typical high quality of earnings” Dray wrote post-earnings. However, the analyst added that there was a pang of disappointment with the disclosure that expected 2H19 slowing in short- cycle industrial businesses (8% of revenues) could pose a -10c headwind. Ultimately, though, Roper remains “indisputably one of the highest-quality names within the Multi-Industry sector.” It leads the pack in EBIT margin and free cash flow conversion thanks to its portfolio of low- capital-intensity and profitable SaaS and network businesses, he tells investors. Currently five analysts rate ROP a buy, with only 1 analyst calling the stock a hold- giving it a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $399 suggesting shares can climb 15% in the coming months.

2019-09-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ever since humans first rode in an elevator more than a century ago we’ve been afraid of getting stuck in one (or worse). The related requirement that these modern marvels are serviced and upgraded regularly is pretty handy for industry leaders Otis, Kone Oyj, Schindler and Thyssenkrupp AG. The companies generate about half their elevator revenues this way, as opposed to the lower-margin sales of original equipment.In good years Otis and Kone have achieved an operating return on sales in excess of 14%. That’s decent for the industrial sector, although a competitive Chinese market has made things more difficult lately.Tough safety regulations and the need to support big teams of technicians are a natural defense against new competitors. The four companies I mentioned have locked up more than 60 percent of the elevator market. Three of them are European.(1)The decent profitability and oligopolistic industry structure are big attractions for would-be acquirers of Thyssenkrupp’s elevator unit, which the German conglomerate has put up for sale. But the big four’s dominance won’t have gone unnoticed by antitrust officials, who could play a central role in determining how any further consolidation plays out.Depending on the bidder, any political desire to build a European elevator champion may run into resistance from those who fear entrenching the power of already dominant companies (as happened when Germany’s Siemens AG and France’s Alstom SA tried to merge their rail businesses).Thyssenkrupp isn’t the only active player in the industry. United Technologies Corp.’s move to spin out its Otis elevator unit has triggered speculation that the U.S. manufacturer might also get involved in M&A. Last week, Switzerland’s Schindler denied a report that it had been targeted by its American rival. Finland’s Kone, meanwhile, is open about wanting to buy the Thyssenkrupp business, telling the Handelsblatt newspaper last week that the two companies would be “a perfect fit.”Combining Kone and the Thyssenkrupp unit would create an industry behemoth with more than 16 billion euros ($17.7 billion) of sales. Though weaker than Kone’s, Thyssenkrupp’s elevator earnings have tended to far outstrip what the unwieldy German conglomerate makes from its other businesses. Its future should be bright too.Urbanization, aging populations and more single-person households are all spurring the construction of denser, taller residential buildings, especially in Asia. China accounts for more than 60% of the world’s new elevator installations.It’s reasonable to think the Thyssenkrupp elevator business would be worth about 15 billion euros if carved out – double the value investors ascribe to the whole conglomerate today. Add a premium for potential synergies and the value could rise further. Kone and Thyssenkrupp would complement each other well: the former is stronger in China while the latter has a bigger U.S. business. And the potential procurement, research and labor force savings from a merger would surely beat any earnings improvements that a private equity buyer could deliver by itself.The big question is whether antitrust officials would agree to two of the big four elevator firms merging? It’s barely a decade since the European Union smacked the companies with almost 1 billion euros in fines for running a price-fixing cartel in several countries. Company employees rigged bids involving hospitals, the European Commision noted. Hardly a good precedent.Thyssenkrupp is burning cash and its stock has fallen more than 35% in the past year. It can ill afford to get involved in another protracted and ultimately unsuccessful antitrust review. Earlier this year Brussels blocked an attempt to combine its European steel operations with Tata Steel. Kone could sell certain assets to ease competition concerns.

2019-09-11,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) finally looked to be out of the woods. GE stock bounced nicely earlier this year, and the company appeared to be turning things around. But a short seller has put GE stock back in the center of controversy once again. Harry Markopolos, famous for helping expose Bernie Madoff down, has sought out his next big target: General Electric.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Markopolos dropped a 175-page report alleging all sorts of fraud and misrepresentations at GE. As a result, traders immediately dumped GE stock, though it quickly recovered much of its losses. Various analysts, including other short sellers, pointed out errors and hasty thinking in Markopolos' report. Still, many traders are operating under the thinking that where there's smoke there may be fire. GE stock has yet to reclaim the $10 per share mark following Markopolos' negative analysis of the firm.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season  Reasons For SkepticismAs InvestorPlace's James Brumley noted, there are many reasons to question the Markopolos report. For one, various folks ranging from bank analysts to fellow short sellers and even an ex-SEC chairman have suggested there were &quot;suspicious&quot; things about his work. Bronte Capital's fund manager John Hempton slammed the report as &quot;utterly misleading&quot; and &quot;flat-out silly&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile Markopolos deservedly earned his reputation with the Bernie Madoff investigation, it's far different going after a public company. It's one thing to expose a total ponzi scheme. But with GE, Markopolos is going after nuanced accounting things such as assumptions on long-term insurance policies where accountants can disagree.Look at something like Brighthouse Financial (NYSE:BHF) where the famed David Einhorn is long, short sellers are on the other side, and they are having a healthy debate around the value of its long-term insurance policies.Markopolos, by contrast, is running around screaming fraud while discussing complicated details.Why is Markopolos taking such a direct approach? He seems to be going for a financial reward. Markopolos is angling to earn money from an SEC whistleblower program along with working with a hedge fund that profits if the GE stock price goes down. These reasons would give Markopolos motivation to play up the incendiary language in his allegations. There Are Valid ConcernsWhile I'm skeptical about the Markopolos report and its intentions, there are some points the bears have latched onto that are worthy of further consideration. For example, GE has negative working capital -- and a lot of it. The figure pencils out around $10 to $20 billion depending on what all you count.What's this mean? General Electric owes more in short-term liabilities than it has in short-term assets. This can be a good thing. For example, think of a subscription business, where people pay you before you deliver a service to them. In the case of an industrial firm like GE, however, a large negative working capital position could mean the company is in weaker financial position than you'd think from a quick glance at its credit rating.In addition to the negative working capital point, analysts concede that Markopolos has some valid concerns on other things such as valuation marks on some divisions and how the value of long-term insurance contracts are calculated. But there's little evidence of anything close to outright fraud. It's Dangerous to Bet Against Larry CulpOne of the weirder things about calling GE a massive fraud is its management team. General Electric already cleaned the deck of its old team and brought in Larry Culp. For those unfamiliar, Culp was the longtime head of industrial powerhouse Danaher (NYSE:DHR). During Culp's tenure, Danaher stock appreciated roughly 500%. Culp is clearly a skilled leader, and there was no evidence of any wrongdoing in his previous highly-successful company.Once Markopolos leveled his charges against GE, Culp stepped in and bought GE stock aggressively. Culp said the allegations are baseless and defended the company with the strongest currency possible, his own money. In fact, Culp invested more in GE stock following the fraud claims than he invested in Danaher during his triumphant run at that firm. That's how much conviction Culp has that Markopolos is shooting blanks.Does a great leader guarantee that GE will succeed? Of course not. Sometimes even the greatest management teams face insurmountable challenges. And General Electric is admittedly in a pretty difficult situation. But in Culp, you have an honest and proven leader. GE Stock VerdictIf you're looking for a safe industrial stock to buy, don't pick GE. GE just announced its measly one cent quarterly dividend payment last week. That's a stark reminder of how far GE has fallen from when it was one of America's most respected blue chip holdings. If you want a safe reliable holding, something like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is a better bet.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But if you are willing to speculate on a turnaround with a decent shot at success, GE is interesting. This Markopolos report could be a blessing in disguise, as it has aired some pointed questions about GE's accounting and offered investors a lot more transparency into the firm. As folks get more comfortable with Culp's vision for an improved General Electric, shares could rally nicely in coming quarters.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned UTX and BHF stock.

2019-09-16,"Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) had enjoyed a strong 2019. The stock bottomed out in December just below $6.50, before General Electric stock rallied more than 75% to $11.27 in February.Source: Carsten Reisinger / Shutterstock.com Since then though, GE stock has been consolidating in a mostly sideways pattern. However, that sideways pattern is starting to develop into a rather negative look. That's even as General Electric stock has remained well-above its December lows.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now It has got investors wondering if there's been a &quot;change in tune&quot; with GE stock and if the sideways action will result in dead money -- or worse, losses -- rather than resolve higher. Before diving into the company, let's look at the technicals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trading General Electric StockWe have been covering General Electric stock here on InvestorPlace for quite some time. It's no wonder, given its former place among America's blue-chip companies. That's no longer the case, even among its own industry. Names like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all considered superior entities.In any regard, we kept such a close eye on GE stock because of its tight trading range. Specifically, we continued to highlight range support at $9 and range resistance near $10.50. The latter elevated itself to around $10.70 in June and July, but we've seen a drastic shift in sentiment since.  Click to EnlargeInterestingly enough, those range levels have now doubled in significance, as it highlights two key Fibonacci retracements. The 38.2% retracement sits up at $10.60, while the 61.8% rests at $8.99.The question now is, can GE stock reclaim former range support and the 61.8% near $9?Last month, General Electric stock traded down to support and gapped below it, plunging to $7.65. On the subsequent retest though, this former support level acted as resistance, as GE again pulled back to sub-$8 levels. That's where the &quot;change in tune&quot; reference comes in.Now just under $9 again, bulls need to make a strong showing. If General Electric stock can reclaim the $9 level, it puts the 200-day moving average at $9.25 and the 50-day moving average at about $9.50 on the table.GE stock will need to reclaim those two key moving averages in order to get back to range resistance near $10.60.If $9 acts as resistance, August support at $8 is a possibility. Below that and the August lows, and sub-$7 is on the table. Key Analyst Will Move GE StockA key catalyst for General Electric stock has been JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa.Tusa upgraded GE from underweight to neutral in December, sparking an enormous rally. To be clear, he wasn't bullish, just less bearish given that the stock had gone from $30 to $7 in a relatively short period of time.Throughout the past few quarters -- through earnings and investor presentations -- Tusa has been critical of the company and of management's outlook. He has since gone back to his underweight rating. About a month ago, he wrote that the company's fundamentals &quot;continue to look negative.&quot;He still maintains an underweight rating and $5 price target on the stock, implying more than 45% downside. GE Stock GrowthFor the most recent quarter, General Electric stock beat on earnings and revenue expectations. It also provided better-than-expected guidance. But not everything was perfect in the quarter.For one, GE warned about headaches stemming from the grounding of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. Specifically, GE's cash flow could take a $1.4 billion hit if the planes remain grounded all year. It could also impact guidance.Growth is far from robust, too. Analysts expect revenue to decline almost 4% year-over-year in 2019. In 2020, estimates call for just a 70 basis point advance. The plus side is that revenue would be done going down in this scenario, but disappointing in that it's still sub-1%.GE is still a few years away from returning to any type of impressive growth for investors. In the meantime, it needs to focus on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its free cash flow. If it can attack the latter, investors -- and Tusa -- will take notice.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-10-03,"After slumping in the first two days of October, stocks rebounded Thursday, but there's a caveat to go along with today's gains. Earlier this week, stocks slumped on news of some troubling manufacturing data. However, today's gains were accrued against the backdrop of more concerning data.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com Today, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its services index fell to 52.6 in September, well below the prior month's reading of 56.4 and far off economists' estimate of a September reading of 55.1. Readings above 50 are considered healthy, but this is still a big miss and it won't do much to allay recession concerns.  * 7 Important IPO Stocks to Watch for the Long Run The ISM services report is the latest in a recent spate of glum economic data. The tests continue tomorrow with the publication of the September jobs report from the Labor Department. With that in mind, today's market upside may be a simple case of a rebound after a couple of bad days or expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again later this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, the Nasdaq Composite snapped back to gain 1.12% while the S&P 500 climbed 0.80%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.47% with 18 of its member firms pointed higher in late trading. Of those 18, roughly half were up about 1% or more. Fun With PfizerPfizer (NYSE:PFE), a rare visitor to this space, was the Dow's top performer today, adding 2.22% on light news. The blue chip pharmaceuticals name is the epitome of a healthcare laggard this year with a loss of more than 20%.There wasn't much news behind the Pfizer rally today, but earlier this week the company said it reached a settlement with Genentech and Roche so that Pfizer can introduce its biosimilar bevacizumab, Zirabev, in the U.S. later this year.Pfizer still needs to gain 13.17% to reclaim its 200-day moving average. Welcome Back, UTXIt's been a while since United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was highlighted here, but shares of the industrial conglomerate posted a modest gain today on some encouraging remarks from Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. A case can be made that UTX should have been up more today because the analyst is forecasting upside of as much as 37% from current levels.United Technologies is still working through its merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and spin offs of its Otis Elevator and Carrier HVAC units, so there's a lot of complexity and moving parts to the long thesis for the shares, but as Barron's points out, there could also be considerable upside.&quot;It is a complicated exercise, but Spingarn said United Tech stock would be worth $164 and Raytheon $230 based on value to be received in a 2020 merger,&quot; according to the financial magazine. &quot;That is about 25% and 20% higher than current stock values, respectively. What's more, he see upside to $180 for United Tech stock, 37% higher than recent levels, if management executes successfully on growth plans.&quot; Post-Event BounceWhen talking about Dow technology stocks and product events, the conversation usually involves Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but today Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the name to discuss.After tumbling yesterday following a product launch session in New York, shares of Microsoft bounced back today. What's happening here is that the company is making a push into the hardware arena. Specifically, it's renewing its smartphone push with a foldable version of the Surface, known as the Surface Duo.Those familiar with Microsoft know the company has a spotty history in the mobile phone arena, one littered with more failures than successes.

Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayOverall, Thursday was a decent day and the first one of that nature since the fourth quarter starter. However, risks linger, namely due to these troubling economic data points. As one potential harbinger of ongoing weakness, oil prices have fallen for eight consecutive days. That would not be happening if market participants were enthusiastic about the global economy.Barclays was out with a note today saying there's a 25% to 30% chance of recession over the next 12 months. Those aren't short odds, but they probably can't be ignored either.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. engineers were nearly done redesigning software on the grounded 737 Max in June when some pilots hopped into a simulator to test a few things.It didn’t go well.A simulated computer glitch caused it to to dive aggressively in a way that resembled the problem that had caused deadly crashes off Indonesia and in Ethiopia months earlier.That led to an extensive redesign of the plane’s flight computers that has dragged on for months and repeatedly pushed back the date of its return to service, according to people briefed on the work. The company -- which initially expressed confidence it could complete its application to recertify the plane with the Federal Aviation Administration within months -- now says it hopes to do that before the end of the year.Changing the architecture of the jet’s twin flight computers, which drive autopilots and critical instruments, has proven far more laborious than patching the system directly involved in 737 Max crashes, said these people, who asked not to be named speaking about the issue.The redesign has also sparked tensions between aviation regulators and the company. As recently as this week, the FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency asked for more documentation of the changes to the computers, said one of the people, potentially delaying the certification further.Developing and testing software on airliners is an exacting process. Manufacturers may have to demonstrate with extensive testing that a software failure leading to a crash would be as rare as one in a billion.“It’s really complicated,” John Hansman, an aeronautics and astronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is not involved in the repair, said of revising aircraft software. “It totally makes sense why it’s taking longer.”Compared with the initial redesign of the software system involved in the crashes -- a feature known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS -- the work on the flight computers will likely create an exponential increase in the safety tests required before it’s approved, said Peter Lemme, a former Boeing engineer who worked on flight-control systems before leaving the company to become a consultant.“Where before you may have had 10 scenarios to test, I could see that being 100,” Lemme said.And that doesn’t account for the added time to design the software changes needed for the two computers, he said.The work on the plane originally focused on MCAS, which repeatedly pushed down the nose in both accidents as a result of a malfunctioning sensor. Pilots eventually lost control and the crashes killed 346 people, prompting a worldwide grounding of the jet on March 13.Within weeks of the first crash -- a Lion Air flight off the coast of Indonesia on Oct. 29, 2018 -- Boeing announced that it was redesigning MCAS to make it less aggressive and to prevent it from activating more than once. It was projected to be completed within months.While the fix became more complex and politically charged after the second accident -- the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10 -- the changes to MCAS remained self-contained and relatively simple.“I could have a bunch of graduate students and rewrite MCAS in a couple of days and be done,” Hansman said.That, of course, wouldn’t pass muster with FAA, he said. And it was far simpler than the extensive computer redesign that they undertook.Flight-Control FailureIn the original 737 Max design review, Boeing and its overseers at FAA concluded pilots would react swiftly to flight-control failures, but that assumption has been called into question by Indonesia’s final report into the crash and recommendations issued by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.FAA officials, stung by post-crash charges of laxity, had already begun a more rigorous review of systems on the plane.Part of assessing an aircraft’s safety involves anticipating even the most remote potential failure. As a result, Boeing in June simulated what would happen if gamma rays from space scrambled data in the plane’s flight-control computers.In one scenario, the plane aggressively dove in a way that mimicked what happened in the crashes on the grounded jetliner, the people said. While such a failure had never occurred in the 737’s history, it was at least theoretically possible.Response TimeBecause at least one of the pilots who flew the scenario in a simulator found it difficult to respond in time to maintain control of the plane, it needed to be fixed, according to two people familiar with the results.The answer was to modernize what was a relatively antiquated design on the 737.Most modern, computerized aircraft -- such as more recent Boeing models and Airbus SE’s jets -- use three computer systems to monitor each other, Hansman and Lemme said.By contrast, the 737 Max had two separate computers. One operated the flight systems and another was available if the first one failed, with the roles switching on each flight. But they interacted only minimally.Boeing decided to make the two systems monitor each other so that each computer can halt an erroneous action by the other. This change is an important modernization that brings the plane more in line with the latest safety technology but raised highly complex software and hardware issues.Short CircuitSimply introducing a new wire that connects the two computers, for example, raises potential safety issues, Hansman said. If a short circuit in one computer occurs, could the wire cause it to disable the second computer?And if flight data arrives in one computer a fraction of a second before or after it reaches the second one, that could create confusion for each system, according to Lemme.As Boeing and the subcontractor that supplied the flight-control computer, the United Technologies Corp. division Collins Aerospace Systems, worked through these changes, it has at times created tension.Officials from the FAA and the European safety agency expressed frustration with Boeing at a meeting last summer when company representatives didn’t supply a detailed enough explanation of the changes.Work AuditA similar issue arose in early November when an audit describing work on the changes wasn’t complete and the agencies ordered Boeing and Collins to revise it, according to a person familiar with the matter.Boeing, in a statement, said it provided technical documents to regulators “in a format consistent with past submissions.”“Regulators have requested that the information be conveyed in a different form, and the documentation is being revised accordingly,” according to the statement. “While this happens we continue to work with the FAA and global regulators on certification of the software for safe return of the MAX to service.”The result has been to extend the jet’s grounding.“It’s absolutely the right thing to do,” said Jeffrey Guzzetti, the former chief of accident investigations at the FAA. “But that is a big change to make.”&#92;--With assistance from Julie Johnsson.To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Delays in Boeing Max Return Began With Near-Crash in Simulator

2019-11-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Earlier this week, my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Chris Bryant examined the ongoing troubles for advanced jet engines used on today’s commercial airliners. These engines now seem to be reaching their technical limits, and as Bryant says, we may be asking too much of the technology.That’s not great news for the companies making those turbines, or for those flying the aircraft. It’s also not the best news for the climate, given the trajectory of emissions from air travel and air freight. Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aviation made up 2.4% of global emissions in 2018 and, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, have grown 32% in just five years.The geography of those emissions is highly concentrated. Three markets — the U.S., the European Union and China — account for more than half of all emissions; the top 10 emitters contribute more than 70% of the global total.There’s something hopeful, actually, in that geographical distribution. High concentration means that tackling emissions in just three markets can have an outsized impact, and standards set in those large markets are easy for others to follow. There’s another aspect to the distribution of aviation emissions that’s worth examining: emissions by type of aircraft. Bryant writes of problems with engines on both widebody and narrowbody aircraft: the Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc Trent 1000 engines used on the widebody Boeing Co. 787, and United Technologies Corp. subsidiary Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan used on the narrowbody Airbus SE A320neo. While widebody aircraft make up one-third of global emissions, narrowbody and regional passenger plans are almost half. If the turbines used to propel the largest and longest-range of aircraft are approaching technical limits but almost half of emissions are from shorter-range and smaller aircraft, then there’s space to innovate, for emissions’ sake, at the short and small end. And that space looks electric and hybrid. Next month, Vancouver-based Harbour Air will fly its first electric seaplane, a De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver prototype retrofitted with a propulsion system from Seattle-based electric aviation company MagniX. It’s a first look at what electric commercial flight could be, and as it draws upon a sophisticated, global and continually improving network of battery makers while the cost of batteries continues to decrease, it has room to grow. “Because of airborne mobility development, this technology is unstoppable, and it’s getting more practical as every day goes by,” says Greg McDougall, Harbour Air’s CEO. “The brainpower and money involved is snowballing, and there’s no doubt we can roll out what we’re doing to other small airlines.” It’s an infectious enthusiasm, but it just might take to the air elsewhere, too. Weekend readingThe Qantas Group plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, Formula 1 plans to reach that milestone by 2030.

2019-12-02,"December is usually a pretty good month for stocks and that historical precedent may yet prove true this month, but it was defied Monday as equities tumbled on the back of some weak manufacturing data and another tariff gambit by the White House.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 lost 0.86%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.96%  * The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.12%  * On light news, American Express (NYSE:AXP) was the worst performer in the Dow, shedding 2.38% to start the week.One of the main reasons stocks weakened to start the final month of 2019 was dismal factory data. Earlier today, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index reading for November declined to 48.1 in November from 48.3 in October. Economists were expecting a November reading 49.2. That's bad not only because the November reading missed estimates, but also because reports below 50 are seen as bearish.Another reason that traders reacted in bearish fashion to the ISM number is that it could be a precursor to more discouraging data and that's a relevant point to consider because the Labor Department deliver the November jobs report before the bell this Friday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now On the tariff front, perhaps the best thing that can be said is that today's headlines don't involve China.

Let's look at some of the best and the worst to start the week. Industrial IntrigueThe aforementioned ISM report proved highly damaging for industrial stocks as none of the Dow's constituents from that sector finished higher today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the worst offender among Dow industrial stocks, shedding more than 3%.This could be another eventful month for Boeing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) head Steve Dickson will testify before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee next week about the Boeing MAX 737.&quot;U.S. officials told Reuters last week it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, that the agency will unground the plane before the end of December,&quot; according to the new agency.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), the Dow's other industrial names, were all dragged lower by the ISM report.&quot;The guts of the report show just how dismal the industrial sector looks,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;New orders, an indication of demand, dropped for the fourth straight month and at an accelerating pace.

However, Black Friday has lost some of its cache in recent years due to the emergence of online shopping. Still, some brick-and-mortar retailers are have significant e-commerce footprints, too. That group includes Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Although Walmart, a Dow component and the largest domestic retailer, experienced a rocky road today, some analysts believe it and rival Target (NYSE:TGT) are winners this holiday shopping season and beyond.&quot;We strongly believe that both WMT and TGT's drive up/grocery pick up options offer exactly what the consumer will need as they are increasingly constrained by time,&quot; said Raymond James retail analyst Matthew McClintock in a note out today. Tech UpdateDue to the risk off tenor to today's market action, it wasn't surprising to see the Dow's technology constituents retreat, but several of these names remain &quot;buys&quot; this month and for the year ahead.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded slightly lower despite JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raising his price target on the iPhone maker to $296 from $290.Speaking of the iPhone, Chatterjee says Apple could eventually consider launching more new versions of the popular smartphone to match Android launches. Apple usually has just one launch per year for the iPhone while Android phones are introduced by handset makers throughout the year.  * 10 Great Tech Gifts to Buy for Under $100 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) joined Apple in the red, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya up his price target on the semiconductor giant to $70 from $65 today while publishing a note outlining five reasons to buy the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith manufacturing data deteriorating, there is some burden on consumer data to pick up the slack and that thesis is being tested as we speak thanks to the holiday shopping season. Broadly speaking, investors should expect the consumer to remain healthy, but not overly buoyant.&quot;Absent a trade or other exogenous shock, the U.S. economy looks to grow again in 2020,&quot; said BlackRock in a note out earlier today. &quot;Real personal consumption has been growing every quarter since the end of 2009.

2019-12-20,"Around this time last year, there were serious concerns about General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock. Shares were flirting with a single-digit stock-price breakdown, as GE stock eventually bottomed just above $6. Then-new CEO Larry Culp didn't get much of a honeymoon.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Since then, shares have almost doubled to current prices, near $11 per share. While the fundamentals are still a bit sketchy, it's got many investors wondering if the worst is now behind General Electric stock. A Clash of AnalystsWhile they're not rivaling with each other, two analysts have very different views on GE stock. First, there's JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa. He was the first analyst to turn bearish on General Electric and was consistently ahead of each decline in the stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIronically, he upgraded the stock from sell to neutral in December 2018, which kickstarted the stock's massive rally off the lows. After earnings and investor day presentations though, Tusa later downgraded GE back down to a sell rating in 2019. He also maintains a $5 price target and is still not bullish.On the flip side, there's UBS, which recently upgraded the stock from neutral to buy and raised its price target from $11.50 to a Street-high $14.A new UBS analyst, Markus Mittermaier, took over coverage of GE and proceeded to give the industrial giant a buy rating last week in his first note to clients.GE stock is at a &quot;positive inflection point,&quot; he wrote, arguing that strong earnings growth estimates for 2020 and 2021, robust free cash flow growth and de-levering its balance sheet should all contribute to a higher stock price.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Put on Your Wish List I won't pretend to know more than these two in regards to GE stock. General Electric clearly has some issues to work through yet. It's really a question of whether management can execute the current turnaround plan, whether investors believe in that plan and if the stock market can hold up.Let's look at the charts to see what the technicals say. Trading GE StockShares of GE were trying to breakout over the $10.50 to $10.75 area for much of 2019. Ultimately, the stock did breakout over this level in November, but not before suffering a major breakdown first.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGE stock price was again rejected from resistance in August. In a matter of days, the stock broke below all of its major moving averages, as well as uptrend support (blue line). Eventually, shares bottomed at $7.64 in mid-August -- quite the two-week decline, I might add -- and began to put in a series of higher lows from that point.Since breaking out though, the stock is trading much better on the long side. General Electric stock does have a short-term downtrend line weighing on it, while $11.50 has been acting as resistance.On the plus side, the $10.50 the $10.75 area that was previous resistance is now acting as support. For now, active bulls can look for support in this area while looking to sell near $11.50. On a break below support, see if either the 50-day or the 200-day moving averages act as support.It's totally possible that UBS' $14 price target is achieved even if support fails. But it will be much easier on the bulls if support holds and the stock takes out $11.50 resistance, rallying to $12-plus going into or in early 2020. Bottom Line on General Electric StockCould 2019 be the bottoming year for General Electric stock? Analysts expect earnings to fall 6.2% this year and sales to decline 22.8%. However, 2020 forecasts call for earnings to grow almost 10% despite a slight decline in revenue.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy The real kicker here is free cash flow. If the company can show a notable improvement in this metric, investors -- and perhaps more importantly, Tusa -- will turn more bullish.That said, GE is very much a &quot;prove it&quot; story at this point. After seeing a 78% haircut in just 30 months and axing its dividend down to nothing, this old conglomerate has to prove its worth. Particularly as Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to struggle -- one of GE Aviation's customers -- and as competitors like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) continue to march higher and higher.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-12-23,"(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co. once set the agenda for entire industries by sharing its outlook for the coming year at elaborate December gatherings.The meetings, sometimes held at the iconic Saturday Night Live studio at Manhattan’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza, became a Wall Street ritual -- and often sparked a stock pop. Another titan of industry, United Technologies Corp., was known for renting out art museums for its confabs.Not anymore.The year-ahead events that once dotted the calendar in December are all but gone as companies opt to unveil annual forecasts in January, February or even March. The industrial sector is leading the way on delayed outlooks as a manufacturing slowdown and trade volatility make forecasting more difficult.“With the heightened stage of uncertainty with trade and the direction of the economy, this gives companies another two months not to have to calibrate and describe the coming year,” said Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. This year, for the first time, none of the 29 companies he covers will hold an outlook meeting.GE and United Technologies in recent years have both stopped holding events to spotlight their earnings forecasts, as have Honeywell International Inc., Johnson Controls International, WW Grainger Inc. and Dover Corp. This year, 3M Co. also called it off.Widening TrendAuto executives traditionally convened every January in Detroit at the North American International Auto Show, and CEOs held parallel events to give early glimpses of quarterly results and guidance for the new year. For 2020, the show moves to June, and no new meetings are set to fill the void. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. so far aren’t planning any investor briefings before fourth-quarter earnings in early February.The new approach goes beyond manufacturers. For years, Walmart Inc. held an annual investor meeting in October to give guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. But this year the retail giant decided to push out the event until after its fourth-quarter report in February.At GE, former Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch used the outlook events in December to generate enthusiasm and a late-year stock pop, said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. “It was like a double Christmas rally,” he said.The success of the meetings prompted other industrial companies to follow suit, Heymann said.Reversing CourseGE is helping lead the way again -- in the opposite direction -- as it’s been roiled by management turmoil, market downturns and a deterioration in finances. Former CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who hosted multiple outlook meetings from the SNL studio, stepped down in 2017 and successor John Flannery was ousted a little over a year later.Current CEO Larry Culp, trying to lead a turnaround after an epic share rout, waited until March 2019 before offering this year’s guidance.“We are committed to enhancing transparency to help investors understand the opportunities for GE as well as the risks we face on our multiyear transformation, and we look forward to updating investors on our outlook in early 2020,” the company said in an email.While the shift away from year-end outlooks is partly influenced by market volatility, it also reflects a “herd mentality” by companies that don’t want to move alone, said RBC’s Dray. Delaying the forecast could be seen by investors as a red flag, he said, so many companies waited for their peers to move before they took the leap.“All you needed was a couple of the companies to decide they weren’t going to do it, and everyone said, ‘Then we’re not going to do it either,’” said Dray, who had long referred to the spate of December meetings as the “fifth earnings season.”3M, which cut its 2019 forecast multiple times this year amid market volatility, didn’t respond to a request for comment. United Technologies declined to comment.Shareholder PreferencesHoneywell, which unlike some peers has had a strong 2019, said the change was driven in part by the preferences of investors and analysts. While the company already provided an early look at next year’s trends, it will wait until next year to offer a more complete picture. “Over the last few years, we heard from our shareowners and analysts that they prefer fewer, more impactful meetings,” the company said by email. “As a result, beginning in 2018, we decided to combine our outlook call with our fourth quarter earnings call, which typically occurs in late January.”Only about a third of public companies provide specific financial and market outlooks, which can help reduce volatility in share prices and provide a check on analysts’ estimates, said Baruch Lev, an accounting professor at New York University‘s Stern School of Business who specializes in investor relations and financial reporting.While delaying guidance can reduce shareholders’ visibility into a company, it makes sense for management to wait for the new year to present an outlook, “when the past is clearer and guidance is most needed,” he said.“The sooner investors get information the better,” Lev said. “But in the big scheme of things, there are limits to what managers can say about the future.”&#92;--With assistance from Matthew Boyle, Keith Naughton and David Welch.To contact the reporter on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan WarrenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",American Companies’ Elaborate Annual Outlook Meetings Are Dying

2019-12-27,"GE (NYSE:GE) makes the engines for Boeing's (NYSE:BA) beleaguered 737 MAX jets. Now that Boeing has decided to halt the jet's production GE stock is set for another significant drop.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com According to the Wall Street Journal, GE's LEAP engine accounts for $4.8 billion of GE's roughly $7 billion in industrial profits. This engine is Boeing's only configuration for the 737 MAX, but it is also used in the Airbus A320neo airliner. GE does not break out the orders between Airbus and Boeing for this engine.However, we can reliably assume that the Boeing cancellation will do significant damage to GE's cash flow for a couple of reasons.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst of all, aviation accounts for over 60% of GE's industrial profits. Second, the 737 MAX grounding has already done significant damage to General Electric's free cash flow. The Wall Street Journal says that it cost them $400 million per quarter in the past three quarters.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way GE's outgoing CFO, Jamie Miller, said in the third-quarter conference call that working capital changes, a component of free cash flow, was negative $1.8 billion. A big portion of that was due to the &quot;timing of collections from Boeing related to the 737 MAX program.&quot;Boeing had slowed down the production of the 737 MAX. And this cost GE $1.8 billion in one quarter alone. But now it is not a matter of &quot;timing&quot; of payments. There will simply be no more payments. Recent Analysts Downgrade on GE Stock PriceIn fact, one analyst, Stephen Tusa at JP Morgan, recently wrote a scathing report on GE about its finances. He says in his report that even if Boeing starts up production, General Electric won't benefit.GE has already received billions in advances on 737 MAX production payments. Even if production started up again, there would be a significant lag effect. New payments would significantly lag the outgoing costs of new production.Moreover, Tusa estimates that Boeing accounts for over 70% of its aviation unit's profits. And, as the WSJ pointed out, this unit accounts for over 60% of industrial profits. Needless to say, Tusa has a &quot;Sell&quot; rating on GE stock and a $5.00 per share target price. That is a drop of almost 55% from today's GE stock price.One analyst believes the production halt will actually be positive. He believes that the production of LEAP engines for Boeing produces losses for GE. There is no way to verify this statement. All indications are that this complete production half will be devasting for GE.For example, earlier this year Boeing cut 737 MAX production to 42 airplanes from 52 per month. This hit of 10 planes month caused a loss at GE of $400 million per quarter, according to the WSJ. So an additional cut of 42 planes per month will like cause over four times that amount or $1.6 billion per quarter.Moreover, based on the CFO's statements in the conference call, the cash flow effect could be even larger. Possibly over three times that amount, since production advances will no longer flow in. GE's Cash Flow ProblemIn short, GE is trying to sell more LEAP engines to Airbus. According to that same WSJ report, GE's share of the A302neo airliner engine production would rise. This plane is the Airbus alternative to the 737 MAX.GE previously had built 50% of the production line engines, along with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). Now GE is going to produce 58% of the engines.General Electric has to more along these lines. It has over $87 billion in debt, which costs GE over $2.6 in interest per year. Recently GE has sold a number of large assets, up to $38 billion, which will lower the net debt to $49 billion.If cash flow losses start to dramatically hit its bottom line, GE may have to borrow more money, sell more assets, or a combination of both. Moreover, its credit rating could deteriorate. That would raise GE's interest costs and lower cash flow. What Guidance Is There For GE Stock?There is no silver lining in the Boeing 737 MAX production halt for GE stock. It will severely future cash flows. It is not easy to predict by how much. That may be one reason why GE stock has not fallen a lot yet.For example, one analyst complained to the WSJ that GE discloses &quot;insufficient information to model any of this.&quot; That is not good. An analyst who closely follows General Electric cannot model out the cash flow hit to GE stock.I complained about a similar issue on GE's disclosure in a previous article. Maybe the new CFO who starts in January can help explain things better for the public and analysts. The Bottom Line on GE StockMeanwhile, GE's third-quarter report increased guidance for 2019. The slide presentation shows projected &quot;adjusted&quot; earnings per share of 55 to 65 cents per share. That puts GE stock on a price-to-earnings ratio of over 18 times earnings. That is a fairly high ratio.In addition, GE said FCF would be between $0 and $2 billion for 2019. Assuming $1 billion in FCF, GE's FCF yield will be a little over 1%, given its $96.3 billion market value.Both of these valuations are way too high for a &quot;turnaround&quot; company facing a huge dent in its free cash flow. So far GE has not said how much the production halt will affect its finances.I would expect the worst. Be careful with this &quot;turnaround.&quot; You will likely have a chance to buy GE much cheaper in the future, at least until the Boeing situation turns around.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-02,"It's too early to tell if the new decade will be this century's equivalent of the &quot;Roaring '20s,&quot; but stocks started the new year in much the same way they ended 2019: on an upbeat note.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 advanced 0.84%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.16%  * The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 1.33%  * A slew of familiar Dow names gained 1% or more today, but in late trading, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was leading the wayWe're just one day into 2020, so it's too early to tell what themes from last year will persist, what laggards will morph into leaders and which winners from last year will disappoint this year. But in late trading, 21 of 30 Dow Jones stocks were higher.On a related note, much of the ebullience to start the new year was attributable to familiar leadership fare as all of the Dow's technology stocks were trading higher today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers Speaking of familiar themes, on a day when news flow was light in the U.S., China helped global equities higher after the central bank there said it would increase access to cheap financing for the country's financial institutions. On a related note, President Trump remains optimistic that the U.S. and China will sign Phase I of the oft-discussed trade compact this month and perhaps start discussions on the next phase. Apple Doing Apple ThingsThere's obviously a long way to go in 2020, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), 2019's best-performing Dow stock, is off to an excellent, gaining 2.2% on the first trading day of the new year.Conventional wisdom often dictates that a prior leader's usually don't retain that status in the following year, but that Apple may not be conventional in that regard. The stock gained 86.16% last year and asking for repeat performance in 2020 may be asking a lot, but Apple certainly has the ingredients and leadership to make 2020 another rewarding year for shareholders.For today, Apple's gains were largely attributable to the aforementioned liquidity injection in China and news that of the imminent trade deal signing. Speaking of Repeat Winners…Disney (NYSE:DIS) gained a tidy 32% last year and was back at it today, jumping more than 2%. Last year's familiar catalyst of Disney +, the company's newly minted streaming service, greased the stock's wheels today.Specifically, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan said in a note out today that a recent survey indicates Disney+ has acquired a massive number of subscribers in a short amount of time.&quot;McTernan estimated that Disney+ had 25 million subscribers as the first quarter of its 2020 fiscal year closed on Tuesday, up from his previous call of 21 million. Disney will likely report its results for the quarter in early February,&quot; according to Barron's. Remember This Name?It has been awhile since industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was highlighted in this space, but the stock was one of the top performers in the Dow today. As has been widely noted, there are lot of moving parts with UTX stock, including previously announced spinoffs of its non-core segments, including Otis (elevators and escalators) and Carrier (HVAC) as well as the Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) merger.It took investors a while to digest all those moves, but there a couple of important reasons why UTX could be a winner in 2020: earnings are expected to grow and the stock trades at a tempting 17x earnings, indicating it's not richly valued despite strong EPS growth forecasts. Along For The RideAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), one of last year's best-performing names from the hot semiconductor space, hit a record high and dragged rival and Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) along for the ride.  * 7 Strong Retail Stocks Still Worth a Look  Waiting on the DogsSeveral of the Dow's 2019 disappointments, a.k.a. The Dogs of the Dow, such as Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), were among the index's losers today, indicating it could take awhile for the Dogs of the Dow theory to kick in this year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOne thing to consider, and it's relevant because we'll soon be treated to the last major economic data points of 2019, is that economic growth in the U.S. is likely to cool this year, but that doesn't dent the case for equities.&quot;While the odds of a near-term recession appear to have diminished, growth is projected to slow in the coming quarters due to a weaker global outlook and reduced global trade flows,&quot; notes FactSet. &quot;U.S. economic growth is expected to continue to slow into 2020, with analysts surveyed by FactSet projecting 2.3% annual growth in 2019 followed by 1.8% in 2020.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-02,"2019 was a banner year, as we saw record high after record high. What drove the indices higher? Let's look the top stock trades from 2019, and specifically, the top five performers from the Dow. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: United Technologies (UTX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnited Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was the fifth-best performer in the group, up 41% in 2019. After struggling with the $142 area in late October, UTX gapped up over this mark in November.Later in the month, it actually pulled back and retested this former resistance levels. This time, though, it acted as support, a clear sign that bulls were in control. Unlike some of the stronger performers on the list below, UTX does not have as well-defined of an uptrend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNotably, though, buyers have been stepping in around the 50-day moving average, giving bulls one significant point of reference. With shares above $150 -- resistance in November and support in December -- it's hard to be bearish on UTX, which hit a new high on Thursday.  * 7 Strong Retail Stocks Still Worth a Look Below the 50-day could send it back down to range support around $142. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Visa (V)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUp 42% in 2019, Visa (NYSE:V) just barely nudged out UTX for No. 4 on the list. Unlike the rest of the market, Visa didn't begin barreling higher until just a few weeks ago.After hitting a high of $183.50 in July, Visa slowly but surely plowed higher. In November and early December, it had a solid uptrend guiding it higher (blue line), before erupting over $184, then $186.It's now in a steeper uptrend channel (purple lines) and continues to climb. Surprisingly, shares are not overbought like many others, so buyers could continue to push this name higher.At this point, I would not bet against Visa if the stock is above the 20-day moving average. Below puts uptrend support, $184 and the 50-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: JPMorgan (JPM)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comJust one percentage point above Visa, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) rang up gains of 43% in 2019. JPM had struggled with the $114 to $116 area for almost two years. In October, the bank burst over this mark, and hasn't looked back since.Shares hit a new high on Thursday, breaching the $140 level. Now what?JPMorgan is a buy-the-dips stock until bulls are proven wrong. This one has been very strong over the past few months and expecting it to continue forever is unrealistic. But for now, dips to the 20-day moving average have been bought aggressively.Until this mark fails to buoy JPMorgan, bulls can continue to buy on pullbacks to it. Below the $137 to $138 area, and the tone will shift more cautious -- note: not bearish, but cautious. Below the 20-day moving average and $137, and the 50-day moving average is next. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUp 55% on the year, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the second-best Dow stock this year.After consolidating between $132 and $142 for about five months, shares gapped up and over the range, and have been trending higher since. Like JPM, dips to the 20-day moving average have been bought aggressively by the bulls.Until that trend changes, we shouldn't bet against it. Flirting with $160 now, MSFT is trying to break out again. If it does, look for a continued run higher. If it can't muster the strength to hurdle $150, see that uptrend support (blue line) and the 20-day moving average support the stock.Below puts the $152.50 area on watch, with the 50-day moving average just below that. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Apple (AAPL)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThese last two are the most impressive to me. Not only do Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) command $2.5 trillion worth of equity, but they are both up incredible amounts this year. The combined rally between the two of them added $1.13 trillion to their market caps!That's such a remarkable figure, it's hard to comprehend. Let's put it this way, AAPL and MSFT's gains total more than the market caps of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) … combined.Apple was the best performer in the Dow last year, up a resounding 86%. I love Apple, but if you took a pass at $150 in January 2018 or $190 in August, I would not suggest $290-plus as being the time to buy.Shares sport an overbought condition (blue circle) and while they can continue higher from here, we need a better dip to buy before getting long. That starts with a correction down to the 20-day moving average and/or the $280 level. Below that and uptrend support (blue line), and the 50-day moving average should buoy the stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL, AMZN, V and ROKU.

2020-01-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A would-be Boeing Co. takeover target has found its own dance partner.Woodward Inc., a maker of cockpit controls and engine-actuation systems, announced late Sunday that it’s merging with fellow aerospace supplier Hexcel Corp. The all-stock deal values Hexcel, a maker of lightweight composite materials, at about $7.5 billion including debt, with Woodward shareholders set to own about 55% of the combined company. While both suppliers have felt the sting of  Boeing’s 737 Max grounding, executives said Sunday that the deal wasn’t a response to that crisis but rather an effort to position the combined company to better compete in the pursuit of more fuel-efficient engines.The effort to sell this merger as a play on climate change is interesting, and it shows the degree to which companies are taking seriously the increasing criticism of greenhouse-gas emissions. At the same time, it’s hard to extricate Boeing and its Max woes from the context of the deal. Just two years ago, it might have been Boeing making these kinds of arguments about the benefits of scale and combined research-and-development budgets.Boeing held preliminary talks with Woodward as it scouted targets for its push to build a services division with $50 billion in sales, according to reports in early 2018 from Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal. Woodward pushed back on those reports and said it wasn’t in discussions with Boeing on a possible sale. Boeing instead acquired KLX Inc.’s aerospace-distribution business for $4.25 billion and announced an auxiliary power unit joint venture with Safran SA. This added to home-grown efforts in avionics and cabin interiors and spooked investors in traditional suppliers of those parts and services.As recently as May, ex-Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was talking about the prospect of additional deals in the vein of KLX – “a substantial, multi-billion dollar acquisition, but one that was complementary.” With the now 10-month Max grounding draining Boeing’s cash flow and mounting scrutiny over the company’s corporate culture and the integrity of its design process, it’s highly unlikely the company will be making acquisitions anytime soon, and entirely possible that its parts and services ambitions go no further.That creates an opportunity for its suppliers, and Woodward and Hexcel are right to seize the moment to gain more clout, particularly as it looks increasingly likely that Boeing will have to speed up development of a narrow-body successor to the 737. With new technologies requiring ever-higher levels of spending, it also just helps to have a bigger balance sheet. Woodward and Hexcel expect to spend $250 million on R&D in the first year after the deal closes, or about 5% of combined sales. That’s a roughly 15% step-up from estimated 2019 levels, notes Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu. “Woodward and Hexcel touch nearly every aspect of aerospace design,” Hexcel CEO Nick Stanage, who will retain that role at the combined company, said on a conference call Sunday. The merged entity will be well-positioned to deliver “integrated systems that satisfy demands for aircraft aerodynamics, energy efficiency, improved safety and reduced emissions and noise.”The Woodward-Hexcel combination follows a United Technologies Corp. $100 billion buying spree over the past two years that saw the engine maker link up with avionics supplier Rockwell Collins Inc. and defense contractor Raytheon Co., as well as smaller tie-ups between Parker-Hannifin Corp. and Exotic Metals Forming Co. and TransDigm Group Inc. and Esterline Technologies Corp. Analysts expressed some caution on Hexcel and Woodward’s ambitious goal of generating $1 billion of cash flow in the first fiscal year after closing, and time will tell if the companies can follow through. But strategically, it’s a bold and smart move that should give the companies an upper hand in both the battle against climate change and any future battles with Boeing.  To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s no clearer sign we’ve reached peak breakup in industrials than a pure-play transportation and logistics company blaming a “conglomerate discount” for its decision to consider cleaving itself into smaller pieces.XPO Logistics Inc. confirmed late Wednesday that it was exploring strategic alternatives including the possible sale or spinoff of one or more of its units. The review could see businesses that generate as much as 75% of XPO’s revenue jettisoned, with the European, North American and Asia-Pacific supply-chain operations and its European and North American transportation arms all potentially on the block, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. That would leave XPO with its North American short-haul trucking business. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs told Bloomberg TV he’s exploring breakup options because the company is suffering from a “conglomerate discount” and “Wall Street understands pure plays.”Those are in-vogue words right now for industrial CEOs after an unprecedented wave of breakups. But the majority of those splits involved businesses that had little or only tenuous connections to each other – think the separation of Ingersoll-Rand Plc’s golf cart, tools and pumps business from its HVAC division, or United Technologies Corp.’s breakup of its aviation, climate and elevator businesses. Even controversial breakups such as Honeywell International Inc.’s spinoff of its Resideo Technologies Inc. thermostat and Garrett Motion Inc. turbochargers businesses, or Fortive Corp.’s plan to carve out its legacy industrial products, involved divisions that clearly didn’t fit. XPO is splitting the hairs much more finely. According to its most recent annual filing, the company gets 65% of its revenue from transportation and 35% from logistics.All the same, the market clearly does love this move. The stock climbed more than 10% on the news, with some of that likely reflecting a squeeze on short sellers who have a 13.1% interest in shares outstanding, according to Markit. Citigroup Inc. analyst Christian Wetherbee estimated a breakup could add as much as $66 a share to XPO’s equity value. And that’s likely appealing for investors looking for a story to bet on amid generally elevated valuations elsewhere in industrial stocks. But it’s hard not to view this breakup plan as a waving of the white flag for a company that was built via consolidation but has struggled of late to get deals done. XPO hasn’t announced a major acquisition since 2015, despite Jacobs’s exclamation in 2017 that he was ready to spend up to $8 billion. Last year, XPO said it would pivot away from M&A and plow billions into share buybacks instead. That helped drive XPO shares to a 40% gain in 2019, despite a recession in freight markets.With its debt levels rising and little in the way of real earnings growth, keeping the party going presented a challenge. Jacobs laid out a plan in August to add as much as $1 billion of profit by 2022 via cost cuts and new business. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow, who noted at the time that such a push carried significant execution risk, says the breakup may be a sign that XPO had already squeezed all it could from the business as far as operating improvements and technology investments.The point of all of XPO’s M&A activity was to wring costs out of the combined operations and gain more negotiating clout with suppliers. Jacobs told Bloomberg TV that XPO’s combination of businesses had helped it add more than $2 billion of revenue organically. “We actually will lose some bargaining power as smaller companies with vendors because we won’t have the global procurement capability,” Jacobs said. But he thinks smaller, more agile businesses will be more appealing to both customers and shareholders.When a CEO is talking out of two sides of his mouth, it sure sounds like financial engineering.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-02-24,"It wasn't &quot;Black Monday,&quot; but today will not be remembered fondly over the course of market history as each of three major domestic equity benchmarks were punished amid intensifying concerns regarding the coronavirus from China. In the span of just two days, $1 trillion has been wiped off the market value of global equities.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 tumbled 3.35%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 3.56%.  * The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.71%.  * UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) felt the &quot;Bern&quot; and was the worst-performing Dow name today, sliding 7.8%.A lot of the talk about the coronavirus today had a &quot;why today?&quot; theme to it. What that means is that for weeks it appeared as though stocks in the U.S. and Europe, too (they deserve some credit across the pond) were holding up very nicely against the virus backdrop.However, that sentiment started to shift last week as it became more apparent that the virus isn't just a China problem. It's a global problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn addition to China, Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on technology hubs such as Japan and South Korea. It has forced the cancellation of major tourist events in Italy, the Eurozone's third-largest economy, prompting speculation that another recession there isn't far off.In other words, it's not surprising that in late trading, all of the 30 Dow stocks were in the red. A dozen of those 30 were lower by 3% or more.  * 7 Tarnished Blue-Chip Stocks to Ditch Now  Burned by BernieAs noted above, UnitedHealth was the worst-performing Dow component today, though the slump likely had little little to do with the coronavirus and plenty to do with Sen. Bernie Sanders winning the Nevada Democratic Caucus over the weekend. Sanders is a proponent of Medicare For All.This isn't a one-off problem for UNH stock. With the Silver State victory, Sanders continues building momentum and his odds of securing the Democratic nomination are getting shorter, not longer. With that in mind, the upcoming Super Tuesday primaries could be a real headwind for UNH. Card DeclinedI noted last week that American Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the names most vulnerable to lingering coronavirus concerns because the virus is a real strain on global travel. Tourists are staying home and conferences and conventions are being canceled, none of which are good news for a stock like AXP. In fact, it was the second-worst name in the Dow today behind UNH. Tech, TooPredictably, technology stocks were repudiated today with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) among the worst offenders. Mentioning that duo as it relates to the coronavirus is relevant due to the China supply chain issues these companies are facing.&quot;The spread of the coronavirus in China is credit negative for US semiconductor companies that generate a large portion of revenues from sales to Chinese manufacturers or depend on end market demand from Chinese consumers,&quot; said Moody's Investors Service. Maybe, But Not YetThere was some chatter that some industrial stocks could be avenues for waiting out the coronavirus issue and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) got a nice write-up from Barron's, which noted the stock is inexpensive. However, that stock along with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) each closed lower today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTo quantify how bad things were for the Dow on Monday, none of its components finished in the green, none of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher and the days best-performing assets were standard safe havens, such as gold and municipal bonds. That's to be expected on a day that was the worst for the S&P 500 in two years.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-05,"In another case of one step forward, two steps back, stocks tumbled today amid fresh fears regarding the coronavirus from China. Ultimately, stocks gave up plenty of the gains accrued on Wednesday. Technology and financial services names, two of the S&P 500's three largest sector weights, led the market lower today.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 slipped 3.39%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average stumbled 3.58%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 3.10%  * Today was a brutal day for industrial stocks as United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was tussling with Boeing (NYSE:BA) as the Dow's worst-performing stockConfirming that riskier assets will have a difficult time making inroads as long as the coronavirus continues dominating news flow, yields on 10-year Treasuries sank to 0.90% today, while gold advanced. Bond yields fall as prices rise.Adding to the pressure on stocks today were comments from various senators, indicating that the White House will miss its original goal having a million coronavirus test kits available by the end of this week. The other issue is training folks on how to properly use those kits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Value Stocks to Buy for 2020 The consumer, often viewed as the bedrock of the U.S. economy, is being crimped by the epidemic, too. Bloomberg's Consumer Comfort Index dropped to 63 as of March, down from 63.5 in the prior week, according to the news agency.Overall, those factors were enough to bring us back to an ugly situation we've seen a few times in recent weeks: none of the 30 Dow stocks pointed higher in late trading. Industrials Sabotage the DowA day after gaining about 4%, United Technologies gave up those losses and then some. Given the lack of headlines directly pertaining to UTX stock, it's not unreasonable to suspect that the Thursday tumble could be a case of industrial infection by way of Boeing.Already dealing with the woes, many of which are self-inflicted, associated with the 737 Max controversies, Boeing appears to be struggling due to the coronavirus as commercial airlines grapple with significantly reduced travel.Earlier today, the International Air Transport Association said it expects revenue losses attributable to the virus to reach $113 billion this year, nearly quadruple the previous estimate.The struggles in air travel could prompt airlines to scale back purchases of new aircraft and that has nothing to do with the 737 Max, meaning Boeing has a lot to contend with these days.Today, UTX closed lower by 8.83%, while Boeing was down 7.06%. Travel Part IIDisney (NYSE:DIS) is under siege due to the coronavirus and related travel cancellations. With today's tumble, shares of Disney reside about 30% below the 52-week. That's a bear market and a half.With the epidemic forcing scrapped travel plans and so many people to stay in, that would appear to be a catalyst for the Disney+ streaming service. While Disney+ is expected to be a significant contributor to the company's top and bottom lines in the future, it's not enough right now to offset declining theme park and movie theater visits.Yes, Disney offers rebound potential, perhaps one of the more credible Dow stocks on that front, but there is a lot of risk in this once beloved name over the near term. Apple AnguishApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the least bad Dow losers today, but that's not saying much and no one is going to be excited about a loss of about 3%.The culprit, though not surprising, was commentary from key Apple supplier Foxconn, which said revenue in the most recently completed quarter fell by the most on a year-over-year basis due to factory closures in China at the hands of the COVID-19 outbreak.In brighter news, those plants are back up to 50% capacity and Apple is just 10% below its 52-week high. These days, that's not bad. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOn a day like Thursday, positive vibes are hard to come by, but if you're looking for something along those lines, I'd point to China. Yes, China. Looking at a chart of the MSCI China Index, it looks like Chinese stocks have put in a coronavirus, a process that took more than a month from the emergence of the first case.There are no guarantees that a similar process will avail itself in U.S. stocks, but the playbook is clear: if investors have credible reason to believe the virus is being contained and not worsening here, it could facilitate a legitimate rebound, not these on again/off again, one-day rallies we've seen this week.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-11,"Stocks started Wednesday off on all the wrong notes, a situation that only got worse after the World Health Organization (WHO) officially called the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, news that gave sellers good reason to punish equities and riskier assets.Source: Provided by FinViz  * The S&P 500 dipped 4.89%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 5,86%  * The Nasdaq Composite swooned 4.70%  * Extending a tailspin of epic proportions, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was far and away the Dow's worst-performing stock today, plunging 16.79%.In late trading, the Dow was residing about 20% below its February record, fitting the technical definition of a bear market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be sure, coronavirus uncertainty is crippling financial markets and perhaps exacerbating today's declines was a surprising level of silence on the issue from the White House.In fact, things have gotten so bad that, for the second time in a month, Goldman Sachs is paring its year-end S&P 500 estimate, essentially calling for the end of a bull market that was already on thin ice.  * 9 Recession-Proof Stocks to Disinfect the Coronavirus These ominous headlines were greeted with a predictable result: in late trading none of the Dow's 30 stocks were higher. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the only member of the blue-chip index not lower by at least 3%. Boeing: Bad to WorseRegular readers of this space know that Boeing frequently makes appearances and rarely with good news. That theme continued today as the aerospace giant was slammed after the company said it's going to draw down the entirety of a $13.8 billion credit revolver. That news comes after Boeing said it had already taken $7.5 billion from that instrument.The original loan was $13 billion from Citigroup, but some other lenders tacked on $800 million and it could be boosted as high as $14.5 billion if other banks join in on the &quot;fun.&quot;Unfortunately, Boeing has morphed from a 737 Max story to coronavirus story because of declining demand and weakness among airlines. If orders for the 787 Dreamliner fall precipitously, which could happen in a recession, Boeing stock could be in for even more severe punishment.Boeing's Wednesday woes again weighed on United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which was also among the worst Dow offenders today. Apple ConcernsRecently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has looked somewhat less worse for the wear than the broader market, but that doesn't mean the iPhone maker has been immune from COVID-19-induced strife. As expected, the virus is going to have some impact on Apple and at least one analyst is confirming as much.In a note out earlier today, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan trimmed 2020 delivery estimates on iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watch and accessories.The analyst lowered his Apple earnings estimate to $12.57 a share, from $13.29 while cutting his price target on the stock to $320 from $350, but he did reiterate a &quot;buy&quot; rating. Don't DowIn this case, I'm referring to Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), a name that has been one of the worst-performing members in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for some time. Down almost 54% from its 52-week, Dow notched a double-digit loss today after the company said it expects sales to fall by $400 million in the current quarter due to the coronavirus. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayGood news is currently in short supply, but for those looking for some green shoots, it's worth noting that amid all the downward revisions to S&P 500 estimates that are currently taking place, many of the banks behind those forecasts are speculating that a new bull market will be born later this year.That's some time to wait and even those projections are imperiled by lack of clarity on when the COVID-19 situation will be resolved in the U.S. Until that happens, there's a significant headwind in front of the economy and riskier assets.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-03-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- U.S. airlines are on track to receive $50 billion in government aid, while Boeing Co. and aerospace suppliers are seeking at least $60 billion in assistance. Only one of those groups has shown any kind of self-sacrifice before putting its hand out.Details started to trickle out Wednesday on the Treasury Department's assistance proposal for an airline industry brought to its knees by a slew of border closings as the world desperately tries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The package will consist of secured loans, rather than the mix of loans, grants and tax relief the industry had sought, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. This will come on top of a relief package passed by the Senate late Wednesday that provides paid sick leave and food assistance for vulnerable populations and financial help for coronavirus testing.Underscoring the urgency of the sector’s needs, Delta Air Lines Inc. on Wednesday announced a stunning 70% reduction in flying capacity. Even that may not be enough: the current plans likely don’t reflect a closing of the U.S.-Canadian border that was announced earlier on Wednesday, nor any limits on domestic travel, which President Donald Trump has said are possible. As a result, Delta is parking half of its fleet — more than 600 planes — and deferring nearly all capital spending, including new aircraft deliveries. For the aerospace manufacturing sector, that means both significantly less maintenance work on existing jets and a dramatic drop in demand for new planes, fueling their call — championed by Boeing — for assistance. Everyone has an argument for why they need a hand, but only the airlines have publicly demonstrated a willingness to make changes to the way they run their business and compensate their leadership. Delta suspended its buyback program earlier this month. CEO Ed Bastian had already cut his salary to zero for the next six months and the board will now forgo its compensation as well. Officers and mid-level managers will also take pay cuts. United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have also announced spending reductions that include salary cuts or freezes for their executives, while American Airlines Group Inc. CEO Doug Parker is paid only in stock. “We are having constructive discussions with the White House and Congress, and remain optimistic that our industry will receive support to help address this crisis,” Delta CEO Bastian said in a note to employees on Wednesday. “That said, we have to continue to take all necessary self-help measures.” I’m not going to argue that the airlines are some beacon of corporate responsibility, and the reality is these cash preservation measures aren’t going to be enough on their own to save some of these companies if the worst-case scenario for the coronavirus pandemic is realized. But it’s better than doing nothing and the symbolism is important for anyone who has their eyes on government cash. And the silence on this front from Boeing and its suppliers has been deafening. Not a single major U.S. aerospace manufacturing CEO has announced a pay cut to my knowledge. That includes Boeing’s David Calhoun, who collected annual six-figure cash payouts during his decade on the board and then was awarded a $1.4 million salary, a regular bonus that will pay out at a minimum of about $2.5 million this year and the promise of a special $7 million payout if he hits certain strategic milestones when he became CEO earlier this year. As a major engine supplier, General Electric Co. is likely to be part of any conversation about an industry-wide bailout, even though it has access to $35 billion in bank lines. CEO Larry Culp’s $2.5 million base salary is the highest for any CEO on the S&P 500 Industrials Index. Including bonuses, pension and stock grants, aviation division chief David Joyce made nearly $24 million last year on an SEC reported basis, according to GE’s proxy filing. Whether GE individually appeals for support or — as is more likely — just tags along for any broader package, those numbers will be difficult to explain to the American taxpayers that are footing the bill.Notably, the airlines haven’t yet taken the ax to their dividends, but these pale in comparison to payouts from the aerospace suppliers. Boeing paid nearly $5 billion in dividends to shareholders last year, while Delta paid less than $1 billion. United Technologies Corp. doled out $2.4 billion in dividends, while United paid nothing. GE already cut its quarterly dividend to a mere penny per share and halted share repurchases while it dealt with a severe drop in demand for its gas turbines. But other big suppliers and Boeing have been mum on this front. Bloomberg’s Dividend Forecasting model is currently projecting Boeing’s dividend falls by more than half. Its buyback program was suspended in the wake of a global grounding of the 737 Max jet following two fatal crashes.  Boeing is also set to use debt to finance a $4.2 billion purchase of a majority stake in a joint venture with Embraer SA’s commercial-jet business. Asked if the deal would be scrapped to help preserve cash, a Boeing spokesperson said, “We don’t comment publicly on discussions between the parties or market speculation. We are addressing the regulatory approvals process and outstanding closing conditions.” The venture is key to maintaining a competitive balance with Airbus SE, which has taken over Bombardier Inc.’s regional jet business. But strategic M&A is the ultimate example of discretionary spending in times of need and that deal — already held up for more than a year by European regulators — should increasingly be viewed as at risk. There’s no such thing as a free bailout. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The downward angle isn't too steep, so it's probably not a major concern yet.  * The stock was recently rejected at $180.

2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- First, it was ventilators for hospitals. Now, it’s thermal body scanners for factories.Demand for thermal-imaging equipment to screen workers’ temperatures is soaring as manufacturers and businesses prepare to return to operations while trying to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Two of the industry’s biggest manufacturers -- Flir Systems Inc. and closely held Seek Thermal Inc. -- say they’re rushing to meet demand.“When the virus moved in to Europe and North America, it was more Fortune 500 companies, hospital and health-care networks and immediate needs from essential business that were required to operate,” Flir Chief Executive Officer Jim Cannon said in an interview. Now, talks with customers have transitioned to what will be required to keep workers safe when they’re allowed to return to work.Flir’s shares gained as much as 16% Monday, buoyed by prospects for the industry after Reuters reported on Amazon.com Inc.’s plans to use thermal cameras at its warehouses and Whole Foods locations. Amazon wouldn’t identify the company making its scanners, and Wilsonville, Oregon-based Flir declined to comment. Seek Thermal said it has not supplied equipment to Amazon.Automakers including General Motors Co. have also confirmed they’re using thermal scanners, without naming their suppliers.Big DemandScanners can be used to detect higher body temperatures, a common symptom of Covid-19. They measure temperature on the skin’s surface using infrared light to create a thermal image. They come in different forms from complex, fixed-position scanners to more basic hand-held devices. Costs can range from $2,500 to $15,000 each.Santa Barbara, California-based Seek Thermal, a younger and much smaller company than Flir, says it’s the second-largest producer by volume but focuses on lower-cost products, such as sensors that can be installed and used without training. Flir, by comparison, offers more complex solutions along with installation and training for thermographers.Even so, Seek Thermal developed a body scanner in six weeks after demand first surged in Asia.“We have been inundated,” Bill Parrish, a Seek Thermal co-founder, said in an interview. Calls are coming from larger Fortune 500 companies, he added. “They are doing demos and evaluations to help them open up their factories. There is a big demand.”Broader UsePrior to the Covid-19 outbreak, sales of thermal-imaging equipment and scanners was largely to the military and government authorities for use in border checks. About a third of Flir’s revenue comes from the U.S. government, according to supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg.On an earnings call in February, Cannon had said he didn’t expect Covid-spurred demand for thermal cameras to be a “needle mover” for the company, which had $1.89 billion in sales for 2019. That might be changing now that impact on the U.S. economy has become more evident, an analyst said.“It is likely that thermal cameras will be more commonly used as a screening device for large gatherings” such as sporting events, factories, and entertainment venues including Broadway theaters, Louie DiPalma, an analyst for William Blair & Co., wrote in a report Monday. He maintained the equivalent of a buy rating on Flir.Flir and Seek Thermal’s executives both said they’re confident they can meet the demand, but some customers may have to wait because of the intricacies of the technology and tight supply of some materials, such as aluminum used for the casings.“If overnight huge industries place huge orders, that certainly will take time to satisfy those orders,” Flir’s Cannon said. The company is prioritizing sales to health-care providers and essential businesses, particularly as the lead time for manufacturing lengthens.Fulfilling OrdersSeek Thermal has intellectual property-sharing arrangements with Raytheon Technologies Corp. and NXP Semiconductors NV, giving it some supply chain flexibility. Even so, building the equipment’s core or chip set takes time.“The problem is that when this pandemic turned up and you open the valve and say you want these tomorrow, you’re actually many months away,” Parrish said. “So it comes down to how many units you had in your inventory.”And the technology does have limits. “I am very careful to say that while we can measure a body temperature, that does not mean they are infected,” Cannon said. “There are other things that can cause elevated temperature.”Seek Thermal’s Parrish shares the sentiment. “Thermal imaging is not a panacea for determining whether or not you have a fever or whether or not you have Covid-19,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Rush for Thermal Cameras Boosts Flir Before Factories Reopen

2020-05-31,"Investors are always ready to buy into a good value, and in today’s markets – with their combination of bear cycle and bull rally – those value stocks are more appealing than ever. Using TipRanks’ database, which features extensive market data collated in real time, we’ve pulled up the details on three great stock market values. All three of these stocks offer investors a solid package: a one-year upside potential of at least 10%, a dividend over 2%, and a history of long-term share appreciation. While all three are down in the current market cycle, Wall Street’s analyst corps sees each of them as a Strong Buy. Even the economic shutdowns, which forced so many companies into losses for Q1, couldn’t derail these three – each showed profits in the quarter, and beat the earnings forecasts. Let’s dive into the details, and find out what makes these three stocks so valuable. Procter & Gamble Company (PG) We’ll start with one of the blue-chip staples of the Dow Jones average. Procter & Gamble showed steady earnings growth through 2019, beating estimates in every quarter, before recording a sharp drop in Q1. That drop, however, needs to be put into context – the company’s calendar first quarter is historically its lowest of the year. Not to mention Q1 2020 reflected both a fifth consecutive earnings beat and a modest year-over-year gain of 4.4%, despite the economic shutdowns. In an odd way, the coronavirus crisis may have even helped PG – the company’s strong presence in the home & consumer health, personal care, and hygiene niches meant that demand for PG products remained strong, even as overall consumer activity declined. In the company’s Q1 earnings release (PG’s fiscal Q3), the company reported 4.2% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition to its solid position in the current environment, Procter & Gamble is also one of the market’s true dividend champs. The company has a 16-year history of steady dividend growth and reliable payments. The current payment is 79 cents, the company raised it by 4 cents in Q1, annualizing to $3.16 per quarter and giving a yield of 2.7%. While that is only slightly higher than the consumer goods sector average of 2.5%, Procter’s dividend is backed by that long history – and it has a payout ratio of 64%, indicating that the payment is easily sustainable with current income levels. Covering PG stock for Evercore ISI, Robert Ottenstein headlines his note “Better, More Resilient, Wiser.” As for forward prospects, Ottenstein writes, “We see Procter as a reliable 6-8% EPS grower, as underscored by the firm’s confidence to raise the dividend by 6% in the face of unprecedented challenges…” Ottenstein keeps his Buy rating on PG shares, and raises his price target from $130 to $140. This implies 21% upside potential for the stock in the coming 12 months. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) Overall, PG’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 10 reviews, which include 9 Buys against a single Hold. Wall Street is slightly less aggressive here than Ottenstein, but the $133 average price target still suggests an upside potential of 15%. (See Procter & Gamble stock analysis on TipRanks) Linde PLC (LIN) Next up is Linde, an important player in the industrial gas industry. This is not a consumer utility; rather, Linde dominates the market for pure gasses such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon, along with compound gasses such as carbon monoxide. All have important uses in industry, especially within the medical and HVAC sectors – which have been deemed essential even during the public health crisis. Like PG above, Linde has a secure niche and product line-up despite the recessionary pressures. The quality of Linde’s market position is demonstrated by the quarterly performance. Where most companies registered declines or even losses, Linde reported Q1 EPS level with Q4. At $1.89, the quarterly earnings beat the forecast by 3.2%, and was the fifth quarter in a row to top the estimates. In another similarity to PG, Linde’s continued profitability is directly related to its strong presence in the healthcare industry. Some 20% of company revenues come from sales in the medical field (oxygen, for example, is a vital item in treating respiratory ailments), and Linde has been able to successfully absorb losses in other segments. With revenues secure, Linde was not shy about declaring its dividend going forward. The company announced that it will pay out 96 cents per share in Q2. That annualizes to $3.85, and gives a yield almost exactly at the S&P average: 2%. Michael Sison, 5-star analyst with Well Fargo, makes the simple case for LIN shares, “[We] believe this stable cash flow business and strong balance sheet make LIN an attractive story in the current uncertain environment.  We also view LIN as a growth story, with the $9.5B project backlog as the pipeline for future earnings growth.  Finally, we continue to expect the company to deliver on additional merger cost and revenue synergies once the recovery starts to take shape, likely before 2021.” To this end, Sison puts a $235 price target on the stock, showing his confidence in a 16% one-year upside potential. With this positive outlook, Sison rates the stock a Buy. (To watch Sison’s track record, click here) LIN is another stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares have 22 reviews on record, breaking down into 17 Buys and 5 Holds. The current trading price is $202.34, and the average price target of $216 implies room for 7% growth this year. (See Linde stock analysis on TipRanks) Raytheon Technologies (RTX) Last on our list is Raytheon, a staple in the aerospace and defense industries, as well as a major contractor for the Pentagon. Raytheon’s better-known products include radars for the Air Force’s front line fighter aircraft and many of the military’s front line air-to-air and air-to-surface guided missiles.  No one ever went broke selling weapons, and Raytheon is a good example of that old saw. The company’s $1.78 Q1 EPS was 60% higher than the estimates. Even more impressive, it was the eighth quarter in a row that RTX beat the earnings estimates. The solid EPS was derived from $18.2 billion in revenues, a figure in-line with both the estimates and the year-ago figure. Raytheon management declared a 47.5 cent quarterly dividend, to be paid out in June. In deference to the difficult economic times, and the possibility of reduced defense contracts as budgets contract, this dividend was a sharp decline from the 74 cents paid out in Q4. The important point for investors, however, is that Raytheon remains committed to maintaining its dividend, with the yield at 2.8%, which is above the industrial goods sector average of 2%. In his note on RTX for Credit Suisse, 5-star analyst Robert Spingarn states, “[We] assume that RTX defense can sustain a 2019-2022 sales CAGR of 6%+ (consistent with its record backlog), and that improving trends for defense margins, working capital, and capex can offset pension headwinds, then RTX defense likely stands to generate ~$5.3 billion of FCF in 2022…” This solid outlook contributes to his Buy rating and $81 price target on the stock. At current prices, this target implies a 26% potential upside to RTX. (To watch Spingarn’s track record, click here) With a share price of $64.52, and an average price target of $75.25, RTX boasts a 17% upside potential for the next 12 months. The consensus on the Street here is a Strong Buy, with 11 Buy reviews and 3 Holds. (See Raytheon stock analysis on TipRanks)",3 “Strong Buy” Value Stocks Gearing up for Gains

2020-06-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Raytheon Technologies Corp. Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes spent weeks delivering grim news to employees about furloughs, pay cuts and hiring freezes as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the economy.“While many of these measures have been difficult, it is the right thing to do for the business,” Hayes said on a May 7 conference call with analysts as he outlined billions of dollars in cost reductions.Just weeks later, the company tweaked terms for stock awards issued to Hayes and a large group of other managers, instantly boosting the value of their unvested awards by more than $100 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg News. Raytheon didn’t specify how much of the windfall would go to Hayes and his top lieutenants, but the figure is likely in the tens of millions of dollars.Behind the gains, which have yet to be realized, lies the complex math that determines how equity awards are treated in large corporate transactions -- in Raytheon’s case, two spinoffs and one merger all closing on the same day. Further complicating the situation: extreme stock volatility caused by the pandemic.The change was made to ensure employees aren’t short-changed by big swings in the stock price, according to a regulatory filing Friday. Raytheon said it was reviewed and authorized by a committee of independent directors and that it’s meant to preserve employee retention and morale, as well as the company’s reputation as a “superior employer.” In previous filings, the company said it reserved the right to retroactively make certain changes to equity awards as a result of the transactions.“They may have had the right but the issue is whether exercising that right breached an obligation to the stockholders,” said James Cox, a Duke University professor who specializes in corporate and securities law.Bethany Sherman, a spokeswoman for Raytheon, declined to comment beyond the filing.Deal CompletionAbout 3,900 current and former employees, many of them working below the executive suite, hold equity awards that will be affected by the new calculation. But companies tend to reserve the largest awards for those in leadership roles.The change followed the completion of a series of deals that Hayes has overseen in recent years.An accountant by training, Hayes was named CEO of manufacturing conglomerate United Technologies Corp. in 2014 after serving in various finance positions. In late 2018, the company announced that it would spin off two major divisions -- the Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioner businesses -- into individual publicly traded firms so it could focus on aerospace and defense. Last June, the company struck a deal to merge with weapons manufacturer Raytheon Co.Read more: United Technologies, Raytheon to Create Aerospace GiantThe completion of the spinoffs and merger were announced April 3. The combined company adopted Raytheon Technologies as its new name, and its shares began trading that day.For Hayes and other Raytheon leaders, the following few days were crucial. Every move in the stock price would have an impact on one of their key benefits: Equity awards worth millions of dollars.Fresh SharesWhen public companies combine, it typically falls on a group of accountants and lawyers to figure out what to do with the troves of unvested restricted shares and stock options the two executive teams typically hold. Awards from the predecessor firms are typically canceled and replaced by fresh ones issued by the new entity, with similar terms and conditions.Figuring out exactly how many new securities should be issued for each old one can be tricky given the fickle nature of stock prices. So companies resort to calculating a conversion ratio that’s based on the price over a period of a few days.Earlier this year, Raytheon disclosed that it would use the average price on the fourth and fifth day that its new shares traded.The measurement period coincided with a stretch of unusual volatility in U.S. equities. From Raytheon’s first day of trading on April 3 through its fifth day on April 9, the S&P 500 rose 10%, rebounding from the sharp drop sparked by shelter-in-place orders and concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy.‘Material Discontinuity’Raytheon, which had closed at $49.93 on its first day of trading, also surged. On the fourth and fifth days, it closed at $62.62 and $64.71, respectively. As a result, the two-day average used to calculate how many new shares executives would get came out to about $63.67 -- more than 25% above where the stock had been just days earlier.The increase, Raytheon said Friday, caused “material discontinuity” between that figure and the share price of United Technologies on its last day of trading. So it opted to retroactively change the terms of that calculation. Instead of using the $63.67 figure, the company will use the opening price on its first day of trading, which was $51.It “preserves the company’s ability to continue to treat employees and retirees fairly in the conversion process,” the company said.For Hayes and others who hold unvested equity awards, the lower price is much better. It means they will receive more new shares and options in exchange for their old award than if the higher figure had been used. And for those who own stock options or so-called stock appreciation rights, the benefit will be double, because the adjustment will also lower the strike price of the new securities.Pay CutsThe boost comes at a tough time.Hayes said May 7 that the company was cutting about $2 billion in costs and making further efforts to conserve billions of dollars in cash, including furloughing an undisclosed number of workers, deferring merit increases and cutting pay for some salaried employees in the second half of this year.Hayes will take a 20% salary reduction. The cut won’t affect his equity awards.(Updates with price-swing protections in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Raytheon Bosses Get Merger Windfall Amid Furloughs, Pay Cuts"

2020-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Anduril Industries Inc., a Southern California startup that builds technology for military agencies and border surveillance, said it raised a new funding round nearly doubling the company’s valuation to $1.9 billion.Silicon Valley money has rapidly propelled the three-year-old company. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz led the latest financing, which totaled $200 million. The investment firm also participated in a deal about a year ago, along with Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and other VCs, that valued Anduril at about $1 billion. That was four times the valuation from a year earlier.The business is controversial. Anduril builds surveillance towers and drones, along with software to automatically monitor areas like international borders and the perimeter of military bases. “We founded Anduril because we believe there is value in Silicon Valley technology companies partnering with the Department of Defense,” Brian Schimpf, the chief executive officer of Anduril, said in a statement Wednesday.But it’s Anduril’s work with other agencies that draws the greatest criticism. The company’s first government contracts were with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, where it put up towers along the U.S.-Mexican border. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of the agency, told Congress in February that immigration authorities planned to have 200 autonomous surveillance towers in place this year. On Thursday, Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the tower system was a “program of record,” meaning it’s essential enough to have a dedicated line of funding from Congress, and that the towers would operate 24 hours a day, independent of the electrical grid. Few VC-backed startups have seriously pursued military contracts, mostly ceding the field to huge, politically connected defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp., and Boeing Co. This is partially due to the impression that small companies will get too bogged down in government work to become profitable and partially because of political controversies surrounding high-tech surveillance and autonomous weapons.Anduril was founded in 2017 on the idea that such hesitation is an opportunity. Founders of the Irvine, California-based company include veterans of Thiel’s Palantir Technologies Inc.—a major contractor to government agencies including immigration officials—as well as Palmer Luckey, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump whose 2017 departure from Facebook Inc. became a flashpoint in an intramural political debate in Silicon Valley.Last year, Anduril expanded beyond surveillance, building a system of small drones that will automatically ram targets that enter contested airspace. Its initial pitch is to defend against small drones used to surveil or attack military bases, though Anduril has said the product could be expanded to combat larger targets in the future. Marc Andreessen described Anduril in a blog post last fall as part of a “new generation of Silicon Valley-style defense vendors.”Anduril now has more than 30 federal contracts which could be worth over $200 million, according to an analysis by Tech Inquiry, a research group. Anduril has said it works with U.S. allies, too, including the U.K. Ministry of Defense.(Updates with Customs and Border Protection statement in the fourth paragraph.  )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Peter Thiel-Backed Surveillance Startup Anduril Is Valued at $1.9 Billion

2020-07-22,Raytheon Technologies' (RTX) Q2 performance is likely to have been affected by significant decrease in air travel resulting from the pandemic.,What Awaits Raytheon Technologies (RTX) in Q2 Earnings?
2020-07-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Add the lackluster performance of defense stocks to the long list of puzzling inequities in the pandemic stock market. A custom basket of top U.S. defense contractors within the S&P 500 Index is down about 20% for the year, even as the broader benchmark pushed into the green this week. Even excluding Boeing Co., whose commercial aerospace travails are more of a focus for investors, the group is still down about 16%. That’s significantly worse than the performance for S&P 500 railroads, restaurants, foot-wear makers and soft-drink companies, all of which are more immediately exposed to the volatility of economic reopenings and behavioral shifts than makers of missiles, fighter jets and radar systems that rely on government contracts sealed years earlier. Lockheed Martin Corp., which reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, displayed the sector's resilience amid the pandemic upheaval. Earnings, sales and cash flow were all higher than the year-earlier period, with cash balances helped in part by accelerated progress payments from the Department of Defense that were then passed on to suppliers. At a time when most companies are hesitant to make any concrete predictions about the immediate future, Lockheed touted a record $150.3 billion backlog and actually raised its guidance on all fronts. And yet even after a respectable 2.6% gain on Tuesday's earnings report, Lockheed still trades at roughly 14 times its estimated earnings in 2021. The valuation discount to the broader S&P 500 is just shy of the widest spread in at least five years.Fellow defense contractors Raytheon Technologies Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are scheduled to report results next week, as is Boeing.The reason for the defense sector’s underperformance appears multi-fold. For one, defense contractors don’t really fit with the technology-focused bent of the recent upswing in stocks and because their business didn’t crash and burn as much as many others did, there’s less room for that mythical, V-shaped recovery many still hope will occur.  Second, as Congress debates injecting at least $1 trillion more in stimulus funds into the pandemic-stricken economy, the deficit is set to explode and the government will likely have to make up some of that spending elsewhere. The worry is that the U.S.’s gargantuan defense budget will be a prime target, particularly if former Vice President Joe Biden succeeds in unseating President Donald Trump in this year's presidential election.Any hit to defense spending isn’t likely to be as bad as what’s suggested by current valuations, though. While the deficit may put a cap on defense spending growth, the volatile geopolitical situation likely creates a floor. Historically, there's a weak correlation between deficit-related economic variables — whether that’s business cycles or changes in tax policy — and defense spending, Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland noted on a call earlier this month. Material shifts in budgets tend to be more a reflection of changes in national-security posture, he said, such as President Barack Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq or President Ronald Reagan’s more aggressive stance toward Russia during the early part of his administration. And there’s not much room for that kind of rethink right now, regardless of who gets elected. Tensions are still running hot with the likes of Iran and North Korea, while Russia and China have taken increasingly aggressive postures. Copeland pointed to a Gallup poll published in March that found half of Americans view the current level of defense spending as “about right,” the highest percentage in more than 50 years. Asked on Lockheed’s earnings call Tuesday if the defense budget would decline, new CEO Jim Taiclet declined to “speculate on the behavior of people that are going to make independent decisions that we can’t predict,” but said the company’s divisions are planning for a wide range of scenarios to be prepared for any outcome. He made a point of citing a downturn as a potential opportunity for Lockheed to take advantage of depressed asset prices through strategic M&A. At the end of the day, “sentiment is fickle, while fundamentals are facts,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote in a report last month. “While we think defense companies can’t do much about the slowing Department of Defense budget outlook, they are still growing and have good visibility, good cash flow and good valuations.” What more do you want? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dissecting earnings reports is always more of an art than a science. That’s particularly true in a pandemic, when the state of play changes at an ever-faster clip. With a surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. Sun Belt and burgeoning concerns about a second wave in Europe and parts of Asia, any glimmers of insight from companies who operate on the ground floor of the economy carry extra weight. Nearly five months into this pandemic, CEOs in the manufacturing sector appear to at least have a handle on what’s happening with their businesses, for better or for worse. Tuesday brought results from three companies that sit at key fault lines in the industrial economy: 3M Co., Rockwell Automation Inc. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. Here are my top takeaways: 3M Co. : The maker of N95 masks has been on the front line of the pandemic, but even in normal recessions, it’s usually one of the first companies to see the early signs of a recovery, given the fast turnaround time for many of its products. So it’s particularly encouraging that 3M says it’s actually seeing July sales trending up by a low-single digit percentage compared to a year earlier. That compares with a 13.1% decline on an organic basis in the second quarter that was slightly worse that what analysts had been anticipating, one possible reason for the stock’s slide on the news. The forward trajectory is all that really matters at this point, though. Sales of N95 masks and other protective gear have undoubtedly been one big driver of the growth in July, with 3M on track to make two billion of the respirators this year. But other companies including Fastenal Co. and Cintas Corp. have predicted a moderation of the surge-style spikes seen in the earlier days of the pandemic in April and May as the market is now comparably better-supplied. More importantly, for those seeking signs of economic revival, 3M cited “broad-based sales improvements across businesses and geographies.” While this doesn’t necessarily augur a V-shaped recovery for the manufacturing sector, it does suggest things are moving in the right direction. The cloud over any rebound for 3M is its potential liabilities related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and other ailments. 3M reached an agreement last week with Alabama that will see it assess contamination from the so-called forever chemicals; invest in treatment and remediation; and research the substances impact on health and the environment — at an unspecified cost to the company. Some analysts had been expecting 3M to take another significant charge on PFAS in the second quarter and the missed opportunity to “kitchen-sink” what were going to be ugly numbers anyway may also be a factor in the stock reaction. Rockwell Automation Inc.: Continuing with the theme of possible green shoots of recovery, Rockwell CEO Blake Moret is confident enough in the trajectory of his company’s recovery that he announced intentions to roll back temporary pay cuts for employees by December and “hopefully sooner.” Rockwell also intends to make another “recognition payment” to manufacturing workers who have continued to come in to factories and kept its operations grinding along. While some companies have had to turn furloughs into permanent job cuts as the pandemic and associated economic slump have dragged on longer than expected, this is an important counterpoint. It speaks to a broader trend across the industrial landscape of companies prioritizing labor and seeking cost cuts elsewhere first in recognition of the unique nature of this particular downturn and shifting expectations of the corporate world’s duty to the community. Railroads CSX Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. have also said they are bringing workers off of furlough as volumes rebound. In terms of numbers, Rockwell actually increased its fiscal 2020 profit guidance for the year and now anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60 on an organic sales decline of about 8%. This is based on an expectation that a “gradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain.” Coming out of this crisis, Rockwell is set to be a key beneficiary of any significant push to bring manufacturing work back to North America. Raytheon Technologies Corp. : Whatever recovery is happening in manufacturing, it isn’t showing up in the world of commercial aerospace, with flight travel still at a crawl. Raytheon — formed earlier this year from the merger of United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. — burned through nearly $250 million of cash in the first quarter as stable results from its defense businesses failed to offset a disastrous slump in the aerospace operations. The Collins Aerospace parts division, previously the company’s most profitable, was barely in the green on an adjusted basis in the second quarter and Raytheon took a $3.2 billion goodwill writedown on the roughly $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. in 2018 that helped form the unit. The charge reflects the deteriorating outlook for commercial aerospace due to the coronavirus, which no one could have predicted, but it’s worth remembering that the deal was very expensive from the start and the assumptions underpinning that price tag relied on quite a lot of things breaking the company’s way. The Pratt & Whitney engine segment saw sales tumble more than 30% excluding the impact of M&A and currency swings. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said the company had cut 8,000 positions in its commercial aerospace divisions and said some of that reduction would be permanent, a shift from the first quarter when he warned about cutting too deep. Arguably, things could have been uglier. The question now is whether the worst is truly behind the company. A slide in the earnings presentation termed “Current Environment” has big question marks next to projections for commercial air traffic and macroeconomic conditions. In case it wasn’t clear what those meant, they are also colored gray, as in this is a gray area.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It would be hard for things to get much worse in commercial aerospace, an industry hit particularly hard by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Sober tones and a slew of writedowns out of industry stalwarts Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. provided more evidence of just how dour the outlook is from here.Second-quarter results from the two companies on Wednesday were predictably bleak for a period that included the worst of the coronavirus slump in air travel and a rush to ground unneeded planes, retire older models and cancel orders for new ones. The best that could be said is that the nearly $8 billion in cash that Boeing and GE burned through collectively in the quarter wasn’t quite as terrible as analysts had feared. GE at least indicated it expected a  sequential improvement in overall company cash flow in the second half of the year, with a return to positive numbers by 2021.Given CEO Larry Culp’s tendency to set a low bar, the company’s usual back-end-weighted seasonality and the likelihood of some moderation in the pressures facing the aviation business as cost cuts take effect and planes come back into service, there’s at least a possibility that GE could end up with a moderately positive number this year — although Culp was reluctant to commit to that when pestered repeatedly by analysts on the earnings call. Boeing, too, may find a path to positive cash flow in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the earnings call, but there’s little hope of redemption on that front this year. Both companies are bracing for a lower-growth future.Boeing announced fresh cuts to production plans it had already dialed back in April to reflect weaker demand for both its grounded 737 Max and the wide-body 787 and 777 models that are typically used for longer-haul, international flights. In an email to employees, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun warned that the company was studying the feasibility of consolidating 787 production in one facility, given the lower rate. A plan to ramp up production of the Max to 31 planes a month by the beginning of 2022 — versus an earlier target of 2021 — may still be too optimistic, writes Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. While U.S. regulators have signaled they may finally be ready to lift a grounding order by early in the fourth quarter, Boeing still has roughly 450 undelivered Max planes sitting in storage. Delivering those to airline customers who aren’t at all interested in adding to their fleets right now will be a challenge. “I don’t know why we would” take delivery of a Max jet this year, Gary Kelly, CEO of the plane’s largest operator, Southwest Airlines Co., said in an interview with Bloomberg News last week. Calhoun estimates it will take about three years for passenger traffic to recover to 2019 levels. The production cuts, of course, are also bad news for GE, which makes the engines for the Max, the 787 and the yet-to-be-approved 777X. “This will be a multi-year recovery, given the dynamics on the existing fleet and new deliveries going forward,” Culp of GE said in a phone interview. Asked why he hadn’t followed Boeing and fellow aerospace suppliers Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. in putting a specific time frame on getting the aerospace market back to last year’s levels, he said he didn’t take issue with forecasts for a recovery by 2023 to 2024, but cautioned that there’s “a level of false precision in that.” On a call with analysts, he flagged some early signs of improvement — particularly in China, where plane departures were trending down only 9% year over year in late July, compared with earlier slumps of more than 70%. But the coronavirus creates a hosts of unknowns. “As we work through all of this, we’re mindful that the fall is going to be really important,” Culp said in the interview. “What happens with cases? How do governments respond? How does the public respond, let alone the flying public? Operationally, we have a conservative posture.”Unlike Boeing — which signaled on Wednesday that it would likely need to cut more than the roughly 16,000 jobs it has already announced it was eliminating — Culp said it would be premature to look at an expansion of GE’s plans to reduce its aviation division’s headcount by 25%. A plethora of charges gummed up the numbers at both companies. Ranging from acquisition writedowns to asset impairments, severance expenses and ongoing headaches related to the Max, these charges are a testament to the severe rethink of growth expectations in what had been a high-flying industry. Most notable at Boeing was a $923 million charge in its services arm related to severance expenses and an impaired view of certain assets due to the coronavirus. Calhoun appeared to walk back his predecessor’s goal of building a services business with $50 billion in revenue in an interview with Aviation Week earlier this month. He cited a need for “transparency and support” for the supply chain and a preference for airlines to buy newer, more efficient jets rather than tap Boeing for services so they can keep flying old ones. The push into lucrative maintenance and spare-parts work by previous CEO Dennis Muilenburg had ruffled the feathers of suppliers who were simultaneously being pushed to drastically cut costs. Taken together, the charge and the comments suggest Boeing is planning for a future where there’s less of this kind of aircraft spending to go around. On a similar note, GE took a $608 million charge in the second quarter related to its aerospace long-term service agreements to reflect updated billing and cost assumptions, including lower expectations for aircraft utilization. GE also took a roughly $900 million goodwill writedown related to its 2016 purchases of 3D-printing companies Arcam and Concept Laser as the growth expectations that underwrote those pricey takeovers got pushed out with the slump in aviation. It’s also writing down $839 million of goodwill in its GECAS aircraft lessor arm, with the bulk of that related to the $1.8 billion takeover of helicopter leasing company Milestone Aviation of 2015. Analysts had warned that business might be subject to writedowns since late 2018 when rival Waypoint Leasing Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. For Boeing and GE — two companies still trying to right themselves from major setbacks that predate the pandemic — the Covid reckoning has been a bruiser. And the pain will continue for the foreseeable future.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-08-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The aerospace sector is headed for “a slow, multi-year recovery,” General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp warned on last month’s second-quarter earnings call. There’s nothing unique about that view: Boeing Co. has said it will take about three years for air-travel demand to recover to 2019 levels; Raytheon Technologies Corp. is targeting 2023; and the International Air Transport Association recently pushed back its timeline for a recovery to 2024.The slump is particularly painful for GE, though. Unlike many of its rivals in the market for airplane production, it was already in the middle of a multi-year turnaround before the pandemic hit. The news that influential shareholder Trian Fund Management  — led by Nelson Peltz — is trimming its position in the industrial giant should be viewed in that context.Trian cut its stake in GE by 46% during the last week to just over 32 million shares, according to regulatory filings. The sale was for “portfolio management purposes, including to provide for new positions,” Trian said in an emailed statement. Even with the divestiture, the fund remains relatively high up on GE’s shareholder register and chief investment officer Ed Garden will continue to serve on GE’s board. So Trian is hardly abandoning the investment, nor has it given up hope of a recovery. “Trian is highly supportive of GE CEO Larry Culp and his team’s restructuring efforts and focus on creating long term value,” the fund said. Still, it’s a tough time to be selling.GE shares are down more than 40% this year, compared with a nearly 4% gain for the S&P 500 Index. Trian’s average price for the sales was just over $6, a nearly 75% discount to the mid-$20 range where GE was trading during the month leading up to the fund’s October 2015 announcement of its investment.Back then, Trian argued the market wasn’t appreciating the “bold steps” that former CEO Jeff Immelt had taken to reshape the company and touted the “defensive growth” profile. By improving operating margins and adding $20 billion of debt to help fund share buybacks, the stock could trade for $40 to $45, Trian argued. It never came close.GE has since been bogged down by tens of billions in writedowns, with the brunt tied to a steep funding shortfall in its long-term care insurance business and an ill-timed acquisition of Alstom SA’s power business that increased the company’s position in the gas turbine market just as demand began to rapidly deteriorate. Immelt’s replacement, John Flannery, was pushed out and Culp took his place in late 2018. Buybacks are out of the question, with the company having instead spent the past few years doing everything it can to reduce a debt load that became untenable as the power business burned through cash.Culp was just starting to show progress on a turnaround of the embattled power unit when the pandemic arrived, with the high-margin and cash-flow generating pharmaceutical diagnostics and aviation units getting crushed the hardest. The company has recorded a cash outflow of more than $4 billion so far in 2020 and Culp was hesitant to give a firm commitment to a positive number for the second half of the year, which is typically when GE makes most of its money. Will GE survive the crisis? Yes, and it’s to Culp’s credit that’s the case. He has aggressively cut costs, accelerated asset sales and generally done a much better job fixing this massive enterprise than critics like myself thought was possible when he started. But what will the company look like on the other side of this?Siemens Healthineers AG’s announcement of a $16 billion purchase of cancer radiotherapy company Varian Medical Systems Inc. earlier this week speaks to the risk of missed opportunities. The Varian deal is pricey and risky with hospitals cutting their budgets to adapt to the pandemic. But the combination of Siemens Healthineers’ diagnostics expertise and Varian's treatment technology is strategically intriguing over the long haul and the takeover could end up being opportunistic. In a different world, this deal might have been GE’s to lose. After all, the CEO of Varian is a former GE Healthcare executive. As it is, the company is effectively side-lined from any kind of major M&A for the foreseeable future.Culp likes to talk about getting GE to a place where it can “play offense.” But the timeline for doing that has been pushed out indeterminately by the pandemic. In the meantime, there are more attractive places that both Trian and other investors can put their money. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Can You Blame It?
2020-08-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Covid-19 may have left roads around the globe barren of cars, but it hasn’t stopped China from claiming leadership over the world of navigation and digital mapping. Watch out, GPS.Big plans are in the making. China has launched the final leg of its BeiDou Navigation Satellite system, or BDS, completing the build-out of a network that competes with America’s ubiquitous Global Positioning System and Europe’s Galileo. Regulators have effectively set a framework of standards for intelligent mobility, while separately committing to double down with financial help and incentives for companies that leverage these technologies. Ran Chengqi, director of China’s Satellite Navigation Office, has said the country is set to build a supply chain of chips, modules, boards and other services for BeiDou.As the U.S. puts up national security walls against Chinese companies and Beijing pushes ahead with self-sufficiency goals, the growing satellite network now stands to rival the U.S. version, which began as a military project in the 1970s and has essentially had a monopoly in the navigation and mapping field thus far. The systems are compatible with each other to some extent, meaning there’s room for interoperability and eventual replacement. However, on certain metrics, the latest version of BeiDou is better: Its signals are accurate down to 0.41 meters versus GPS’ 0.5 meters on average, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts. China has said that 100% of the key components for the BDS-3 satellite are being domestically produced.Whether China’s system eventually becomes what GPS has been to the world for decades  — used in everything from military targeting to unsnarling traffic jams to finding you a nearby Italian restaurant — is less important at this point than the fact that Beijing is focused on getting ahead and creating an ecosystem around it, including supply chains of manufacturers and service providers. The real benefits of BDS could accrue to China’s industrial complex. Stocks have surged in homegrown firms like Guangzhou Haige Communications Group Inc. and Beijing BDStar Navigation Co. that provide relevant products and services. Over the last five years, research and development expenditure amounted to between 10% and 15% of the companies’ revenues. The output value of the satellite navigation industry is expected to exceed 400 billion yuan ($57 billion) this year. Several other companies that once made radio devices and walkie-talkies are now front-runners in the satellite communication space. That’s brought down costs, allowing for wider application in logistics, farms and factories at a time when Beijing needs to boost efficiency and productivity to bolster growth.Already, BeiDou – with 56 satellites – is perceived as “more advanced, and offers higher precision and sophisticated coverage” when compared to its U.S. and Russian rivals, which currently have 35 and 30 orbiters respectively, according to Jefferies. Regulators last week noted that chips that enable devices to tap the navigation system are being mass manufactured, with an output value of almost $50 billion last year. The system is increasingly being utilized; more than 100 countries across Africa, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia now employ it to some extent. Several Belt and Road participants are starting to use China’s “Space Silk Road” for smart port and land charting, for example. At home, mapping services are employed in the machinery and automobile industries, and in taxis, trucks and fishing vessels. Can it go beyond this?Sure, the U.S. system isn’t standing still. Along with government bodies, defense companies like Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. are constantly working on upgrades; billions of dollars are being put to work. Now, though, there’s real competition.Technology and potential aside, replacing GPS comes with another (big) hurdle: trust. Relying on any provider of location data in these increasingly protectionist times could be unsettling. Even if complaints about GPS becoming more outdated are frequent, will users across the world take to a system run by Beijing, no matter how accurate it is? Your guess is as good as mine.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-08-18,"On Tuesday, shares of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $62.38.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-11  * Strike Price: $57.50  * Volume: 1600  * Open Interest: 313 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 10, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Donald Trump’s attempts to use the office of the presidency to call for a boycott of an American company have always been jarring and alarming. But the latest broadside against Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. feels particularly shortsighted. On Wednesday, Goodyear joined a long list of corporations whose products the president has said should be shunned at one point or another. The list — which stretches even longer if you include companies targeted over the course of his campaign — is a who’s who of the American way of life, ranging from Apple Inc., AT&T Inc., Harley-Davidson Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc. He’s also threatened to cancel an order for a new Air Force One jet from Boeing Co. and yank unspecified subsidies for General Motors Co. The reasons for the boycotts range from disagreements over operating decisions such as factory relocations or product selection; a means of pressure for jobs initiatives; leverage for government contract negotiations; and just general dislike. He’s never cared very much if the issues that are the grist for his corporate attacks conflict with or are the result of some of his own policies, nor has he been particularly focused on achieving more than a publicity stunt in most instances.But Goodyear is an especially curious target. The company’s biggest competitors are foreign companies such as Japan’s Bridgestone Corp., Germany's Continental AG and France’s Michelin. So when Trump tells his supports to “get better tires for far less,&quot; he would appear to be directing them to spend their dollars at the very same companies he’s spent the better part of the last four years trying to hamper with tariffs and political posturing.Not to mention, Goodyear — based in the swing state of Ohio — actually operates factories in the U.S. at a time when the White House is angling to bring more manufacturing work back to America, and as the country faces an unprecedented slump in employment because of the coronavirus pandemic. A full-throttle boycott of Goodyear may affect the Americans working at the company, not to mention their attitude toward his re-election prospects. In 2016, Goodyear was one of 15 recipients of the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, &quot;the highest honor&quot; given to the private sector to recognize support for National Guard and Reserve workforce members.Goodyear’s offense is an image circulating on social media that appeared to list “acceptable” and “unacceptable” attire and messaging for the workplace. According to the visual, support for the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as LGBT initiatives, falls into the “acceptable” category; politically affiliated slogans or material (including the “Make America Great Again” attire featured in the Trump campaign) as well as support for the “All Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” movements are deemed “unacceptable.” In a statement, Goodyear said the slide wasn’t distributed by corporate headquarters and wasn’t part of a diversity training program, as was alleged on social media.It remains unclear who exactly created this visual. But once again, Trump’s instinct is to shoot first and ask questions later, a dangerous instinct for someone in charge of running an entire country. It feels particularly notable that his tweet is focused on the alleged ban on the MAGA attire his campaign popularized; he never misses an opportunity to worry about himself. Never mind that even if the slide deck is true, it would also appear to ban, say, t-shirts supporting Trump’s challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden.In other comments to local news outlets, Goodyear made a distinction between allowing employees to express themselves on issues of racial justice and equity in the aim of fostering a more respectful workplace, and wanting to avoid political campaigning for either side. It's an interesting portrait of the challenges corporate America is facing as companies try to respond to demands for social progress. But the complexity of that dilemma is lost on Trump. Trump's not the only politician to target or boycott specific companies. Celebrities and prominent Democrats including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York panned Goya Foods earlier this year after the company's CEO expressed support for Trump. In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called on Trump to threaten to withhold defense contracts from United Technologies Corp. (now Raytheon Technologies Corp.) over the status of a factory in Indiana. It’s fair to question the potential ramifications of those calls on rank-and-file Americans, too. “Two can play the same game,” Trump said. But this isn’t high school and only one person is the president. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-08-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude and gasoline futures both climbed to levels not seen since before the pandemic as Hurricane Laura rattled toward a key stretch of the U.S. Gulf Coast that is home to the nation’s greatest concentration of refining capacity.U.S. gasoline futures jumped 2.1% and crude futures added 1.7% Tuesday, bringing both contracts to the highest since early March. The storm is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday along the Texas-Louisiana coast as a Category 3 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. More than 84% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has shut and refiners including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Citgo Petroleum Corp. have reduced operations or closed plants in preparation.“The energy patch is facing a potentially cataclysmic situation in the next 48 hours,” in part as forecasts show “the storm on a collision course with some of the largest refineries in the world,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA, said in a note.The spread between the September and October gasoline contracts rose to as high as 15 cents per gallon during the session, the widest backwardation in a year. The price action “implies the market is worried about extreme shortage,” Yawger wrote.Some of the largest U.S. refineries are shutting in advance of Laura, affecting nearly 3 million barrels a day of capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s about one third of the Gulf Coast refining capacity, according to figures from Lipow Oil Associates.Still, the hurricane will likely only have a short-term impact on prices with this year’s lackluster summer driving season nearing an end and a pickup in consumption remaining questionable due to the coronavirus pandemic.“Even if the resumption of offshore production were to be slow, increasing the loss of supply, there is a large inventory buffer that precludes a sudden tightening of crude oil availability to refiners when they resume their operations,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.U.S. crude stockpiles are currently at the highest seasonal level in decades, according to Energy Information Administration data.U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.52 million barrels last week and gasoline stockpiles fell by more than 6 million, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported, according to people familiar. If confirmed by the EIA report on Wednesday, it would be the fifth-straight weekly decline in crude stocks. On the other hand, the API report showed another build in distillate supplies.“The severe gasoline draw reflects careful inventory management for refiners and distributors to not be stuck with higher quality than they need come the middle of September,” as specifications change for the winter season, said Tom Finlon of GF International. Meanwhile, cash-market gasoline for Colonial Pipeline loading outside Houston rose to the highest in eleven months on Tuesday morning as retailers sought to secure supplies ahead of Laura.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Oil, Gasoline Climb to Five-Month Highs With Hurricane Nearing"

2020-08-27,"On Thursday, shares of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $61.48.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 703  * Open Interest: 3493 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Analyzing Raytheon Technologies's Unusual Options Activity  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 10, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

However, currently, she is cautious on the aerospace industry, amid challenges including an aircraft production crisis because of the 737 MAX halt and slowdown in air travel due to COVID-19. The analyst does not expect aerospace stocks to trade at a premium to the market until there are signs of new and increasing aircraft production.Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock.

On top of this, a “broader procyclical shift” in stocks and other assets could take place during the remainder of this year.“We have shifted more cyclical on sectors and themes tactically but still prefer growth vs. value on a strategic horizon... In the near-term, elevated uncertainty on U.S. elections and a better global growth outlook might benefit non-U.S. equities more, but in the medium term a large weight in structural growth stocks is likely to support the S&P 500,” Mueller-Glissmann noted.As for the “most important catalyst” that could spur growth optimism in the next year, the strategist points to additional clarity on when and how a COVID-19 vaccine will be available.Turning Mueller-Glissmann's outlook into concrete recommendations, Goldman Sachs’ analysts are pounding the table on three stocks that look especially compelling. According to these analysts, each name is poised to surge in the 12 months ahead.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)First up we have Raytheon Technologies, which is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers. While shares have stumbled in 2020, Goldman Sachs thinks the weakness presents a buying opportunity.Representing the firm, analyst Noah Poponak points out that RTX is “too high quality and well positioned of a company to trade at an 11% free cash flow yield on the fully aerospace-recovered and fully synergized 2023E free cash.”The analyst’s bullish outlook is largely driven by the company’s aerospace aftermarket (the secondary market that deals with the installation of equipment, spare parts, accessories and components after the sale of the aircraft by the original equipment manufacturer) business, which Poponak argues is “the best sub-market within Aerospace over the long-term.” This segment makes up roughly 45% of RTX’s aerospace revenue.Even though COVID-19 flight disruptions have weighed on this part of the business, Poponak points out total aircraft in service is down only 25% year-over-year, and flights have dipped less than 50%. He added, “China domestic traffic is now up year on year, and while international remains depressed, we believe the recovery in global air travel could be quicker from here than broad expectations for a recovery by 2023-2024.”Poponak highlights that in previous downturns, the aftermarket had to confront headwinds that arose from the increased use of parting out, inventory pooling and delayed aftermarket spending. “Even then, aftermarket grew at or faster than ASMs, and we believe there was pent-up demand heading into this downturn that support aftermarket tracking the recovery in global air travel. Long-term, we expect air traffic to grow 2X global GDP, as it has historically,” the analyst commented.Adding to the good news, the Geared Turbo Fan, which is a type of turbofan aircraft engine, product cycle could generate substantial revenue and EBIT growth at Pratt & Whitney, in Poponak’s opinion.“Given the high OE exposure to the A320neo, which has the strongest backlog of any aircraft in the market, we see Pratt OE revenue holding up better and recovering faster than peers. New GTF deliveries will drive expansion in the installed base for Pratt, which was declining for most of the 2000s. Despite the end of V2500 OE deliveries, that program is just moving into the sweet-spot for shop visits on the aftermarket side,” Poponak opined.What’s more, Poponak sees merger synergies as capable of fueling margin expansion and cash generation, with the historical synergy capture in the space implying that upside to guidance isn’t out of the question.In line with his optimistic approach, Poponak stays with the bulls. To this end, he keeps a Buy rating and $86 price target on the stock. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 49%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Poponak’s track record, click here)In general, other analysts echo Poponak’s sentiment. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $78.63, the upside potential comes in at 36.5%. (See RTX stock analysis on TipRanks)Boeing (BA)Moving on to another player in the aerospace space, Boeing has also struggled on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, with it failing to match the pace of the broader market. That being said, Goldman Sachs has high hopes for this name going forward.Firm analyst Noah Poponak, who also covers RTX, points out that BA has already trimmed production rate plans by half, compared to the peak plan from before the COVID crisis and MAX grounding. A slower-than-anticipated air travel rebound could result in more reductions, but the analyst argues these would be much smaller than the reductions that have already been witnessed. He added, “Historically, the best buying opportunities in BA shares are right after it has capitulated to production rate cuts.”According to Poponak, compared to previous economic declines, the peak to trough in the current downturn is larger and faster, although this is partly related to the grounding of the 737 MAX in 2019. “We believe this will result in a less severe dislocation of supply and demand balance, and see deliveries recovering to 2018 levels by 2024 as global air travel recovers and airlines replace accelerated retirements,” he explained.As for how the company can fulfill its new production rate plan “given the mix of its backlog is so much more weighted to growth than replacement,” Poponak believes “the answer is that airlines during this downturn are revising that mix.” Since the pandemic’s onset, airlines have revealed higher aircraft retirement plans, and braced for less growth. “That means for a given revision in an airline’s order book, there is also a substantial mix shift toward replacement from growth within the new delivery numbers. Therefore, the backlog will not necessarily lose all of its growth orders,” the analyst stated.Additionally, following an uptick in aircraft order cancellations in March and April, the pace has slowed. “Even assuming another 200-plus unit cancellations this year, we estimate the 737 MAX would have nearly 6X years of production by the middle of the decade at our revised production rate estimates,” Poponak mentioned.When it comes to free cash flow, the analyst is also optimistic, with Poponak forecasting that BA will see positive free cash flow in 2021. “We think the market is underestimating the mid-cycle achievable aircraft unit cash margins across the major programs, extrapolating temporarily negative items into the future, and underestimating the degree of inventory unwind likely to occur in 2021,” he said.If that wasn’t enough, the MAX recertification could be a major possible catalyst. The company is working towards recertification and return to service, with Poponak expecting both to come before year-end.Taking all of the above into consideration, Poponak maintains a Buy rating and $225 price target. This target conveys his confidence in BA’s ability to climb 35% higher in the next year.Turning to the rest of the analyst community, opinions are mixed. With 8 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that BA is a Moderate Buy. At $192.40, the average price target implies 16% upside potential. (See Boeing stock analysis on TipRanks)Immatics (IMTX)Combining the discovery of true targets for cancer immunotherapies (therapies that utilize the power of the immune system) with the development of the right T cell receptors, Immatics hopes to ultimately enable a robust and specific T cell response against these targets. Based on its cutting-edge approach, Goldman Sachs counts itself as a fan.Writing for the firm, analyst Graig Suvannavejh notes that unlike CAR-T approaches, a T cell receptor (TCR)-based approach can go after targets inside the cell, and fight the 90% of cancers which are solid tumor in nature. The company is advancing two technologies: ACTengine, designed for personalized TCR-based cell therapies, and TCER, which targets TCR-based bispecific antibodies.ACTengine is the more advanced technology, with its four assets IMA201, a genetically engineered T cell product candidate that targets melanoma-associated antigen 4 or 8, IMA202, which targets melanoma-associated antigen 1, IMA203, which targets preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) and IMA204 that targets COL6A3 (found in a tumor’s stroma and is highly prevalent in the tumor microenvironment/TME in a broad range of cancers) expected to enter the clinic soon.Using the TCER platform, IMTX is developing IMA401 and IMA402, or “off-the-shelf” biologics consisting of a portion of the TCR which directly recognizes cancer cells and a T cell recruiter domain which recruits and activates the patient’s T cells.Speaking to the market opportunity, Suvannavejh mentioned, “Cancer immunotherapies have made great strides over the past decade, and in particular, advances seen with CAR-T have paved the way for cell therapy-based approaches... CAR-T, however, has to date only shown limited effect in treating cancers that are solid tumor in nature. With more than 90% of all cancers being solid tumors — with lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancers accounting for c.60% of the total — this is the opportunity for IMTX.” To this end, he believes cumulative 2035 sales could land at $15.5 billion for the ACTengine-based assets.Reflecting another positive, since 2017, IMTX has inked at least one significant partnership per year with top global biopharma companies. According to Suvannavejh, each provided non-dilutive funding opportunities.The analyst added, “...the ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), merger that enabled IMTX to become a publicly traded entity brought in a deep roster of well-known, experienced healthcare-dedicated institutional investors. Taken together, we find these to be validating of IMTX’s longer-term prospects.”Looking ahead, the initial clinical data readouts for IMA201, IMA202 and IMA203, which are slated for Q1 2021, and investigational new drug (IND) application submissions for IMA204 and IMA401 in 2021 and YE2021, respectively, reflect key potential catalysts, in Suvannavejh’s opinion.Everything that IMTX has going for it convinced Suvannavejh to reiterate his Buy rating. Along with the call, he attached a $17 price target, suggesting 73% upside potential. (To watch Suvannavejh’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, the message is clear: IMTX is a Strong Buy. Given the $19 average price target, shares could soar 93% in the next year.

2020-09-30,"Governments across the world are fighting the COVID-19 threat and spending billions of dollars in addressing the pandemic. Despite the COVID crisis, the defense spending by most of the countries might not change drastically given the growing geopolitical tensions.According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute or SIPRI, the global military expenditure rose 3.6% to $1.92 trillion in 2019 with the US topping the list with military spending of $732 billion (way more than China's $261 billion expenditure- the second-largest military spender). A defense bill of $740.5 billion is being planned for 2021 in the US compared to $738 billion in 2020.With this in mind, we will use the TipRanks' Stock Comparison tool to compare two leading defense companies Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Lockheed Martin is the world’s largest pure-play defense company. Its main customer is the US government, which accounted for 76% of its $32 billion net sales in the first half of 2020. International customers generated 23% of the company’s sales in the first half while 1% of sales came from US commercial and other customers.The defense contractor is widely known for its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which accounted for 27% of the company’s consolidated sales in 2019. Lockheed is also considered a leader in hypersonics and its THAAD or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems are one of the most advanced missile systems.Despite COVID-19 hurting the company’s supply chain, Lockheed Martin’s 2Q revenue grew 12.4% Y/Y to $16.2 billion led by increased volumes in the Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control segments. EPS grew by 12.4% to $5.79. Following its 2Q performance, the company raised its 2020 guidance and expects sales between $63.5 billion to $65 billion and EPS of $23.75 to $24.05.Lockheed received about $22 billion in orders in 2Q and ended the quarter with a strong order backlog of $150.3 billion. Of the new orders booked in 2Q, $7 billion were for the F-35. The company’s order backlog reflects the strength of its broad portfolio.One of the most notable recent updates about Lockheed is the $62 billion ten-year contract that it won in August for the production of F-16 fighter planes for foreign military allies of the US.Lockheed Martin is down 0.2% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $436.50 indicates an upside potential of 12.3% in the coming months.Recently, Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak removed Lockheed Martin from the firm's Conviction List while retaining a Buy rating. He lowered his price target for Lockheed to $447 from $501. The analyst believes that new order bookings continue to outpace the industry on average, ""supporting further outgrowth ahead.""However, the analyst sees more upside in aerospace stocks like Boeing and Raytheon Technologies, two stocks which he added to Goldman's Conviction List. (See LMT stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the Street is cautiously optimistic about Lockheed Martin. A Moderate Buy consensus for the leading defense company is based on 6 Buys, 3 Holds and no Sell ratings.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)Raytheon Technologies was formed in April 2020 with the merger of defense contractor Raytheon Company and aerospace company United Technologies following the latter’s spin-offs of its Carrier and Otis businesses. The rationale behind the merger was to leverage the technology and research and development capabilities of both the companies to capture opportunities in the high-growth segments of aerospace and defense.However, the pandemic caused unprecedented damage to the commercial aerospace sector. Rayetheon expects that it will take at least until 2023 for commercial air traffic to recover to 2019 levels. Meanwhile, the company has announced efforts to cut $2 billion in costs this year and save $4 billion in cash. It plans to slash 15,000 jobs amid the current crisis.Raytheon’s net sales 2Q increased 24.1% Y/Y to $14.1 billion as the growth in the company’s defense business more than offset the slump in the aerospace side. Adjusted EPS plunged about 68% to $0.40.The company ended 2Q with a backlog of $158.7 billion, of which $85.6 billion was from commercial aerospace and $73.1 billion was from defense. Raytheon sees sequential sales improvement in the second half of the year, with modest improvement in Q3 and then a better Q4.On Sept. 20, Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak added Raytheon to the firm's Conviction Buy list while keeping a Buy rating. The analyst raised the price target for Raytheon to $86 from $84. Poponak views the company’s aftermarket as the best sub-market within Aerospace over the long term and notes that it accounts for about 45% of Raytheon's Aerospace revenue.The analyst believes that the recovery in global air travel could be ""quicker from here than broad expectations for a recovery by 2023-2024,"" and also argues that Raytheon's Defense business is well-positioned in key end market categories. He adds that the strong trailing book to bill supports visible revenue growth going forward. (See RTX stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street mirrors Poponak’s bullish stance and has a Strong Buy consensus based on 7 Buys, 2 Holds and no Sell ratings. Raytheon stock is down about 35% so far this year but has an upside potential of 36.5% in the coming months as indicated by the average analyst price target of $78.63.ConclusionLockheed Martin definitely is a strong defense play with an impressive order backlog. But, Raytheon currently looks to be the better stock based on a higher dividend yield of 3.23% compared to Lockheed’s 2.66% and a higher upside potential.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

Amazing Financial Performance
Its revenue in the last 12 months (LTM) ending June 30 was $62.9 billion. It made net income of $6.45 billion, manifesting a respectable net income margin of 10.3%.
Moreover, free cash flow (FCF) is amazing. Its LTM FCF ending June 30 was $6.89 billion. This represents 10.9% of its LTM revenue and indicates that the company produces more than enough to cover its dividend and buyback programs.
For example, the company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 8.33% to $2.60 per share. In the LTM, the dividends cost the company just $2.66 billion.

So even with the higher dividend payment, the ongoing cost will only be $2.88 billion.  This is well below the $6.9 billion in FCF that the company made in the LTM.
Moreover, its buyback program costs just $1.7 billion. In fact, the company was also able to reduce its debt by $2.05 billion over the last 12 months. All because the company’s FCF is so powerful.

Based on analysts’ estimates for 2021, the company is forecast to make $26.66 per share next year. That puts LMT stock, at $386.50 per share on Oct. 16, on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.5 times earnings.
And by the way, those earnings are forecast to grow 10.3% over 2020 estimated earnings. In other words, the company is growing — and yet, Lockheed Martin stock is still cheap.

Moreover, according to Morningstar, the average P/E ratio over the past five years has been 23.55 times. Therefore, if shares were to rise to its average P/E multiple, the potential gain is 62% (i.e., 23.55 divided by 14.5). That would put LMT stock at $627.84 per share.
And even if that took two years to occur, the average compounded gain would be 27.4% each year.
On a dividend yield basis, Lockheed Martin stock is also very cheap. As I mentioned above, the dividend was recently raised by 8.3%. Right now, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.69% (i.e., $10.40 divided by $386.50 per share).
But over the past four years, the stock has exhibited an average annual dividend yield of 2.36%, according to Seeking Alpha. Therefore, LMT stock is 14% too cheap.
You can derive this by taking the $10.40 dividend per share and dividing it by 2.36%. That produces a target price of $440.68 per share. That target price is 14% higher than the Oct. 16 price of $386.50 per share.
What To Do With LMT Stock
So far we have come up with two ways to value the stock. Based on its average P/E history, the stock should be at $627.84 per share.
And based on its historical dividend yield, the target price is $440.68 per share. Therefore, the average price target is $534.26. That represents a potential gain of 38% over the Oct. 16 price.
Moreover, the company’s powerful FCF means that it is likely inexpensive using this measure as well. Its $6.9 billion in FCF represents 6.38% of its $108 billion market capitalization. That is a very high ratio.
For example, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) has a similar market cap of $93.1 billion. But it made just $3.59 billion in FCF in the last 12 months. That means that its FCF yield is 3.86%.
Therefore, if Lockheed Martin stock had a 3.86% FCF yield, the market cap would be $178.75 billion. This is 65.4% above today’s value. It implies that the stock should be at $639.27 per share.
Therefore, averaging all of these valuations the stock should be at $569.26, or 47% above today’s price. That represents a good return on investment for most investors.

2020-10-26,"(Bloomberg) -- China will impose unspecified sanctions on Boeing Co.’s defense unit, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. after the U.S. State Department approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan last week.The sanctions will be imposed “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters Monday in Beijing.The action follows the State Department’s approval last week of $1.8 billion in sales of new weapons for Taiwan and submission of the package to Congress for a final review. The deals, and an earlier one involving Lockheed F-16 fighters, are taking place amid rising tension between the superpowers ahead of the U.S. election next week.The new package includes 135 SLAM extended-range land attack missiles from Boeing, Himars mobile artillery rocket systems from Lockheed, and Raytheon surveillance and reconnaissance sensors to be mounted on aircraft.Boeing fell 3.7% to $161.11 at 11:32 a.m. in New York as the broader market slumped on concerns about rising coronavirus cases. Lockheed dropped 2.7% to $364.24, while Raytheon declined 3.7% to $60.23.Boeing’s 50-year relationship with China in aviation has helped the country’s “safe, efficient and profitable aviation system to keep pace with the country’s rapid economic growth,” the company said by email. Boeing sells civilian aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max to Chinese airlines.“It’s been a partnership with long-term benefits and one that Boeing remains committed to,” Boeing said.Raytheon, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and other aeronautics equipment, also touted its connections to China’s civil aviation industry. “We remain committed to its success,” the company said by email.Raytheon and Lockheed noted as well that foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions, made in cooperation with U.S. authorities. Lockheed said its presence in China is limited.‘One China’In August, the U.S. and Taiwan completed the sale of 66 new model F-16 Block 70 aircraft from Lockheed. Zhao, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, condemned it at the time, saying it violates the One China principle, interferes in China’s internal affairs and will have a “major impact” on U.S.-China relations.In July, China -- which considers Taiwan part of its territory and resists any recognition of its de facto independence -- had announced sanctions on Lockheed Martin for a previous arms sale to the island.QuickTake: Taiwan Walks Tightrope Between China and Not ChinaTaiwan will continue to urge the U.S. to fulfill its security pledge and sell weapons to the Asian country for defense needs, its foreign ministry spokeswoman, Joanne Ou, said in a statement delivered by text.U.S. arms manufacturers face strict limitations on what kind of business they can do with countries deemed by Washington to be strategic rivals, such as China. Lockheed generated 9.7% of its revenue in the Asia-Pacific region last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though that’s not broken down by individual countries.China has previously threatened to sanction U.S. companies, including General Dynamics Corp. and Honeywell International Inc., on numerous occasions over arms sales to Taiwan. It also warned it could blacklist FedEx Corp., while Ford Motor Co.’s main joint venture partner in China was fined 162.8 million yuan ($24.3 million) last year, days after the U.S. put a ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies Co.While China has often invoked the threat of putting U.S. companies on a blacklist -- or list of “unreliable entities” -- in response to various actions by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration over the past year, it has yet to name any, at least publicly.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“China’s sanctions against Boeing’s defense unit have no effect as China accounts for no military sales, yet the manufacturer would be hurt considerably if commercial aircraft are included because a large portion of backlogs are for Chinese airlines. Slapping sanctions on U.S. aerospace makers is difficult because key components including narrow-body engines are made by U.S. companies such as Raytheon and General Electric, which both sell military gear to Taiwan.”George Ferguson, Senior Aviation and Defense AnalystClick here to read the research.For Boeing, China’s action comes at a delicate time. The company, reeling from the hit to air travel from the coronavirus pandemic, is trying to get its besieged 737 Max plane back into the air after two fatal crashes saw it grounded around the world. China was the first place to ground the plane also has the world’s biggest 737 Max fleet.“There are a number of intangibles that could affect recertification of the Max in China and this could potentially add another dimension,” said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting. “China took the lead in grounding the Max and it is very conscious of its role in aviation safety. There’s also the dimension of the trade tensions with the U.S., as well as the U.S. presidential election and how that turns out.”Europe’s top aviation regulator said earlier this month the plane will be safe enough to fly again before the end of this year. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson flew the Max in September and said the controls were “very comfortable.”China, which had nearly 100 Max planes in operation prior to the grounding, doesn’t have a clear timetable for allowing the plane back into the air, Feng Zhenglin, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters in Beijing last week.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","China to Sanction Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Over Taiwan Arms"

2020-10-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets head into the last full trading week before the U.S. election with stocks and currencies near their highest levels since January and dollar-bond spreads close to their narrowest since February.Don’t expect it to get much better than that in coming days.Caution is likely to be the watchword for investors, with the Nov. 3 vote set to reveal not just whether Joe Biden’s opinion-poll lead over Donald Trump will propel him to victory, but also determine the fate of the much-anticipated U.S. stimulus package. And there’s always the risk of a contested result.“It makes sense for emerging-market investors to maintain only light (risk-bullish) positions in the remaining days before the U.S. election,” a Credit Suisse SA team including Kasper Bartholdy, managing director of fixed-income strategy in London, wrote in a report. “This is in part because we see sizable residual scope for the ‘Biden/Trump U.S. voter-support gap’ to fluctuate. It is also because we see a large risk that ongoing negotiations in the U.S. about pre-election fiscal-policy stimulus will falter and cause some temporary market consternation.”That investors are wary of putting too much on the line right now is already apparent. Implied currency volatility declined for a fourth week in the past five trading days, the longest streak since June. The main MSCI indexes of stocks and currencies barely budged Friday. A Bloomberg-Barclays gauge of emerging-market dollar bonds was also little changed, while inflows to emerging-market exchange-traded funds slowed down last week.That’s not to say there aren’t plenty of emerging-market events to keep traders on their toes this week.

2020-10-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The future of work at Raytheon Technologies Corp. is going to mean fewer people in offices and more robots on the factory floor. The aerospace and defense giant on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings and free cash flow that were better than analysts had expected, even as the recovery in the commercial side of its business continues at a snail’s pace. Raytheon reiterated its expectation that global air traffic won’t return to 2019 levels until at least 2023 — and that’s assuming the successful development and broad distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. “It's clearly not a V, all right? This is going to be a long, slow recovery,” Raytheon Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said on a call with analysts to discuss the results. “We continue to focus on what we can control.” That means building on expected cost savings from the merger between United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. completed earlier this year. And then some. The company had previously planned to consolidate its office space in light of the combination and was targeting a 10% reduction in its 31 million square feet of real estate. But after touring facilities where only a handful of people are now on-site and the rest are diligently (and productively) working remotely, Hayes came to the conclusion that “we don’t need all this space.” Raytheon now plans to double its previous goal and ultimately get rid of as much as 25% of its office square footage, starting with locations it currently leases. Hayes probably isn’t the only executive to wonder if the pandemic-driven work-from-home revolution offers an opportunity for cost savings, but this shift feels more meaningful coming from a company that used to sell quite a lot of products to the commercial real estate market. In conjunction with the Raytheon merger, the former United Technologies also spun off its Otis Worldwide Corp. elevator unit and the Carrier Global Corp. heating and air conditioner division. Those businesses will suffer if more companies follow Raytheon’s lead and decide they, too, can function with significantly less office space.Raytheon is also planning to consolidate some of its manufacturing real estate in lower-cost locations and reimagining what those factories should look like on the inside. The company highlighted a new turbine airfoil facility for its Pratt & Whitney jet-engine division that will be based in Asheville, North Carolina, and will combine work that’s now spread across multiple sites and throughout the supply chain. North Carolina’s flat corporate income tax rate of 2.5% is the lowest in the country among states that apply a levy, compared with a top marginal rate of 8% in Raytheon’s home state of Massachusetts, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. This new facility in North Carolina will be “highly automated,” and Raytheon expects to achieve $175 million in annual cost savings. There’s been a lot of talk about a potential resurgence in U.S. manufacturing in the wake of the pandemic, whether that’s due to companies growing disillusioned with the benefits of far-flung supply chains and relocating facilities back home or the prospects of a major infrastructure spending push by the government. Raytheon’s commentary on Tuesday underscores why the jobs component of these initiatives is far from straightforward. As I’ve written, companies are going to be reluctant to give up the cost cuts they achieved in the pandemic, and it’s likely that many of the jobs eliminated during the peak of the disruption might never come back. A “reshoring” of manufacturing work from China to the U.S. — to the extent it actually happens — seems more likely to spark a golden age for automation.To that end, Raytheon said Tuesday that only about half of the 15,000 jobs being cut from its commercial aerospace businesses would return once demand eventually recovers. “We’ve got to keep the other 50% from coming back, and that's what's going to give us leverage on the upside when we do indeed see a return to normalcy in air traffic,” Hayes said. Much of the reduction will come from eliminating layers of management and overlap in centralized functions like procurement. “It should lead to, long term, a much more efficient organization,” he added. All in, Raytheon is eliminating roughly 20,000 jobs this year, including 4,000 contractor positions and 1,000 previously expected adjustments because of the merger. And this is coming from a company that had $10 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter and sees the current crisis as an opportunity to invest in next-generation technology and gain more market share. “You have to invest for the long term,” Hayes said. Indeed, just not in people or office space, apparently. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Raytheon Technologies Corp. fell after the company disclosed a demand from the U.S. Department of Justice for records dating back more than a decade from the company’s missile business.The criminal subpoena was dated Oct. 8 and Raytheon is cooperating, according to a company regulatory filing Tuesday. Federal prosecutors are seeking documents and information in a probe of accounting and other reporting matters within Raytheon’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009, according to the filing.In the same filing, Raytheon also disclosed it had received a second subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to a separate, previously disclosed probe. Raytheon tumbled 7.4% to $52.34 at the close of trading in New York amid a broad market rout, the shares’ largest drop since June.A Raytheon representative said the SEC investigation is unrelated to the Justice Department probe that prompted the Oct. 8 subpoena. In the filing, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based defense contractor said it’s unable to predict the outcome of the inquiries. It said it believes neither will have a material impact on its financial condition or results based on current information.‘Shoot First’“The market is in ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ mode,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Jonathan Raviv said in a note to clients. “As a result, we’re not surprised to see the stock reaction since the potential outcomes range from very bad to zero outcome at all. But keep in mind that management-signed documents estimate it’s immaterial.”Raytheon has previously disclosed the inquiry of the SEC, which is looking into potential improper payments by a joint venture with Thales SA tied to contracts in certain countries in the Middle East since 2014, according to the filing. The DOJ is also investigating the issue, Raytheon said.“Raytheon Company maintains a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program, is cooperating fully with the SEC’s inquiry, and is examining whether there has been any conduct that is in violation of Raytheon Company policy,” the aerospace and defense giant said in the filing.The company is the result of the April merger of Raytheon and United Technologies.(Updates with analyst in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Raytheon Sinks After Disclosing U.S. Probe of Defense Books

If the goal was to underpromise and overdeliver, GE succeeded: On a day when the broader market was swooning, the company’s shares climbed as much as 10%.“This is a period of great uncertainty,”Culp said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s prudent to be conservative yet realistic in an environment like this.”GE’s better-than-expected cash flow performance in the third quarter stems from improvements in working capital dynamics like inventory management and at the beleagured power division, which eked out a small operating profit in the third quarter. This business had been the focus of Culp’s turnaround efforts before the pandemic hit, and it appears his efforts to inject more operational discipline are starting to pay off. Cost cuts across the company in response to the pandemic are also starting to yield benefits. This includes a plan to eliminate 13,000 jobs — or 25% of the workforce — in the aviation unit. Unlike rival Raytheon Technologies Corp., which expects about half of the 15,000 people cut from its commercial aerospace divisions to return as volumes recover, Culp said the bulk of GE’s targeted cuts are expected to be permanent. That could bolster profit margins down the road, albeit at a material human cost. GE on Wednesday reiterated its forecast for positive industrial free cash flow in 2021, which now seems more achievable. The company expects to generate “at least” $2.5 billion of cash flow in the fourth quarter. Given GE’s track record on forecasts, it seems likely that this too may be an undershoot.A material outperformance may come down to the aviation unit, which appeared to be stabilizing in the third quarter but at a very low level. Orders were down more than 50% compared with the year earlier and profits were down nearly 80%. GE did flag some incremental improvements, but the emphasis is on the incremental: The percentage of its engine fleet that is parked is now about 26%, compared with 31% at the end of the second quarter, and lucrative maintenance shop visits are trending down about 50%, compared with 55% as of July. With this business driving so much of GE’s cash flow and profits, the inevitably slow recovery will remain a pressure point. “We’re not taking any departure for granted,” Culp said, acknowledging rising coronavirus cases around the world risk crimping the fledging recovery in air traffic. Dark Time for Aviation Is About to Get DarkerSeparately on Wednesday, Boeing Co. said it would cut an additional 7,000 jobs, bringing this year’s reductions to 30,000, as demand for new planes remains low and cancellations pile up for its still-grounded 737 Max. That affects GE, too: in a filing Wednesday, the company said customers have canceled 1,100 orders for the engine that powers the Max this year.But the problems in the aviation industry aren’t new, and GE kept the fresh bad news elsewhere in the company to a minimum. It completed the annual GAAP-based stress-testing of its reserves for a run-off insurance arm in the quarter, and for once trends in this business went GE’s way. The lower-for-longer interest rate environment was a drag on expected returns for investments that fund the reserves. But the pandemic has been particularly precarious for the older individuals who own long-term care insurance policies issued by GE and has made people reluctant to enter the kind of care facilities that generate many of the claims on those policies.GE Is Still Haunted by '$15 Billion Problem'GE also said it was setting aside $100 million in relation to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its handling of a surprise $15 billion funding shortfall in the insurance business, long-term maintenance agreements and a large goodwill writedown in the power unit. SEC staff earlier this month warned they may recommend civil penalties over the insurance issue without specifying any decision on the other matters. If the worst of any action from the SEC is a $100 million penalty, that will be good news for investors. Some had worried the SEC would require earnings restatements or a restructuring of the GE Capital arm to isolate the insurance business and its funding. Asked on the earnings call how GE arrived at the $100 million number, Culp reiterated that the company is cooperating with the SEC and said the reserve reflects “our view of what’s appropriate under the circumstances.” All in all, this was a good showing for GE, even if the bar was low. There is still a long way to go for the stock to get back into the $17 range that would get Culp the full amount of his equity award (and help shareholders recoup at least some of their losses). But Culp has earned every right to proclaim that “GE’s transformation is accelerating.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-10-29,"Shares of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $52.53.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-02-19  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 1577  * Open Interest: 1415Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For October 27, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company completed a merger and changed “Raytheon Company” to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”The Class Period commences on February 10, 2016, when Raytheon Company published its annual report on a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which stated in relevant part, “we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded.

2020-11-01,"Insiders load up on IBM, Raytheon Technologies, Crown Castle and Kimberly-Clark",Top Insider Buys Highlight for the Week of Oct. 30
2020-11-02,"Inside trading has a bad sound to it, but what is it really? Corporate insiders are company officers – the Presidents and VPs and Execs and Board members who run the world’s public – and private – companies. Their positions put them ‘in the know,’ and make them privy to the inner workings of their companies. Using that information to buy up stock would be underhanded, except for two points. First, they trade public shares openly. They don’t hide their transactions, and the investing public can see what they are doing – and read the hints given. And second, corporate insiders are not just trying to make money for themselves. Their positions make them responsible – to their Boards, to higher execs, and to the company shareholders – for bringing in a profit. What this means for investors, is insider moves provide valuable hints to a stock’s soundness. A casual stock player can put together a viable strategy just by noting and following the trades made by corporate insiders. TipRanks tracks these moves, and makes the data available to the public through the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool. With its up-to-date data and variety of filters, this tool can bring some interesting stock options to light. We’ve picked three ""Strong Buy"" stocks with recent insider buying that investors should take a closer look at.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)First up is Raytheon, a major research and manufacturing contractor for the US defense and aerospace industries. This company produces many of the air-to-surface guided missiles and fighter aircraft radar systems used by the US Air Force. The military tries to make the contracting process as varied as possible, but there are limited number of companies capable of producing high-end, modern hardware for the Pentagon – and Raytheon benefits from being part of a small club.A combination of military retrenchment and the ongoing coronavirus crisis pushed Raytheon’s revenues down in Q1, and both revenues and earnings down in Q2. The third quarter, however, saw a bounce back as EPS jumped 45% to 58 cents. It’s important to note that RTX has beaten the quarterly earnings forecasts consistently, going back two years.Along with the quarterly earnings, Raytheon announced its dividend payment, at 47.5 cents per common share. This is the third quarter in a row with the dividend at this level; the company reduced the payment earlier this year, to keep it affordable when the share price fell. RTX’s dividend gives a yield of 3.5%, nearly double the Industrial Goods sector average for peer companies.Turning to the insiders, we see two big purchases in the last few days. First, President and CEO Gregory Hayes laid down $3.35 million for a bloc of 61,406 shares in his company. The second large buy was from Thomas Kennedy, who’s 19,000 share purchase cost an estimated $999,800. These buys are a show of confidence in the company, coming the day after the Q3 earnings release.Covering Raytheon for RBC Capital, analyst Michael Eisen noted, “We believe the company is executing well with what is within its control, delivering on cost take out, synergy realization, and FCF generation…” Looking at the details, and the company strengths, Eisen adds, “…we view the company’s book of business as one of the most attractive under coverage with heavy alignment with the fastest and most supported missile, missile defense, cyber, and space systems.”In line with his comments, Eisen gives Raytheon an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $68 price target suggests a 22% upside for the stock. (To watch Eisen’s track record, click here)Overall, Raytheon’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent Buy reviews. The stock is selling for $55.61 and the average price target of $76.71 implies a one-year upside of 38%. (See RTX stock analysis on TipRanks)Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC)Next up, Ares Capital, is an asset management company with a focus on business development in the middle-market segment. Companies like Ares fill a vital role in the business world, providing cash, capital, credit, and financing for smaller ventures that might otherwise have difficulty accessing money markets. Ares boasts over 350 companies in its investment portfolio, with that portfolio valued over $14 billion.After a drastic hit to revenue, followed by a fall in EPS, during 1H20, Ares is starting to see a recovery. Revenues are up 49%, from $333 million in the second quarter to $497 million in the third. EPS is flat, at 39 cents, but beat the estimates in both Q2 and Q3. The outlook for Q4 is another 39 cents EPS.In a sign that the company feel confident, Ares declared its Q4 dividend in late October. The payment, scheduled for the end of December, is 40 cents per common share. The dividend annualized to $1.60 and yields an impressive 11.57%, or nearly 6x the average found among S&P-listed companies.Kipp Deveer, Ares’ CEO, swung the needle on insider sentiment strongly positive when he purchased 75,000 shares at the end of October. The trade cost him $1.048 million, and came just two months after Ares’ officers and directors made a series of smaller – but also informative – stock purchases. Insider buys on ARCC have totaled almost $1.9 million in the past three months.Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski points out that ARCC remains committed to keeping its dividend reliable, and writes of the company’s value to investors, “We continue to view ARCC as a great holding in the BDC space givens its size, diversified holdings and history of NAV preservation through difficult times… We see ARCC providing investors with the comfort of owning a long-established, large BDC with an excellent long-term, through-the-cycle track record…”Kotowski’s $16 price target implies a 12% one-year upside, and supports his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock. (To watch Kotowski’s track record, click here)It’s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock, so when it does happen, take note. ARCC’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 12 Buys. The stock’s $16.08 average price target is in line with Kotowski’s view. (See ARCC stock analysis on TipRanks)Banc of California (BANC)Last on our list is a full-service business bank, one of the largest in the state of California. Headquartered in Santa Ana, the bank focuses on small and mid-sized business through a network of 39 offices, including 31 service branches, spread across the state from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Banc of California boasts over $7.8 billion in total assets.Like much of the banking industry, the economic shutdowns of 1H20 were bad news for BANC. The company has rebounded, however, and after negative earnings in Q1 and Q2 reported a positive net EPS of 24 cents in Q3. This was well above the 14-cent forecast, and solidly in-line with the company’s pre-crisis performance. Revenues, which dipped in Q1, are also back to historic levels, at $59.8 million for Q3.Turning to the dividend, the current quarterly payout of 6 cents per common share has been stable for the past 6 quarters. It annualizes to 24 cents per share and gives a yield of 2%, almost exactly the average found among dividend payers in the S&P 500. They key here is reliability, and the company’s commitment to making the payments.Adding to the good news, BANC saw its first big insider buy in four months. Last Thursday, October 29, President and CEO Jared Wolff bought 10,000 shares for $115,000. Well Fargo analyst Timur Braziler makes BANC one of his Top Picks, and writes of the stock, “As long as credit holds up, and we think it will, we expect further earnings momentum, TBV growth, and discounted valuation relative to scarcity value to provide plenty of additional upside… Credit trends are holding up well, as delinquencies, criticized/classified, and nonperforming balances all improved sequentially.”To this end, Braziler rates the stock as Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a $15 price target that indicates room for 23% growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Braziler’s track record, click here)All in all, Banc of California holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 4 reviews including 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The shares have an average price target of $14.17, giving a 16% upside potential from the $12.19 trading price.

Seven Buys published in the last three months add up to a firm Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $77, the upside potential comes in at 41%.

According to the complaint, as a result of Raytheon’s faulty financial accounting, the company misreported the segment’s costs since 2009. This in turn exposed Raytheon to increased scrutiny from regulators, including potential criminal liability.  Investors allegedly began to learn the truth after the markets closed on Oct. 27, 2020, when Raytheon announced it received a criminal subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice. The company disclosed the DOJ seeks information and documents relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting by the missiles and defense business segment.This news drove the price of Raytheon shares sharply lower.“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Raytheon intentionally misrepresented its financial results over the last several years,” said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein.If you are a Raytheon investor and have significant losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation and prosecution of this matter, click here to discuss your legal rights with Hagens Berman.Whistleblowers:  Persons with non-public information regarding Raytheon should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

2020-11-05,"NEW YORK, Nov. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Zosano Pharma Corporation (NASDAQ: ZSAN), Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN), Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Zosano Pharma Corporation (NASDAQ: ZSAN) Class Period: February 13, 2017 to September 30, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 28, 2020Zosano is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its lead product candidate is Qtrypta (M207), a formulation of zolmitriptan coated onto the Company’s microneedle patch. Its pivotal efficacy trial, called ZOTRIP, began in July 2016. In December 2019, Zosano submitted its New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking regulatory approval for Qtrypta.On September 30, 2020, Zosano disclosed receipt of a discipline review letter (“DRL”) from the FDA regarding its NDA for Qtrypta and stated that approval was not likely. According to the Company’s press release, the FDA “raised questions regarding unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan observed in five study subjects from two pharmacokinetic studies and how the data from these subjects affect the overall clinical pharmacology section of the application.” The FDA also “raised questions regarding differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots of Qtrypta in the company’s clinical trials.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.92, or 57%, to close at $0.70 per share on October 1, 2020.On October 21, 2020, Zosano disclosed receipt of a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA. As a result of the previously identified deficiencies, the FDA recommended that Zosano conduct a repeat bioequivalence study between three of the lots used during development.On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.17, or 27%, to close at $0.04440 per share on October 21, 2020.The complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company’s clinical results reflected differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots; (2) that pharmocokinetic studies submitted in connection with the Company’s NDA included patients exhibiting unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing differences among patient results, the FDA was reasonably likely to require further studies to support regulatory approval of Qtrypta; (4) that, as a result, regulatory approval of Qtrypta was reasonably likely to be delayed; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Zosano class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ZSANCelsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN) Class Period: November 2, 2015 to July 10, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 28, 2020Celsion is an integrated development clinical stage oncology drug company that focuses on the development and commercialization of directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy, and RNA-based therapies for the treatment of cancer.Celsion’s lead product candidate is ThermoDox, a heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin that is in Phase III clinical development for treating primary liver cancer.In February 2014, Celsion announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had reviewed and provided clearance for the Company’s planned pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with radio frequency ablation (“RFA”) in primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), called the “OPTIMA Study.” The trial design was purportedly based on a comprehensive analysis of data from the Company’s Phase III HEAT Study, which purportedly demonstrated that treatment with ThermoDox resulted in a 55% improvement in overall survival (“OS”) in a substantial number of HCC patients that received an optimized RFA treatment. On July 13, 2020, Celsion announced that “it ha[d] received a recommendation from the independent [DMC] to consider stopping the global Phase III OPTIMA Study of ThermoDox® in combination with [RFA] for the treatment of [HCC], or primary liver cancer.” According to the Company, “[t]he recommendation was made following the second pre-planned interim safety and efficacy analysis by the DMC on July 9, 2020,” which “found that the pre-specified boundary for stopping the trial for futility of 0.900 was crossed with an actual value of 0.903.”On this news, Celsion’s stock price fell $2.29 per share, or 63.97%, to close at $1.29 per share on July 13, 2020.The complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy of ThermoDox; (ii) the foregoing significantly diminished the approval and commercialization prospects for ThermoDox; and (iii) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Celsion class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CLSNCitigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) Class Period: February 25, 2017 to October 12, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020The Class Period begins on February 25, 2017, following the Company’s submission of its 2016 Annual Report to the SEC. In that filing, and throughout the Class Period, Citi assured investors that there were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls. When faced with periodic regulatory penalties for noncompliance, the Company continued to assure investors that the specific deficiencies at issue were being remediated promptly and that internal controls and regulatory compliance were a top priority at Citi. In particular, Citi assured investors that it satisfied all regulatory requirements and maintained adequate internal controls, data governance, compliance risk management, and enterprise risk management.In reality, during the Class Period and unbeknownst to investors, Citi’s internal controls and risk management capabilities suffered from “serious” and “longstanding” inadequacies that exposed the Company to massive regulatory penalties and will cost significantly more than $1 billion to remediate. Specific control failures about which Citi executives were warned remained unresolved for years and the Company’s culture of non-compliance was so widespread that Citi’s CEO, Defendant Michael Corbat, exhorted employees in an internal memo that regulatory compliance required more than “checking boxes.”The truth began to emerge on September 14, 2020, when reports surfaced that regulators were preparing to reprimand Citi for failing to improve its risk-management systems.That disclosure caused the price of Citi’s stock to decline $2.85 per share, from $51.00 to $48.15, erasing $5.91 billion in shareholder value.After the market closed on September 14, 2020, an internal memo sent to Citi employees revealed for the first time the Company’s disregard for adequate internal controls and regulatory compliance.As a result, the price of Citi’s stock declined an additional $3.34 per share, from $48.15 to $44.81, erasing $6.93 billion in shareholder value.Then, on October 13, 2020, Citi reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020, and disclosed that the Company’s expenses increased during the third quarter by 5%, to $11 billion, due to an increase in costs including a $400 million fine, investments in infrastructure, and other remediation costs related to control deficiencies.These disclosures caused Citi’s stock price to decline by $2.20 per share, from $45.88 to $43.68, erasing $4.57 billion in shareholder value.For more information on the Citigroup class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRaytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) Class Period: February 10, 2016 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020On October 27, 2020, after market hours, Raytheon filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 (the “3Q20 Report”). The 3Q20 Report announced the DOJ Investigation, stating in pertinent part: “On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”On this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020, on unusually heavy trading volume, damaging investors.The complaint, filed on October 30, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers’ reviews.”Concerns regarding Raytheon’s financial accounting and internal controls over financial reporting were revealed after market hours on October 27, 2020, when Raytheon filed its quarterly report on a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The Form 10-Q reported that “[o]n October 8, 2020, [Raytheon] received a criminal subpoena from the [U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”Following this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the DOJ; and (6) as a result, the defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.If you wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this litigation, please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 877-9500 (toll free) or (610) 667–7706, or via e-mail at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors may, no later than December 29, 2020, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.  Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law.

(NYSE: SPR) from Neutral to Overweight with a price target lifted from $26 to $36.Vaccine Focus: Pfizer's statement that its COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 90% effective in a study could represent a ""turning point"" for the aero industry, Seifman said in a Tuesday upgrade note.While the exact timing of an industry inflection point remains unclear, investors are more willing to buy shares today and wait for the eventual recovery, the analyst said. Related Link: Spirit AeroSystems Analyst Sees Benefits From Return of Boeing's 737 MAXThe Raytheon Thesis: Raytheon is a combined aerospace and defense company, but the aerospace unit will ""dominate"" a valuation expansion as the sector recovers in the coming years, he said.This would be consistent with historical norms, as aerospace has been the main focus for Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), Seifman said. Raytheon is also expected to return cash to investors through dividends and buybacks, while longer-term catalysts include the recovery of Pratt and Collins in 2022, with ""significant growth"" to follow in 2023, the analyst said. The Spirit AeroSystems Thesis: Boeing's ramp of its 737 MAX planes will ""take time,"" but represents a multiyear catalyst for Spirit AeroSystems, he said. Encouragingly, Spirit's contracts to make parts for the MAX are set through 2033, and if the aircraft maker has to accept less favorable deals from airlines, it is a ""Boeing issue,"" Seifman said.

The Company is also developing OCA for various other indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).On May 22, 2020, Intercept reported that the FDA “has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company’s [NDA] for [OCA] for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to [NASH] has been postponed” to “accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 12.19%, to close at $80.51 per share on May 22, 2020.On June 29, 2020, Intercept issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) rejecting the Company’s NDA for Ocaliva for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH.On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $30.79 per share, or 39.73%, to close at $46.70 per share on June 29, 2020.Then, on October 8, 2020, news outlets reported that Intercept was “facing an investigation from the [FDA] over the potential risk of liver injury in patients taking Ocaliva, [Intercept’s] treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare, chronic liver disease.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $3.30 per share, or 8.05%, to close at $37.69 per share on October 8, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants downplayed the true scope and severity of safety concerns associated with Ocaliva’s use in treating PBC; (ii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of an FDA investigation into Ocaliva’s development, thereby jeopardizing Ocaliva’s continued marketability and the sustainability of its sales; (iii) any purported benefits associated with OCA’s efficacy in treating NASH were outweighed by the risks of its use; (iv) as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the Company’s NDA for OCA in treating patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH; and (v) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Intercept class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ICPT-2Neovasc, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVCN) Class Period: November 1, 2019 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 4, 2021Neovasc is a specialty medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets products for cardiovascular diseases, including the Tiara technology and the Reducer. The Company’s Reducer is a medical device that treats refractory angina by altering blood flow in the heart’s circulatory system.On October 28, 2020, before the market opened, the Company announced that an FDA advisory panel voted overwhelmingly against the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer. The panel noted concerns with the Company’s clinical data, including “that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret.” As a result, the panel reached a consensus “that additional premarket randomized clinical data was necessary.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.77, or 42%, to close at $1.06 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the results of COSIRA, Neovasc’s clinical study for the Reducer, contained imbalances in missing information present in the control group versus the treatment group, including significant missing information for secondary endpoints but none for the primary endpoint; (2) that the imbalance in missing information indicated that control subjects were aware of their treatment assignment (not blinded) and less inclined to participate in additional data collection; (3) that blinding is critical when studying a placebo-responsive condition such as angina; (4) that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, the FDA was reasonably likely to require additional premarket clinical data; (6) that, as a result, the Company’s PMA for Reducer was unlikely to be approved without additional clinical data; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Neovasc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVCNAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please click https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/raytheon-technologies-corporation?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=raytheon.According to the complaint, Raytheon is an aerospace and defense company providing advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company completed a merger and changed “Raytheon Company” to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”The Class Period commences on February 10, 2016, when Raytheon Company published its annual report on a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which stated in relevant part, “we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers’ reviews.”Concerns regarding Raytheon’s financial accounting and internal controls over financial reporting were revealed after market hours on October 27, 2020, when Raytheon filed its quarterly report on a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The Form 10-Q reported that “[o]n October 8, 2020, [Raytheon] received a criminal subpoena from the [U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”Following this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the DOJ; and (6) as a result, the defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.If you wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this litigation, please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 877-9500 (toll free) or (610) 667–7706, or via e-mail at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors may, no later than December 29, 2020, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.  Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law.

(NYSE: C), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.Zosano Pharma Corporation (NASDAQ: ZSAN) Class Period: February 13, 2017 to September 30, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 28, 2020Zosano is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its lead product candidate is Qtrypta (M207), a formulation of zolmitriptan coated onto the Company’s microneedle patch. Its pivotal efficacy trial, called ZOTRIP, began in July 2016. In December 2019, Zosano submitted its New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking regulatory approval for Qtrypta.On September 30, 2020, Zosano disclosed receipt of a discipline review letter (“DRL”) from the FDA regarding its NDA for Qtrypta and stated that approval was not likely. According to the Company’s press release, the FDA “raised questions regarding unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan observed in five study subjects from two pharmacokinetic studies and how the data from these subjects affect the overall clinical pharmacology section of the application.” The FDA also “raised questions regarding differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots of Qtrypta in the company’s clinical trials.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.92, or 57%, to close at $0.70 per share on October 1, 2020.On October 21, 2020, Zosano disclosed receipt of a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA. As a result of the previously identified deficiencies, the FDA recommended that Zosano conduct a repeat bioequivalence study between three of the lots used during development.On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.17, or 27%, to close at $0.04440 per share on October 21, 2020.The complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company’s clinical results reflected differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots; (2) that pharmocokinetic studies submitted in connection with the Company’s NDA included patients exhibiting unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing differences among patient results, the FDA was reasonably likely to require further studies to support regulatory approval of Qtrypta; (4) that, as a result, regulatory approval of Qtrypta was reasonably likely to be delayed; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Zosano class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ZSANCelsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN) Class Period: November 2, 2015 to July 10, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 28, 2020Celsion is an integrated development clinical stage oncology drug company that focuses on the development and commercialization of directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy, and RNA-based therapies for the treatment of cancer.Celsion’s lead product candidate is ThermoDox, a heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin that is in Phase III clinical development for treating primary liver cancer.In February 2014, Celsion announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had reviewed and provided clearance for the Company’s planned pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with radio frequency ablation (“RFA”) in primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), called the “OPTIMA Study.” The trial design was purportedly based on a comprehensive analysis of data from the Company’s Phase III HEAT Study, which purportedly demonstrated that treatment with ThermoDox resulted in a 55% improvement in overall survival (“OS”) in a substantial number of HCC patients that received an optimized RFA treatment. On July 13, 2020, Celsion announced that “it ha[d] received a recommendation from the independent [DMC] to consider stopping the global Phase III OPTIMA Study of ThermoDox® in combination with [RFA] for the treatment of [HCC], or primary liver cancer.” According to the Company, “[t]he recommendation was made following the second pre-planned interim safety and efficacy analysis by the DMC on July 9, 2020,” which “found that the pre-specified boundary for stopping the trial for futility of 0.900 was crossed with an actual value of 0.903.”On this news, Celsion’s stock price fell $2.29 per share, or 63.97%, to close at $1.29 per share on July 13, 2020.The complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy of ThermoDox; (ii) the foregoing significantly diminished the approval and commercialization prospects for ThermoDox; and (iii) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Celsion class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CLSNCitigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) Class Period: January 15, 2016 to October 12, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020The Class Period begins on February 25, 2017, following the Company’s submission of its 2016 Annual Report to the SEC. In that filing, and throughout the Class Period, Citi assured investors that there were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls. When faced with periodic regulatory penalties for noncompliance, the Company continued to assure investors that the specific deficiencies at issue were being remediated promptly and that internal controls and regulatory compliance were a top priority at Citi. In particular, Citi assured investors that it satisfied all regulatory requirements and maintained adequate internal controls, data governance, compliance risk management, and enterprise risk management.In reality, during the Class Period and unbeknownst to investors, Citi’s internal controls and risk management capabilities suffered from “serious” and “longstanding” inadequacies that exposed the Company to massive regulatory penalties and will cost significantly more than $1 billion to remediate. Specific control failures about which Citi executives were warned remained unresolved for years and the Company’s culture of non-compliance was so widespread that Citi’s CEO, Defendant Michael Corbat, exhorted employees in an internal memo that regulatory compliance required more than “checking boxes.”The truth began to emerge on September 14, 2020, when reports surfaced that regulators were preparing to reprimand Citi for failing to improve its risk-management systems.That disclosure caused the price of Citi’s stock to decline $2.85 per share, from $51.00 to $48.15, erasing $5.91 billion in shareholder value.After the market closed on September 14, 2020, an internal memo sent to Citi employees revealed for the first time the Company’s disregard for adequate internal controls and regulatory compliance.As a result, the price of Citi’s stock declined an additional $3.34 per share, from $48.15 to $44.81, erasing $6.93 billion in shareholder value.Then, on October 13, 2020, Citi reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020, and disclosed that the Company’s expenses increased during the third quarter by 5%, to $11 billion, due to an increase in costs including a $400 million fine, investments in infrastructure, and other remediation costs related to control deficiencies.These disclosures caused Citi’s stock price to decline by $2.20 per share, from $45.88 to $43.68, erasing $4.57 billion in shareholder value.For more information on the Citigroup class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRaytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) Class Period: February 10, 2016 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020On October 27, 2020, after market hours, Raytheon filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 (the “3Q20 Report”). The 3Q20 Report announced the DOJ Investigation, stating in pertinent part: “On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”On this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020, on unusually heavy trading volume, damaging investors.The complaint, filed on October 30, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

2020-11-24,"Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) posted a 111.54% decrease in earnings from Q2. Sales, however, increased by 4.88% over the previous quarter to $14.75 billion. Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest Raytheon Technologies is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible. Raytheon Technologies collected $14.06 billion in revenue during Q2, but reported earnings showed a $3.76 billion loss.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Raytheon Technologies posted an ROCE of 0.01%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on RTXReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Raytheon Technologies, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Raytheon Technologies reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.58/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.5/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: iRobot  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Dollar Tree(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-25,"NEW YORK, Nov. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN), Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX), and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ICPT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN) Class Period: November 2, 2015 to July 10, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 28, 2020Celsion is an integrated development clinical stage oncology drug company that focuses on the development and commercialization of directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy, and RNA-based therapies for the treatment of cancer.Celsion’s lead product candidate is ThermoDox, a heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin that is in Phase III clinical development for treating primary liver cancer.In February 2014, Celsion announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had reviewed and provided clearance for the Company’s planned pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with radio frequency ablation (“RFA”) in primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), called the “OPTIMA Study.” The trial design was purportedly based on a comprehensive analysis of data from the Company’s Phase III HEAT Study, which purportedly demonstrated that treatment with ThermoDox resulted in a 55% improvement in overall survival (“OS”) in a substantial number of HCC patients that received an optimized RFA treatment. On July 13, 2020, Celsion announced that “it ha[d] received a recommendation from the independent [DMC] to consider stopping the global Phase III OPTIMA Study of ThermoDox® in combination with [RFA] for the treatment of [HCC], or primary liver cancer.” According to the Company, “[t]he recommendation was made following the second pre-planned interim safety and efficacy analysis by the DMC on July 9, 2020,” which “found that the pre-specified boundary for stopping the trial for futility of 0.900 was crossed with an actual value of 0.903.”On this news, Celsion’s stock price fell $2.29 per share, or 63.97%, to close at $1.29 per share on July 13, 2020.The complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy of ThermoDox; (ii) the foregoing significantly diminished the approval and commercialization prospects for ThermoDox; and (iii) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Celsion class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CLSNCitigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) Class Period: January 15, 2016 to October 12, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020The Class Period begins on February 25, 2017, following the Company’s submission of its 2016 Annual Report to the SEC. In that filing, and throughout the Class Period, Citi assured investors that there were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls. When faced with periodic regulatory penalties for noncompliance, the Company continued to assure investors that the specific deficiencies at issue were being remediated promptly and that internal controls and regulatory compliance were a top priority at Citi. In particular, Citi assured investors that it satisfied all regulatory requirements and maintained adequate internal controls, data governance, compliance risk management, and enterprise risk management.In reality, during the Class Period and unbeknownst to investors, Citi’s internal controls and risk management capabilities suffered from “serious” and “longstanding” inadequacies that exposed the Company to massive regulatory penalties and will cost significantly more than $1 billion to remediate. Specific control failures about which Citi executives were warned remained unresolved for years and the Company’s culture of non-compliance was so widespread that Citi’s CEO, Defendant Michael Corbat, exhorted employees in an internal memo that regulatory compliance required more than “checking boxes.”The truth began to emerge on September 14, 2020, when reports surfaced that regulators were preparing to reprimand Citi for failing to improve its risk-management systems.That disclosure caused the price of Citi’s stock to decline $2.85 per share, from $51.00 to $48.15, erasing $5.91 billion in shareholder value.After the market closed on September 14, 2020, an internal memo sent to Citi employees revealed for the first time the Company’s disregard for adequate internal controls and regulatory compliance.As a result, the price of Citi’s stock declined an additional $3.34 per share, from $48.15 to $44.81, erasing $6.93 billion in shareholder value.Then, on October 13, 2020, Citi reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020, and disclosed that the Company’s expenses increased during the third quarter by 5%, to $11 billion, due to an increase in costs including a $400 million fine, investments in infrastructure, and other remediation costs related to control deficiencies.These disclosures caused Citi’s stock price to decline by $2.20 per share, from $45.88 to $43.68, erasing $4.57 billion in shareholder value.For more information on the Citigroup class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRaytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) Class Period: February 10, 2016 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020On October 27, 2020, after market hours, Raytheon filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 (the “3Q20 Report”). The 3Q20 Report announced the DOJ Investigation, stating in pertinent part: “On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”On this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020, on unusually heavy trading volume, damaging investors.The complaint, filed on October 30, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.For more information on the Raytheon class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/RTXIntercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ICPT) Class Period: September 28, 2019 to October 7, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 4, 2021Intercept’s lead product candidate is Ocaliva (obeticholic acid (“OCA”)), a farnesoid X receptor agonist used for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”), a rare and chronic liver disease, in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults. The Company is also developing OCA for various other indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).On May 22, 2020, Intercept reported that the FDA “has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company’s [NDA] for [OCA] for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to [NASH] has been postponed” to “accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 12.19%, to close at $80.51 per share on May 22, 2020.On June 29, 2020, Intercept issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) rejecting the Company’s NDA for Ocaliva for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH.On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $30.79 per share, or 39.73%, to close at $46.70 per share on June 29, 2020.Then, on October 8, 2020, news outlets reported that Intercept was “facing an investigation from the [FDA] over the potential risk of liver injury in patients taking Ocaliva, [Intercept’s] treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare, chronic liver disease.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $3.30 per share, or 8.05%, to close at $37.69 per share on October 8, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants downplayed the true scope and severity of safety concerns associated with Ocaliva’s use in treating PBC; (ii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of an FDA investigation into Ocaliva’s development, thereby jeopardizing Ocaliva’s continued marketability and the sustainability of its sales; (iii) any purported benefits associated with OCA’s efficacy in treating NASH were outweighed by the risks of its use; (iv) as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the Company’s NDA for OCA in treating patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH; and (v) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Intercept class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ICPT-2About Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) Class Period: February 10, 2016 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: December 29, 2020On October 27, 2020, after market hours, Raytheon filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 (the “3Q20 Report”). The 3Q20 Report announced the DOJ Investigation, stating in pertinent part: “On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”On this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020, on unusually heavy trading volume, damaging investors.The complaint, filed on October 30, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.For more information on the Raytheon class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/RTXIntercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ICPT) Class Period: September 28, 2019 to October 7, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 4, 2021Intercept’s lead product candidate is Ocaliva (obeticholic acid (“OCA”)), a farnesoid X receptor agonist used for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”), a rare and chronic liver disease, in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults. The Company is also developing OCA for various other indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).On May 22, 2020, Intercept reported that the FDA “has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company’s [NDA] for [OCA] for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to [NASH] has been postponed” to “accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 12.19%, to close at $80.51 per share on May 22, 2020.On June 29, 2020, Intercept issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) rejecting the Company’s NDA for Ocaliva for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH.On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $30.79 per share, or 39.73%, to close at $46.70 per share on June 29, 2020.Then, on October 8, 2020, news outlets reported that Intercept was “facing an investigation from the [FDA] over the potential risk of liver injury in patients taking Ocaliva, [Intercept’s] treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare, chronic liver disease.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $3.30 per share, or 8.05%, to close at $37.69 per share on October 8, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants downplayed the true scope and severity of safety concerns associated with Ocaliva’s use in treating PBC; (ii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of an FDA investigation into Ocaliva’s development, thereby jeopardizing Ocaliva’s continued marketability and the sustainability of its sales; (iii) any purported benefits associated with OCA’s efficacy in treating NASH were outweighed by the risks of its use; (iv) as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the Company’s NDA for OCA in treating patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH; and (v) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Intercept class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ICPT-2Neovasc, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVCN) Class Period: October 10, 2018 to October 27, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 4, 2021Neovasc is a specialty medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets products for cardiovascular diseases, including the Tiara technology and the Reducer. The Company’s Reducer is a medical device that treats refractory angina by altering blood flow in the heart’s circulatory system.On October 28, 2020, before the market opened, the Company announced that an FDA advisory panel voted overwhelmingly against the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer. The panel noted concerns with the Company’s clinical data, including “that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret.” As a result, the panel reached a consensus “that additional premarket randomized clinical data was necessary.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.77, or 42%, to close at $1.06 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the results of COSIRA, Neovasc’s clinical study for the Reducer, contained imbalances in missing information present in the control group versus the treatment group, including significant missing information for secondary endpoints but none for the primary endpoint; (2) that the imbalance in missing information indicated that control subjects were aware of their treatment assignment (not blinded) and less inclined to participate in additional data collection; (3) that blinding is critical when studying a placebo-responsive condition such as angina; (4) that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, the FDA was reasonably likely to require additional premarket clinical data; (6) that, as a result, the Company’s PMA for Reducer was unlikely to be approved without additional clinical data; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Neovasc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVCNInterface, Inc. (NASDAQ: TILE) Class Period: March 2, 2018 to September 28, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 11, 2021On April 24, 2019, Defendants filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing, inter alia, that Interface “received a letter in November 2017 from the [SEC] requesting that the Company voluntarily provide information and documents in connection with an investigation into the Company’s historical quarterly [EPS] calculations and rounding practices during the period 2014-2017”; that “[t]he Company subsequently received subpoenas from the SEC in February 2018, July 2018 and April 2019 requesting additional documents and information”; and that “[i]n the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company conducted at the SEC's request an internal investigation into these and other related issues for seven quarters in 2015, 2016 and 2017.”On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $1.43 per share, or 8.37%, to close at $15.66 per share on April 25, 2019.Then, on September 28, 2020, the SEC announced the conclusion of its investigation into Interface's historical quarterly EPS calculations and rounding practices. Interface agreed to pay a $5 million fine to resolve the matter and was ordered to cease and desist from violating the federal securities laws. In the SEC’s enforcement order issued that same day, the SEC also disclosed how, inter alia, “Interface employees caused Interface to produce documents in response to Commission investigative requests that were suggestive of contemporaneous support for journal entries that, in truth, did not exist at the time the entries were recorded,” and had modified certain documents after the SEC’s investigation began.On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $0.20 per share, or 3.13%, over the following two trading sessions to close at $6.18 per share on September 29, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 12, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Interface had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) consequently, Interface, inter alia, reported artificially inflated income and earnings per share (“EPS”) in 2015 and 2016; (iii) Interface and certain of its employees were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with respect to the foregoing issues since at least as early as November 2017, had impeded the SEC’s investigation, and downplayed the true scope of the Company’s wrongdoing and liability with respect to the SEC investigation; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Interface class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TILEAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

The Company is also developing OCA for various other indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).On May 22, 2020, Intercept reported that the FDA “has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company’s [NDA] for [OCA] for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to [NASH] has been postponed” to “accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 12.19%, to close at $80.51 per share on May 22, 2020.On June 29, 2020, Intercept issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) rejecting the Company’s NDA for Ocaliva for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH.On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $30.79 per share, or 39.73%, to close at $46.70 per share on June 29, 2020.Then, on October 8, 2020, news outlets reported that Intercept was “facing an investigation from the [FDA] over the potential risk of liver injury in patients taking Ocaliva, [Intercept’s] treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare, chronic liver disease.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $3.30 per share, or 8.05%, to close at $37.69 per share on October 8, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants downplayed the true scope and severity of safety concerns associated with Ocaliva’s use in treating PBC; (ii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of an FDA investigation into Ocaliva’s development, thereby jeopardizing Ocaliva’s continued marketability and the sustainability of its sales; (iii) any purported benefits associated with OCA’s efficacy in treating NASH were outweighed by the risks of its use; (iv) as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the Company’s NDA for OCA in treating patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH; and (v) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Intercept class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ICPT-2Neovasc, Inc.

The Company’s Reducer is a medical device that treats refractory angina by altering blood flow in the heart’s circulatory system.On October 28, 2020, before the market opened, the Company announced that an FDA advisory panel voted overwhelmingly against the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer. The panel noted concerns with the Company’s clinical data, including “that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret.” As a result, the panel reached a consensus “that additional premarket randomized clinical data was necessary.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.77, or 42%, to close at $1.06 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the results of COSIRA, Neovasc’s clinical study for the Reducer, contained imbalances in missing information present in the control group versus the treatment group, including significant missing information for secondary endpoints but none for the primary endpoint; (2) that the imbalance in missing information indicated that control subjects were aware of their treatment assignment (not blinded) and less inclined to participate in additional data collection; (3) that blinding is critical when studying a placebo-responsive condition such as angina; (4) that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, the FDA was reasonably likely to require additional premarket clinical data; (6) that, as a result, the Company’s PMA for Reducer was unlikely to be approved without additional clinical data; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Neovasc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVCNInterface, Inc. (NASDAQ: TILE) Class Period: March 2, 2018 to September 28, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 11, 2021On April 24, 2019, Defendants filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing, inter alia, that Interface “received a letter in November 2017 from the [SEC] requesting that the Company voluntarily provide information and documents in connection with an investigation into the Company’s historical quarterly [EPS] calculations and rounding practices during the period 2014-2017”; that “[t]he Company subsequently received subpoenas from the SEC in February 2018, July 2018 and April 2019 requesting additional documents and information”; and that “[i]n the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company conducted at the SEC's request an internal investigation into these and other related issues for seven quarters in 2015, 2016 and 2017.”On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $1.43 per share, or 8.37%, to close at $15.66 per share on April 25, 2019.Then, on September 28, 2020, the SEC announced the conclusion of its investigation into Interface's historical quarterly EPS calculations and rounding practices. Interface agreed to pay a $5 million fine to resolve the matter and was ordered to cease and desist from violating the federal securities laws. In the SEC’s enforcement order issued that same day, the SEC also disclosed how, inter alia, “Interface employees caused Interface to produce documents in response to Commission investigative requests that were suggestive of contemporaneous support for journal entries that, in truth, did not exist at the time the entries were recorded,” and had modified certain documents after the SEC’s investigation began.On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $0.20 per share, or 3.13%, over the following two trading sessions to close at $6.18 per share on September 29, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 12, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Interface had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) consequently, Interface, inter alia, reported artificially inflated income and earnings per share (“EPS”) in 2015 and 2016; (iii) Interface and certain of its employees were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with respect to the foregoing issues since at least as early as November 2017, had impeded the SEC’s investigation, and downplayed the true scope of the Company’s wrongdoing and liability with respect to the SEC investigation; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Interface class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TILEAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company completed a merger and changed “Raytheon Company” to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”The Class Period commences on February 10, 2016, when Raytheon Company published its annual report on a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which stated in relevant part, “we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers’ reviews.”Concerns regarding Raytheon’s financial accounting and internal controls over financial reporting were revealed after market hours on October 27, 2020, when Raytheon filed its quarterly report on a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The Form 10-Q reported that “[o]n October 8, 2020, [Raytheon] received a criminal subpoena from the [U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”Following this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the DOJ; and (6) as a result, the defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.If you wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this litigation, please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 877-9500 (toll free) or (610) 667–7706, or via e-mail at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors may, no later than December 29, 2020, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

2020-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Lloyd Austin, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for defense secretary, may have to stay out of decisions on the Pentagon’s costliest weapons system, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, because of his ties to its engine-maker, Raytheon Technologies Corp.Supporters of Austin have focused on the historic role he would occupy as the first Black defense secretary, leading a force that Biden notes is 40% people of color. Critics have questioned whether Congress should grant the retired Army general a waiver from a law barring officers from leading the Pentagon within seven years of leaving the military.But debate during Austin’s Senate confirmation process will also touch on the revolving door between the Pentagon and its multibillion-dollar contractors, a lucrative tradition that also benefited his most recent predecessors in the name of sharing their wisdom about the needs of the Pentagon and its warfighters.Austin, who has served on Raytheon’s board since 2016, also may have to recuse himself from decisions on the company’s missile defense and shipbuilding contracts aimed at countering China and Russia. Other questions will be raised about his role in a private equity group.Under President Donald Trump, recently ousted Defense Secretary Mark Esper was a former top lobbyist for Raytheon and retired general-turned-defense chief Jim Mattis had been on the board of contractor General Dynamics Corp. Both were questioned about conflicts during their Senate hearings -- and then allowed to serve after agreeing to recuse themselves from certain Pentagon decisions.House Majority Whip James Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat who played a pivotal role in Biden’s election, suggested it would be a double standard to call out Austin’s participation on defense contractor boards amid demands that companies increase their racial diversity.“When we ask people to help diversify all the systems and processes, why would we hold it against them when they do?” Clyburn said. “I want people like him at that table so that he can bring those issues to the table that we want brought to the table.”Full ProductionThe first major acquisition decision faced by the incoming Biden administration may be when and whether to approve the roughly $400 billion F-35 program for full production, the most lucrative phase of a weapons program for contractors. Raytheon’s Pratt & Whitney engine unit, acquired in a merger with United Technologies Corp., has an estimated value of $66.4 billion, according to the Pentagon’s latest annual cost report.Raytheon is also the maker of Tomahawk missiles and the Standard Missile-3 missile defense interceptor, and it’s a major contractor on Navy programs, providing radar and electronic warfare systems to warships and aircraft carriers.Austin’s total compensation as a member of Raytheon’s board of directors amounts to $1.4 million since 2016, according to company records. His compensation is a mix of cash and stock awards.By the time of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Austin will have had his finances scrutinized by the panel’s staff. He will have already filed a financial disclosure statement for public review with the Office of Government Ethics detailing his cash and stock compensation and holdings and disclosing their value within broad ranges.And he will have filed an ethics agreement on steps he would take to resolve potential conflicts of interest, including which assets he would divest.In 2019, Esper, who already had sold his Raytheon stock when he became secretary of the army, pledged to recuse himself as defense secretary from “participating personally and substantially” in decisions that would have a “direct and predictable effect” on Raytheon. He’s still slated to receive $1 million to $5 million after 2022 in deferred compensation from the contractor.‘Ethically Rigorous’“Secretary-designate Austin will recuse himself consistent with ethics requirements,” Sean Savett, a spokesman for Biden’s transition office, said in an email. “Joe Biden has pledged the most ethically rigorous administration in American history, and every cabinet member will abide by all disclosure requirements and strict ethics.”He’ll also have to provide details on his other business ventures since retiring. This year, Austin became a partner in Pine Island Capital Partners, a private equity partnership between a group of New York-based investors and Washington-based former government officials. Biden’s choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is also involved with the private equity firm.Savett said Austin will divest from his interests in Pine Island and Raytheon if confirmed. The firm’s stated goal is to invest in mid-sized companies with values from $50 million to $500 million, specifically targeting aerospace and defense, retail, financial services, health care, manufacturing and technology. In September, Pine Island Acquisition, a blank-check company formed by Pine Island Capital Partners to target the defense industry, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise as much as $300 million in an initial public offering.Austin’s role at Pine Island Capital might raise bigger questions than his connection to Raytheon, according to Mandy Smithberger, director of defense information at the Project on Government Oversight. “They’re pretty open about the fact that they’re selling access,” she said.Pine Island Capital, which advertises on its website the prominent government jobs its Washington team used to hold, is “literally the business of the revolving door,” Smithberger said.In the end, though, the interplay within what President Dwight Eisenhower called the “military-industrial complex” has become an accepted part of life in Washington.Austin “needs to be treated like everyone else,” said Representative Marc Veasey, a Texas Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus. “He should be judged on the job he did while he was general and questioned about his expertise on matters surrounding defense and security of this country.”(Adds comments about Austin’s plans to divest in 16th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Board Job Likely Bars Biden Pentagon Chief From Some Arms Deals

The 3Q20 Report announced the DOJ Investigation, stating in pertinent part: “On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”On this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020, on unusually heavy trading volume, damaging investors.The complaint, filed on October 30, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

The Company is also developing OCA for various other indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).On May 22, 2020, Intercept reported that the FDA “has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company’s [NDA] for [OCA] for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to [NASH] has been postponed” to “accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 12.19%, to close at $80.51 per share on May 22, 2020.On June 29, 2020, Intercept issued a press release announcing that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) rejecting the Company’s NDA for Ocaliva for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH.On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $30.79 per share, or 39.73%, to close at $46.70 per share on June 29, 2020.Then, on October 8, 2020, news outlets reported that Intercept was “facing an investigation from the [FDA] over the potential risk of liver injury in patients taking Ocaliva, [Intercept’s] treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare, chronic liver disease.”On this news, Intercept’s stock price fell $3.30 per share, or 8.05%, to close at $37.69 per share on October 8, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants downplayed the true scope and severity of safety concerns associated with Ocaliva’s use in treating PBC; (ii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of an FDA investigation into Ocaliva’s development, thereby jeopardizing Ocaliva’s continued marketability and the sustainability of its sales; (iii) any purported benefits associated with OCA’s efficacy in treating NASH were outweighed by the risks of its use; (iv) as a result, the FDA was unlikely to approve the Company’s NDA for OCA in treating patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH; and (v) as a result of all the foregoing, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Intercept class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ICPT-2Neovasc, Inc.

The Company’s Reducer is a medical device that treats refractory angina by altering blood flow in the heart’s circulatory system.On October 28, 2020, before the market opened, the Company announced that an FDA advisory panel voted overwhelmingly against the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer. The panel noted concerns with the Company’s clinical data, including “that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret.” As a result, the panel reached a consensus “that additional premarket randomized clinical data was necessary.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.77, or 42%, to close at $1.06 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 5, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the results of COSIRA, Neovasc’s clinical study for the Reducer, contained imbalances in missing information present in the control group versus the treatment group, including significant missing information for secondary endpoints but none for the primary endpoint; (2) that the imbalance in missing information indicated that control subjects were aware of their treatment assignment (not blinded) and less inclined to participate in additional data collection; (3) that blinding is critical when studying a placebo-responsive condition such as angina; (4) that the lack of blinding assessment made the primary endpoint difficult to interpret; (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, the FDA was reasonably likely to require additional premarket clinical data; (6) that, as a result, the Company’s PMA for Reducer was unlikely to be approved without additional clinical data; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Neovasc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVCNInterface, Inc. (NASDAQ: TILE) Class Period: March 2, 2018 to September 28, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 11, 2021On April 24, 2019, Defendants filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing, inter alia, that Interface “received a letter in November 2017 from the [SEC] requesting that the Company voluntarily provide information and documents in connection with an investigation into the Company’s historical quarterly [EPS] calculations and rounding practices during the period 2014-2017”; that “[t]he Company subsequently received subpoenas from the SEC in February 2018, July 2018 and April 2019 requesting additional documents and information”; and that “[i]n the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company conducted at the SEC's request an internal investigation into these and other related issues for seven quarters in 2015, 2016 and 2017.”On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $1.43 per share, or 8.37%, to close at $15.66 per share on April 25, 2019.Then, on September 28, 2020, the SEC announced the conclusion of its investigation into Interface's historical quarterly EPS calculations and rounding practices. Interface agreed to pay a $5 million fine to resolve the matter and was ordered to cease and desist from violating the federal securities laws. In the SEC’s enforcement order issued that same day, the SEC also disclosed how, inter alia, “Interface employees caused Interface to produce documents in response to Commission investigative requests that were suggestive of contemporaneous support for journal entries that, in truth, did not exist at the time the entries were recorded,” and had modified certain documents after the SEC’s investigation began.On this news, Interface’s stock price fell $0.20 per share, or 3.13%, over the following two trading sessions to close at $6.18 per share on September 29, 2020.The complaint, filed on November 12, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Interface had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) consequently, Interface, inter alia, reported artificially inflated income and earnings per share (“EPS”) in 2015 and 2016; (iii) Interface and certain of its employees were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with respect to the foregoing issues since at least as early as November 2017, had impeded the SEC’s investigation, and downplayed the true scope of the Company’s wrongdoing and liability with respect to the SEC investigation; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the Interface class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TILEAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company completed a merger and changed “Raytheon Company” to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”The Class Period commences on February 10, 2016, when Raytheon Company published its annual report on a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which stated in relevant part, “we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers’ reviews.”Concerns regarding Raytheon’s financial accounting and internal controls over financial reporting were revealed after market hours on October 27, 2020, when Raytheon filed its quarterly report on a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The Form 10-Q reported that “[o]n October 8, 2020, [Raytheon] received a criminal subpoena from the [U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”Following this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the DOJ; and (6) as a result, the defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.If you wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this litigation, please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 887-9500 (toll free) or (610) 667–7706, or via e-mail at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors who wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 887-9500 (toll free) or at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors may, no later than December 29, 2020, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.  Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law.

2020-12-21,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) plans on extending its footprint in the rocket engine market by acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne, a leading rocket engine manufacturer in the United States.",Lockheed Martin (LMT) to Acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for $5B
2020-12-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. is expanding its foray into futuristic space travel and missile defense by acquiring supplier Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. in a deal valued at $4.4 billion, targeting higher sales and more savings in an environment of tightening defense budgets.As part of the transaction, Aerojet declared a $5 per share special dividend, to be paid on March 24, to holders of record as of March 10. The payment of that special dividend will adjust the $56 per share consideration to be paid by Lockheed Martin, according to a statement Sunday.At $51, Lockheed will be buying Aerojet at a 21% premium from the closing price on Friday. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Jim Taiclet stepped into the top job this year with a reputation as a dealmaker and a stockpile of cash. With Aerojet, he’s picking up a key U.S. supplier of propulsion systems for missiles, rockets and other space and defense applications.Still, the consolidation is likely to face scrutiny from key customers such as the U.S. Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Another question mark is the reaction of competitors such as Boeing Co. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. that rely on Aerojet’s motors for their own hypersonics and missile products.Potential ‘Pushback’It’s not clear how defense and antitrust officials “will view this deal, especially in a new administration, but we could imagine pushback from others in industry, such as Raytheon or Boeing,” Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to customers.Aerojet soared 22% to $51.11 at 9:55 a.m. in New York after surging as much as 26%, the most intraday since 2009. Lockheed fell 2% to $348.79, giving the world’s largest defense contractor a market value of almost $98 billion. Aerojet declined 7.9% this year through Dec. 18 while Lockheed dropped 8.6%. A Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. aerospace and defense companies tumbled 18% over the same period.Lockheed has been scouting for acquisitions. In January, the company said it was flush with cash and open to deals as Raytheon Co. prepared to combine with United Technologies Corp. to create a powerhouse in aerospace and defense.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Lockheed’s planned $4.4 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne would add a key supplier of propulsion systems in hypersonics, space systems and franchise missile programs, all key defense areas, and we believe it may help it sustain growth above the flattening U.S. defense budget.”\--Douglas Rothacker, aerospace analyst\--click here for read the researchDuring Lockheed’s October earnings call, Taiclet said the company would be active but “very, very prudent” in its drive to “bring in the technologies faster into the company that we think are going to be crucial for the future.”The Aerojet transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 after getting regulatory approvals and a nod from Aerojet’s shareholders.At the end of last week, Aerojet’s stock was trading at 25 times expected earnings, compared with 16 times for Lockheed.Lockheed’s space division is its third-largest business, contributing 18% of its 2019 revenue. The company competes with Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. for U.S. government rocket launches through the United Launch Alliance, its joint venture with Boeing.Lockheed was advised by Goldman Sachs, Ardea Partners and Hogan Lovells, while Citigroup and Evercore, as well as Jenner & Block and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represented Aerojet.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Lockheed to Boost Space Expansion With $4.4 Billion Aerojet Deal

On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company completed a merger and changed “Raytheon Company” to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”The Class Period commences on February 10, 2016, when Raytheon Company published its annual report on a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which stated in relevant part, “we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers’ reviews.”Concerns regarding Raytheon’s financial accounting and internal controls over financial reporting were revealed after market hours on October 27, 2020, when Raytheon filed its quarterly report on a Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The Form 10-Q reported that “[o]n October 8, 2020, [Raytheon] received a criminal subpoena from the [U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009.”Following this news, the price of Raytheon shares fell $4.19 per share, or 7%, to close at $52.34 per share on October 28, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the DOJ; and (6) as a result, the defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.If you wish to discuss this securities fraud class action lawsuit or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this litigation, please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check (James Maro, Jr., Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (844) 887-9500 (toll free) or (610) 667–7706, or via e-mail at info@ktmc.com.Raytheon investors may, no later than December 29, 2020, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.  Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law.

2021-01-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Retired General Lloyd Austin, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for defense secretary, may get as much as $1.7 million in payments tied to the board seat he’d be giving up at defense contractor Raytheon Technologies Co.“As soon as practicable but not later than 90 days after my confirmation, I will divest my financial interest in Raytheon,” Austin wrote in his ethics agreement with the Pentagon and his financial disclosure report, which are being released Sunday by the Office of Government Ethics. He also pledged to recuse himself for one year from decisions involving Raytheon, the nation’s No. 3 defense contractor.That may include some decisions on the F-35, the costliest U.S. weapons system, because Raytheon’s Pratt & Whitney unit makes the fighter jet’s engines.The documents, which give the value of holdings in broad ranges, show that Austin may receive $750,000 to $1.7 million when he divests his shares in Raytheon and associated entities.Austin joined the board of United Technologies Corp., which owned Pratt & Whitney, when he retired from the Army in 2016. He became a director of Raytheon after it acquired United Technologies in April 2020.Ethics OfficerAustin’s ethics agreement outlining the Raytheon recusal indicates it isn’t absolute: It cites an exemption in a Standards of Conduct law that would allow his involvement in a Raytheon issue if a designated Pentagon ethics officer determined that the government’s interest in Austin’s participation outweighed a perception he may not be impartial.Austin, who led forces in the Mideast as head of U.S. Central Command, would make history as the first Black U.S. defense secretary. His confirmation process will begin with a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee scheduled for Jan. 19. He also would have to receive a congressional waiver from a law preventing retired military officers from serving as defense secretary until they’ve been out of office for seven years.Austin’s ethics agreement is a standard part of a post-Watergate process intended to give lawmakers and taxpayers assurances that public officials follow conflict of interest standards. It draws extra attention at the Defense Department because of concerns about the influence of the military-industrial complex and the revolving door between the Pentagon and its multibillion-dollar contractors.Unlike President Donald Trump’s former defense secretary, Mark Esper, who drew criticism from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren for having worked as Raytheon’s chief lobbyist, Austin had a much less extensive relationship with the company. His situation may be closer to that of another of Trump’s defense chiefs, James Mattis, who recused himself for a year from decisions involving General Dynamics Corp. because he had served on its board from 2013 to 2017 and severed all financial ties.In Austin’s ethics agreement, he said he would resign from Raytheon’s board upon confirmation as well as from positions with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. and Pine Island Capital Partners. Austin last year became a partner in Pine Island, a private equity partnership between a group of New York-based investors, and made a loan of as much as $15,000 to the group. He said he plans to liquidate “any rights I may have to any future interest in the company.”The firm’s stated goal is to invest in mid-sized companies with values from $50 million to $500 million, specifically targeting aerospace and defense, retail, financial services, health care, manufacturing and technology. In September, Pine Island Acquisition, a blank-check company formed by Pine Island Capital Partners to target the defense industry, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise as much as $300 million in an initial public offering.The exact value of Austin’s payout from his Raytheon ties will be based on the closing price of the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company and two offshoots from its merger -- Otis Worldwide Corp. and Carrier Global Corp. -- when executed.The largest potential amount is $500,000 to $1 million in a category of “vested, deferred” Raytheon stock units. The second-largest, valued at as much as $500,000 -- $250,000 each -- are “vested deferred stock units” granted Austin from the Otis and Carrier spinoffs.“In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and my board benefits agreement, when I resign” from Raytheon it will “liquidate” those stocks and “give me a cash payout on or before the first business day that is” 30 days after he resigns. The payments will be based on the closing share prices of the respective stocks that day, Austin wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Biden Defense Pick to Get Up to $1.7 Million From Raytheon Role

2021-01-13,"NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating certain officers and directors of Jeld-Wen (NYSE: JELD), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX), and L Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LB) on behalf of long-term stockholders. More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided.  Jeld-Wen Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: JELD) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Jeld Wen Holding, Inc. following news that the Shareholder Class Action Against Jeld-Wen has survived the motions to dismiss in the pending securities class action and may face damages.According to the securities class action complaint, throughout the Class Period defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud and made materially false and misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, regarding the Company’s business, operations, growth prospects, and competitive positioning. Specifically, defendants stated that Jeld-Wen products, including doors, compete against other manufacturers on price, and described the market in which the Company sells its doors as “highly competitive.” Defendants also attributed Jeld-Wen’s strong margins and anticipated margin growth to legitimate business factors, such as “making strategic pricing decisions based on an analysis of customer and product level profitability” and increasing its emphasis on “pricing optimization.” These and similar statements made by defendants during the Class Period were false and misleading because defendants knew that Jeld-Wen was engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy with another door manufacturer to artificially increase or maintain prices of interior molded doors. As a result of defendants’ misrepresentations, shares of Jeld-Wen’s common stock traded at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class Period. On October 26, 2020, U.S. District Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. denied defendants’ motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged securities fraud claims.For more information on our investigation into Jeld-Wen go to: https://bespc.com/cases/JELDRaytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Raytheon Technologies Company following a class action complaint that was filed against Raytheon on October 30, 2020.The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Raytheon had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (2) Raytheon had faulty financial accounting; (3) as a result, Raytheon misreported its costs regarding Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business since 2009; (4) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon was at risk of increased scrutiny from the government; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Raytheon would face a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); and (6) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

(NYSE: LB) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of L Brands, Inc. Company following a class action complaint that was filed against L Brands on July 23, 2019.The complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding L Brands’ business and prospects, which caused L Brands stock to trade at artificially inflated prices of more than $37 per share during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, prior to and during the Class Period, L Brands’ Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses began to experience deteriorating operating performance due to, among other things, increased competition from new lingerie brands. In an attempt to drive sales and retain market share in the face of increasing competition, Victoria's Secret and PINK engaged in heavy promotional activities by offering consumers large discounts and even giving items free of charge. While this marketing strategy helped to mitigate sales declines, it adversely impacted the Company’s profit margins and cash flows and had a deleterious impact on the Company's liquidity. In response to questions from securities analysts about the sustainability of the Company’s dividends, defendants repeatedly stated that L Brands had sufficient cash flow and cash on hand to sustain its dividends and that the Company, “in its history, ha[d] never reduced the dividend.” Then, just weeks after defendants issued a series of false and misleading statements about the Company's dividends, L Brands announced that it was cutting its dividend in half so that it could pay down existing debt. In response to this news, the price of L Brands common stock declined approximately 18%, from $34.55 per share on November 19, 2018 to $28.43 per share on November 20, 2018.For more information on our Investigation into L Brands go to: https://bespc.com/cases/LBAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

2021-02-16,"During Q4, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) brought in sales totaling $16.42 billion. However, earnings decreased 271.2%, resulting in a loss of $743.00 million. In Q3, Raytheon Technologies earned $434.00 million and total sales reached $14.75 billion. What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Raytheon Technologies's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Raytheon Technologies posted an ROCE of -0.01%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on RTX ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Raytheon Technologies is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For Raytheon Technologies, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Insight Raytheon Technologies reported Q4 earnings per share at $0.74/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.7/share.

2021-02-19,"Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) shares experienced unusual options activity on Friday. The stock price moved up to $73.91 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-06-18 Strike Price: $80.00 Volume: 383 Open Interest: 19740 3 Ways Options Activity is ‘Unusual’ Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa. Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being “out of the money”. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are “bullish” when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are “bearish” when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor’s true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they’re hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-05-20,"Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX) has inked a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) to enhance future wireless networks. The two are joining forces to develop and commercialize a new gallium nitride on silicon semiconductors to enhance frequency performance on 5G and 6G. Raytheon is a defense and aerospace company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a worldwide semiconductor manufacturer. The partnership seeks to enable high-performance and affordable communication technologies. Plans are underway to develop the new semiconductor in Burlington, Vermont. (See Raytheon stock analysis on TipRanks) ""Raytheon Technologies was one of the pioneers advancing RF gallium arsenide technology which has been broadly used in mobile and wireless markets, and we have similarly been at the forefront of advancing gallium nitride technology for use in advanced military systems,"" said Raytheon’s CTO Mark Russell. GF's partnership with Raytheon is one of many, as the company seeks to deliver differentiated solutions in the semiconductor industry. The company has invested $15 billion in semiconductor development over the last decade. Raytheon's delivery of an impressive 2025 sales target has caught the attention of Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr. Rumohr stated, “RTX's Investor Day unveiled a 2025 sales/ops target that looks mostly plausible off the depressed 2020 base. It also showcased impressive technology (thermal materials, additive mfg. etc.) and a solid updated FCF/deployment guide. While it's always hard to gauge five-year targets, the stock has a moderate 13.7x 2022 total enterprise value/EBITDA and scarcity value as the largest commercial aftermarket recovery play.” The analyst has an $88 price target on the stock implying 3.90% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 11 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $94.33 implies 11.37% upside potential to current levels. RTX scores a ""Perfect 10"" on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, suggesting it is likely to outperform the overall market.
