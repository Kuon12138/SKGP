2018-08-07,"Investors tend to be drawn to hot technology and biotechnology stocks for their growth prospects - not for the cash they return to shareholders. But several well-known tech and biotech stocks could afford to invest in their businesses, buy back their shares and pay dividends, if only they chose to. When it comes to returning cash to shareholders, corporate management often prefers stock buybacks to dividends because it gives them flexibility. A company can adjust its share repurchases according to business and market conditions. A dividend is a commitment. The market often exacts severe and swift revenge if a company cuts or suspends its payout. The initiation of a dividend can also be taken as a sign that a company or stock&apos;s best days are behind it. A quick look at Apple&apos;s (AAPL) performance shows that&apos;s not necessarily the case. The company reinstated its dividend in 2012 after a 17-year hiatus. Between price appreciation and payouts, Apple stock has delivered a total return of about 170% since March 2012, when it announced plans to reinstate its dividend later that year - the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index is up about 130% over the same span, including dividends. The following five stocks don&apos;t yet offer dividends, but they should ... and could.

2018-09-12,"Hedge funds often are referred to as the market&apos;s &quot;smart money&quot; because of their management&apos;s longtime expertise and penchant for making good investing decisions. Sure, they don&apos;t always live up to the hype, and they can be expensive. But they do comprise a large chunk of institutional investment dollars, and some do perform very well. So when you&apos;re looking for the best stocks to buy, it pays to see what these hedge funds are doing. As WalletHub points out, hedge funds currently have $3 trillion in assets under management. What they&apos;re doing with those assets certainly is interesting, and perhaps even instructive. Helpfully, WalletHub did a deep dive into which American stocks are most popular with U.S. hedge funds. Combing through regulatory filings, they looked at the positions of more than 400 hedge funds, added up the positions for the same stock, then ranked the stocks by their total holdings value. Spoiler alert: Every one of these companies is massive by market value. Indeed, they would have to be to accommodate so much institutional interest. It also is no surprise that these stock picks are all household names. Here&apos;s a look at the 25 best stocks to buy, based on how heavily they&apos;re held by hedge funds. Not every one of the following stocks is necessarily a buy at current prices, but there certainly are no dogs in the group. In other words, it&apos;s not hard to see why these stocks are the ones hedge funds love the most.

And while the Democratic takeover of the House had some investors worried about gridlock, some experts view it through bullish-tinted glasses. &quot;We think markets likely view this outcome as positive since it removes the risk of an all-Democratic Congress,&quot; Evercore Managing Director Terry Haines told Bloomberg, &quot;and the increased Republican Senate majority offers additional assurance that the 2017 tax cuts would not be rolled back in 2021 in the event of a Democratic president.&quot; In that light, it&apos;s easy to assume the best and start seeking out aggressive, high-growth, high-risk names. But it&apos;s incorrect to think only risky stocks are capable of producing strong growth. Sometimes big, well-established old-school names are surprisingly capable of putting up some big numbers, too: all the reward potential, with much less risk. Here are 12 top blue-chip stocks that still sport impressive growth and/or profit estimates - even against the backdrop of a (very) mature economic growth cycle.

Sure, they don&apos;t always live up to the hype, and they can be expensive. But they do comprise a large chunk of institutional investment dollars, and some do perform very well. And as WalletHub points out, hedge funds currently have $3 trillion in assets under management ... so what they&apos;re doing with those assets certainly is interesting, and perhaps even instructive. Certainly, when you&apos;re looking for the best blue-chip stocks to buy, it pays to see what these hedge funds are doing - especially in difficult times such as the current stock-market correction. Helpfully, WalletHub did a deep dive into which American stocks are most popular with U.S. hedge funds. Combing through regulatory filings, they looked at the positions of more than 400 hedge funds, added up the positions for the same stock, then ranked the stocks by their total holdings value. Spoiler alert: Every one of these companies is massive by market value. Indeed, they would have to be to accommodate so much institutional interest. It also is no surprise that these stock picks are all household names. Here are the 25 best blue-chip stocks to buy, based on how heavily they&apos;re held by hedge funds. Many of these stocks have shed some value over the past few months, but most of them have just been swept up in the current market correction. Despite recent pain, it&apos;s not hard to see why these stocks are the ones hedge funds still love the most.

2019-01-09,"Despite the turmoil in the overall stock market, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) has been surprisingly resilient. On Monday, Twilio stock was again flirting with a breakout over $100 per share. If it does break out and the overall markets avoid a retest of the lows, this high-growth -- and high-valuation -- stock can really take off.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



Twilio is definitely a regret for me. As an investor, I know that we can't win 'em all and that we won't always buy at the bottom and sell at the top. With that said, picking out a stock and failing to pull the trigger on what ends up being a big winner is a tough pill to swallow.

My biggest issue with the company has always been its valuation. Nonetheless, Twilio runs an excellent business and has a lot of momentum behind it right now. Bulls are betting that it can maintain pace.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Valuing Twilio Stock

Analysts expect Twilio to grow sales 58% this year to $630 million, followed by 32% growth to ~$828 million in 2019. They also expect almost 160% earnings growth this year to 11 cents a share. Forecasts call for 45% growth to 19 cents a share in 2019. Clearly, the company still touts strong growth, even if the rate is decelerating after a strong 2018.

Shares exploded after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter results in November, climbing more than 33%. Remember, this was during a time of turmoil for the stock market -- although, admittedly, the worst was yet to come. In Twilio's case, the company beat expectations and raised forecasts, giving investors confidence that Twilio had the wind at its back.

Will that continue? Clearly, some believe it will.

On Monday, Piper Jaffray analysts named Twilio a top software pick for 2019, along with Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Zendesk (NASDAQ:ZEN). On Tuesday, Keybanc analysts maintained their &quot;overweight&quot; rating, but bumped their price target from $103 to $114.

While I believe the stock can break out (assuming the market holds up going forward), there are some concerns for TWLO. Concerns like TWLO stock being up 400% since February 2018 and that net income continues to dip (despite showing positive non-GAAP earnings). There's also the fact that free-cash flow remains negative.

Again, momentum here is strong -- margins are on the rise, customer count is climbing and, obviously, revenue is moving in the right direction. But those issues are a few things to take note of for investors looking at a longer-term position.

### Trading TWLO Stock

  
Click to Enlarge

The trend has been from the lower left to the upper right, with resistance at $100 on the nose. You'll notice the first test of $100 came after Twilio stock's powerful post-earnings rally. The fact that investors were able to buy TWLO stock about two weeks later at pre-earnings levels should have been a flashing buy sign for the name. Unfortunately for me, I missed my chance in Twilio and will have to move on as a result.

Traders, though, can still extract some alpha. Over the last three months, Twilio stock has rallied to $100 three times now. The first two times held as resistance, so we can't rule out that possibility again. If there is resistance at the $100 level, look for a possible pullback down to the $80-$84 level. That lands TWLO stock near uptrend support and the 50-day moving average.

Should $100 give way, then we have a breakout in the name. Not that I like to buy a stock that's up ~33% in a one-month span, but pushing through $100 could pave the way to $110 or possibly higher. The issue? We need the overall markets to play ball too. After a quick post-Christmas rally, indices have already gone a fair distance in just a few trading sessions.

Regardless, Twilio stock is setting up as a solid trade -- either as a breakout candidate or a buy-on-dip name.

2019-01-15,"Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) has never been Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It wasn't founded to sell consumer goods. Its cloud isn't challenging Amazon in infrastructure. And in the past six months, BABA stock has suffered a drop about two times that seen by AMZN shares.

Instead of selling raw infrastructure, Alibaba is developing software services that let companies design products for specific markets and get them through distribution channels. That's the strategy that led them recently to buy Data Artisans, a Berlin-based software company, for $103 million. Data Artisans dominates in the development of Apache Flink, an open source data processing system.

So, while Amazon sells infrastructure, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sells a platform, in other words, Alibaba has gone up the stack, like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), selling a unique solution.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Leveraging Cheap Tech Workers

The result of Alibaba going up the stack doesn't just cut its retailers' costs and make them competitive. It also supports Chinese goods exports, and raises the value of all of Alibaba's cloud offerings, allowing it to enter western markets, starting in Europe. 

The costs are higher, but so are the margins. About 40% of Alibaba's 50,000 employees are tech workers. Thanks to the bear market in tech, and the China trade war, they can now get into this cheap.

### All Eyes on Earnings

Alibaba is expected to earn $1.38 per share on revenue of $17.25 billion when it reports earnings on January 30. That would bring total revenue for the last four quarters to over $52 billion, against a market cap of $390 billion when the market opened January 11.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into 



Like the other cloud czars, including Amazon, BABA stock has had a terrible six months, the shares dropping by about a third from a high of $206 to a low of $139 per share, closing yesterday below $150. With about $3.45 per share in earnings expected for the calendar year, that's a price to earnings ratio of 43, against Amazon's 92, and Alibaba is a higher-margin operator.

The China trade war, along with rhetoric from Washington and New York about the &quot;Chinese Communists&quot; (executive chairman Jack Ma admits he is a party member), has helped push Alibaba's price down. But China isn't any more communist today than many other countries. It's a party-run dictatorship, but so are our &quot;friends&quot; in Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Alibaba's home market is still growing faster than the U.S., and it has been more successful than other Chinese software companies in selling services outside its home market. Alibaba Cloud now has 55 availability zones across 19 regions , including two in the U.S. 

### Get It at a Discount?

If you don't trust China and you don't like Alibaba's price, you can actually get it at a discount by buying Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA), the former Yahoo. Its primary asset is a holding of 383 million Alibaba shares, worth about $57 billion on the open market, but Altaba itself has a market cap of just $38 billion. Since it's selling out of Yahoo Japan (OTCMKTS:YAHOY) it's even more of a pure play on Alibaba stock.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



My problem is this only gives you Alibaba stock second-hand (just like some of the items on AliExpress). Altaba has no income, and you're stuck waiting for its board to monetize the stake for you. But they do have 15% of Alibaba's common, and if Alibaba wants them out, they'll have to pay a premium to achieve that.

### The Bottom Line on BABA Stock

Alibaba today is a unique value proposition. It's not the Chinese Amazon. It's not even a &quot;Cloud Czar&quot; in the way of Amazon and Microsoft. And it'd be wrong to look at BABA stock as you would be shares of those others.

Alibaba is what it has always been, a software company dedicated to moving markets from the 19th to the 21st century. Like Amazon, it uses distribution and retailing for the financial scale needed to grow, and as a demonstration of what its cloud does. Beyond that, it's something completely different -- just like Alibaba stock.

2019-01-16,"Everyone seems to love Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) stock. Call me an old fogey, but I don't get it.

At its market cap of $17 billion, investors are paying roughly 17 times expected 2018 revenue. There is an awesome growth rate of roughly 30% on the top line, but profits remain stubbornly out of sight, and analysts don't expect any this quarter, a loss of six cents per share on revenue of $314 million.

Shopify did have positive operating cash flow in its September quarter, but at $2.86 million that's nearly a rounding error. The bulk of its rising cash flow still comes from investment and financing.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But analysts still love the stock. There are now 29 following it, and 16 have it on their buy lists. They're expecting 71 cents per share of earnings for 2019.

I suspect they will be disappointed, as they have been disappointed by past Canadian tech stars like Corel and Blackberry (NASDAQ:BB).

### SHOP Stock Is Good at Growth

What Shopify seems to be best at is finding new merchants and selling stock.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), for instance, pounded the table for Shopify last month just as it was completing an offering of 2.4 million shares, with limited voting rights, at $154 per share. After a week's fall for the tech wreck, those shares took off and opened for trade January 16 back at the offering price.

The offering raised about $400 million, bringing the company's cash pile to $2 billion, which it has been using to launch into new markets, acquire other companies like Sweden's TicTail, and offer loans to its merchant clients.

Shopify says its developers brought in about $2 billion in 2018, while its own revenues are approaching $1.1 billion. The app store, where shopkeepers can get things like Web-to-print product Brush Your Ideas, is Shopify's secret sauce, because it takes 20% of that revenue, and this helps it compete with rivals like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Magento or privately held Squarespace and BigCommerce.

But Shopify doesn't seem to have the same respect for its customers' customers. The online world is filled with scams and dodgy merchandise, and Shopify is regularly shocked, shocked by what happens to consumers in its stores.

Until recently, for instance, one of its merchants was a gun store that reportedly moved $11.4 million through a Shopify store. Shopify has also served Instagram &quot;stars&quot; with drop-ship scams which claim to be giving away valuable merchandise but are actually up-selling junk.

### How Big?

While Shopify stock is very volatile, it's no longer the home run it was in 2017, when it doubled in price. Over the last year it has traded for as little as $111 per share and for as much as $174, matching the volatility of the market. If you bought it just after Christmas, you look like a genius. If you bought two weeks before you look like an idiot.

Most news on Shopify involves the stock, not the company or its technology. You'll find stories asking if it's the next Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), a millionaire maker stock.

### The Bottom Line on Shopify Stock

Maybe it's because I've been following the Internet for 40 years, but I still have a suspicion, as I wrote over a year ago, that the Shopify story is going to end in tears.

The company seems to be all about getting new customers, opening new stores, selling more apps, and not about pleasing consumers, which is the metric by which real stores, and real companies, are measured.

You may make money on Shopify with quick moves, but I don't see a long-term future here.

### NASDAQ/NGS:ADBE

View full report here!

## Summary

  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for ADBE with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting ADBE.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $4.87 billion over the last one-month into ETFs that hold ADBE are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Technology sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

While I see stocks largely range-bound through the first half of 2019, in the near term, stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) have potential in either direction for trades. Below I discuss two potential trade setups in ADBE stock.

One of the most serious challenges for most market participants is to keep their time frames for trades/investments straight. In other words, just because one say has a bullish view on stocks through a six-month lens doesn't mean stocks can't drop a few percentage points in the ensuing days or weeks. Think about it, have you ever ultimately been correct on your views on a stock but off in the near term timing? I know I  have, too many times to admit it … but each time valuable lessons were learned.

To wit, when I look at a bigger picture chart of something like shares of Adobe, I have my concerns through a six-to-12-month lens, but that does not mean the stock can't see further appreciation in the near-term.

Moving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 week

Looking at the multiyear chart, we see that ADBE stock thanks to the selling spree in Q4 2018 has mean-reverted back to a longer-standing reference support line. The bulls will point out that such a re-test is healthy and that from a longer-term momentum perspective (MACD momentum oscillator at bottom of chart) the stock remains oversold.

While I don't doubt the stock can back and fill in either direction by a few percentage points here, it's hard to imagine ADBE stock will see fresh all time highs anytime soon.

  
Click to Enlarge

Moving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 day

On the daily chart we note that ADBE stock has now rallied sharply (more than 20%) off the late December lows and is coming into an area of well-defined technical resistance. The way I see it one of two trades will likely trigger in the near future:

* Either ADBE will break and hold below $240, which could lead to a move lower toward $223 - $227
* Or ADBE will break and hold above $250, which could allow it to squeeze higher toward a next upside target around $260-$262.

Either way, at this juncture traders would be well advised to respect the potential for both of these moves rather than having staunch opinions on a near term directional move in one direction or another.

2019-01-23,"Buy-and-hold investing isn't just about sitting around and collecting dividends.

That's not to cast any aspersions on dividends. Far from it. Regular and rising payouts are often the key to beating the market over long periods of time. Just have a look at the best stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the past half-century.

But when we're looking at shorter time frames, such as, say, a single decade, strong and sustainable earnings growth is a critical factor too. Companies with key advantages in growing industries - or that have a long history of adapting to changing times - have a better chance of outperformance in the decade ahead.

It also doesn't hurt to find yourself in rapidly evolving sectors that continually spawn new ways to drive revenue growth. Think: technology or finance or health care.

That said, boring can be beautiful too.

The bottom line is that big companies with great brands, strong balance sheets and some balance of outsize earnings or dividends will stand the test of time every time. The following 11 stocks have what it takes to be great bets for the next decade and beyond.

Given its strong position in the e-commerce market, SHOP stock should continue to perform well. However, in light of the elevated valuation of Shopify stock,  prospective buyers of the shares should stay on the sidelines for now.

### Shopify Has Only Begun to Tap Its Potential

Shopify still has a great deal of room to grow, since many small businesses that haven't yet become the  customers of SHOP or its open-source peers want to conduct e-commerce outside the established online marketplaces.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



SHOP currently serves over 600,000 businesses that sell more than $55 billion of merchandise. In 2015, just 165,000 firms sold their products on Shopify.

The company estimates about 47 million merchants operate small or medium-sized businesses, so SHOP's growth can continue for some time.

### E-Commerce Is Growing Nearly as Quickly as the Cloud

Shopify does face direct competition. In theory, any developer can build a platform like Shopify's, and they have done so. Sites such as WooCommerce, Magento {which is now owned by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)}, and others also operate in that space. Naturally, investors wonder whether SHOP can stave off the competition.

To address that issue, we should consider the similarities between the cloud-computing and e-commerce sectors. Both industries are growing rapidly. Also, most companies in both spaces have benefited from that growth despite the fact that anyone with computer expertise could enter the sectors. And just as a handful of companies dominate the cloud, only a small number of firms hold the upper hand in the e-commerce-platform space. Shopify is poised to become one of the latter firms.

Along with its first-mover status, Shopify also offers more simplicity and scalability than most of its peers. That's important because the majority of small businesses are one-man shops. Most of the owners of those businesses cannot afford to spend time on website issues. As a result, most of them will turn to the sector leader and pay Shopify's somewhat higher costs so they can fully outsource the website-related work.

So far, investors don't seem to be too concerned about the strength of the company's moat, as Shopify stock has had an impressive run since it and many of its tech peers hit a near-term low on Christmas Eve. In the last month and a half, SHOP stock has risen by about 45%. Earlier today, SHOP stock price set a new all-time high of $176.85.

### Do Not Buy Shopify Stock Yet

After the rally of Shopify stock, investors should be cautious about the name. Over the summer, Shopify stock crossed the $170 per share level twice only to pull back both times. With the stock again at that level, investors need assurance that it's not near a price ceiling before buying SHOP stock.

Also, SHOP investors need to be cautious about its price-earnings ratio. As of this morning  SHOP stock traded at about 250 times analysts' consensus forward earning estimate for the company. Its other multiples are high as well; Shopify stock trades at over 20 times its sales and more than 11 times its book value.

On some levels, the elevated multiples of SHOP stock are justified. Shopify will likely greatly exceed its current market cap of around $19.4 billion. Moreover, analysts' consensus estimate calls for its top line to grow by an average of almost 81.9% per year over the next five years, and on average they expect its revenue to surge 125.8% this year. In light of those expected growth rates, the price -earnings ratio of SHOP stock should be well above the S&P 500's average PE ratio.

Still, even Shopify stock is only worth so much. With a forward PE of around 244 and the stock trading near its all-time highs, prospective buyers of SHOP might want to hold off for now.

### The Bottom Line on Shopify Stock

Shopify stock has an undeniable value proposition. SHOP has enjoyed a massive move higher in recent weeks as tech stocks recover from a slump that began in October. As a result, its valuation has reached excessive levels. Even though other firms competing for its customers, Shopify holds the first-mover advantage when it comes to providing an independent platform for merchant sales. Put simply, Shopify has become the AWS or the Azure of e-commerce.

Moreover, the company has only begun to scratch the surface of its full potential.

However, investors need to stay cautious about the valuation of SHOP stock, and they should realize that it may have reached a price ceiling. With the metrics of Shopify stock screaming &quot;overvalued&quot; on many fronts, investors should think twice before buying the shares.

Thanks to Shopify, small merchants can benefit without having to pay Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Investors who wait for a pullback of Shopify stock before buying the shares will probably benefit as well

Economic data over the last two weeks has improved consumer and business demand expectations, which should continue to lift technology stocks higher.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

We like ADBE because of how the company has leveraged its subscription model to shift further towards services revenue and increased profit margins. And ADBE recently acquired a company that will help expand the services offered in its Creative Cloud.

### Allegorithmic

ADBE acquired Allegorithmic two weeks ago. The French company develops the Substance tools, which are used to by animators, designers and AAA game creators.

ADBE had already invested in Allegorithmic, but this acquisition means ADBE will be able to further integrate the widely used tools into its already popular software suite.

Because we like ADBE's cloud based business model, any expansion of the services it offers is positive. The acquisition didn't boost the stock right away, but we think it improves ADBE's fundamental outlook.

The recent tech rally, which took ADBE above resistance, got us excited about selling puts.

### Breaking Above $254

This is a good time to enter a trade on ADBE because the stock broke the neckline of a bullish inverted &quot;head and shoulders&quot; pattern (with a &quot;double bottom&quot; for the &quot;head&quot;) near $250 per share.

Daily Chart of Adobe, Inc. (ADBE) -- Chart Source: TradingView

ADBE broke above resistance at $254 on Monday, and it could stay at or around that level in the run up to its earnings announcement. It will announce after the market closes on March 14th, 2019.

Option premiums are still inflated following all the volatility last month. This puts the risk/reward ratio of this trade further in our favor because there is more option premium to erode between now and the middle of March.

Last year CRM stock rose to new highs but then fell 25% into the Christmas market-wide correction. Since then it has had a V-shaped rebound. Now it is again close to setting a new all-time high.

  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss 



So is it too late to buy it? No.

Before 2018, traders complained of the lack of volatility. As they say, be careful what you wish for because 2018 brought fear in droves. Investors had to contend with waves of bad headlines from tariff wars to a combative U.S. Federal reserve.

This year we've had a reprieve from those inflammatory headlines as politicians are now more likely to resolve the issues that plagued us last year. So now companies are free to flourish in these favorable macroeconomic conditions. Yes, in spite of all the fear mongers, things are conducive for growth.

CRM is still cranking on all cylinders. It generates $3 billion in operating cash flow. The results from the last earnings report said so. But don't take my word for it, this is consensus on Wall Street. The stock is up nearly 50% in the past year.

Furthermore, almost all of the analysts that cover it rate Saleforce.com stock as a buy. Yet, it still trades well below their average price targets, so there is more room to go. Roughly 10% more upside, to be exact.

All this good news comes at a cost. Critics question CRM's valuation and rightfully so. A three-digit price-earnings (P/E) ratio is extravagant … except that it's not in this case. When I analyze a hyper-growth stock like CRM or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I don't judge it by its profitability …

For as long as it continues to grow as fast as this, it's doing its job. Growth companies are supposed to overspend in order to grow. Only when they make the turn to a mature stable corporation than will I judge its P/E levels. CRM stock is not there yet.

### Bottom Line on CRM Stock

So then the decision to buy it or not comes down to timing. CRM is a momentum stock and those are tough to trade because &quot;momo&quot; stocks don't give us a clear spot to buy. They move so fast they seem perpetually ready to flip, thereby scaring most investors out of investing.

This has been the case for a lot of investors who have missed out on the upside while they wait for a perfect time to buy it. Sometimes the advice to buy low and sell high just isn't the right thing to do. Here you have to buy high and sell higher.

Being long these shares, I know there will be bad times. But a bet on Salesforce stock is a bet on the broader markets … if the equity markets are higher years from now, then CRM stock will be higher as well.

As a general rule, it is better to take small bites and not swallow the whole meal at once. This is especially true when we have politicians bickering over tariffs and budgets. So while the fundamental are hostage to headlines for the next few months, I take my positions in tranches. So if the trouble hits the fan then I can add to the position at lower prices.

2019-02-11,"The rebound in cloud stocks has been fast and fierce, which didn't really give investors a chance to load up on their favorites. Or should we say, when the opportunity presented itself, such as with Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), not enough investors took their chance. So are investors out of luck with ADBE stock?I wouldn't say investors are out of luck, but they've likely missed their best buying chance of the recent correction. The one thing we can all hope for is a retrace of some or almost all of this rally from the Christmas Eve lows. The market does one thing really well, and that's cause as much chaos as possible at certain times. 1 ADBE Stock's Recent Price ActionOur first reason for buying Adobe stock comes from the charts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMarkets barreled lower into Christmas, capitulating on the eve of the holiday. However, investors couldn't decipher if the next week of trading was simply a dead-cat bounce happening amid low volume during the typical Santa Claus rallying period. A few days into January and stocks were still climbing, causing many to wait on the sidelines for the inevitable pullback. Here are we in the beginning of February and many are still waiting.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months Adobe stock is one that investors wish they bought when they had the chance. Just don't make the same mistake twice if the opportunity presents itself.ADBE stock price is still $20 below its highs. While Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and others have been on fire, so has Adobe. ADBE is now $50 up from its lows. Investors could justify buying ADBE stock another $10 lower, near the conflux of its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. I would love a &quot;real&quot; correction back down to $235 or so though before really getting long this name. 2 ADBE Stock FundamentalsAdobe stock is great thanks to one thing: subscriptions. Virtually every freelancer and every business in online marketing utilizes Adobe to some capacity. Whether it's to tidy up in Photoshop or make elaborate designs, ADBE carries the load. That's why it has such a good pulse on the e-commerce market as well. Customers have a few options when it comes to subscribing to Adobe, but for simplicity, let's look at the main one. A subscriber can gain access to just about all of Adobe's products by either paying month-to-month at a higher rate or paying at a lower monthly rate but signing up for a 12-month agreement.Once the refund period has passed, Adobe will be able to collect revenue from its users month after month after month. This leads to a more stable business with more predictable cash flows and it's exactly why its stock gets a premium in the market.Because of this subscription base and its leverage of the cloud, Adobe stock has exploded in recent years, as has its business. Revenue has doubled over the last five years while free cash flow (FCF) and cash flow from operations continue to coast from the lower left to the upper right. Over the last 12 months, Adobe has generated more than $4 billion in FCF. While Adobe does carry $4.1 billion in long-term debt, its total assets are double its total liabilities. 3 Adobe Stock in 2019Before Adobe reported Q4 earnings in December, it issued its 2019 outlook in mid-October. Management reiterated that it was on track to hit its fourth-quarter numbers and it's looking for 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2019. When it reported earnings in mid-December -- a top- and bottom-line beat -- Adobe updated its 2019 outlook to include its recent acquisitions.Despite all this, Wall Street didn't care, tossing the cloud juggernaut aside with the rest of the market into the Christmas Eve doldrums. Coal for everyone, they said, no matter how well the company is doing.After a quick retest of the lows, investors who stayed the course are the ones laughing now. Estimates call for full-year revenue of 28% and for earnings to swell 41.5% to $7.78 per share. Adobe isn't just growing, it's accelerating and that's why it's going to make investors even more money this year.  * 7 Banks Stocks to Buy After the BB&T-Suntrust Mega-Merger Timing an entry has been important, but it can (and should) be done in ADBE stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-02-13,"After tech stocks ended 2018 on a treacherous note, the new year has brought renewed prosperity to the sector. Software stocks in particular are rallying.Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is no exception. From its recent low of $205 per share, the Adobe stock price is back up to $258. That puts ADBE stock within striking range of its all-time high price of $277.Across the sector, investors are chasing stocks to fresh new heights. On Monday, a variety of cloud and software plays hit 52-week or all-time highs.  Among the names in that category were Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Coupa Software(NASDAQ:COUP), Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR), Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and VMware (NYSE:VMW), among others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again So Adobe stock should be going up, since the sector is on fire. Adobe's recent strong performance has little connection to its own particular fundamentals. And given the hotness of the tech sector, savvy traders should consider selling tech stocks and taking profits at this point. For Adobe, 2018 Was a Great YearAdobe has delivered impressive growth in recent years, and that trend continued in 2018. Rather remarkably, the revenue increases of both major Adobe business units were almost equal. The company's Digital Media unit, which accounts for roughly a third of its revenue, generated top-line growth of 27%. The sales of Adobe's  core Digital Media business, which accounts for around 70% of Adobe's revenues, increased by 26%. With the revenue of both major divisions increasing more than 25% annually, the company is clearly doing well.You may have seen some griping about Adobe's last earnings report of 2018. The company's earnings per share did come in below analysts' consensus estimate, but its revenue came in above the consensus outlook. The earnings shortfall was due to costs related to Adobe's  acquisition of Marketo. In the long-run, a near-term earnings miss due to M&A won't affect the company's outlook meaningfully.What is important is that Adobe is no longer just the world's best image-software company; it now offers a broader business solutions package. Adobe purchased both Marketo and Magento recently. Marketo does B2B marketing while Magento offers digital-marketing solutions. By offering its customers a rich suite of software solutions, Adobe has gained many synergies.Adobe's  revenue jumped nearly 25% last year. Probably not coincidentally, Adobe stock rallied 29% in 2018. Investors tend to price a company like Adobe based on its sales, so it makes sense that ADBE stock rose during a year in which its revenue surged. However, the situation could change in 2019. Adobe Stock Is ExpensiveThose who are bearish on ADBE stock can point out an obvious, if true, statement: Adobe stock is really pricey. On a trailing basis, Adobe stock has a price-earnings ratio of 50. Now, to be fair, ADBE had some one-tine costs in 2018. But the company's forward P/E ratio stands at 27. That's still quite pricey, especially since analysts have already baked healthy growth into their 2019 projections.On a price-sales basis, ADBE stock looks even more expensive. It is currently going for more than 14 times its sales. The normal rule of thumb for fast-growing tech stocks is that they are valued fairly if they're trading at ten times their sales.Consider that even if Adobe's  revenue jumps 24% again in 2019, it will still be selling for a touch over ten times its sales. Various peers of Adobe are selling for between eight and ten times their sales at the moment, suggesting that Adobe stock price could drop considerably if the valuation of ADBE stock drops to levels that are more in-line with the rest of the tech sector. How Much Can the Experience Cloud Grow?The big question for ADBE stock, at least for long-term investors, is how far its so-called experience cloud can run. After integrating Marketo, Magento, Tubemogul, and other acquisitions, Adobe is now seen as a leader in the still-emerging marketing-cloud space. As is often the case in tech, Adobe's first- mover advantage in that area appears to be huge.Bulls are buying up Adobe stock because of their belief that the company will become the entrenched leader in the space. Even so, it's worth asking just how much that achievement would be worth. Consider that the shares of the current leader of the marketing-software space, Salesfore.com (NYSE:CRM), are selling for just 9.5 times its sales.Adobe stock would have to drop around 30% to reach Salesforce's valuation. And Salesforce isn't exactly considered a value stock ,either. Salesforce has posted average annual revenue growth of 28% over the past five years, and analysts don't expect that to change much. Does Adobe stock deserve such a large premium over Salesforce's shares? The Verdict on Adobe StockGiven the great enthusiasm we are seeing for tech and software stocks, it seems tempting to hold Adobe stock into its earnings which are slated to be announced next month. However, I'd urge investors to be cautious about ADBE stock. Much of the recent gains of Adobe stock price have been triggered by the rallies of other cloud names.But Adobe still has to prove its own merits. Analysts will be looking at the company's M&A costs closely. And with 25% revenue growth already baked into investors' expectations, Adobe stock may not have all that much room to advance further even if its numbers are relatively strong.With tech stocks on fire, it seems like a good time to take some chips off the table, whether we're talking about ADBE stock or other names in the sector that are making fresh, new all-time highs.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-26,"One of the stock market's brightest stars over the past several years has been creative solutions giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). From late 2013 to late 2018, Adobe stock rose by more than seven-fold from under $40 to nearly $280. Perhaps more impressive, it did so with relatively muted volatility. During that stretch wherein shares rose 600%, Adobe fell into bear market territory only once.Source: Shutterstock But, Adobe stock has fallen flat lately. Specifically, the late 2018 market-wide selloff hit Adobe stock hard, as it did all high-flying stocks. ADBE dropped 25% off recent highs -- it's biggest correction since 2012.To be sure, shares have rebounded from that selloff. But, Adobe stock's 200-day moving average is flattening out for the first time in five years. Some investors are concerned that this flattening is a sign that the best is over for Adobe.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market That thesis is flawed. The best is not over for Adobe stock. The reality is that Adobe is an innovative company attacking some very big secular growth markets. Adobe has huge advantages in those markets, and as such, projects to be a much larger company in the future than it is today. So long as Adobe remains on that secular growth track, ADBE will head higher, despite its ostensibly large valuation.As such, recent weakness in the stock is nothing more than noise. This stock remains a long-term winner, powered by robust secular growth tailwinds. Cloud Market LeadershipWhen it comes to Adobe, the narrative is focused on three business: Document Cloud, Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud. All three businesses are high-margin, high-growth businesses immersed in significantly larger addressable markets supported by secular growth trends. Adobe also has a big advantages in each of those markets. As such, all three businesses project to one day be much larger than they are today.Document Cloud provides market-leading solutions that are used to create, edit, and amplify next-generation digital documents. The total addressable market is estimated at $7.5 billion, according to Adobe management.Secular trends imply that this market will only get bigger with time, as the world, particularly enterprises, becomes more digitally dependent than ever before. Competition is also muted, as Adobe essentially owns the PDF world. Thus, Document Cloud projects as a big growth business for a lot longer.In the Creative Cloud business, Adobe leverages its expertise in photo editing and video editing to create highly visually appealing cloud solutions for businesses and entrepreneurs. The addressable market of this business is even bigger, estimated at around $30 billion.Secular trends, including a shift toward visual-oriented consumption, imply that this market will only get bigger with time. Competition is mitigated by the fact that Adobe is the only relevant name in photo and video editing. Thus, Creative Cloud projects as a big growth business for a lot longer.Last, but certainly not least, is the Experience Cloud business. This business is centered around an enterprise cloud solution that's focused on enhancing the whole customer experience, from marketing to analytics to commerce to advertising.The addressable market, estimated at over $70 billion, is massive. The secular consumer shift toward an experience-oriented economy defined by consumers valuing experiences over products will help this market get even bigger over time.Competition in the space is fierce, but Adobe has a big advantage when it comes to delivering the visual aspect of an experience-driven cloud solution. Thus, Experience Cloud projects as a big growth business for a lot longer.Altogether, Adobe is defined by three big growth cloud businesses that project to be big growers for a lot longer. So long as these businesses remain big growers, Adobe stock will remain a winner. Bottom Line on Adobe StockAdobe was a big winner over the past several years. That success likely isn't repeatable, mostly because of valuation. Back in 2013, ADBE had a price-to-sales multiple of around five. Today, that multiple stands closer to 15. Thus, valuation will limit another seven-fold increase in Adobe over the next several years.But, that doesn't mean the rally in Adobe is over. Quite the opposite. This rally will persist for a lot longer, despite the big valuation, because Adobe's huge growth drivers imply that Adobe stock has enough firepower left to more than grow into it's valuation over time.In the big picture, Adobe is a really strong company aligned with some of the world's most powerful secular growth trends, and the company has critical advantages which will allow to it capitalize on those trends better than peers. That is the sort of a company you want to be invested in for the long run.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.

2019-02-27,"All is back to normal for Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). CRM stock had been one of large-cap tech's best performers through the summer, rising over 250% in a little over five years. Salesforce stock then took a tumble, at one point losing 30% of its value.Source: Shutterstock But CRM has recovered, touching a new all-time high earlier this month. Heading into Q4 earnings on the afternoon of March 4, the long-term upward trend appears re-established. And as a blowout fiscal Q3 report in November showed, the volatility in Salesforce stock had little to do with the steady and impressive performance of the underlying business.The rebound in the stock, then, makes some sense. But it puts CRM stock back into a familiar position. I wrote back in July that the story of CRM stock - great business, questionable valuation - echoed those of so many other tech high-flyers. That's again true, and it sets up an intriguing report on Monday for not just Salesforce stock, but the entire tech space.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019  Salesforce EarningsFor two reasons, it seems exceedingly likely that Salesforce will beat expectations on Monday. First, history strongly suggests such an outcome: Salesforce hasn't missed consensus on either revenue or earnings in at least five years. In each of the last eleven quarters, Salesforce earnings and revenue have come in ahead of the Street.Second, expectations don't look particularly high. Consensus essentially matches the company's guidance given after Q3. Salesforce traditionally outperforms its guidance, another reason to expect a beat. And the 24.9% revenue growth forecast by analysts is actually toward the bottom range of recent performance, while the Mulesoft acquisition should provide some help as well.All told, a miss likely would lead CRM stock to fall, if not plunge but that outcome seems unlikely. That said, investors will be watching fiscal 2020 guidance as well. Salesforce gave revenue guidance after Q3, projecting 20-21% growth.With Salesforce stock at all-time highs, investors likely are hoping, if not expecting, that figure will be raised. The Street already is at the high end of the range. Earnings guidance should be delivered with the Q4 report. Current consensus on that front suggests just over 5% growth - a seemingly conservative figure.So there's a clear path here for Salesforce to deliver another beat-and-raise quarter, the type of report that sent Salesforce stock soaring after the Q3 release. Expectations are reasonable. Competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has shown little sign of slowing Salesforce.com down. Of course, there's one major difference: CRM stock is at the highs, not near the lows. The Risks to CRM StockThe question is if even another strong quarter and boosted guidance is priced in. Of course, that's the same question that has dogged CRM stock for years now, and yet last year's quick decline aside, the stock has kept moving higher.There are some reasons for concern. Initial FY20 guidance does suggest a long-awaited deceleration in growth. CRM stock trades at over 50x FY20 EPS. Even backing out cash, and even ignoring heavy share-based compensation, that accounts for about half of those adjusted profits.Analysts are heavily behind the stock, but CRM stock once again is nearing even bullish outlooks. The average Street price target of $174 suggests just 7% gains.Meanwhile, CRM is back at 2018 highs and many software peers have done even better. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) has gained more than 50% from November lows and trades at an all-time high. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has done roughly the same. For enterprise software plays, investors are even more bullish than they were in September.That sentiment seems potentially worrisome and it again raises the question of just how much upside possibly can be left. Salesforce stock has quadrupled in less than six years. Backing out share-based compensation, it trades at something like 100x next year's earnings. We saw just five months ago what happens to a stock like that when that bullish sentiment reverses. The Bottom Line on Salesforce StockWith share prices back at the highs, old concerns have resurfaced for CRM and for its peers. And so the reaction to Salesforce earnings next week should be watched by all investors. Is a beat-and-raise quarter greeted with enthusiasm or a shrug?As I wrote back in July, at some point valuation has to matter. And it did - for a couple of months. Those concerns again are being brushed off. Monday's report should show whether that will continue to be the case.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-15,"Friday was another strong day, with stocks melting higher. It sets up an interesting dynamic with a Federal Reserve statement coming out next Wednesday. As it stands though, the S&P 500 continues to trade well and push through a notable level near 2,800. Let's look at our top stock trades to watch for Monday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Adobe SystemsShares of Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell after reporting earnings on Thursday after the close. While full-year guidance was okay, management's outlook for next quarter came up a little short. In a way, that reminds me of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which had a similar report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash So what now?Like CRM, bulls may feel comfortable enough to gobble up Adobe on this result. However, below $250 and concerns will start to elevate. Not only are both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages near this mark, but the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the December lows to the October highs is here too.If ADBE closes below $250, it will be in no man's land. In that sense, longs might find the stock to have an attractive risk/reward. If Adobe can get back over the 20-day average, look for it to fill the gap up through $265. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: AppleSpeaking of gaps, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filled its gap from back in November today. That came after the stock powerfully stormed through the $185 level and is now threatening to run to the 200-day moving average.The gap fill was our target in Apple earlier this week, while a move to the 200-day is our second target. That's a good reason to trail up stops and consider locking in some profits. Apple stock is overbought according to the RSI and no one's ever gone broke by locking in a gain. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Aurora CannabisAfter a monster move on Wednesday, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) had an inside day on Thursday, setting up for the possibility of a rally on Friday. That's what we flagged on Friday morning before the move.There was plenty of time to get in this one below $9 and those that haven't may want to take a pass at this point. $10 is not an unrealistic target at this point, although that's only 41 cents short of current prices.Longs should trail up stops and keep other cannabis stocks in mind. For instance, while Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) is putting together a super tight coiling pattern, investors of both CGC and ACB need to remember that Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) will report earnings on Monday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Ulta BeautyUlta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) is putting together a strong post-earnings rally on Friday, up 9% after beating on top and bottom lines. The rally is stunning, particularly given the modest rally we were seeing this morning.In any regard, I will be watching this on Monday, where investors should look for a flat or weak open. If that's the case and Ulta quickly goes green, it may want more upside and we can have a limited-risk setup by using the morning's low (assuming it's within reason). If so, perhaps we can some follow through like we did with Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: TeslaInvestors aren't buying the Model Y hype from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Friday's decline means Tesla stock remains trapped in a nasty downtrend that isn't over yet.The 20-day moving average stopped Tesla dead in its tracks on Thursday, although the Model Y unveil is certainly the issue on Friday, not the moving average. If the stock takes out this month's lows, look for a test of channel support, likely near $265.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs If Tesla continues to fall, it may have a date with $250.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-18,"Recently, I've become increasingly convinced that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is an important barometer for the tech sector as a whole. CRM stock price isn't the only gauge investors need to watch, But Salesforce stock still seems to provide a pure look at investors' preferences.Source: Shutterstock The key reason why is that Salesforce.com 's story is reasonably simple. It has a fantastic business. No one can dispute that. As CEO Marc Benioff pointed out on its Q4 conference call earlier this month, the company was the fastest enterprise software company ever to reach $13 billion in sales. (The company celebrated its 20th anniversary on Mar. 8) Its revenue growth has been almost bizarrely consistent for years now, hovering generally in the 24%-26% range.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade And there really aren't any external factors that can materially change its outlook. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are trying to compete in customer relationship management, or CRM, software, but the dominance of Salesforce.com appears assured. A downturn in the macro cycle likely would impact Salesforce stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut given multi-year contracts and the importance of CRM software to businesses, the impact likely would be manageable. (Note that CRM's revenue more than tripled between 2007 and 2011.)Of course, CRM stock price also isn't cheap  or close to it. And so Salesforce stock provides an intriguing answer to an interesting question: what, exactly, are investors willing to pay for growth?Coming off the company's fourth-quarter report, it appears investors aren't sure about the answer to that question. Once they figure it out, the rest of the market may as well. Earnings &quot;Surprise&quot; for Salesforce Stock (Yeah, Right)Salesforce's earnings came in nicely ahead of Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. That surprised exactly no one remotely familiar with Salesforce stock; as I wrote before the report, Salesforce.com hasn't missed on either revenue or earnings in at least five-plus years.Yet it wasn't good enough. The company's guidance looks a bit disappointing, as Nicholas Chahine detailed after the report. The CRM stock price fell 3.7% on the day of the report  and dipped almost 1% on the following day. Salesforce stock wound up falling 6% for the week, but it has since regained the majority of its losses.Bu the initial selloff seemed to confirm the risk facing CRM stock and the market. Bear in mind that the CRM stock price over time has been an exaggerated reflection of the market as a whole. It gained steadily in the first years of the decade, as the market recovered, and its gains accelerated in 2016 and 2017, as the stock market gained steam.Salesforce stock peaked in early October 2018  and then plunged as the Q4 selloff hit. CRM stock lost over 25% of its value in less than three months and took three and a half months to gain it all back, and then some.The profit-taking after the strong Q4 report seemed to suggest that investors were paying more attention to risk, but subsequently, as noted above,  CRM stock regained most of the losses it had suffered this month. How High Can the CRM Stock Price Go?The issue at this point is that Salesforce stock is expensive, really expensive. It still trades at about 60 times the company's 2020 earnings guidance. At some point, investors will start worrying about the valuation of even a great business, which Salesforce.com unquestionably is.From here, it still looks like valuation fears drove the initial post-earnings reaction. Disappointing guidance is a good talking point, but again, Salesforce.com never misses analyst estimates. It's reasonably obvious at this point that the company guides conservatively. Meanwhile, Q1 and 2019 projections aside, the company also predicted that its revenue would double again by fiscal 2023.There was nothing wrong with the company's Q4 results. The issue is its valuation. But there's another aspect of Salesforce stock that could demonstrate investors' appetite for risk.  Salesforce.com predicts that its non-GAAP EPS will come in at $2.74-$2.76, but that includes stock-based compensation of  $1.84 .That's two-thirds of its  projected net income. Back that out, and CRM stock is trading at over 172 times the high end of this year's earnings guidance. Some investors have questioned whether Salesforce stock should have such a high valuation. If more investors agree, CRM stock likely would be the first stock to take a big hit. Watch CRM Going ForwardBetween the stock's valuation and the company's share-based comp, CRM obviously is a growth stock. And the relatively simple nature of its outlook means there's one key argument regarding Salesforce stock: what to pay for the business. Bulls will argue that paying up for Salesforce stock has been a great bet for nearly 15 years. Bears will reply that, at some point, the rally has to end.That argument is a stalemate right now. It's worth paying close attention to who wins in the near-term. Where CRM stock goes, other growth stocks - like Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) - are likely to follow.If Salesforce stock is too expensive, so is pretty much every other stock in the market; few, if any, of them have as an outlook that's as good as CRM. If investors are willing to pay up for CRM stock now, however, they'll likely be willing to stretch for other growth plays. The pre- and post-earnings movements of  CRM stock price show the market isn't quite sure which side to take. At some point soon, that will change.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-19,"Make no mistake about it. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is finally back. The E. coli outbreak which hit the chain hard in 2015 is now in the rear-view mirror. The company is using new marketing, menu innovations and an expanded digital presence to drive a long overdue recovery in traffic, sales and margins. In response, CMG stock has rallied from $250 in February 2018, to $660 a little over a year later.Source: Shutterstock Some bulls think this monster rally will continue. Piper Jaffray recently lifted its price target on CMG stock to $725, citing international expansion potential as a reason to buy Chipotle stock. But fundamentals say that this big Chipotle stock rally is on its last legs. To be sure, the fundamentals at Chipotle are improving. Unique marketing campaigns, healthy food menu innovations, and digital business expansions are driving robust and sustainable comparable sales and traffic growth. That's pushing margins higher. Plus, the company still has a ton of runway left on the unit expansion front (only 2,500 stores).But all of those positives are already priced into CMG stock. This is a $650 stock with a fiscal 2019 earnings estimate of $12.30 per share. That means Chipotle stock is trading at over 50x forward earnings. The average forward multiple in the restaurant sector is under 25. Thus, CMG stock is trading at more than double the valuation of its peers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven for a company with as big of growth potential as Chipotle, that relative valuation gap is just too large. It will eventually narrow, and in a big way, meaning that Chipotle stock is due for a sizable correction in the near future. The Fundamentals Are ImprovingThe Chipotle turnaround is very real and very impressive.Long story short, Chipotle brought in new CEO Brian Niccol about a year ago, and he's done nothing short of a spectacular job turning around what was a sinking ship. Before Niccol, Chipotle was a company struggling with its brand image, which had no real growth drivers in the aftermath of a crippling late 2015 E. coli outbreak.Since Niccol took over, all that has changed. Chipotle has re-branded itself as a healthy QSR chain with real ingredients through its new 'For Real' marketing campaign. To coincide with that marketing campaign, Chipotle has also expanded its menu to include things like lifestyle bowls, which cater to the ingredient-sensitive consumer. Meanwhile, Chipotle has also significantly expanded its presence on digital food-ordering apps.These three initiatives have worked wonders for Chipotle. Traffic growth has turned healthily positive for the first time since late 2015. Comparable sales growth is running around 10%-plus. Digital sales growth was above 65% last quarter. Restaurant level operating margins are moving consistently higher.In other words, the Chipotle turnaround is here. It won't end any time soon. As such, the fundamentals underlying CMG stock project to remain favorable for a lot longer. The Valuation Makes No SenseAt current levels, favorable long-term growth fundamentals won't cut it for CMG stock. It's already priced for favorable long-term growth, and then some.This is a restaurant stock trading at over 50x forward earnings. The whole market trades at 16x forward earnings. Restaurant stocks trade at 23x forward earnings. High growth application software stocks trade at 35 forward earnings. Indeed, on a forward earnings basis, CMG stock is more expensive than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), all 20%-plus revenue-growth tech companies with sky high margins and big moats. It's also nearly as expensive as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), two huge revenue-growth companies with tremendous margin expansion potential.That doesn't make much sense to me. Again, CMG is a restaurant stock. With a sub-10% revenue growth rate. In a competitive fast casual restaurant industry. And margins that, while heading higher, don't have that much more room to expand.Here's my math on Chipotle stock. Mid-single-digit comparable sales growth will likely slow going forward as the lap gets tougher. But comps will remain in the low single-digit range thanks to menu innovations and digital business expansion. Sustained mid-single-digit unit growth should drive high-single-digit revenue growth. Restaurant level margins should continue to rise, but flatten out short of their mid-2010's highs due to higher labor costs. G&A and D&A expense rates should fall with scale.Putting all together, I optimistically see Chipotle as a 20% earnings grower over the next several years, with potential to hit $35 in EPS by fiscal 2025. Based on a slightly above restaurant-average 25x forward multiple, that equates to a fiscal 2024 price target for CMG stock of $875. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to fiscal 2019 price target below $550.Chipotle stock trades above $650 today. As such, this stock is simply overvalued at the present moment.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them  Bottom Line on CMG StockThe Chipotle turnaround is here, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. But CMG stock has already had its big run-up in anticipation of this recovery. At current levels, the stock is overvalued. As such, the next time this company fumbles, the stock could drop in a big way, and in the restaurant industry, fumbles happen all the time.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long  FB, GOOG, TWTR, ADBE, AMZN, and CRM.

2019-03-19,"An object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by an unbalanced forced. Sir Isaac Newton posited that in the 1600's as the first law of motion, and it has since become a fundamental building block of physics.As it happens, Newton's first law of motion also has applications to the stock market. Traders just don't call it the first law of motion. They call it momentum. But, the idea is broadly similar. Stocks that are on an uptrend/downtrend, will stay on an uptrend/downtrend, until some external catalyst reverses the direction of the stock.As such, when looking for stock market winners, it is appropriate to look at the basket of stocks which are already winners. That is, look for stocks that are already on an uptrend, and have a track record of beating the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen doing so, there are two important things to remember to mitigate risk: longer is better, and bigger is better. The longer the stock's track record of market out-performance, the safer it is to assume the stock will keep outperforming for the foreseeable future. Also, the bigger the stock's market cap, the safer the stock is given its presumably already dominant positioning.With that in mind, I've come up with a list of seven &quot;invincible stocks&quot; that are leading this bull market higher. These are stocks that have consistently generated huge alpha over the past decade, and which have become titans in their industry today. As such, these stocks are proven winners that project as winners for the foreseeable future, too.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Which stocks belong to this list? Let's take a look. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Shutterstock Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 2,360% (over 2,000%)Market Cap: $830 billionPerhaps the godfather of invincible stocks is e-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). There was a point in time where no one really knew if the Amazon e-commerce business model was going to work. That point in time was long ago. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly proven the effectiveness of its e-commerce business model, while adding multiple other verticals, leading to Amazon stock generating over 2,000 points of alpha during that stretch.This stock is only going higher. The theme of Amazon over the past decade has been robust revenue growth and rapid market share expansion. Over the next decade, the theme will be robust profit growth and margin expansion, thanks to growth in higher-margin businesses like digital ads and cloud. Both of those themes are really positive. One has already done its work and generated huge alpha. The next is about to.Long story short, Amazon stock is one to buy and hold for the long run. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 6,280% (over 6,000%)Market Cap: $150 billionRight next to Amazon in the Mount Rushmore for invincible stocks is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Just like many people doubted the e-commerce business model, many people likewise doubted the streaming business model. Those doubters were wrong. Streaming has become the biggest trend in video today, and Netflix has led the way. In doing so, Netflix has generated an amazing 6,000-plus points in alpha over the past decade.This trend of out-performance will continue. In the streaming wars, all that matters is content, since better content drives sub growth and price hikes, which leads to revenue growth, margin expansion, and profit growth. Netflix has already won the content game. It has more reach than any other streamer, so it has more data to produce better content and it can justify spending more money to produce better content, too. Considering no one else will likely get to Netflix's size any time soon, that means Netflix has a huge advantage in streaming that isn't going away any time soon.  * The 5 Best ETFs to Buy for a Complete Income Portfolio So long as the ultra-critical content advantage doesn't go away, Netflix stock will remain on an uptrend. Salesforce (CRM)Source: Shutterstock Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 1,860% (over 1,500%)Market Cap: $125 billionOne of the biggest themes in the business world over the past several years has been the migration of enterprise processes from on-premise to the cloud, and the company leading that secular transition has been Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Over the past decade, the cloud has gone from niche to mainstream, as enterprises have increasingly realized its cost and convenience benefits. When these enterprises turned to the cloud, the first company greeting them was Salesforce, and that's largely why CRM stock has generated over 1,500 points of alpha over the past decade.The stock will continue to be a big winner for the next several years. This is a high-growth, high-margin company that is both supported by secular trends and attacking some very large markets. The valuation underlying CRM stock is rich. But, that's always the case for big growth stocks, and those big growth stocks always grow into those rich valuations so long as the growth trajectory remains healthy. It will for CRM stock, mostly because the cloud and data revolutions are still in their early innings (only about 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud).All in all, because of its leadership position in a market that projects to be a big grower for a lot longer, CRM stock likewise projects to a big winner for a lot longer. Adobe (ADBE)Source: Shutterstock Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 1,330% (over 1,000%)Market Cap: $130 billionAnother cloud giant that has won big over the past several years is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Over the past decade, Adobe has gradually shifted its business model from one-off, on-prem sales to recurring, cloud subscriptions and in so doing, it has significantly improved revenue predictability and profitability. It has also expanded its business to include enterprise-level cloud solutions. This combination of tailwinds has led to ADBE stock generating over 1,000 points of alpha over the past ten years.Adobe stock will generate big alpha over the next ten years, too. At its core, this company is the visual cloud leader. That is, it dominates in delivering cloud solutions focused on storing, organizing, analyzing and creating visual-heavy experiences. The world is pivoting towards both producing and consuming these visual-heavy experiences in greater volume, perhaps most broadly evidenced by the rise of photo and video sharing apps like Instagram. As this pivot continues to play out, the visual cloud will only become more important to enterprises, and Adobe will only win over more customers.  * 7 Financial Stocks to Invest In Today As they do, the stock will keep heading higher in a long-term window. Nike (NKE)Source:  rodrigofranca via FlickrPast Decade Performance (Alpha): 680% (410%)Market Cap: $136 billionThe only non-tech stock on this list is athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE), and that's because Nike's sustained dominance in the athletic apparel market is largely unmatched in any other non-tech industry. It seems like that ever since the mid-1990's and Michael Jordan, Nike has been top dog in the athletic apparel market. Impressively, over the past ten years, that dominance has only grown, as the company has continued to attract the best athletes, create the best shoes, roll out the best marketing and do all three of those things far more quickly than peers. Consequently, Nike stock has generated an impressive 410 points of alpha over the past decade.There were signs that the Nike stock uptrend was going to end in 2017. That was just a head fake. Nike fell asleep at the wheel. Competition gained ground. The sleeping giant woke up. Nike doubled down on innovation, speed to market and marketing. They've since crushed the competition, and are now as dominant as they've ever been in the athletic apparel market. This example proves that Nike is king in this market and that the company will remain king so long as management keeps executing.They've been executing almost flawlessly for over twenty years now. There's no reason to believe that, after already squashing threats in 2017, this great execution won't continue. As such, Nike stock will remain a long-term winner. Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: Shutterstock Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 635% (365%)Market Cap: $830 billionWhat is the internet without search? Nothing. That's exactly why, as global internet penetration rates have more than doubled over the past ten years, global digital search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has turned into a global utility. Internet consumers don't just want Google. They need it. This need has been the fuel for GOOGL stock's 365 points of alpha over the past decade.Because the internet is still growing, Alphabet will continue to grow, too. The global internet penetration rate is still just over 55%, and that rate is growing by several points every year. Thus, within the next decade, we are likely to see 70%, 75% and even 80%-plus internet penetration rates. As the global digital economy grows from a 55% penetration rate to a 70%-plus penetration rate, the number of users on Alphabet's suite of platforms (most notably, Google and YouTube) will continue to rise. As will ad dollars and profits. There's also the cloud, AI and self-driving businesses, which in it of themselves are big-growth businesses oozing with long-term potential.  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Under $10 In other words, the Alphabet growth narrative is far from over. That means the uptrend in GOOG stock is also far from over. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Jon Fingas via Flickr (Modified)Past Decade Performance (Alpha): 1,530% (over 1,000%)Market Cap: $65 billionAnother major secular growth trend during the 2010's was automation, and one major company at the heart of this trend has been Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive Surgical creates robots called da Vinci that assist with medical surgeries and procedures. As the automation trend has made its way into the medical world, adoption of da Vinci robots has skyrocketed. This surging adoption has led to a 1,500%-plus rally in ISRG stock over the past decade.The exciting part of Intuitive Surgical is that this medical robot growth narrative is still in its early innings. There are over 400,000 operating rooms in the world. Only around 5,000 have a da Vinci operating system. That means there's lots of room for da Vinci to grow globally as the automation wave becomes more broadly adopted in the medical sector.The implication for ISRG stock? Sustained big growth over the next several years will keep ISRG stock on a winning path.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, NFLX, ADBE, NKE and GOOG.

2019-03-20,"Every once in a while we get a company that wows investors. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is one of them and Wall Street is in awe of it. The proof is that CRM stock's momentum represents risk appetite in the whole market. It rallies fast and yes, it falls fast, but almost never to any fault of its own.Source: Shutterstock On Mar. 5, when traders were selling out of CRM stock, I wrote about how wrong they were to do that. It has since recovered and is back to near all-time highs. And yesterday, CRM stock was leading the charge before the China headline hit the ticker tape to cause a market wide sell off and stall the run.The results show that for the long term, owning Salesforce stock is a winning proposition. Year-to-date, CRM is up 20% leading all indices. It is up 31% in 12 months and almost 200% in five years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo those wanting to invest in CRM for the long term should not worry about timing a perfect entry into CRM stock. It's a momentum stock, so it almost never leaves the door open for a clear entry point. The idea here is to buy high and sell higher much later.  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Under $10 Fundamentally, Salesforce stock is not cheap since it sells at a three-digit price-to-earnings ratio. It is more expensive than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been the poster child of expensive stocks. But when a company delivers hyper-growth as CRM and AMZN do, investors should award them a higher valuation. They are supposed to overspend, so they can continue to deliver outstanding growth. How to Approach CRM Stock NowInvestors incorrectly sold CRM stock on softer guidance this month. But I listened to its high profile leader Mr. Benioff, who emphatically said that they will continue to set records on Wall Street, and I believe him.For the short term, momentum stocks like CRM make for good trading vehicles because they move fast in both directions. The key to success here is finding the levels that matter. For that, I use the lower time frame charts.At the end of January, CRM broke out of the $153 neckline and since then, it continues to trade inside a defined range. The breakout neckline was successfully tested twice already so it is short-term support. Anytime Salesforce stock falls to it, I can buy it for a swing trade with tight stops at $5 and $9 below it.There is another mini support level at $159 per share. So if I am long already into a swing trade, I could use this as a stopping point depending on my trade intentions. I expect it to hold as natural support provided the geopolitical headlines or the Fed today don't ruin the run.  Click to EnlargeConversely, if the CRM bulls can breakout out of $166 per share they run into open space where there is virtually no resistance. The bears will have a hard time to stop the rally. The target of the breakout is really open to interpretation, so then I'd set trailing stops to lock in the profits and enjoy the ride. Those who know options can then sell calls against their stock to generate synthetic dividends.The bottom line, CRM is an incredible success story for the long term and it presents many short-term trading opportunities. Today, it will also likely represents a leading indicator to the market-wide risk appetite. If CRM is getting bid, then the major indices will also be in the hands of the bulls. Shorting CRM stock long term is the equivalent of shorting markets in general. For now, this will not be my approach to the stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-20,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock has dropped over 5% since the visual-cloud giant delivered a mixed first-quarter earnings report in mid-March. The company's first-quarter revenue and profit numbers topped expectations, as its top line surged an impressive 25% year-over-year.Source: Shutterstock But the company's second-quarter revenue and profit guidance came in slightly below expectations. And although it hiked its full-year 2019 profit guidance, it did not change its 2019 revenue guidance.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly In other words, ADBE didn't deliver the typical beat-and-raise report to which the owners of Adobe stock have become accustomed. Instead, it reported a beat, but not a clear-cut raise. The owners of ADBE stock weren't too happy, and Adobe stock dropped a few points.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the big picture, this post-earnings weakness of Adobe stock is nothing to be concerned about. The company's top-line growth, which came in at 20%-plus, remains healthy and continues to support the thesis that ADBE is growing quickly and gaining share in some exceptionally large markets. Meanwhile, its bottom-line growth was below 10%, which is lower than normal for ADBE.  But that was mostly the result of certain one-off margin headwinds which will pass by mid-year.Overall, then, the revenue and margin outlooks supporting ADBE stock remain robust. As long as that remains true, Adobe stock will continue to rise over the long-term. Right now, investors are worried about the valuation of ADBE stock. But those worries will pass once the company's margins start moving higher again. So investors should embrace the recent weakness of Adobe stock, instead of avoiding it. The Numbers Are Really GoodAdobe's numbers are still really good. Importantly, its revenue growth is actually accelerating, not decelerating, and its margins have the runway to rebound in a big way in the second half of the year.The company's revenue growth in Q1 was north of 25%. That is the biggest year-over-year revenue growth rate Adobe has reported since late 2017, or five quarters ago. Meanwhile, its Q2 revenues are expected to rise roughly 23%. But management's guidance is usually conservative. So ADBE's Q2 revenue growth will likely come in around 24%-25% when all is said and done, exceeding the company's growth rate through most of 2018.In other words, Adobe is a 20%-plus revenue growth company with a revenue growth rate that is not only stable above 20%, but actually rising slightly as the company expands. That's impressive. It shows just how dominant this company is in some  continuous-growth cloud markets and demonstrates that 20%-plus revenue growth can be counted on for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, its margins were subpar last quarter, but this pain is temporary and leaves the company well-positioned to increase its margins in the second half of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, its gross margins fell 1.4 percentage points year-over-year  and its operating margins dropped roughly four percentage points. That's not good.But all of the margin pressure was caused by deferred revenue and acquisition headwinds, which will phase out in the second half of 2019. As a result, its margins should improve dramatically through every quarter of 2019. By the second half of the year, its margins should be poised to expand year-over-year. If that occurs, as investors become more confident about its margins, they will buy Adobe stock, putting upward buying pressure on the shares.All in all, despite the stock's recent drop, the company's numbers remain good. As long as its revenue growth remains north of 20% and its margins improve from their depressed first-quarter base, ADBE stock should rebound from this selloff. The Long-Term Outlook of Adobe Stock Is PromisingIn the big picture, Adobe stock is a long-term winner.Adobe is a cloud company. More than that, Adobe is a dominant, big-growth cloud company that is attacking really big, non-cyclical growth markets. Those markets include cloud-based digital document management solutions. which is a $7.5 billion total addressable market, cloud-based photo and video-editing creative solutions, a $30 billion total addressable market, and experience-focused enterprise cloud solutions, which is a $70 billion addressable market.ADBE already dominates two of those markets. The company essentially owns the PDF and digital-documents world. That world will continue to grow over the next several years as everything goes digital. As it does, Adobe's Document Cloud will become more widely adopted.Adobe is also the only reputable player in the creative-solutions space. That space, too, will grow over the next several years as the world becomes more focused on graphics. And as the latter process continues, Adobe's Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud solutions will also become more widely used.Overall, Adobe is positioned to gain share over the next several years in markets that are cumulatively worth $100 billion-plus, and Adobe's revenues this year are expected to be just over $11 billion. Consequently, I think it's reasonable to expect Adobe's top line to rise 15%-20% for the foreseeable future, with gross margins that remain around 90%. Moreover, its spending rates should gradually fall as it grows.If my forecasts prove to be correct, I think Adobe's EPS can reach about $22.50 by fiscal 2025. Based on a forward multiple of 20, which is average for growth companies, that implies a fiscal 2024 price target for Adobe stock of $450. That represents roughly 80% upside in the long-run.If we discount that $450 price target back by 10% per year, we arrive at a fiscal 2019 price target for ADBE stock of $280. That's above where the stock trades today. As a result, ADBE looks well-positioned to rise in the near-term, too. The Bottom Line on ADBE StockThe recent weakness of Adobe stock is nothing to worry about. Adobe's numbers remain good, and its fundamentals remain strong, so the recent weakness of ADBE stock will pass. When that occurs, Adobe stock will resume its long-term climb. Ultimately, that long-term ascent will push ADBE stock towards $450.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.

2019-03-26,"Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, isn't a new concept. This idea that companies can take on-premise software solutions, host them through the cloud and offer them in a subscription package to customers has been around for a while.But, just because the SaaS concept has been around for a while, that doesn't mean it's too late to jump on the SaaS bandwagon. Truth be told, SaaS stocks in the right industry are winning stocks. They are high-growth companies because they align with the secular pivot to cloud solutions, and they're high-margin companies, too, because the costs associated with delivering a cloud-hosted software service at scale are small. Plus, SaaS stocks are also supported by steady and predictable subscription revenue streams.Broadly speaking, then, SaaS stocks are often big growers with big margins and lots of revenue predictability. That combination usually makes SaaS stocks big winners in the long run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis trend won't reverse course any time soon. Only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud, so the runway for cloud growth remains long and promising. Meanwhile, margins will likely only head higher as the industry scales, and revenue predictability won't waver.  * 10 Tech Stocks With Key Products That Face an Uncertain Future Overall, then, it's not too late to get bullish on SaaS stocks. With that in mind, let's take a look at seven SaaS stocks to buy for long-term gains. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrSoftware Service: E-commerce solutionsOne of my favorite SaaS stocks is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). In short, Shopify offers e-commerce solutions to retailers of all shapes and sizes so that any seller can sell any item to any buyer through any channel.These solutions have both tremendous value, and tremendous room for growth. On the value side, consumers are increasingly connected to content and products through various digital channels. Retailers need to connect with consumers through those various channels. Shopify gives them the tools to do so.On the growth side, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) owns about 50% of the U.S. e-commerce market. That's unsustainable. Over the next several years, the e-commerce market will democratize as retailers pivot more aggressively into digital. That pivot will include a bunch of those retailers adopting Shopify's solutions.Overall, Shopify is a winning SaaS stock. The stock has already increased ten-fold over the past three-plus years. But, with revenue growth running at 50%-plus and margins roaring higher, SHOP stock will only keep heading higher in the long run. Twilio (TWLO)Source:  Web Summit Via FlickrSoftware Service: Communication solutionsAnother one of my favorite SaaS stocks to buy for the long haul is Twilio (NASDAQ:TWLO). Twilio offers real-time communication solutions to businesses of all shapes and sizes so that they can connect with customers at any point in time through any communication channel.Much like Shopify, Twilio's communication solutions have both tremendous value and tremendous growth potential. On the value side, customers increasingly demand a unique and personalized customer experience. A big part of that is personalized and real-time communication. Twilio offers solutions that allow businesses to do just that, and dramatically improve their customer experience.On the growth front, Twilio has less than 65,000 customers. There are 30 million-plus businesses in the U.S., and somewhere around 200 million across the globe, nearly all of whom will develop a need for Twilio's services as real-time communication becomes a vital part of the customer experience.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills Overall, Twilio stock is a winning SaaS stock with big growth potential. Gross margins are also high, and operating margins are scaling nicely with revenues. As such, Twilio projects to be a big winner for a lot longer. Adobe (ADBE)Source: Shutterstock Software Service: Creative solutionsA bigger SaaS stock that also falls into the long-term winners category is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Adobe does a lot of things, but at its core, the company offers creative and visual-oriented cloud solutions to creative amateurs, creative professionals and businesses.Adobe's business breaks into three categories, all three of which are big growth categories. First, there's the Document Cloud, which enables customers to sign, edit, amplify and organize digital documents. This business is supported by the secular rise in enterprise-level digital workload adoption. Second, there's the Creative Cloud that delivers second-to-none, visual-focused editing solutions. This business is supported by a global consumption shift toward visual-first content. Third, and perhaps most importantly, there's the Experience Cloud, which is an enterprise-level cloud solution aimed at improving the customer experience. This business is supported by a global shift to an experience-driven economy.Ultimately, Adobe has three big growth businesses, the sum of which create a $100 billion-plus revenue opportunity for Adobe. Revenues this year are projected at just $11 billion. Thus, there's a long runway for growth ahead. Also, gross margins are really high, and this company has a chance to run at 50%-plus operating margins one day.Overall, Adobe is a big company with big growth potential ahead, a combination that should lead to Adobe stock trending higher in the long run. Axon (AAXN)Source: Shutterstock Software Service: Law enforcement solutionsOne of my favorite under-the-radar SaaS stocks is Axon (NASDAQ:AAXN). Axon provides cloud-hosted and next-gen solutions aimed at upgrading, optimizing and digitizing law enforcement processes of all sorts.The idea here is pretty simple. One area of the market that the big technology revolution hasn't hit as hard is the law enforcement world. But, as the world gets more technologically advanced, the need for a law enforcement tech makeover gets bigger. Axon wants to help them with that makeover, and that includes selling smart weapons, body cameras and various related cloud solutions (like a records management system).There are a few things that make Axon attractive as an investment. For starter's, the secular growth narrative of digitizing the law enforcement world is very healthy and it has a lot of room for growth. Second, Axon sells to law enforcement agencies, so demand is largely recession-proof. Third, revenue growth has consistently been north of 15% for a long time. Fourth, margins are roaring higher thanks to the software pivot.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 All in all, Axon has all the makings of a winning SaaS stock, and I fully expect this stock to head way higher in the long run. Okta (OKTA)Software Service: Identity solutionsMost SaaS stocks are exciting, and all the SaaS stocks on this list are very exciting. But, one of the more exciting SaaS stocks on this list is Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), given the company's unique approach to a potentially huge market.Broadly speaking, Okta is pioneering what management calls the identity cloud. The whole idea of the identity cloud is enabling enterprises to securely adopt any technology and/or software, by focusing on protecting a user's identity. This service has tremendous value in today's enterprise environment, wherein new technologies and software are being adopted in bulk, and where personal privacy and data protection have become of increasing importance recently.This is a big idea. Big ideas have big markets. Indeed, the addressable market for Okta's identity cloud is the whole IT space. Okta recorded revenues of just over $100 million last quarter from growth of nearly 60%. This is nothing new. Over the past several quarters, the average revenue growth rate has hovered around 60% and the average customer growth rate has hovered around 40%.Thus, this is a small company that is consistently and rapidly growing in a huge market. That makes Okta an attractive SaaS stock to own for the long run. The Trade Desk (TTD)Source: Shutterstock Software Service: Programmatic ad buying solutionsOne of my favorite SaaS stocks for the long run is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), and that's mostly because this company is the unparalleled leader in a huge growth industry.The Trade Desk is in the field of programmatic advertising. Essentially, programmatic advertising is using machines and algorithms to buy ads. A few years back, the ad buying process involved two or more human parties negotiating back and forth until an agreement was made. This process worked, but it was also time-consuming, costly, and largely inefficient in optimizing ad spend return. As technology has advanced, this process has become better. Now, instead of using human parties to negotiate, big companies are allocating their ad-spend using machines, which take data-driven inputs to optimize ad spend, and do so quickly, dynamically and without labor costs.The Trade Desk is the undisputed leader in offering programmatic advertising solutions. As such, the company has been a big grower for the past several years as programmatic advertising has really come into its own. This growth narrative is far from over. While programmatic advertising is already dominant in some advertising markets (like mobile), it is much smaller and less known in other advertising markets (video, audio, offline, so on and so forth).  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy Now Eventually, programmatic advertising will become big in those other areas given its cost, time and efficiency advantages. As such, at scale, all $1 trillion worth of global advertising dollars will be transacted programmatically. Gross spend on The Trade Desk's platform was under $2.5 billion last year, meaning there's still a long runway for growth ahead. That long runway, coupled with big margins, should keep TTD stock on a winning path. Salesforce (CRM)Source: Shutterstock Software Service: Enterprise cloud solutionsPerhaps the godfather of all SaaS stocks is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and that's because this company is a $100 billion-plus empire built on enterprise SaaS cloud solutions.Broadly speaking, Salesforce is the company both at the heart of and leading the cloud and data revolutions. The company offers cloud-based solutions that leverage analytics, data and AI to optimize enterprise operations of all sorts, ranging from sales, to marketing, to engagement. This market has big growth potential, mostly because the cloud revolution is still far from over (only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud) and the data revolution is just getting started (the volume of data globally is expected to surge higher over the next several years).Thus, as cloud adoption permeates and data volume surges, Salesforce will continue to win over clients and be a big grower in the SaaS market. This big revenue growth will couple with healthy and expanding margins, and continue to power robust profit growth. So long as the robust profit growth narrative remains intact, CRM stock will head higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SHOP, AMZN, ADBE, AAXN, OKTA and TTD.

2019-03-27,"Gaming companies like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stock got killed by Fornite which is partly owned by Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). It is a free game that produced billions in sales and caused a ruckus in the world of gaming.Source: Electronic ArtsElectronic Arts stock fell 50% starting in July and bottoming with the equity markets in December. It almost did a double bottom retest in February but that was a successful retest of support.Management seemed helpless. After all how could it battle a free game that is this popular? The answer was simple -- join the wave. Since EA created the Apex Legends game, the stock went off to the races.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips EA Stock and Apex LegendsApex Legends was a departure from EA's usual marketing hoopla. The statistics that resulted from the quiet release were a complete surprise to every one. They now have millions of players and each one is an opportunity for an up-sell to contribute to the EA stock bottom line.The sharp fall in the stock last year created a fundamental reason to own the shares. While it's not dirt cheap at 22 trailing price-to-earnings ratio, the future looks a lot brighter now that they have a way to compete with the elephant in the room.This is a similar situation to companies like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) migrating to the subscription service model rather than continuously chasing sales of new releases. I bet that EA management will be replicating this going forward as Apex Legends' contribution to their bottom line grows.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 This also opens the door for new revenue streams. So, those who want to own a piece of the gaming opportunity can now own Electronic Arts stock with confidence for the long term.However, today's opportunity is more tactical than fundamental. The upside benefit of this success of the new game is the positive action in the EA stock.Year-to-date, EA is up almost 30%, which is more than double that the performance of the S&P 500. But for the past 12 months, it is down 20% and lags the indices by about 25% points. So clearly there is a catch-up trade opportunity.Since the December bottom, EA stock stock has embarked on an ascending trend line of higher low as it closes in on a neckline of resistance. This usually creates the opportunity for a bullish breakout.If the buyers can break out of the $109-per-share area, they could overshoot to target $128. This would close the open gap from last August. But there are a few lines of resistance along the way at $105, $110 and $117 per share.To capture this potential, I can hold the stock with a tight stop below recent support. Depending on preference and portfolio balance, I would sound the first alarm below $96.50 per share. If that fails then there should be a support zone around $91 per share, plus or minus $1. Other than that, I see no reason for sellers to retest the February lows.Most urgently, there is a tight three day range between $101 and $104.70 that will act as the catalyst to the breakout we seek. For those who don't want to jump the gun I'd set an alert for the crossing of either edges and chase the opportunity I want.Those who know how to use options can find hundreds of other ways of getting long EA stock with very little out of pocket risk. For example, selling puts or put spreads is one way to generate income if the stock holds its levels or rallies. I can even use the funds from the puts to buy shares or call options on them.But there is reason to be cautious here. After all we are still facing macroeconomic headline risk that we still face from BREXIT and global tariffs.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-28,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) really is as strong as it has been for awhile. But when you think about it it makes perfect sense that and Adobe stock is so solid.Source: Shutterstock In the stock market, amid all the numbers and stochastic price movements, it's sometimes best to keep things simple. As such, here's my best attempt at a simple, three box check-list for identifying winning stocks.The company has to have winning and distinct features. The company has to be in a secular growth market. And, the stock has to trade at a reasonable valuation that leaves room for upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 A lot of stocks check off those boxes. But, few check them off as convincingly as Adobe. Adobe has winning and distinct features (the company dominates in delivering visual-oriented digital solutions). The company is also immersed in the secular growth cloud services market. And, ADBE has consistently traded at a reasonable 30-times forward price-to-earnings multiple.Consequently, Adobe stock has been a winning stock for a long time. Over the past five years, Adobe has risen more than 300%.Adobe will have similar success over the next five years, largely because the stock continues to check off all the right boxes. Of recent importance, Adobe just partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a move that only emphasizes Adobe's winning features and expands the company's reach in the secular growth cloud services market.So long as these catalysts keep popping up, ADBE will remain in the winner's column. As such, it remains the sort of stock you buy now and hold for the long haul. Microsoft Partnership Reinforces Strong FundamentalsAdobe stock is supported by strong big picture growth fundamentals.Those big picture fundamentals include that this is a company unparalleled in its ability to deliver visual-oriented solutions, and that is leveraging that unique ability to create unique and highly valuable visual-focused cloud solutions.Those solutions include Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud, and have increasing value today, in a world that is rapidly pivoting to visual-heavy consumption and interaction. As such, as this pivot continues for the foreseeable future, Adobe projects to win dollars and share in the huge growth cloud market.This healthy big picture narrative is getting even healthier, mostly thanks to Adobe's continued expansion into the commerce and enterprise marketing side of the cloud market.Specifically, Adobe last year acquired two companies. The first, Magneto, is a commerce platform. The second, Marketo, is a B2B marketing engagement company. The sum of these acquisitions expanded Adobe's reach in the cloud services market, to include commerce and B2B enterprise marketing.Building on those acquisitions, Adobe recently announced a partnership with Microsoft that further expands Adobe's reach in new markets. Specifically, Adobe's customers can now tap into the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn network to more effectively identify and sell to their own customers.This is a big move. It essentially says that Adobe isn't done growing yet. This company started with delivering visual-oriented cloud solutions. That growth narrative is still firing on all cylinders. But, in the meantime, Adobe is expanding its business offerings through acquisitions and partnerships into things like B2B marketing and sales.This expansion, on top of an already red hot visual-oriented growth narrative, only strengthens the long term growth fundamentals underlying Adobe. Valuation, Technicals and Adobe StockBecause the fundamentals remain healthy, the only two other things we need to look at here are valuation and technicals. Both of those check out.On the valuation front, ADBE stock trades at just over 30-times forward earnings, which is roughly in-line with its five year average forward multiple. The market, too, is trading roughly in-line with its five year average forward multiple. Thus, there is no disconnect with the market or history.Plus, growth projects to remain healthy over the next several years (20%-plus revenue growth and healthy margin expansion), and a 30 forward multiple on that strong growth profile is very reasonable.On the technical front, Adobe's 50-day moving average finally moved above its 200-day moving average just a few days ago. That golden cross pattern is a sign that Adobe stock is back to its winning ways after a late 2018 sell-off. Bottom Line on ADBE StockIn the big picture, Adobe stock is a long term winner. The company has a winning advantage (visual-oriented solutions) in a secular growth market (cloud), and the stock trades at a reasonable valuation (30-times forward earnings). A partnership with Microsoft only underscores the winning nature of this stock, and should help keep the stock on its new-found uptrend.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.

2019-03-29,"March Madness is here. But, contrary to what has happened in prior years, this year's men's college basketball tournament has played out largely as expected. There weren't many upsets in the first round. Nor that many in the second round. Indeed, for just the second time ever since 1985, the tournament's top 12 teams all advanced to the Sweet 16. That's because this year's top college basketball teams are just that good.The same is true in the stock market today. The stock market's top stocks are really good. They are supported by powerful secular growth narratives, in an economy that is still gradually expanding, with tailwinds that won't ease anytime soon, a runway that implies several years of big growth ahead, and valuations that are largely reasonable considering the immense growth potential.Further, the stock market's top stocks look and act a lot like college basketball's top teams. In college basketball, you have the consensus number one seed that is just tough to bet against. In the stock market, you have the top stock that analysts keep upgrading and investors keep buying. Meanwhile, in college basketball, you have the young team coming together at the right time. In the stock market, you have the small company that is delivering the perfect solution to the perfect market at the perfect time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business In other words, the top dogs in the stock market and the top dogs in college basketball aren't too different in terms of underlying characteristics. With that in mind, let's take a look at my list of Elite 8 stocks to buy, all of which I see as big winners for a lot longer. Elite 8 Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the consensus number one seedFirst on this list is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which in the March Madness analogy, is the stock market's consensus number one seed.Over the past several years, Amazon stock has consistently been one of the stock market's best performers thanks to the company's never-before-seen ability to successfully execute on a hugely disruptive growth narrative, which started with e-commerce and now encompasses things like cloud, digital advertising, and logistics.While the e-commerce businesses is in the slowdown part of its growth narrative, Amazon's cloud, digital ad, logistics, and offline retail businesses are all in their early innings, not to mention the yet-to-be-launched pharmacy business. That means revenue growth will remain big for the foreseeable future. Also, most of those businesses operate at substantially higher margins than the e-commerce business. Thus, Amazon's profit growth narrative is about to accelerate.Overall, then, Amazon stock has been and will remain a big winner. This is a one seed I wouldn't bet against. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrMarch Madness Parallel: the young team coming together at the right timeSecond on this list is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which in the March Madness analogy, is the young team that is coming together at the right time and playing their best basketball when it matters most.Shopify is a relatively young (founded in 2004) and small (sub-$25 billion market cap) company. But, the company is providing a very important service at the perfect time, and could one day be very, very big. Specifically, Shopify provides e-commerce solutions to retailers of all shapes and sizes, at a time when e-commerce is in the midst of rapid growth, and when that growth is increasingly driven by smaller players not named Amazon.In other words, the e-commerce world is finally being democratized. First, it was just the Amazons of the world that had the tools to build digital retail businesses. Now, thanks to Shopify, everyone and anyone can build a digital retail business. More than that, all retailers need to do so, since consumption is only becoming more digitally-focused than ever before.  * The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns As such, Shopify is providing the right solution at the right time. That makes this stock very much like a young and talented college basketball team that is peaking at the perfect time. Adobe (ADBE)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the &quot;been there, done that&quot; team that is the definition of consistencyNext up we have Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). For Adobe, the March Madness comp is pretty simple. Adobe is the &quot;been there, done that&quot; team that is known for consistency. Further, while they don't wow you with blowout wins, they are are as good as it gets on paper.It's fair to say that Adobe stock knows a thing or two about winning. Ever since this company pivoted to a SaaS model in 2012, it has been nothing but up, up, and away for the stock, which has gone from $30 to $270 during that stretch. What's the secret sauce? An unparalleled suite of visual-focused creative professional tools, which have important and necessary applications across a broad array of industries.Adobe has no competition in delivering those solutions, and their end-markets have secular growth drivers thanks to the increase in visual content consumption. Adobe is also gradually expanding their suite of cloud solutions to include marketing, commerce, and other enterprise functions. Gross margins are sky-high. Operating margins are close in on 50%. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is reasonable around 30. The balance sheet is clean.In other words, Adobe stock is about as good as it gets on paper. As such, this stock should remain a big winner for the foreseeable future. Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the misunderstood and underrated but highly talented teamPerhaps a surprise entry on this list, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) belongs in the Elite 8 of stocks because of the company's unparalleled and enduring reach among the world's internet population. In March Madness terms, Facebook is the misunderstood and underrated, but highly talented team that is starting to win games when it counts.In 2018, everyone knocked Facebook for privacy concerns and inept management. Yet, despite all the negative press, no user left the Facebook ecosystem. Instead, the Facebook ecosystem continued to add users. Advertisers followed those users, and continued to flock to the platform in bulk. Revenues went up. Profits did, too, even amid a huge surge in expenses.The lesson learned was that Facebook's ecosystem is very, very sticky. It survived a 2018 public fiasco that was one of the worst I've ever seen. That means it will likely survive anything and everything going forward. The user base will consequently keep growing. Revenues will rise. Margins will expand as big investments normalize. Profits will surge.  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos All in all, Facebook stock will remain on a solid uptrend in 2019 after as it buries 2018 headwinds. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the team that looks unstoppable right nowAlongside Facebook and Amazon, another mega-cap tech stock in the Elite 8 is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which comps most closely to the team which is on a twenty game win streak going into the tournament, and looks unstoppable right now.There's no denying the win streak that Netflix stock has been on over the past several years. Ever since an original content breakthrough in summer 2016 headlined by Stranger Things, Netflix has leveraged an original content-powered growth strategy to consistently add more and more subs each quarter, while concurrently raising prices without noticeable churn, and doing all against the backdrop of rising competition.This win streak will continue. For all intents and purposes, Netflix has already won the content game. They have a bigger user base than anyone else. Therefore, they have more consumer watching data than anyone else, and also can justify big content spend better than anyone else (each original content piece on Netflix has an opportunity to reach nearly 150 million pairs of eyeballs). As such, with more data and resources, Netflix appears positioned to keep beating the competition on the content front.If so, Netflix stock will stay in rally mode for the next several years. Roku (ROKU)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the dark horse gradually climbing backRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) belongs in the Elite 8 of stocks as the dark horse that is gradually climbing back into the winner's circle.Everyone seemingly forgot about the Roku growth narrative in late 2018. There were concerns about rising competition, which coupled with slowing economic growth concerns to put investors in a &quot;sell first, ask questions later&quot; mood. Roku stock tumbled.But, Roku reminded everyone with robust holiday quarter numbers that this is a big growth company. The underlying secular drivers in steaming video adoption remain robust. Competition remains muted. Demand for over-the-top advertising real estate is only growing. Further, the number of streaming services is only going up, and all those new streaming services are using Roku to grow, implying that Roku is increasingly turning into the cable box of the streaming world.  * 7 Stocks Still Worth Buying at 52-Week Highs Ultimately, the cable box of the streaming world will command tremendous value one day, as the market will have hundreds of millions of streamers and dozens of streaming services. Roku is best positioned to serve that need one day. As such, this stock projects as a big time grower for the foreseeable future. The Trade Desk (TTD)Source: Shutterstock March Madness Parallel: the streaky team that has huge upsideOne of the lesser-known stocks on this Elite 8 list is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). But, this company comps in March Madness terms to the streaky team that has huge upside if they stay hot. As such, TTD stock may actually have the most upside of any Elite 8 stock on this list.The Trade Desk is pioneering a market called programmatic advertising. In short, programmatic advertising is using machines, as opposed to humans, to buy ads. To be clear, this isn't just a change. It's an improvement. Automation in ad transactions makes the process quicker, more dynamic, less costly, more data-driven, and more real-time. Overall, programmatic advertising is simply better than traditional advertising.Eventually, all ads will be transacted programmatically. The global ad market is marching towards $1 trillion. Thus, programmatic advertising is a trillion dollar opportunity. Gross spend on The Trade Desk, the world's leading programmatic advertising platform, was well under $5 billion last year. As such, the growth runway ahead is huge.If The Trade Desk can stay hot and remain on top of this market, then TTD stock truly is in the first inning of a potentially huge programmatic advertising growth narrative. Square (SQ)Source: Via SquareMarch Madness Parallel: the &quot;remember them?&quot; team that fans won't forget againLast, but not least, on this Elite 8 list is Square (NYSE:SQ), which most directly comps in March Madness terms to the team that started out hot, went cold, and is now getting hot again at just the right time.For most of 2018, Square was a winning stock, thanks to secular growth tailwinds in non-cash payments and the company's innovation in various subscription services. But, the payments processor cooled in late 2018 as the global economy slowed down and competition heated up, creating a double headwind which forced investors to question the staying power of Square's big growth rates.In early 2019, the stock has bounced back, mostly because the global economy has picked up and Square has put to rest competition concerns through continued product innovation, market expansion, and big gross merchandise value growth. This company should stay hot because it remains the innovation leader in a secular growth digital and non-cash payments market, and has a unique opportunity to disrupt the banking world over the next several years.  * 7 Dividend Stocks With Double-Digit Increases All in all, then, Square stock is hot again, and should remain hot for the foreseeable future given long-running growth tailwinds.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, SHOP, ADBE, FB, NFLX, ROKU, TTD and SQ.

2019-04-03,"Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best Stocks for 2019 contest. John Jagerson and Wade Hansen's pick for the contest is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).Last December, we made an argument in favor of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) based on its strong market position and fundamental growth rates. One of the most important drivers behind this strength has been ADBE's stable revenue and high margins from its suite of Creative products (including subscription revenue), as well as its strong growth in expert services and marketing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the important benefits of ADBE stock's shift into services, subscription and cloud products over the last few years has been an improvement in margins. This is particularly critical right now as investors prepare for poor first-quarter earnings reports from some of the components of the S&P 500.Many companies were able to show very good profit growth rates in 2018 because of the effect of the 2017 tax cut. While that did a lot to increase after-tax net margins, it disguised the negative performance common at the operating margin level.Operating margin is the ratio of the income earned after operational expenses (before interest and taxes) divided by total revenue or sales. On average, operating margin was flat in 2018 and is forecasted to be negative in 2019. ADBE hasn't been immune to the soft growth in margin last year, but they have a distinct advantage -- 91% of total sales is driven by recurring revenue rather than new sales.Over the last year, ADBE's earnings per share grew by 42.86%, which was assisted by the tax cut. However, unlike many firms, topline growth -- which has nothing to do with the tax cut -- rose 17.61% on a trailing-12-month basis and 46% over the last 24 months.  * The 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally We expect those trends to continue in the short-term, which will make the company stand out among its peers during the upcoming earnings season. Technicals for ADBE StockWhen we wrote our original recommendation, the ADBE stock price was forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that was expected to be confirmed once the stock crossed above $245 per share. That pattern was confirmed, but its initial price target in the $278 range has not been met yet. Price growth has been slow as the stock retested its neckline breakout point in late February-March.Because the breakout has been slow, another interesting pattern has had time to form which signaled a higher likelihood for more gains. In the following chart we have outlined a &quot;diamond&quot; continuation pattern that was confirmed on April 1 with a break to new highs.Although diamonds can be difficult to identify, the historical data suggests a high probability for it to precede new short-term highs. We believe this happens because the pattern is the result of a period of distribution when weaker traders are either moving out of tech or just taking profits while new traders are accumulating the position. This pattern of distribution and accumulation could explain why the trading range goes through a pattern of widening and then narrowing swings.Our upside target remains in the $278 range, but we are more confident the stock will reach that level in the short-term following this recent breakout. One investment strategy could be for investors to leave the stock uncovered through that target, but then consider a hedge or short call position if the stock consolidates in the $278 range, where it may run into the resistance from the prior highs. A Few Issues to Watch With AdobeLast December, we warned that investors should be wary of economic slowing in Europe and the UK and how that may affect ADBE's revenues. This persistent issue is still a problem, but we don't believe Adobe is exposed to it to a greater extent than its peers. One way to manage this risk could be to combine a long position in ADBE with a short position in another tech stock (e.g. semiconductors) that has greater exposure to European economic problems. If economic conditions worsen significantly, the profits from the weaker short position should offset the losses in ADBE.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

The bank reports have been somewhat erratic so far, which has set some traders on edge. Selling a put builds in a small hedge in case the stock heads lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe took profits on our ADBE April 18th $260 Put Write last week. ADBE had lost some momentum after its last break higher, and we were concerned the resistance level just above $275 might prevent the stock from climbing any higher in the short term. Resistance at $275 caused the stock to form a double top in September 2018, and a rejection at that level could send the stock back down.Though it hasn't broken above $275, the stock is headed higher, and we think now is a good time to sell more premium. First Quarter Earnings Were StrongWe've talked in the past about why we like ADBE, and we've successfully sold three puts on it in 2019.Though the stock lost some value after reporting earnings, the report had some positive news. The company beat earnings per share (EPS) estimates, and it increased subscription based revenue since the first quarter of 2018.One aspect of ADBE's business model we've always liked is its subscription-based services. The fact that revenue from those services is increasing only makes the stock that much more appealing. Two &quot;Double Bottoms&quot;From a technical perspective, ADBE broke out of a large double bottom in the $205-$260 range in late February and is just completing another smaller double bottom in the $255-$270 range. The stock retested its most recent breakout with a bounce last week, making this a good opportunity to sell puts.Daily Chart of Adobe (ADBE) -- Chart Source: TradingViewWe are optimistic in the short term that investors have set a very low bar for earnings, which will reduce the risk for disappointments, but we want to be cautious for a few more days while we gather more data.ADBE is a good bet because its earnings were generally positive, and investors are moving capital into stocks that provide income and/or solid growth.

2019-04-17,"I'm not yet a believer in the ability of IBM (NYSE:IBM) to make the shift to the new tech world under its current leadership. Every other mega-cap technology company has already adapted to the new ways except IBM. While IBM stock came into its earnings event up 27% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500's 16%, it still trails the index and its competitors tremendously for the long term.Source: Shutterstock IBM is down 25% in five years, while the SPY is up 56%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are up 200% for the same period. More to that, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are up 145% and 38% respectively. So this is proof that old dogs can learn new tricks … except for IBM.Management talks the talk, but for some reason, it's hard to see the results without a forensic technician on hand. If CEO Ginni Rometti has to point out the innovation, then it's probably not as impressive as she thinks it is.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe new formula for tech success is simple. Companies now want to use subscription services that are based in the cloud. Anything else is considered ancient and is off trend. This is likely to continue for a few years. CRM started the model and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) accelerated it with the advent of its AWS.Last night, IBM management missed on sales but managed to beat their bottom line. This means IBM is managing profitability, but it still struggles to meet its revenue expectations. Also, to make things even more confusing they rearranged some of the revenue segments to muddle things. So I caution you on chasing mentions of &quot;cloud&quot; in their statements -- now, it's a matter of showing, not just telling.  * 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years While I'm not an expert on IBM's business, I do know mediocrity when I see it. This report represents its third consecutive decline in quarter sales year-over-year. Clearly IBM needs to make another shift of sorts. Whatever the company is doing now is not working, yet the CEO still gets the benefit of the doubt. At some point, IBM needs intervention so it can transform itself as MSFT did with its new CEO Satya Nadella.My criticism here is not the same as shorting the stock, but it's not a good bullish thesis either. The good news is that fundamentally, IBM stock is cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 12. This is even cheaper than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), so there is value below and it's not likely to be a major loss to hold the shares here. It's just stagnating. Bottom Line on IBM StockMaybe its acquisition of Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) is their ticket out of the stock muck in which they are stuck. If so, then a lot is riding on that and if it fails for any reason, both of those stocks are doomed.In addition to its fundamentals, IBM stock can't rally here because it's facing heavy technical resistance. Yes, IBM rallied an amazing 34% off its December lows. But up here it runs into the supply of sellers who have been stuck up since the October disaster.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Pivot zones like these are where bulls and bears agree on price so they like to fight it out hard. This creates price action congestion and when a stock is rallying this translates into resistance. All of that means it won't be as easy for IBM stock to breach the $145 zone as it was getting here. Conversely, IBM stock has support above $132 per share, so it would take a big calamity in the equity markets for it to fall below it.If I owned shares, I'd put them to work by selling covered calls against them. This is an easy way to create synthetic dividends above and beyond the company's 4% yield.Another bit of potentially good news is that most analysts have given up on the rally in IBM, so they rate the stock as a HOLD. When IBM finally delivers actual turnaround results there should be a slew of upgrades to cause a buying catalyst for the stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-18,"As financial markets have rebounded in 2019, so have shares of now-cloud giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

2019-04-18,"Do you want to invest like real billionaires do?Most billionaires obviously have much more money to burn than the average investor. And they also have enough cash in the bank to wait things out should their stock picks turn sour.Still, given the so-called &quot;smart money's&quot; resources and intimate connections with some of the companies they own, it wouldn't be a crazy idea to study the top stocks that billionaires and high-asset hedge funds are plowing their long-term capital into.

2019-04-25,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Cloud stocks are back. During the late 2018 market selloff, cloud stocks were thrown out, along with every other growth stock in the market. But as financial markets have improved in early 2019 due to stabilizing economic fundamentals, cloud stocks have come roaring back.The big rebound in cloud stocks can be chalked up to improving fundamentals and sentiment. As it turns out, the global economy isn't spiraling downward at a rapid rate. Instead, it is simply slowing at a reasonable rate to a more steady 2-3% growth rate. Amid this slowdown, cloud services demand has remained robust, since cloud services are seen both as the future and a way to cut costs amid slowing growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsequently, the fundamentals and sentiment underlying cloud stocks have dramatically improved over the past month. As they have, cloud stocks have soared higher.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years This rally is far from over. Considering only 20% of enterprise workloads have shifted to the cloud, it's fair to say that the rally in cloud stocks is still in its early stages. With that in mind, let's take a look a seven cloud stocks to buy now. Adobe (ADBE)Perhaps the best-in-class cloud stock to buy now for healthy upside and limited risk is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).The core growth narrative here is quite promising. Adobe is one part stable-growth business with a huge moat, and one part hyper-growth business with a rapidly expanding addressable market. Those two parts put together are worth far more than what the market is saying today.On the stable growth side, Adobe is a one-stop shop digital solution for creative professionals with relatively muted competition. This has always been the case. If you can't think of any true competitors to Adobe in the creative solutions space, you aren't alone. Just check out this list or this list of Adobe Photoshop alternatives. None of them are household names. Nor do any of them offer products even close in quality to Adobe's offerings. As such, this creative solutions business is a stable growth business with a huge moat and no competition, implying healthy revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.On the hyper growth side, Adobe is morphing into a cloud business with a unique value prop. Other cloud solutions focus on various factors. Adobe's cloud solutions focuses on experiences and visuals, and the company is leveraging its experience in visual-oriented solutions to create cloud solutions for companies looking to enhance their consumer's experience. As it does, Adobe's revenue and profits will move considerably higher.Overall, there's a lot to like about ADBE stock. This is a big growth company that will keep growing at a big rate for a lot longer. That level of robust growth will power ADBE stock significantly higher in a long term window. Twilio (TWLO)Another best-in-class cloud stock is cloud communications app maker Twilio (NYSE:TWLO)Over the past several quarters, Twilio has emerged as the unchallenged leader in the rapidly growing Communication Platforms-as-a-Service (CPaaS) market. The CPaaS market essentially consists of companies integrating real-time communication into their services. Think of Uber or Lyft using messages to communicate with riders when their rides are approaching.This market will be huge due to continuous shifts towards cloud-based communication, personalized customer experience and digital engagement. Quite simply, as consumers, we enjoy digital, real-time, and personalized communication about the services and products we are paying for. Twilio enables this communication. That positions this company for huge growth as the CPaaS market expands over the next several years. For what it's worth, research firm IDC expects this market to grow five fold over the next five years.Thanks to its huge customer and revenue growth and 95%-plus retention rate, Twilio has emerged as the clear leader in this space. As this space matures over the next several years, companies will increasingly turn towards Twilio to enable CPaaS solutions thanks to the company's leadership position (in new industries, you always tend to trust the leader).  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years As such, over the next several years, Twilio will continue to grow at a rather robust rate. This big growth will ultimately power TWLO stock higher, especially against a favorable equity backdrop. ServiceNow (NOW)In the digitization and automation fields, the cloud stock to buy is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW).ServiceNow is currently in the business of digitizing corporate operations. This includes automating corporate workflows and IT tasks. But, this is just the tip of the iceberg for ServiceNow. Automation is a big, big market. Automating IT tasks represents just a fraction of what the automation market will look like at scale.At scale, jobs across the entire corporate ecosystem will be replaced by more efficient digitized and automated solutions. ServiceNow will provide the lion's share of these solutions. As such, as the automation revolution plays out over the next several years, ServiceNow's revenues and profits will explode higher. As they do, NOW stock will explode higher, too, considering the valuation today remains reasonable.Overall, NOW stock is a great way to play the automation revolution. This revolution is still in the first inning, and the next eight innings promise to have broad and immense financial implications. For ServiceNow, those implications are hugely positive. As such, NOW stock should trend consistently higher over the next several years. Okta (OKTA)One of the more exciting cloud stocks to consider here is Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA).Okta is pioneering what the company calls the identity cloud. Essentially, this is a cloud solution centered on individual identity that allows millions of people across a corporate ecosystem to seamlessly, securely, and uniformly connect to the technological tools that the corporation is adopting. This may sound like a complex idea. The underlying technology is complex. But, the idea isn't. The idea is that companies everywhere are rapidly adopting new technologies, and that the implementation of these technologies is often difficult, chunky, and risky to identities and data. Okta solves this problem, and allows companies to adopt new technologies seamlessly and within the same secure cloud solution.This is a big idea. Big ideas have big markets. Indeed, the addressable market for Okta's identity cloud is the whole IT space. Okta recorded revenues of  $115 million last quarter from growth of nearly 60%. This is nothing new. Over the past several quarters, the average revenue growth rate has hovered around 60%.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Thus, this is a small company that is consistently and rapidly growing in a huge market. Gross margins are high, and marching higher, leaving room for big profits at scale. Overall, this is a big growth company with a ton of potential. The valuation is big, but the amount of growth firepower underneath this business implies a tremendous opportunity to grow into the valuation, and then some, making OKTA stock an attractive long term investment here. Salesforce (CRM)The king of all cloud stocks is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and there's good reason for that.Salesforce is at the heart of the cloud and data revolutions. The company leverages data and analytics to deliver robust cloud solutions to enterprises that want data-driven insights. Demand for this type of service will grow by leaps and bounds over the next several years as data-driven strategies and cloud solutions become the enterprise norm. Salesforce has developed a long-standing reputation for being the best in class for delivering these services.That won't change any time soon. As such, Salesforce's revenues and profits will soar higher over the next several years as the cloud and data revolutions gain mainstream traction.This will naturally push CRM stock higher. Valuation is somewhat of a concern at nearly 60x forward earnings. But, the company has enough growth firepower through cloud and data tailwinds to grow into its valuation. Plus, valuation has been a long-running concern for this stock, and the stock has done nothing but defy those concerns and head higher over the past several years.The same will be true over the next several years, too. Cloud and data tailwinds will propel CRM stock higher, and this stock will ultimately grow into its valuation. Indeed, numbers indicate the stock could double in the long run. Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is better known for its giant e-commerce business. But, the true profit growth driver behind Amazon is the company's cloud business -- Amazon Web Services.AWS is the world's largest cloud infrastructure services business, and it's not even close. Amazon Web Services is bigger than its four closest competitors … combined. And the company has consistently controlled more than 30% of the cloud services market.This dominance speaks volumes about just how good AWS is. Indeed, AWS is so good that even Amazon's commerce competitors are giving money to the company through AWS. Notably, Amazon's e-commerce competitor Zulily migrated its infrastructure to AWS recently. Also, AWS is so good that Amazon it is the clear front-runner to win a $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) commercial cloud contract with the U.S. government. If Amazon were to win that contract, that would be the second huge government contract it has won this decade (AWS won a $600 million CIA contract in 2013).  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Overall, AWS is the clear leader in the cloud infrastructure services. As this market grows over the next several years, AWS will grow, too, and that will provide a big boost to Amazon's profits. A big boost to Amazon's profits will give AMZN stock firepower to head higher. Alphabet (GOOGL)Much like Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) is better known for its non-cloud businesses.But, a significantly underappreciated and underrated aspect of Alphabet is Google Cloud. Google Cloud is a big growth, big margin business for Alphabet. To be sure, the business has lost some steam over the past several quarters as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has gained cloud market share at a more robust pace than Alphabet recently. But, there have been some C-suite changes at Google Cloud which could give the business new direction and new firepower to regain some lost momentum.Regardless, Google Cloud will remain a 20%-plus growth business for a lot longer. Overall, Google Cloud is the key to unlocking the next leg of value in GOOGL stock. Fortunately, this business is progressing as expected, and will continue to do so over the next several years. As it does, GOOG stock will move higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE, TWLO, CRM, AMZN and GOOG.

2019-04-26,"Hedge funds are where millionaires and even billionaires funnel their money to find ways to outperform the market. They don't always live up to the hype, and they're constantly derided as too expensive.

2019-04-26,"The shares of the cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is up more than 35% over the past year. The overall fundamental strength of the company has been the catalyst behind the Salesforce stock returns.Source: Shutterstock Between now and when Salesforce reports earnings on June 4, there is likely to be volatility and even some profit-taking in the stock price, especially as many other technology firms also report in the coming weeks.However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to a growth company in the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add CRM stock to their portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years  Salesforce Is an Industry LeaderNot many investors are fully versed in the fundamental strengths of the Salesforce stock. In a nutshell, customer relationship management software systems connect businesses with customers. For example, the software enables a company's support and sales teams to have all possible information about any given customer so that they can offer the right mix of customer service at the right time. It is the biggest software market globally.Wall Street credits Marc Benioff, Chairman and co-CEO with popularizing the software for managing customers, sales, and service. Revenues in the CRM market are expected to reach $80 million by 2025. And Salesfoce.com is regarded as the clear industry leader.Salesforce's market share is about 20% and over 80% of all Fortune 500 companies use its CRM software. On the other hand, the respective market share of each of its competitors such as Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is in single digits. CRM Stock Has Robust Fundamental Numbers On March 4, Salesforce announced results for its fiscal Q4 as well as the full fiscal year that ended on Jan. 31, 2019. &quot;We had another year of outstanding revenue growth, surpassing $13 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company in history,&quot; said Mr. Benioff.Growth was strong across geographic markets, products, and sales segments. CRM stock increased its fourth-quarter revenue to $3.6 billion, a jump of 26% year-over-year (YOY). It also reported a total of $5.38 billion in unearned revenue, an increase of 25% YOY. This metric accounts for sales that Salesforce has already made but, due to accounting rules, will only recognize later within the next 12 months.The  jump in revenue also drove a 29% increase in CRM's quarterly operating cash flow, to $1.33 billion. Finally, the company announced an annual revenue goal of $26 billion to $28 billionby fiscal year 2023, an impressive feat for a company with a market cap of over $126 billion. Salesforce Stock and Strategic InvestmentsSalesforce has been branching out into other business ventures, too. This expansion is made possibly partly due to its steady free cash flow (FCF), which measures a company's ability to produce cash. The juggernaut's total free cash flow for the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended in January was $2.8 billion.Investors care a lot about FCF as it can be used in a discretionary manner, for example, to invest in growth opportunities and to strengthen CRM's balance sheet further.The cash-rich company is also not shy to acquire smaller businesses that management deems a good fit with its existing product lines and growth ambitions. The $6.5 billion takeover of the business software company MuleSoft in 2018 was Salesforce's largest acquisition to date. Analysts believe that MuleSoft will increase Salesforce's ability to help customers integrate other systems into Salesforce.Salesforce, the most dominant force in the global CRM industry, has so far invested $1.3 billion in other promising ventures and public companies. Its focus is on cloud companies.Several of CRM stock's past investments include Docusign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Domo (NASDAQ:DOMO), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), SurveyMonkey parent SVMK (NASDAQ:SVMK), and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Its most recent investment has been in Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) which went public on Apr. 18. In other words, these investments help Salesforce position itself for future success. What Could Derail CRM Stock Short-Term?Year-to-date, CRM stock is up 17%. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat overextended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Salesforce's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Furthermore, over the past few weeks, CRM stock has been trading between $150 and $160, a range that is likely to be broken soon either to the upside or to the downside.Should bulls reignite, they could easily push Salesforce stock over $165. On the other hand, if there is a pullback, the $145 level looks like a spot to me to consider buying into CRM stock.Although I'm expecting some short-term profit-taking in CRM stock, I'd not fight the tape and would be willing to re-evaluate the technical charts in the coming days.Salesforce stock's beta is 1.37, which means its volatility on average is 37% higher than that of the broader market. Therefore, if the industry or the overall market declines as other companies release earnings, Salesforce stock price may also be adversely affected.If you are worried about the overall earnings season in May and would like to protect some of your profits in the CRM stock, you may consider a covered call strategy with approximately a five-week time horizon.In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of CRM at a limit price of $163.09 (the closing price on Apr. 25) and, at the same time, sell a CRM May 31 $160 call option, which currently trades at $6.65.The $160 option is slightly out-of-the-money, offering downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in Salesforce stock.This call option would stop trading on May 31 and expire on June 1.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find CRM stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $175. In other words, it's still a good time to be bullish on Salesforce. Bottom Line on CRM StockSalesforce stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further broad-based growth prospects, leadership in the respective market, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.Investors who are interested in software stocks or cloud-based services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Salesforce may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have CRM stock as a holding, including iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV), First Trust Cloud Computing ETF(NASDAQ:SKYY), or PowerShares Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Portfolio (NYSEARCA:PXLG).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-09,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) continues to prove why it is one of Wall Street's favorite investments. On March 15, the creative software maker announced strong Q1 results as the company delivered broad-based sales growth, lifting Adobe stock. Specifically, ADBE reported record revenue of $2.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year.Source: Shutterstock A big winner over the past several years, ADBE still remains on track to produce consistent growth for the foreseeable future. However, this week has once again reminded investors what volatility due to political uncertainty, such as the U.S-China trade wars, may mean for their portfolios. Therefore Adobe stock price might be weak in  the short-term, especially between now and June 18, when the company is slated to report its Q2 earnings.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From  Adobe Stock Thrives on Strong FundamentalsADBE reports the revenue of two of its segments: Digital Media and Digital Experience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Digital Media segment includes revenues from Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) and Adobe Document Cloud. In recent years, Creative Cloud's revenues have increased by high double-digit percentage levels, driven by increases in subscriptions by both B2C and B2B customers  In Q1, the Digital Media segment's revenue was $1.78 billion, while Creative's revenue jumped to $1.49 billion and Document Cloud reached record revenue of $282 million.The Digital Experience segment includes Adobe Experience Cloud, which offers a range of cloud-based tools for marketing, advertising, analytics and content management. Customers use these tools to better manage their marketing initiatives. This segment has been been adding more enterprise customers to its ecosystem. Its Q1 revenue rose 34% year-over-year to $743 million.Many analysts agree that Adobe's 2018 acquisition of Marketo, a marketing software and e-commerce platform, as well as Magento Commerce, a market-leading e-commerce platform, has helped ADBE grow its market share in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and become a digital-marketing platform leader.Going forward, ADBE has enough cash on hand to finance more potential acquisitions to fuel the growth of its digital-experience segment. ADBE's Subscription Model Has Boosted Adobe Stock PriceAdobe's flagship software products for video, graphic and audio content creation include Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat and Dreamveawer. In 2012, when Adobe first announced that it had switched from a software- licensing model for Adobe Creative Cloud to a monthly subscription-based model, Wall Street was not sure as to how this radical approach would affect Adobe stock price.Overall, Adobe offers powerful solutions that face little competition. As a result,  many customers decided to move to Adobe's subscription cloud solutions because there was no real alternative. The subscription model has enabled Adobe to achieve high gross margins and  raise its prices without losing customers.Fast forward to 2019, and investors realize that the significant risk that Adobe has taken has paid off: Users, the company and investors are all happy with the subscription model.Users always  have the latest versions of Adobe's software, ADBE does not have to persuade customers to buy a newer version every few years, and the owners of Adobe stock have been thrilled with its recurring, stable income;, asabout 85% of ADBE's revenue now comes from subscriptions.As ADBE offers more cloud-based products, Wall Street is expecting the company's dominance and revenue  to grow. So far, most of ADBE's revenue has come from the U.S. But Wall Street believes the company can easily grow its businesses in both Asia and Europe, adding to the current $3 billion of annual revenue that ADBE obtains from these regions.Investors also believe that Adobe will be able to push deeper into customer relationship management (CRM) through Sensei, its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, boosting its top line and Adobe stock . Adobe's Partnership With MicrosoftAdobe's strengths are not limited to its robust financial results. Management has also been taking important steps to make the company a  leader in the content-creation space.Since 2016, Adobe has had a powerful  partnership with Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud business, Azure. The two companies work together to provide cloud-based data to enterprises.Additionally, Adobe's Experience Cloud and Microsoft's Dynamics CRM platform will be integrated with Microsoft's LinkedIn. Pooling Adobe platform's data with Microsoft's tools could cause the gains of Adobe stock to accelerate.The strong and unique collaboration between Adobe and Microsoft has  fueled rumors that Microsoft may purchase Adobe as early as 2020. Many analysts increasingly believe that Microsoft is looking at Adobe as more than just a partner. If MSFT does buy ADBE, the owners of Adobe stock are likely to be rewarded handsomely. The Bottom Line on Adobe StockADBE is the dominant player in  the cloud-based software market. Adobe stock is a winning name that many investors are likely to stick with. Within two to three years, investors who buy Adobe stock are likely to be rewarded handsomely. By then, ADBE  could become a takeover target.Tech stocks may continue to be volatile in May, and I would not advocate trying to identify stocks that could be immune to a U.S.-China trade war. In the past few trading days, ADBE stock price is down almost 10%.But if Adobe stock price declines further, long-term investors may find Adobe stock particularly attractive. I believe Adobe stock price  is likely to find major support between $250 and $260.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Nokia posted a loss of 2 cents a share and revenues of $4.49 billion, while the Street was looking for a profit of 2 cents a share and revenues of $5.06 billion.But when it comes to transforming a company, the progress can be choppy. Competition remains tough and there are long sales cycles.However, NOK is still a much better company today, as it has done much of the needed heavy-lifting of cost cutting and restructuring to streamline operations. There have also been some major acquisitions, such as for Alcatel-Lucent.Yet, the most important potential catalyst is the emergence of 5G. As an indication of the importance of this trend, look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It appears that the key reason it settled its massive lawsuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was to ensure that the company has the necessary technology for 5G. This technology is a must-have.While mobile network transitions do not necessarily result in major demand for equipment, this time is likely to be different. Speeds for 5G are likely to be 100 times faster than 4G, which means there will probably be a surge in innovation. And this means more than just greatly improving smartphones. There will also be opportunities in categories like IoT (Internet-of-Things), gaming, education, autonomous cars and so on.To play in this market, there needs to be secure, reliable and scalable technology. And yes, NOK is one of a few companies that that has these capabilities with its systems.Another important factor: The US-China trade standoff. This means that the US will block out a fierce competitor -- mainly, China's Huawei.And finally, Nokia has a valuable patent portfolio. On the earnings call, CEO Rajeev Suri remarked that there will be continued strength from the portfolio that should provide &quot;considerable monetization opportunities.&quot; Bottom Line on NOK StockThe move to 5G has certainly not been without its challenges  -- and this should be no surprise. The technology is complicated and requires dealing with onerous rules and requirements. But as for NOK, management is still optimistic and believes that the second half of the year will see a pick-up in the business. There is also about 200 million in euros of revenues that are expected to be recognized during this period of time.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Something else: NOK stock is quite cheap at current levels, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 12 or so. Oh, and the dividend yield is an attractive 4.13%. This is among one of the highest in the tech sector.In other words, NOK stock does look like an interesting value play on the 5G opportunity.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-15,"If you put $1,000 into Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of 2011, today that Adobe stock would be worth $9,849, a compound annualized return of 35.7%.Source: Shutterstock So far in 2019, ADBE stock is up 23% year to date through May 10. If Adobe can meet its average annual return over the past seven-and-a-half years, it will hit $300 with a little room to spare. Given the stock's momentum, it seems like an absolute certainty. However, others would argue that its valuation is far too stretched, suggesting $250 is a more likely scenario for the end of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk Here's an argument for both prices. Adobe Is a $300 StockAdobe stock has taken in the trade war and the Chinese recent retaliation. The Chinese, in a tit-for-tat move, added tariffs to $60 billion in American exports to China, scaring the heck out of investors and sending the major indexes down by more than 2%. President Trump is playing the ultimate game of chicken. However, cooler heads will prevail because no one wants a protracted trade war between the world's two largest economies. When that day comes, and the trade negotiators deliver a workable deal, Adobe's move higher should resume to $300. A big reason why Adobe stock will continue moving higher has very little to do with a trade deal and everything to its business functioning at a very high level of efficiency. At the end of April, Adobe's stock got a ratings upgrade from Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss who upped it from equal weight to overweight while also increasing his 12-month price target by 21% to $340, providing investors with 26% upside from current prices. &quot;Adobe should sustain a 20%+ EPS compound annual growth rate over the next three years, even if digital-media growth begins to wane, given improving segment profitability and ramping digital-experience growth,&quot; Weiss wrote in a note to clients.He's not the only analyst who likes Adobe. A total of 19 analysts have an overweight or buy rating on the stock with 12 analysts giving it a hold rating. None of the 31 analysts covering it gives it an underweight or sell rating. Of course, when you're growing earnings per share by 20% or more a year, it's easy to see why no analysts are negative about the company.As for target prices, Weiss's is highest at $340 with the average just under $300 at $296.68. From where analysts are sitting, Adobe looks primed to hit $300 by the end of 2019.  Adobe Stock Is Only Worth $250In March, Adobe reported its first-quarter results and they were very strong with its digital media segment up 22% year over year while its digital experience segment increased revenues by 34% on the back of two acquisitions; Marketo for $4.7 billion and Magento for $1.6 billion.In fiscal 2019, Adobe expects its digital media segment's revenues to grow by 20% while its digital experience segment should see revenues grow by 34%, again thanks in large part to its two acquisitions. Most important, it expects non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2019 to grow by 15% from $6.76 in 2018 to $7.80 in 2019. While the $7.80 figure is likely a conservative estimate (it increased guidance from $7.75 after the first quarter) earnings have got to hit $8.11 a share or higher to meet Weiss' three-year grow rate mentioned above. Considering both its price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow ratios are higher than its peers, and its five-year historical average, any growth below 20% will have to be viewed by investors as a failure to deliver. While I agree with InvestorPlace contributor Tezcan Gecgil that Adobe is a good long-term investment given the strength of its cloud-based products. Furthermore, it probably would make an attractive acquisition for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).However, valuation in a volatile market remains a major sticking point to a higher stock price. More bad news on the trade front could put tech investors in an extended selling mood making $250 a real possibility.  The Bottom Line on Adobe StockIt's important to remember that Adobe was trading below $210 as recently as December. Therefore, it's more than possible that its share price will drop to $250 or even lower. Long-term, like my colleague, I believe Adobe stock is a winner. I would wait to see how this trade war plays out before buying. If you already own, I'd continue to hold, buying more in the $250s.

2019-05-17,"Nobody is questioning the business prospects of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But on the price chart, ADBE stock's longevity and top-dog status among the bulls is looking tenuous at best. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Wall Street loves Adobe stock. The analyst community collectively has 17 buys on the company behind ever-present products such as Photoshop, Acrobat and Illustrator. The staunch support has manifested itself into a median price target almost 6% above yesterday's $283.55 close.Want more? The Street's $340 high estimate is 20% removed from today's levels and 17% north of Adobe stock's all-time-highs set in early May. Mind you, those heady expectations are despite shares having enjoyed a rally of around 300% since 2016 and a massive return for its investors of about 1,650% over the last decade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the other extreme? Currently, there's not a single sell recommendation on Adobe stock.Most recently and backing the Street's enthusiasm, ADBE's CEO enjoyed a bit of cushy armchair talk on CNBC's Mad Money. The interview highlighted the company's enviable position within secular trends for design and creativity, emphasized Adobe's exposure to the trade war is &quot;fairly minimal&quot; and the outlook for 2019 looks strong.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days And away from the cameras? Adobe's soon-to-be-released Photoshop Creative Cloud for the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad is the latest innovative tool backing up the upbeat talk.Nevertheless, when I see a picture or chart illustrated like Adobe stock's below, there's good reason to be more cautious than carefree. Adobe Stock Monthly ChartClick to EnlargeWhat concerns me are indications of price and pattern weakness emerging on Adobe stock's longer-term monthly chart. A two-candlestick reversal formation centered on the 2018 all-time high is developing. This pattern is closing in on a bearish signal to short ADBE stock below April's low of $263.72. The formation also maintains a supportive, weak-looking stochastics set-up.At a minimum, for investors that have participated in Adobe stock's burly rally, confirmation of a top should be used for profit-taking as the chances for a much larger correction increases. Adobe Stock Short StrategyFor investors who are comfortable shorting, as mentioned, I'd wait for pattern confirmation as ADBE stock trades through $263.72. Using a pattern breaking stop-loss above $291.71 amounts to short exposure of about $28 or roughly 11% stock risk.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week Alternatively, if a short in Adobe stock signals, a tighter exit above the September high of $277.61 equates to reduced risk of around 5%. That kind of price action could be enough of an indication our technical concern was misplaced.On the downside and if conditions allow for a top to play out, the &quot;X&quot; on the ADBE stock chart marks the spot or more aptly, 'illustrates' where I see the first layer of substantial support. This is backed by a key Fibonacci trend-line at the December lows. Shorts would also be looking at solid open profits versus the position's initial risk. As much, this area makes a good choice for taking partial profits or maybe even giving Adobe stock a second look for an entirely new position.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-21,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) isn't just Photoshop and PDF documents anymore. Indeed, ADBE stock has been an investment in a digital marketing company since early 2017. That's when it debuted Experience Cloud and Advertising Cloud: two platforms that help organizations market and measure their online efforts.Source: Shutterstock It has been a solid success as a result too, if for no other reason than those offerings drive recurring revenue.The company just took its e-commerce arm to a whole new level though, partnering up with sector giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The deal helps Amazon's third-party sellers cultivate relationships and manage their business better.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMost fans and followers of Adobe acknowledged and respected the development. Not enough investors, however, seemed to fully appreciate the potential of this new offering for the ADBE stock price. Meet MagentoThe rise of third-party sellers on e-commerce platforms represented a hot button for years. But the matter came to a strange head last month when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos lamented, &quot;Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt.&quot;  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) The math is presumably correct, but the premise is misleading at best. Third-party sellers have never made up a bigger portion of Amazon's total sales than they do right now. However, they've also arguably never been more miserable about it thanks to their constant competition with Amazon's own retail-sales efforts.Amazon has been and continues to cheer &quot;the little guy&quot; using its sales venue, promising tools to better empower them. As it turns out, the company wasn't just blowing smoke. Its latest option does that and much more.The program is called &quot;Branded Stores for Amazon Sellers.&quot; However, existing AMZN customers may recognize the new features look very similar to Adobe's Magento platform.Regardless of the wrapper and label, the results are the same: faster page-load times, better conversions, options to scale for online-shopping surges and one-click checkouts, just to name a few features. The platform also raises the profile of Adobe stock.Those niceties are secondary to what Magento's Branded Stores for Amazon Sellers ultimately delivers though. As Adobe's vice president of commerce product and platform Jason Woosley explains:Small and mid-market businesses are taking direct ownership over how they manage customer experiences to differentiate, grow and build loyalty. Our work with Amazon empowers this large community of sellers to get closer to their customers while saving them time and money on development. Relationship BuildingIt's a product development that cuts straight to the heart of a matter which has long frustrated several Amazon vendors. No matter how well the seller serves the customer, Amazon.com owns the relationship, and oversees the experience.Not any longer though. In an environment where would-be rivals like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) are thriving explicitly because it's helping budding online entrepreneurs develop real customer relationships, Amazon is being forced to do the same.And Shopify is undoubtedly rattling Amazon's cage in this way. Shopify's director of product Michael Perry recently explained:The most important thing for entrepreneurs is to establish that direct relationship with their customers. Personally, I don't know why anyone would want someone else to own their customer relationship. Unfortunately, that's the exchange that takes place with a digital marketplace.It was a veiled jab at Amazon, but a well-deserved one. It's the new norm in e-commerce. Shopify has got several quarters of strong double-digit sales growth to verify it's this kind of platform that online retailers want.Adobe's solution is different than Shopify's though, in that Adobe's Magento isn't a one-stop-shop. Adopters can integrate Magento with multiple e-commerce venues.And it's already been integrated with another big one, as the partnership with Amazon isn't exactly exclusive. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) now allows online sellers to manage their Google ad campaigns via Magento.It's hardly a threat (yet) to Amazon. But if Adobe continues to partner with anyone and everyone that wishes to take aim at Amazon.com, the half of the e-commerce market Amazon doesn't own could collectively make a dent in Amazon's dominance.And Adobe is more than happy to sell them their bullets. That bodes well longer term for the ADBE stock price. Bottom Line for ADBE StockIt's not necessarily a reason to step into ADBE stock, particularly right now. Shares are up 36% since their late-December low, and back within sight of record highs. The equity is vulnerable to profit-taking. This vulnerability is more pronounced in that Adobe stock never really burned off the froth of the 170% gain it reaped between the end of 2016 and September of last year.Besides, it's still the early innings for Magento's Branded Stores for Amazon Sellers, as well as for Magento's non-Amazon growth.There's little doubt as to the marketability of the new option for Amazon's third-party vendors, however, as well as for online retailers not using Amazon.com. It's one big step closer to the tool online sellers have been looking for.Therefore, it wouldn't be crazy to take a shot on ADBE stock on any decent pullback. The sentiment applies even before Magento has its full chance to make a fiscal impact.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-22,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Okta NASDAQ OKTA has had an impressive run with Okta stock trading under the radar as a cloud play and cloud stocks are on fire There s no other way to put it,Okta Stock Is the Sleeper Cloud Play You’ve Been Looking For
2019-05-22,"Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) has had an impressive run, with Okta stock trading under the radar as a cloud play, and cloud stocks are on fire. There's no other way to put it.As the global enterprise world pivots from on-premise to cloud-hosted solutions for price, convenience, and accessibility advantages, the providers of those cloud-hosted solutions are growing by leaps and bounds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsequently, the stocks of cloud titans like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) have soared.Okta has gained far more than any of those headline cloud stocks over the past few years. It went public in April 2017 at $17 per share and trades today around $110.What's the story behind the huge gains from Okta stock? Cloud security. Broadly speaking, everyone and their best friend in the business world is pivoting to the cloud. That means there's a whole bunch of corporate and customer data up in the cloud. Security surrounding that data isn't all that great, hence the huge volume of hacks and data breaches over the past few years. Thus, enterprises are increasingly seeking a better cloud security solution. Okta provides just that.As such, Okta has found itself at the convergence of two secular tailwinds (cloud adoption and cybersecurity). Those two tailwinds have produced huge growth for the company. Shareholders have cheered that big growth, and Okta stock has taken off like a rocket ship.At these levels, there's no hiding the truth that Okta stock is expensive. But, is it too expensive? I don't think so. If you take a big picture outlook on the stock, this is a big growth company with a ton of upside left over the next several years.As such, I think investors who are late to the party shouldn't be too concerned. There's still plenty of long term upside left. Big Market OpportunityIn the big picture, Okta is attacking an exceptionally valuable and large market with a unique solution, and as this unique solution gains scale over the next several years, Okta's revenues and profits will continue to grow at a robust pace.Okta operates in the enterprise cloud market. This is a huge market. Global cloud spend is projected to hit $500 billion by 2020. But, only 20% of enterprise workloads have migrated to the cloud so far. Over time, that number will move towards 100% given that cloud-hosted solutions provide price, convenience, and accessibility advantages over on-premise solutions.Thus, the big cloud growth narrative is only one-fifth of way through, meaning that the enterprise cloud market is not just big, but also growing very quickly, too.Within this market, security is a big issue. Everyone is pivoting to the cloud. But, they aren't just pivoting wholesale to one cloud. Instead, the norm in the cloud market is hybrid cloud, which is essentially adopting multiple different cloud applications depending on the use case (Adobe for visual solutions, ServiceNow for automation, Salesforce for marketing, so on and so forth).Consequently, the enterprise pivot to the cloud simultaneously means a pivot of valuable corporate and customer information across various different cloud service providers.That data needs to be protected. But, protecting it isn't very easy to do. That's why we have seen so many headline data breaches and hacks over the past few years as the cloud pivot has gained momentum. Thus, consumers are increasingly seeking a uniform cloud security solution. Unique Solution Gaining ShareOkta provides this uniform cloud security solution, and does so in a unique way.Okta is creating a new cloud security solution which allows enterprises to seamlessly secure information across all cloud apps at the same time. They call this solution the Identity Cloud.Essentially, this is a cloud solution centered on individual identity that allows millions of people across a corporate ecosystem to seamlessly, securely, and uniformly connect to the technological tools that the corporation is adopting. This may sound like a complex idea. It's not. Okta is simply creating an identity-driven security solution wherein controlled identity information is the only way in and out of a system.This is a big idea. Importantly, it's a big idea that gaining traction rapidly.A few years ago, Okta had about 2,000 customers and was doing $30 million in quarterly revenue. Okta closed fiscal 2019 with 6,100 customers on a $115 million revenue quarter. Further, the company exited 2019 with 50%-plus revenue growth rate and a 40%-plus customer growth rate.In other words, not only has Okta grown very quickly over the past several years, but it is still growing very quickly today, and hardly losing any steam. As such, it is clear to see that Okta's unique Identity Cloud security solution is rapidly gaining share in the cloud security market. Big Valuation Warranted Long TermOkta stock is trading at nearly 700-times projected profits that are still two years out. Thus, this stock is richly valued. But, is it overvalued? I'd say no, if you look at the big picture.Okta has just over 6,000 customers. There are over 100 million businesses in the world, all of whom could use Okta's Identity Cloud. Further, cloud spend is at $500 billion and growing. Okta's revenues this year are projected around $535 million.Thus, in the big picture, this company is very small relative to its market opportunity. Because of this, management's long term target for 30%-plus annualized revenue growth into fiscal 2024 seems very doable. Even thereafter, this company should be able to do 20%-plus revenue growth into 2030, as more companies pivot to the cloud and cloud security demand globally grows.Under those assumptions, this could easily be a $5 billion revenue company one day, and probably by 2030. Gross margins are sky high and projected to rise north of 80% soon. Meanwhile, opex rates are big, but dropping rapidly, and could fall towards 50% at scale. That means 30% operating margins are achievable. On a $5 billion revenue base, that implies $1.5 billion in operating profits. Assuming a normal tax rate and some growth in the share count, that could flow into $8 in EPS by 2030.Application software stocks normally trade at 35-times forward earnings. Applying that average multiple to $8, a realistic 2029 price target for Okta stock is somewhere around $280. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2020 price target of just under $120. Thus, while Okta stock is richly valued, it isn't overvalued. Yet. Bottom Line on OKTA StockOkta stock has been one of the market's biggest winners over the past two years, and with good reason. This company is in the early stages of a really powerful long term growth narrative that will produce robust profit growth over the next several years.To be sure, a lot of this upside is already priced into Okta stock. But, not all of it. As such, while gains will be more muted going forward, this stock will remain on a medium to long term uptrend for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long OKTA, CRM, ADBE, AMZN, and NOW.

I've  been a fan of Adobe stock for a long time,  and ADBE stock has continued to rise for years. Right now, it doesn't look like that will change.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why ADBE Stock Price Is Cheap EnoughOne simple comparison highlights why Adobe stock is, at worst, cheap enough to consider. Again, ADBE trades at 35 times this year's expected EPS, and 28 times analysts' average 2020 EPS estimate. For a large-cap software play, that's simply not that expensive.Indeed, look at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), an Adobe cloud partner and a long-rumored potential buyer of the company. Microsoft - even excluding its almost $8 per share in net cash - trades at 26 times analysts' average fiscal 2019 EPS estimate and over 23 times  their FY20 consensus EPS estimate.Should Adobe stock be trading at a higher valuation than Microsoft stock? Absolutely. ADBE's growth going forward should be far more impressive. Adobe's adjusted earnings per share, according to analysts' average projections, should rise 23% next year, more than double Microsoft's anticipated increase. Both companies have benefited from the shift to cloud-based services, but Adobe has much lower exposure to flattish consumer PC revenue.This data doesn't mean ADBE stock price is cheap. Indeed, I was skeptical toward Microsoft stock for some time before turning bullish on it last year. The recent run of Microsoft stock to a near-trillion-dollar market cap makes MSFT once again somewhat dicey from a valuation standpoint.But the valuation gap between MSFT and ADBE stock is, at worst, reasonable. If Adobe 's EPS  continues to rise at a 20%+ annual rate, that gap will disappear in just a few years. Put another way, 35 times  this year's earnings for ADBE stock  might sound expensive. But Adobe's EPS looks poised to reach $12  by 2021. At current levels, ADBE stock is trading around 23 times $12. A multiple of 23 times for ADBE stock sounds close to cheap. Growth Drivers for Adobe StockThe ADBE stock price is, at worst, in a range that will enable Adobe to grow into its valuation and then rise further. ADBE is not quite priced for perfection, as some may believe.If ADBE's growth continues, Adobe stock should rise and outpace the market. And there are plenty of reasons to expect that ADBE's growth will continue. Creative Cloud demand is only going to grow as creative jobs multiply amid the growth of streaming media and small businesses, i.e the customers of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).ADBE's Experience Cloud - boosted by the acquisitions of Marketo and Magento last year - will continue to expand its addressable market and benefit from the increasing importance of data analytics and the increasing breadth of marketing channels, including digital marketing.Adobe should benefit from many of the trends that have driven tech stocks, in particular, to their current valuations. The shift to cloud? Check. Digital advertising growth? Check. Big data? Check . If an investor is going to pay up for exposure to those trends, ADBE stock is a logical choice for him or her. Watch the MarketThe biggest risk to ADBE, in fact, seems to be external. At some point, investors may bring stock valuations down across the board. (But I'd note that risk has been seemingly ever-present for the past decade,.) The ADBE stock price dropped by more than 25% in the market-wide swoon late last year, so it's not immune to broad market weakness.But any investor owning pretty much any tech stock at the moment is taking some sort of valuation risk. And there doesn't appear to be many tech stocks as appealing as ADBE. Adobe stock isn't cheap, but it shouldn't be, at least not yet. And if it keeps doing what it has been doing, $267 will seem cheap in retrospect.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-24,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock has been around a long time. It is one of the tech industry pioneers that transitioned from selling software to enterprise companies to delivering professional products all the way through the funnel to individuals.Source: Shutterstock It was an original Silicon Valley company, founded in San Jose in 1982. That's a long time ago, especially in tech world. Remember, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is only 20 years old.That means ADBE stock has survived the dot-com bust in 2000 as well as the financial meltdown in 2008. It has also been able to grow as tech has developed, competitors have risen and fallen and revenue models have changed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Adobe Stock Continues to Look StrongThat is an immense achievement. Adobe isn't a niche player that makes one unique product that has significant barriers to entry. Its growth depends on more and more people and companies using its products. That means it has to stay not only relevant, but ahead of the curve, anticipating the needs of its customers.It made (and continues to make) significant inroads into design software for rapid prototyping (aka, 3D printing) before it started to become mainstream, for example.But the big point of inflection for ADBE is summed up in two simple words: recurring revenue.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer Like many of the older software companies, Adobe was based on a model that relied on regular updates on their software versions. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was another prime example.They would sell personal and professional versions of one program, like PhotoShop, and then update those versions over the next year or two. Customers would then go out and buy the new software when it was available.However, as the internet became more integrated into business life, companies started to build their models around subscription-based services. Instead of buying each version of new software from a vendor, people could buy a monthly or yearly subscription that allowed their software packages to be updated as soon as new versions were available.Imagine how much easier this was for companies with hundreds and thousands of employees, each using various software packages. Logistics were simplified, installation times evaporated and IT staff could be more productive. Plus, for companies like Adobe, revenue became more consistent and reliable. That is something the stock market loves.While that transition took some time, ADBE stock has been a big beneficiary of the results, both on the equity side and the business side.It reported Q1 earnings in March and showed that earnings and revenue are doing as well as expected. It also projected the full year to be along analysts expectations as well.The other big thing ADBE is developing now is partnerships with two of the world's top ecommerce companies -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google.It's allowing third-party sellers to use its Magento design suite to make ads and landing pages for Amazon vendors. And on GOOGL, it's providing Magneto to online sellers to design, track and manage its ad campaigns. These could bring about another round of massive growth for ADBE, which continues to stay one step ahead of its competition.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-05-24,"In 2015, a year after Satya Nadella became its CEO and committed his company to the cloud, I put some Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares in my retirement account and forgot about them. My patience has been rewarded. A $53 investment in MSFT stock is worth almost $127 now, and reinvesting dividends has brought me more shares, which have also risen in value.Source: Shutterstock With a market cap of $972 billion, Microsoft is now the world's most valuable company, and despite his earnest philanthropy, co-founder Bill Gates is worth over $100 billion.The question is how long can the company keep growing without getting into the same monopoly penalty box that kept it from reaching its 1999 highs until 2016?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's Nadella's challenge now. Spreading Bets Through CloudThe key is to continue spreading the company's bets, using the Azure cloud, growing as humbly as it can.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy The humility is evident in the company's numbers. Growth returned just two years ago, and net income was lower in fiscal 2018 than in 2017. But Nadella was using the time to build infrastructure and relationships. The big benefits have begun appearing in the last six months. At its present pace, Microsoft will bring in well over $120 billion of revenue and over $30 billion of net income during fiscal 2019, adding to a cash pile that had reached $131 billion at the end of March. Microsoft has already piled up over $21 billion in operating cash flow through the first half of the fiscal year. Forget it becoming IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft is now Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).The key lies in partnering with other companies and not trying to consume them. Microsoft has over 200 cloud partners, most of which you have never heard of, for whom its tools are essential. Microsoft has deep relationships with companies like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). But it has avoided a big acquisition that might lead rivals to compare it with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which bought many of its database channel partners in the 2000s, then demanded monopoly rents.The best evidence for how well this works is a recent announcement with Sony (NYSE:SNE) on gaming and streaming. The two firms' consoles have battled each other for decades. But in the new field of cloud gaming, they position themselves as underdogs against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which are already in the field. Good to Not Be KingThe strength of other cloud czars is Microsoft's secret weapon in any battle with regulators.Windows is no longer a monopoly thanks to Google Chromebooks. Skype is barely mentioned in video calling -- the focus is all on Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM). No one worries about LinkedIn because Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is so dominant.The acquisitions Microsoft is making are on the bleeding edge, in the Internet of Things, where it trails Chinese giants like Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA). Microsoft was seen as a good home for Github, the open source repository, because it's seen as more neutral than other potential acquirers, like IBM, might be. The Bottom LineIn his most recent conference call, Nadella emphasized areas like security, hardware and social, where the company clearly trails market leaders.But Microsoft Azure is the most profitable cloud. Microsoft booked $9.7 billion of revenue as &quot;intelligent cloud&quot; during the quarter, with margins of over 20%, putting $3.4 billion of new capital to work there. Again, thank goodness for Amazon. No one is screaming about an &quot;Azure monopoly.&quot;So long as Nadella can keep spreading his bets, Microsoft and investors like me will keep smiling all the way to the bank.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-28,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) continues to solidify its market position. A partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) boosts the company's digital marketing profile. Moreover, an Android app in its multimedia niche will expand its usability in video editing. Such innovations have helped take ADBE stock to new highs.Source: Shutterstock However, this optimism may have also taken the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio on Adobe -- more than 50x as of Friday -- beyond its growth rates. Although Adobe will continue to hold profound influence in both multimedia and digital marketing, investors should probably wait for a pullback before buying ADBE stock. Adobe's Deep MoatsBack in April 2018, I wrote that Adobe has prospered by building deep competitive moats. For years, consumers knew ADBE best for its multimedia features. Adobe Acrobat, Photoshop, and the Flash platform have long served as its better-known offerings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn recent years, the company has established another niche in digital marketing, utilizing its Adobe Experience Cloud. Subsequent acquisitions have expanded its reach. In 2018, the company bought Magento, a platform for e-commerce stores, and more recently, Marketo. Marketo acts as an end-to-end solution to manage the customer experience.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors Now, it has continued to solidify its market position in both of its primary niches. Adobe has also partnered with Amazon to bring Magento Commerce stores to Amazon sellers. This move takes its rivalry with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to a new level and should further help ADBE stock long term.It will also bring its Premiere Rush video editing software to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Android operating system. As Alphabet also owns YouTube, this should allow users to make quick edits to videos shot on the spot.Adobe will make Premiere Rush available for free initially but will levy a $9.99 a month subscription fee after the end of the trial period. In years past, Adobe might have sold this software for a one-time price. Now, it becomes one of the latest sources of recurring revenue. Many credit that recurring revenue model for boosting Adobe stock in recent years. ADBE stock has more than tripled since the beginning of 2016 and risen tenfold since 2011. ADBE Stock is Ahead of ItselfNonetheless, I find myself again holding the same view on ADBE stock that I had a year ago. Since that time, ADBE saw further growth, a sharp decline in the fall of around 25%, and then a steady recovery to new all-time highs in 2019. Now, there are again concerns about the valuation of Adobe stock. The shares gains have taken the PE ratio to almost 51 times earnings. Still, thanks to its profit growth, the forward PE sits at about 29x.That may appear high, but that does not take the multiple far above averages over the previous five years. The days where ADBE stock supported PE ratios in the teens and twenties have disappeared as its activity in multimedia and digital marketing has brought a premium multiple. I do not see that changing in the near future.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Still, at about $275 per share, the price may have moved slightly ahead of itself. Analysts predict a 15.7% earnings increase this year and 23.9% next year. While impressive, these moves may not justify the current valuation. I don't recommend that long-term holders of ADBE stock get out. However, I would not encourage buying at these levels either. Final Thoughts on ADBE StockAs Adobe solidifies its market position in its key niches, ADBE stock may stagnate in the near term due to valuations. Both the Magento partnership with Amazon and the expansion of Premiere Rush into the Android ecosystem will further solidify Adobe's strong competitive moats.However, at more than 52 times current earnings, I see little near-term upside. Moreover, a lingering trade war with China could put further pressure on ADBE stock. The moats ADBE has built as well as double-digit profit growth should make the equity a valuable long-term holding. However, given the valuation and current conditions, wait for it to return to a bear market before buying.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-28,"Amid calls to sell Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock, the equity continues its march higher. Despite multiples that resemble 1999 valuations and endless calls by analysts urging traders to sell SHOP stock, Shopify stock continues to rise. Now it has become not only expensive, but also unpredictable. Due to the uncertain nature of Shopify, investors should simply log out of SHOP. Shopify Versus Shopify StockSource: Shopify via FlickrI cannot praise the business model of Shopify enough. SHOP allows small firms to build e-commerce platforms that are separate from those of large players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, it enables small businesses that might not otherwise be able to sell products outside of their immediate surroundings  to bring their goods to the world. This value proposition has helped SHOP's annual  profit growth exceed 50% for many years.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement However,SHOP's position as a market disruptor does not make me like SHOP stock, at least at its current level. Seeing the performance of Shopify stock reminds me of a famous Mark Twain quote:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.&quot;In fairness, I would attribute the excessive valuation of Shopify stock to  ill-advised decisions rather than stupidity. Still, the quote describes my feelings whenever I think about buying SHOP stock. Though Shopify stock continues to defy gravity, I believe that most owners of SHOP stock will face a grim fate at some point.Trading above $270 per share, SHOP's forward price-earnings (PE) ratio  now stands at about 293. Both myself and other analysts have argued that even 50%-plus annual profit growth does not justify such a multiple.But nobody seems to care.Despite its sky-high valuation, Shopify stock has risen by about 140% since Dec. 24. SHOP stock has continued to rally despite the fact that many factors could derail its upward movement. As InvestorPlace's Vince Martin pointed out, the small firms which Shopify serves will likely bear the brunt of any  macro-economic slowdown. He also called the company's transaction-based revenue model dangerous. InvestorPlace columnist Dana Blankenhorn went further, calling SHOP a &quot;bubble&quot; and pointing out that a number of market pros have assigned SHOP stock negative ratings. Shopify Stock Has Become Too UnpredictableAlso, many forget that SHOP has competitors. A large number of site operators prefer WooCommerce. Moreover, Magento, now owned by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has partnered with Amazon to make small platforms integrate more easily with those of the e-commerce giant.Despite these challenges, Shopify stock continues to surge. Stock-market history indicates that SHOP, like its once-high-flying predecessors, will eventually fall to its fair value. However, history also suggests that it's difficult to predict when such moves will occur. Thus, I have no idea how to time the coming correction of SHOP stock. At this point, a long position can lead to outsized profits, but it could just as easily turn investors into bag holders.The valuation of SHOP indicates that traders should short Shopify stock, at least in theory. However, its 293 forward PE suggests that investors have become  irrational about SHOP. Since SHOP stock stopped trading on fundamentals long ago, one has to admit that the shares' forward PE could reach 500 or even 1,000.Because both long and short positions carry tremendous risk,  traders are left with only one responsible option: staying away. The Bottom Line on Shopify StockSHOP makes products that can only be found  locally available to the entire world. Given the high number of businesses that could benefit from an online store, SHOP is a significant market disruptor.Unfortunately, Wall Street knows this all too well. Despite a forward PE ratio that's approaching 300, Shopify stock trades near its all-time highs. That price level makes it very difficult  to predict the direction of SHOP.Despite its tough competition, Shopify continues to take small businesses to a higher level. Unfortunately, investing in Shopify stock will probably not take traders to a higher level. Given the valuation of SHOP and the threats to its business, avoiding it  has become the only responsible recommendation.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump fired off a tweet about raising tariffs on China, the S&P 500 has shed nearly 4%. Importantly, the sell-off has not been narrow. Pretty much every stock outside of the defensive sector dropped in May. This includes shares of ecommerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Since the infamous Trump tweet, Amazon stock has shed 6%.Source:  Via AmazonBut, does that really make sense? After all, Amazon has relatively mitigated exposure to China, so should the stock really be an under-performer against the backdrop of rising trade tensions?Quite simply, no. Amazon stock should not have under-performed in May.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement But it did, and this underperformance has created a contrarian buying opportunity for long term investors. Amazon will ultimately recover from near term trade-related weakness. In the long run, innovation and growth will ultimately power this stock way higher than where it trades today. Amazon's Fluke UnderperformanceWith respect to recent weakness, Amazon stock should not have underperformed in May because the company's exposure to the trade war is relatively mitigated.Broadly, there are two reasons why Amazon  dropped in May. Both of them are trade related. First, rising trade tensions mean falling consumer confidence (normally), which means lower global retail sales and less growth for Amazon's e-commerce platform.Second, if in place for a long time, higher tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices in the U.S. Higher consumer prices in the U.S. will spark inflation throughout the economy, which will get the Fed to come off the sidelines and hike rates. That will provide downward pressure on equities and consumer confidence, and is especially bad news for a consumer-focused, richly valued name like AMZN stock.These two concerns, while legitimate, are overstated.Trade tensions aren't bad enough yet to where they are weighing on consumer confidence. Consumer confidence in the U.S. ticked up in May, topped expectations, and is now back to Fall 2018 levels, which were 18 year high levels. Because consumer confidence hasn't dipped, neither have retail sales, which rose 2.8% in April, versus a 3 month moving average of 2.7% year-over-year growth. Thus, trade war issues aren't bad enough yet to where they are rearing their ugly head in consumer confidence and spend levels.Further, inflation remains muted. Core PCE growth is below 2% and falling, mostly because there are multiple deflationary forces throughout the U.S. economy. In order to offset those forces, you would need tariffs to stay big for a lot longer. That probably won't happen, because both sides want to get a deal done. Thus, inflation projects to remain muted for the foreseeable future. Amazon Stock Will RecoverWhile trade concerns related to Amazon stock are overstated, the favorable fundamentals supporting this stock are understated.Specifically, there have been multiple positive developments with respect to Amazon and its multiple growth verticals over the past several weeks and months. There was a favorable Cowen survey which showed that Amazon Web Services customers are more likely to increase spend on AWS than customers of other cloud platforms.There has also been a huge one-day delivery push on the ecommerce front and an equally big push into automated warehouses to make one-day delivery a reality without cramping margins. Amazon has also jumped into the food delivery game with a big investment in Deliveroo. It has expanded its presence and capabilities in the Indian ecommerce market and scored a big partnership with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) on the decentralized direct commerce front.It's also worth noting that Amazon's Fire TV platform now has more users than Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), making Amazon a front-runner in the secular growth advertising-video-on-demand (AVOD) space. Growth in AVOD would be a nice complement to what is already a burgeoning digital ad business at Amazon.Overall, then, Amazon's innovation pipeline remains as robust as ever. So long as that remains true, Amazon will remain a big revenue growth company. Importantly, a lot of Amazon's new growth is coming from higher margin businesses, so margins are running higher, too. Thus, Amazon today is a big revenue and profit growth company.Ultimately, this huge profit growth trajectory will keep Amazon on a winning track, meaning near term trade related weakness is nothing more than a buying opportunity. Bottom Line on Amazon StockAmazon stock underperformed in May against the backdrop of rising trade tensions. It shouldn't have. This disconnect creates a compelling buying opportunity. Over the next few weeks, Amazon will recover. Then, over the next few years, the stock will continue to head significantly higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, ADBE, and ROKU.

2019-05-31,"The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is having an unmistakably negative effect on the technology sector. Numerous tech stocks have heavy Chinese exposure, whether it's via the rare-earth materials they use in their products, manufacturing done in China or just deriving a large percentage of revenues from the country. And their shares have been punished as the rift between the two countries has widened.As a group, the outlook is worrisome. But a few tech stocks are more shielded than others from Chinese trade issues. Just look to the cloud.Cloud computing has been a lucrative mega-trend on its own; whole industries have moved into scaled data centers, linked by fiber cable and wireless networks. But it also is shaping up to be something of a safe haven from trade concerns. China may make some of our devices, and their chips may go into our technology infrastructure, but the clouds themselves are ours, and so is the value inside them. Thus, many companies that operate cloud-based services look to be relatively well-insulated against this long-running U.S.-China trade spat.The following are six tech stocks that can help China-proof your portfolio. Many of these stocks have run hot in 2019, and some of them are expensive as a result. But each is also a strong long-term holding based on the merit of their technological innovations and the lucrative markets they address.

2019-06-12,"We're finally seeing U.S. stocks cool off a bit after a miraculous run over the past few week or so. One would think that the bears could undo some of these gains here. The fact that they can't says it's more likely buyers are taking a rest right now rather than sellers taking control. That can always change -- sometimes just from a tweet -- but for now, we have to respect that observation. Let's look at some top stock trades going forward.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Facebook  Click to EnlargeFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares are under pressure with worries about whether CEO Mark Zuckerberg was aware of the company's privacy issues. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock was rejected from its 50-day moving average and is failing to hold its 20-day moving average. It's no surprise that downtrend resistance (blue line) is also squeezing it lower.     * 5 Tech Stocks That Are Far Too Risky Right Now Let's see where it firms up. If buyers come in to defend FB, $175 may hold. If not, a decline down to the $160-ish level may be in the cards. On the upside, bulls really need to see FB clear downtrend resistance and the 20-day moving average. That puts the 50-day and potentially higher back on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: General Electric    Click to EnlargeLook at General Electric (NYSE:GE) quietly trying to breakout. The stock pushed through a convergence of moving averages near $9.75 and is now well north of $10. Bulls need to see the stock hold above its three major moving averages. So long as that's the case, a breakout over $10.50 is in the cards. If it does, the February high near $11.28 is the first target. If $10.50 holds as resistance, bulls need to see its trifecta of moving averages hold as support. Otherwise, $9.50 and potentially $9 are on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: The Trade Desk    Click to EnlargeThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) took a quick 6% hit on Wednesday on an analyst note, but recovered half of those losses by the close. It's left the stock bouncing off its 10-day moving average, but is otherwise just floating there. Where resistance came into play is no surprise. A close below Wednesday's low could get us a flush in TTD. Maybe only down to the 20-day moving average, but perhaps down to the 50-day moving average. I would love to see TTD back down in that $190 to $200 consolidation zone, but after a $50 rip in a week, I don't know if it will decline that far, (short of a broader market correction). If it does, I would consider it a buying opportunity. Otherwise, see how it trades through the rest of the week. If today's lows hold, a retest of its highs and channel resistance are in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Alteryx  Click to EnlargeAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) is ripping higher on Wednesday, with the stock up 10%. Along with TTD, these two stocks have been total studs and the gains shouldn't surprise InvestorPlace readers. After all, they are two of the seven mid-cap stocks to buy for big-time returns. So what now? AYX continues to bumble along against channel resistance, a mark that's been in place since the fourth quarter. Can AYX breakout over it? Of course, but I wouldn't bet on it happening. I'd rather potentially play the breakout after the fact than gamble on multi-month resistance suddenly giving way. However, I would certainly be a buyer on a pullback into the $87 to $92 area. Aggressive bulls may pull the trigger at $95 to $96. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Adobe Systems  Click to EnlargeAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reports earnings on June 18th. Usually we see some upside action ahead of the report as optimism grows. It's no secret this name has been a huge winner over the years, so optimism ahead of the print is not surprising. Above, you can see that the 50-day moving average is holding up, as is the backside of short-term downtrend resistance. That said, $285 has been a ceiling to ADBE while it has made three straight lower highs.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession I don't know how the stock will trade post-earnings, but as long as it holds today's lows, it could be good for a bounce in the coming days. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long ADBE.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped Wall Street estimates, signaling the Photoshop maker’s expanding product suite is continuing to fuel growth.Sales increased 25% to $2.74 billion in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $2.7 billion.For more than a decade, Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has sought to diversify the company known for creative software. Adobe made two big-ticket acquisitions in the past year, Magento, an e-commerce company, and Marketo, which sold marketing software, and is now working to integrate its bigger line of products. Adobe unveiled a software platform in March that will further connect the company’s programs with other systems, so clients can glean more insights about their consumer data.“We expect the first half momentum to continue in the second half,” Narayen said on a conference call. “Our revenue growth, cash flow, and operating profit differentiates us among” large software companies.Adobe’s shares gained about 2.8% in extended trading after closing at $276.78 in New York.The company, however, gave a profit forecast that fell short of analysts’ projections for the second consecutive quarter. Earnings, excluding some expenses, will be about $1.95 a share in the current period. Analysts estimated $2.05 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.There’s “a bit of a relief that something didn’t go wrong,” Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in an interview. “They had a nice beat and they’re maintaining a steady 25% growth rate. That’s solid.”Adobe’s stock has been an investor favorite for years, jumping sevenfold from 2012 through the end of 2018 -- six times more the S&P 500 Index and far outpacing rivals. While the shares have gained 22% this year, the enthusiasm has cooled since March after the earnings forecast missed estimates. The stock increased just 3.4% since that March 14 outlook through Tuesday’s close.Sales from Adobe’s experience cloud division, which comprises marketing, analytics and e-commerce tools, climbed 34% to $784 million in the period ended May 31, and is projected to grow by the same percentage in the fiscal third quarter.The creative cloud division, led by Photoshop, grew 22% to $1.89 billion in the quarter and is projected to increase by 20% in the period ending in August.Adobe’s remaining performance obligation, a measure of future revenue under contract, increased to $8.37 billion, compared with $8.13 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. That metric, plus the sales projection for the company’s experience unit, suggests demand will remain steady.(Updates with comments from analyst in the seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Gains as Revenue Tops Estimates on Expanded Portfolio

Essentially, it is willing to be accommodative, which is reassuring to investors, provided Fed Chair Powell doesn't say something hawkish in his press release. Let's look at some top stock trades in light of today's move.

Is the stock finally ready to breakout?  * 5 Strong Buy Biotech Stocks for the Second Half It might be. Uber poked its head above the $45 IPO price, but retreated shortly after.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Jabil  Click to EnlargeShares of Jabil (NYSE:JBL) are slowly but surely grinding higher on Wednesday after better-than-expected earnings results. After finding the 200-week moving average as support a few weeks ago, shares quickly vaulted above the 20-week and 50-week moving averages as well.It sets up a big test of $31, which has been range resistance for two years now. Should it act as resistance again, a pullback will likely get underway. If it gives way though, it could ignite a potent rally over this mark.Watch $31 to $31.40. Over this area and JBL stock could fly. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Adobe Systems  Click to EnlargeAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is rallying after better-than-expected earnings and despite worse-than-expected guidance for next quarter. That's surprising, given most stocks trade on guidance rather than the past quarterly results.But it doesn't matter; price action does.Wednesday's rally vaults ADBE over the key $285 level. As long as it can maintain this price, bulls can stay long. Over $292 will land Adobe at new highs and could spark a rally to $300.Below $285 puts the 50-day back in play. Below that puts its June lows on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Shopify  Click to EnlargeDoes this stock ever stop?

2019-06-19,"After Tuesday's big rally, Wednesday's session was muted most of the day, but it wasn't boring. What moved the Nasdaq today? As is typically the case on FOMC meeting days, the Federal Reserve was on everyone's radar.Source: Shutterstock While the market was pricing in a roughly 25% chance of a rate cut this month, it was no surprise that the Fed held steady. But that doesn't mean they will continue to do so going forward. According to the Fed Funds futures, there's a 77% chance that the Fed will cut rates next month. Further, the market is pricing in a 62% chance that the Fed cuts twice by its September meeting.On some level, that feels bearish given that the Fed shouldn't be cutting rates in a healthy environment. That said, with the U.S. economy mostly humming along, investors don't want to fight the Fed. If it's willing to be accommodative and dovish, investors don't want to be stubborn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: UBER, JBL, ADBE, SHOP That can be a boon for tech stocks, which tend to thrive in a low interest rate environment. If that ends up being the case, look for the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) to benefit. Wednesday's WinnersChip stocks, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) held up well on Wednesday after Tuesday's powerful rally. Should the trade-war rhetoric continue to improve, the semiconductors should continue to see upside.Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) jumped more than 5% in Wednesday's session, after the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations. However, management's outlook for next quarter came up short of expectations, which makes today's rally somewhat peculiar. It appears that investors are willing to give ADBE the benefit of the doubt and seem to like the partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Speaking of MSFT, shares hit yet another new highs on the day, after doing so on Tuesday as well.Jabil Inc (NYSE:JBL) jumped double digits on the day, rising more than 10% after better-than-expected earnings. Non-GAAP earnings of 57 cents per share was in-line with expectations, while revenue of $6.14 billion beat consensus estimates by $130 million and grew 12.9% year-over-year. Now, the stock is flirting with a major multi-year breakout.T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) tacked on another 2.4% gain on Thursday, as it looks increasingly likely that it will get the green light from the DoJ to acquire Sprint (NYSE:S). The latter rose 3% on the same optimism, as reports peg Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) as the likely suitor to buy the duo's asset sales, which are necessary for regulatory approval.Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 7.5% to new highs following a positive take from its investor meeting. The stock hit another new all-time high on the day as the Shopify train just keeps on rolling. Should shares hit $356, it will be a triple from the December lows. The LosersVideo game stocks struggled on Wednesday, led lower by Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which fell about 1%. Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) ended flat after a strong last hour of trading, while Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) ending higher on the day despite a lower open. The group was under pressure Wednesday following video game sales data showing an 11% year-over-year decline for May, while hardware sales slumped 20%.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled again on Wednesday. The stock opened at its highs on Tuesday, but fell despite announcing its new cryptocurrency. That selling continued today, with the stock down 0.53%. It cast a shadow over social media stocks, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) falling 1%, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) dropping 1.3% and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) sinking 2.5%. The Bottom Line on the Nasdaq TodayThe Fed was the most polarizing event of the day and its aftermath will show itself in the days and weeks to come. Will the event act as a catalyst to propel stocks to new highs? After all, the Nasdaq is less than 200 points or about 2.1% away from those highs now. Or will investors sell the market lower despite the Fed's accommodative stance?Let price be the guide. If Wednesday's closing action is any indication, buyers want in on the market heading into the early part of summer.What I really want to see how is how the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones trade through the rest of the week. While they rose 0.42%, 0.33% and 0.15% on Wednesday, respectively, I want to see if the move has staying power. A strong finish to the week very well could bring new highs, but we need to see that continuation to confirm it.  * Dow Jones Today: Stocks Almost Had Some Fed Fun Let's see if chip stocks can continue to push higher and if Adobe can climb up toward $300.

2019-06-21,"The reaction to earnings at Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offered more proof that cloud applications are kings of this stock market.Source: Shutterstock Adobe, which moved its picture and video editors to the cloud early this decade, earned $632 million, $1.30 per share, on revenue of $2.744 billion during the three months ending in May. The earnings were 5 cents short of a year ago, well short of analyst estimates, but revenue was 25% ahead. Guidance was considered soft.But Adobe stock took off anyway, rising almost $17.50 per share over the next 24 hours, opening for trade June 20 at $294 per share. This added about $7 billion to the market cap, which stood at $142 billion. Adobe is up almost 29% in 2019 and over 300% over the last five years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPretty good for what is, by Silicon Valley standards, a mature company. The Marketing CloudAdobe was founded in 1982 around PostScript, a page description language, and during the rest of the 20th century it grew by acquiring other, related products for pictures and video. By the middle of the 2000s, however, it was languishing.Then CEO Shantanu Narayen committed the company to the cloud.Not only did Adobe find new profits by hosting its software online, but Adobe found new markets. In addition to its Creative Cloud, where you'll find most of its older software, its star product is now its marketing software, called Adobe Experience Cloud, designed to help create, and measure, online and offline marketing efforts.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills The result has been what TV analyst Jim Cramer calls the &quot;golden age of creativity,&quot; with websites crushing brick-and-mortar retailers. This doesn't just help big retailers, but smaller ones like Rite Aid (NASDAQ:RAD), which is using Adobe to pull data from multiple sources and help pharmacists get treatments right with improved patient compliance.Along the way, Adobe has increasingly collided with Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) as both seek to become customers' Data Management Platform of choice for sales and marketing. So far there seems to be plenty of room for both. The losers are stores that don't use these new tools and vendors of older tools like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which are now being bypassed. Facing FutureHaving creative and marketing applications in the cloud not only improves Adobe's own time to market, it lets all its customers stay on top of the latest trends in Web marketing and the fight against fraud.When Adobe learns how to detect faces that have been edited online, all its customers can too. When its new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad software for artists, now called Fresco, is ready for launch, all its customers will get it at once.Narayen's key decision wasn't just to commit to cloud, but to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its Azure cloud. The two companies are increasingly connected, with seamless integration between Adobe's cloud and Microsoft Office applications.This will inevitably lead some to talk of a merger, but don't expect one. Microsoft has learned, from its antitrust experience 20 years ago, not to consume the markets it creates. Close partnerships give it the dominance it craves without the risk of government interference. The Bottom Line on Adobe StockThe rapid rise in Adobe stock has some technicians putting up stop signs on it, but options traders who bet on a move higher were big winners.As cloud applications become the norm, ADBE has a clear field ahead of it. The only thing keeping it off some analyst buy lists is its valuation, well over 10 times sales and 54 times earnings.But in a hot market you don't get a diamond by buying zirconium, and ADBE stock skeptics are falling in line.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-02,"Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best Stocks for 2019 contest. John Jagerson and Wade Hansen's pick for the contest is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).Since December 2018, we have been recommending Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a long position because its fundamentals are undervalued. ADBE's market position is dominant in its media products and the company has been steadily growing by adapting its Creative and document management solutions to mobile. We feel that these factors will protect the company from the emerging economic headwinds both in the U.S. and outside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom a technical perspective, ADBE has been able to outperform its benchmark indexes and most of its peers despite a choppy year for stocks so far. Now that we have another two quarters of data since we began recommending ADBE stock, it's time to revisit our analysis and see if we can still make the same judgement. Valuing ADBEWe believe that ADBE's ability to grow its profit margins has positioned it well in each of its three main segments: Digital Media, Digital Expertise and Publishing. The media segment includes their Creative products like Photoshop and their document services, which accounts for more than 70% of their revenue.The most recent quarterly report on June 18 showed Creative revenues were up by 22% on a year-over-year basis. The emphasis on services and subscriptions has increased ADBE's gross margin to 85% and net margins are at 23% over the same period. The company did suffer a little over the last two quarters due to adverse currency conversion rates, but to put it in perspective, from a margin standpoint, ADBE is outperforming Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); it's also just behind the most recent report from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate Besides the favorable comparison between ADBE and their peers, we believe the company's growth has not been fully priced into the stock. As you can see in the following chart, revenue and EPS have been rising with the stock's price, but its earnings multiple remains near historical lows. If we were to adjust the EPS line to use constant dollars, the trend of the P/E ratio and EPS would be even more impressive.  Click to EnlargeThe point behind a value-price comparison like this is to determine if investors are paying more, or less, for each dollar of earnings than they have in the past. Because growth is still strong, paying less for the stock now indicates the likely probability that the shares are still undervalued. Technical PositionLike the stock averages themselves, ADBE's share price drew down in April and May as traders worried about the impact of slowing economic growth and the trade war. Total revenue from the Europe Middle East Africa (EMEA) region was 27% in the most recent quarter and 15% was from Asia. Outside the US, economic performance and stock markets haven't recovered from the bear market of late-2018 to the extent the U.S. has, and we feel this has also dragged on ADBE's share price.However, ADBE's current technical breakout following their earnings report from an inverted &quot;head-and-shoulders&quot; pattern looks to be a strong bullish momentum signal. This stock tends to have reliable technical patterns which we have been commenting on in our previous recommendation updates including the double bottom in February, bullish diamond in April, and the double-bottom retest at the beginning of June.  Click to EnlargeIn the short term, a Fibonacci-based target of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern would indicate an upside target in the $313 per share range. Historically, patterns like this can play out very quickly, but 60-days is closer to the long-term average. A Few Issues to Watch for AdobeAs previously mentioned, a quarter of Adobe's sales come from Europe. Adobe may see its revenues softening, especially in document services if the European economy continues to weaken and the Brexit outlook gets worse due to new conservative leadership in the U.K. Adobe's continual investment in developing end-to-end document signing and processing puts it at the forefront of the global supply chain. However, recent trade wars could stall that income growth in the short term.The company has placed an emphasis on lower-end media solutions and document management that are focused on mobile users which should help insulate the company from some economic issues because these products are broadening their customer base. We believe the long-term impact of this focus will be similar to what happened when the company shifted to cloud-based services and will increase margin growth.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying As noted in ADBE's recent earnings release, a rising dollar was a negative for earnings. The Fed is hinting at a strong possibility of interest rate cuts in the short term, which could help weaken the dollar and improve performance. However, even with the Fed's potential cuts in July and December, the battle for a cheaper currency may be tough to win against the European Central Bank (ECB) which has promised to be ready with easing of its own if market conditions worsen in Europe. This is a systemic issue that will affect most large companies but is something to keep your eye on this summer.InvestorPlace advisors John Jagerson and S.

2019-07-02,"Editor's note: This column is part of our Best Stocks for 2019 contest. Jason Moser's pick for the contest is Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC).Teladoc looked like it was going to end the quarter in fourth or even fifth place. But after a rally that started last Wednesday, TDOC stock slid past Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) for a second-place finish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo how does TDOC look going forward? TDOC's First Quarter EarningsTeladoc's first quarter was a good one. Revenue of $128.6 million marked growth of 43% (23% organic) and total U.S. paid members are now at 26.7 million along with 10.2 million visit fee-only users. Total visits of 1,063,000 represented 29% organic growth.It's also worth noting that this represented the first quarter where the business crossed 1 million doctor's visits, and that was actually in spite of a weaker flu season. International visits grew from basically nothing a year ago to 282,000 this quarter.Gross margin was 65.3% versus 70% a year ago and as we've seen in previous quarters this investment in behavioral along with a more comprehensive offering. TDOC's balance sheet remains in good shape considering the deals the company has made recently with $479 million in cash and equivalents and $450 million debt. It's also worth noting that debt is in convertible notes that don't even come due until 2022 and 2025. Looking Ahead for TDOCThe business is still unprofitable but what else is new? Profitability will come in time and management reiterates that the company will be cash flow positive for the first time in 2019 so we'll hold them to that target.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate The CVS and Aetna relationships have never been stronger and we should expect some additional news regarding Teladoc and Aetna at some point in the near future as well.CEO Jason Gorevic likes this business because there are so many levers for growth. I tend to agree; healthcare is a phenomenally large global market opportunity.One final note, the CFO search is over as Mala Murthy has joined the Teladoc team. A seasoned vet, Murthy comes to the company from American Express so it's encouraging to see the team in a good place going forward.As of this writing, Jason Moser, a senior analyst with The Motley Fool, held shares of TDOC.

And under this context, consumer technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) should be worried. Recently, a developer for the open-source platform Linux accidentally revealed that Linux-based operating systems had greater presence in Microsoft's Azure cloud network than Microsoft-based OS'. Does this signal a dumping opportunity for Microsoft stock?Source: Shutterstock At first glance, the suddenly dominant presence of Linux may startle stakeholders of Microsoft stock. After all, Linux is a free and open-source collaboration, meaning that it's impossible to profit from its mere existence. Of course, that philosophy runs counter to Microsoft's legacy revenue channels, where it sold programs and updates to those programs.By all accounts, it was an extremely profitable venture. But this latest bit of Microsoft news demonstrates that we're no longer in the 20th century. And despite the optics, the Linux development is a long-term positive for MSFT stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer How so? Because MSFT is, when it comes to software-related ventures, moving firmly toward the Software as a Solution (SaaS) model. Not only that, but the rise of Linux helps shift the narrative to the concept that Microsoft stock will now trade on the fundamentals of service offerings, not standalone products.For management, it doesn't really matter that Linux is the go-to choice for Azure users. For one thing, there's the fact that Azure is cheaper to run on Linux than on any other platform. Even Microsoft benefited from Linux's streamlined and efficient architecture to power its Internet of Things (IoT) devices.In other words, MSFT stock wins as long as Microsoft is somehow involved in the process. Office 2019 Offers Insight Into &quot;New&quot; MSFT StockWhen Microsoft 2019 launched during last year's fall season, it perplexed many observers. By that time, the tech firm had decisively entered the SaaS arena, and for good reasons. Namely, SaaS makes perfect sense for MSFT stock on multiple levels.First, subscription-based models utilize an ongoing contractual relationship. While the subscriber has to pay constantly, they also have access to the SaaS entity's service umbrella. Thus, when the need for updates arise -- and that need perpetually exists -- the platform automatically refreshes with relevant features.Second, the subscription model can quickly convert prospective buyers due to their much cheaper initial cost outlay. Once subs are on board, companies have greater chances to convert them to higher-margin services. Such strategies have rejuvenated Microsoft stock in the past. They've also done wonders for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).So when MSFT launched Office 2019, the computing public viewed it as one of the strangest pieces of Microsoft news. Unlike Office 365, Office 2019 was not an SaaS platform. Instead, it was a one-shot offering for whom Microsoft termed &quot;customers who aren't ready for the cloud.&quot;Not ready for the cloud? This is the kind of language that, if you didn't understand the context, would cause panic on Microsoft stock. Thankfully, you just need to read between the lines to see what management is up to.And no, the leadership team haven't lost their minds. Simply, Microsoft Office 2019 is a way to soak up demand from those who aren't ready for SaaS; I'm thinking students or non-technical startups.But the real beauty of Office 2019 is its limitations. Using it makes customers wonder, what if? Microsoft readily answers that question with their suite of SaaS services. Granted, it's a long-winded approach to lift MSFT stock, but it works. Microsoft Isn't Microsoft, and That's Just Perfect!A decade ago, the old Microsoft would freak out that another competing OS is legitimately flexing its muscle. That iteration would probably fight fire with fire, leading to a series of bloated and bumbling systems.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Thankfully, we're living in the era of the upgraded MSFT. In this version, the company has realized tech's economies of scale, that open source can foster more utilitarian solutions. Better yet, new management has embraced this. Instead of fighting a losing battle, they're redirecting their efforts into their core strengths. That's a key difference between the Microsoft stock of old versus the one we see today.And what exactly are Microsoft's strengths? They are innovation and an unbeatable brand in PC-related software solutions. With these components, Microsoft assures itself relevancy despite losing dominance in certain market subsegments. Ultimately, that's why stakeholders can continue to trust MSFT stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-05,"Since Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) moved its applications to clouds and began selling them as a service early this decade, Adobe stock has been a rocket ship with seemingly unlimited fuel.Source: Marcin Wichary via FlickrOver the last five years alone it has risen 326%. If you bought it 10 years ago, near the bottom of the recession, your gains have been 819%. By comparison, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose Azure cloud hosts Adobe applications, is up &quot;only&quot; 480%.This is possible because of the economics of cloud, built on open source software and commodity hardware. The biggest benefits of open source go to the users, not the developers, and Adobe is a cloud user.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice  Adobe Stock Valuation ConcernsWith an opening July 3 price of $302, and a market cap of $146.3 billion, Adobe shares are in nosebleed territory. It's a place they've been before this decade, consolidating and then rushing higher on results.The latest results, delivered June 18, were once again above analyst expectations, with year over year growth of 25%. Adobe earned $632 million, $1.29 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $2.744 billion. Earnings beat elevated estimates by almost 3%.Shares rose 4.6% after the earnings beat and have kept rising since. Adobe now trades at a whopping 16 times last year's sales and 56 times last year's earnings.The time to be bullish, some say, is over. The marketing-based Experience Cloud carries lower margins than the Creative Cloud, which includes such products as Illustrator, Acrobat and Photoshop, the bears grumble, and it's growing fastest. Sweet Smell of SuccessMeanwhile, Adobe has broken ground on a second office tower in downtown San Jose, where it has long dominated the skyline. The new tower will serve 4,000 people, with 700,000 square feet on 18 floors. For San Jose, technically the Bay Area's largest city but long seen as a sleepy suburb until landing the new San Francisco 49'ers stadium, it's a very big deal.Adobe continues to break new ground on its software products, the latest innovation being a tool that can tell when the Face Liquify feature of its Photoshop has been used to enhance someone's face. As more-and-more fake photos and videos are released such security tools are becoming important. Spotting fakes provides a rich vein of future growth. Adobe has also released enhancements that let users erase background objects, so the definition of fake keeps shifting.For that reason, and Adobe's stellar track record this decade, there remain Adobe bulls.  Adobe is a disrupter, they say, and that's where you want to be in the current market. Analysts who pounded the table for the stock before earnings looked prescient when the numbers came out. As more marketers in more places gain the scale to afford subscriptions, they see it as wise to let their bets on Adobe ride. The Bottom Line on Adobe StockThe cloud decade shows no immediate signs of ending. But it does show signs of maturing.Whether Adobe can lead in the next phase of technology, as artificial intelligence mediated by cloud gets into devices you see every day, is uncertain. But the company has the scale and the talent to keep moving forward.Until the ground truly shifts under Adobe's feet, I'd let my investment here ride. But for a young investor looking for the returns Adobe has delivered over the last 10 years, it's time to look elsewhere.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-05,"These days, passive and index investing is all the rage. And there's a good reason for that, many active managers struggle to beat their benchmarks and produce market-beating returns. So, why bother then and pay the additional costs? But the truth is, there are places that active management can pay off. One such example could be among tech stocks.The technology sector continues to be a game of guessing and selecting the next big time. That often means the leaders of tomorrow are the mid- and small-cap tech stocks of today. Popular tech stocks indexes and exchanged-traded funds like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) are often top-heavy with the largest tech stocks around. There's nothing wrong with that. However, an active manager can find the best and most promising smaller stocks outside of the benchmark. Thereby, leading to higher returns.And the proof is in the pudding when you look deeper into key tech ETFs to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice There are several tech ETFs and mutual funds that have managed to crush their benchmarks and the broader technology indexes for years. For investors looking for higher returns in the tech sector, the following three funds are a great bet. T.Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund (PRSCX)Earning an average of 20% per year over the last ten years sounds too good to be true. But that's exactly what the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund (MUTF:PRSCX) has managed to do. PRSCX has managed to crush the S&P 500 by nearly 4% per year over that time. It has beaten the XLK as well. The secret is in the stock selection.Manager Ken Allen looks for tech stocks that have the potential for real earnings and revenue growth as well as those that are leading/growing their market share. This serves as an important hedge. Those companies, especially small tech stocks, that fall short of analyst expectations are often treated harshly by investors. But those that actually have the ability to keep churning out revenue and profit growth tend to keep on winning. As a result, PRSCX has been able to keep its returns consistent and high.As for those stocks themselves, the fund is able to not only bet here at home but overseas as well. Top holdings for the fund include U.S.-based Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and the Netherland's ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The idea is not to find growth stories, but actual growth stocks. The fund is concentrated as well -- with $5.5 billion in assets spread over just 43 different names. Allen is willing to trade them too. Turnover for the fund is a high 88%. So, this is not one to keep in a taxable account.Expenses for PRSCX clock in at 0.79% or $79 per $10,000 invested. That's a little high when compared to indexing. However, given the mega-sized excess returns for the fund, that expense ratio is a small price to pay. The minimum investment is $2,500. Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)One of the biggest trends in all of technology happens to be cloud computing. Being able to access software and apps on any device through the internet has completely changed how both consumers and enterprise customers function. And there's plenty of growth ahead as more firms take to the cloud. Which is why the Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (MUTF:FSCSX) could be a great active mutual fund to buy.As the name implies, FSCSX hones in on those stocks that provide software and services related to networking and data warehousing. These days, much of the fund's portfolio reads like a who's who of the top cloud computing players. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are just some examples of top holdings. And it turns out, this is a great place to be.As cloud computing has grown, so has FSCSX. Over the last ten years, the mutual fund has managed to produce a near-22% annual return. That handily beats the S&P 500 and its benchmark -- the MSCI U.S. IM Software & Services 25/50 Index. That return has allowed the fund to score a coveted five-star rating from Morningstar.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Expenses for the fund run at 0.72%. But perhaps the best part is that thanks to recent changes at Fidelity, FSCSX's minimum has been lowered to $0, with additional investments at $0 as well. This can allow even the smallest investors to get better than benchmark returns in the tech sector. Red Oak Technology Select (ROGSX)Active management wins when it is highly selected and concentrated. That's just what the Red Oak Technology Select (MUTF:ROGSX) does. Jim Oelschlager and his team at Oak Associates first look for the most attractive sub sectors of technology. Then they look for great long-term winners among these tech sectors by placing plenty of weight on the durability of the business and the company's valuation. Individual tech stocks competitive advantages and sustainability are also key when building their portfolio. Oelschlager and his team specifically don't look for the hot stories or fads. You won't find Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) here.The result is very few bets that are held for a long time. Currently, ROGSX only holds just 35 different tech stocks. Turnover for the fund is just 9%. This focus on durability, moat, and holding has paid off over the long haul.In terms of returns, ROGSX has managed to outperform its benchmark by about a percentage point over the last decade. This highlights the more long-term focus of the managers. In the shorter-term, ROGSX's returns have been a bit bumpy. So, this is definitely one that you'll want to buy and forget about for a while. Expenses for the mutual fund come in at 1.01%.All in all, for those investors looking for long-term -- potentially decades-long -- exposure to tech stocks, ROGSX could be a great mutual fund to buy.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and ServiceNow Inc., makers of cloud-based software, announced a partnership that will help ServiceNow sell to highly regulated industries and further integrate the companies’ technology. ServiceNow will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud to host workloads for the U.S. and Australian governments, the companies said Tuesday in a statement. The companies may allow other customers to run ServiceNow applications on Microsoft’s cloud, but didn’t specify when. This is the first time that ServiceNow has made its software available for use with a major public cloud-computing vendor.Microsoft will also sell ServiceNow applications, helpingServiceNow enter new segments and geographic markets. The agreement may bolster ServiceNow’s stated goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue. ServiceNow pitches itself as a “digital workflow company” that organizes the basics of business, such as setting up a help desk for IT operations or bringing on board new employees. Its decision to use Azure to run its software, instead of relying purely on in-house server farms, is key for Microsoft as it seeks more customers for its cloud infrastructure services. Market leader Amazon.com Inc. counts many of the biggest cloud-software application providers as clients, including Splunk Inc. and Okta Inc. “Microsoft was really best positioned as a broad strategic partner,” Lara Caimi, chief strategy officer of ServiceNow, said in an interview. “We were hearing from our customers that they wanted ServiceNow and Microsoft to work better together.”Microsoft will also use more ServiceNow software, adopting the company’s Information Technology & Employee Experience product “to improve operations, enhance employee experiences, and deliver stronger business outcomes,” according to the statement. For now, the software makers will integrate more capabilities from Microsoft's customer-relationship, accounting, and Office cloud applications with ServiceNow’s programs. The new deal with ServiceNow expands on a limited partnership the companies announced in October. Moving forward, ServiceNow will benefit from Microsoft’s security certifications as it pursues government contracts around the world. For Microsoft, the partnership will give the company another ally in the fast-growing cloud-applications space. The world’s largest software maker already partners with Adobe Inc. and SAP SE — companies that compete against a key Microsoft rival, Salesforce.com Inc. ServiceNow also goes toe-to-toe against Salesforce in help desk software, and Microsoft’s plan to sell ServiceNow products to customers fills a key gap in the Microsoft ecosystem. For its part, Salesforce has bought companies that are rivals of Microsoft, such as analytics company Tableau Software Inc. and Quip, which has a productivity suite.“It's a large vote of confidence in our platform,” said Gavriella Schuster, a Microsoft vice president.ServiceNow’s stock has gained 65% this year, closing at $293 on Monday in New York. Microsoft’s shares have jumped 35% this year to $136.96.  The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization.Microsoft and Santa Clara, California-based ServiceNow committed to collaborate on future solutions, and are currently hashing out some of the details. ServiceNow may join Microsoft’s Open Data Initiative, a pact with SAP and Adobe to use the same data model so mutual customers can move information among their various systems. To contact the authors of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netDina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Signs Broad Pact With ServiceNow, Extending Cloud Influence"

2019-07-15,"About a year ago, I coined the high-growth STARS acronym on InvestorPlace, saying that these five growth stocks -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and Square (NYSE:SQ) -- are the high quality, big return potential stocks that investors want to buy now and hold for the next several years.The idea behind the STARS acronym was simple. The market's favorite high-growth acronym -- FANG, which comprises Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- was becoming increasingly obsolete for investors. That's not to say that FANG companies have peaked. They haven't. They are still doing very well. But, they are such large companies and long FANG is such a crowded trade, that the long-term return potential in these names isn't what it used to be. It almost certainly isn't the best return potential investors can find in the overlap of growth and technology.STARS is exactly that. Each one of the STARS stocks is supported by huge secular growth trends, is small relative to their addressable markets, is unknown relative to the FANG stocks, and has huge upside potential in a multi-year window. That's why I told investors to forget FANG and buy the STARS stocks a year ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe results speak for themselves. Over the past year, the S&P 500 is up about 7.5%. Had you bought one share in each of the FANG stocks, you would be up just 5% over the past year. But, had you bought one share in each of the STARS stocks, you would be up more than 70% over the past year.   Click to EnlargeIn other words, STARS stocks have generated more than 60 points of alpha over both the S&P 500 and FANG stocks over the past twelve months.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy This out-performance from the STARS group will continue. Without further ado, let's take a deep look at why you should buy each one of these high-quality growth stocks. STARS Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shutterstock Trailing 12-Month (TTM) Gain: 90%The Bull Thesis Tag Line: &quot;The Next Big Thing in Commerce&quot;Core Bull Thesis: The secular bull thesis on e-commerce solutions provider Shopify is simple. Thanks to the widespread proliferation of the internet, the commerce world is two doing things: One, it's pivoting into direct retail, wherein brands and merchants are selling to and communicating with customers. Two, it's also pivoting into a decentralized model, wherein anyone can sell anything to anyone else.Shopify is at the heart of both these pivots, providing the tools which allow any seller to sell any item through any direct channel, and is thus levered to benefit from the expansion of these two huge secular tailwinds.These tailwinds are still in their early innings. Shopify's gross merchandise value represents less than 1.5% of global e-retail sales, and is growing at a steady 50%-plus pace. Further, Shopify just started to jump into the physical retail world, dramatically expanding this company's addressable market.As such, SHOP has the necessary room and firepower to keep growing at a robust rate for a lot longer.Key Growth Projections:  * Shopify goes from 1.5% e-retail market penetration today, to 7.5% penetration by 2030, as direct decentralized retail trends gain mainstream traction.  * Shopify goes from about 0% physical retail market penetration today, to about 0.5% penetration by 2030, as Shopify finds some success in the physical retail world.  * Total gross merchandise volume (GMV) and Merchant Solutions revenue grow at about 30% annualized pace into 2030.  * Subscription Solutions revenue grows at a high teens annualized pace, as Shopify continues to grow its merchant base.  * Total revenue grows at a 25%-plus pace over the next decade.  * Operating margins scale from 1% today, to 25% by 2030, as robust revenue growth drives significant operating leverage on already huge gross margins.  * 2030 EPS settles around $25, versus projected EPS in 2019 of $0.60.Long-term Price Target: About $750, based on a commerce platform average 30-forward multiple on projected fiscal 2030 EPS of $25.Present Value: About $300, based on a 10% discount rate and a 2029 price target of $750. The Trade Desk (TTD)TTM Gain: 160%The Bull Thesis Tag Line: &quot;The Future of Advertising&quot;Core Bull Thesis: The secular bull thesis on The Trade Desk centers around something called programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising is essentially automation in the ad industry. Before, ad spend allocation was largely a guess-and-check effort, while ad transactions were conducted between two human parties. Programmatic advertising automates both of those processes, leveraging AI and big data to optimize ad spend allocation and dynamically transact ads based on those optimal allocations. In this sense, programmatic advertising is the future of advertising.The Trade Desk is one of the most important players in the programmatic advertising world, and one of the fastest growing, too. But, ad spend through the TTD platform measures less than 1% of the near $300 billion global digital ad market. That market is rapidly marching towards $500 billion-plus levels. Eventually, most of that $500 billion-plus worth of spend will be transacted programmatically, and the lion's share of that programmatic spend will happen through TTD.As such, The Trade Desk has huge growth potential over the next several years through automation in the ad world, and if all that growth potential materializes as expected, TTD stock will fly higher from here.Key Growth Projections:  * The global advertising market measures around $1 trillion by 2025, up from $650 billion-plus this year.  * The digital ad market grows to around $650 billion by 2025, representing 65% share versus 45% share in 2018, as engagement and ad dollars continue to flow into the digital channel.  * TTD grows its share in the digital ad market from less than 1% in 2018, to 2-2.5% by 2025, as programmatic advertising becomes more widely used across various ad formats and channels.  * Gross spend on TTD and revenues grow at a 25%-plus pace into 2025.  * Profit margins gradually move higher as robust revenue growth drives positive operating leverage on healthy gross margins.  * 2025 EPS comes in around $15, versus 2019 estimates of $2.90.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Long Term Price Target: About $375, based on a digital ad average 25-forward multiple on projected 2025 EPS of $15.Present Value: About $230, based on a 10% discount rate and a 2024 price target of 375. Adobe (ADBE)TTM Gain: 20%The Bull Thesis Tag Line: &quot;The Cloud Giant in a Visually Dominated World&quot;Core Bull Thesis: The secular bull thesis on cloud giant Adobe is predicated on two very simple ideas: First, the world is becoming increasingly obsessed with visuals. Consumers are increasingly engaged in visual-first social media apps, like Instagram and Snapchat. They are also spending more time on visual-content-heavy streaming platforms like Netflix. At the same time, businesses are increasingly using visuals to communicate with their customers, since these forms of communication are what resonates most deeply with today's consumer. Thus, both consumers and enterprises are shifting to a more visually-focused world.Second, Adobe is the unrivaled king in delivering visual solutions. Sure, there are a ton of Adobe competitors out there, but none really rival Adobe. They are all just knock-offs. Long story short, Adobe dominates the visual-focused industry, and when it comes to creating visuals on both the consumer side (e.g. editing a photo for Instagram) and the enterprise side (e.g. creating a visually aesthetic ad campaign), everyone turns to Adobe solutions.Put those two ideas together, and it becomes increasingly obvious that Adobe has plenty of room to grow over the next several years as both consumers and enterprises increasingly adopt visual-focused cloud solutions.Key Growth Projections:  * Adobe's Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud businesses continue to grow at a robust pace over the next several years given digital and visual related tailwinds, and ultimately power about 15% annualized revenue growth into 2025.  * Gross margins expand gradually towards 90% as Adobe benefits from steady but small price hikes given lack of competition.  * Operating margins expand towards 50% as 15% revenue growth drives healthy operating leverage on huge gross margins.  * EPS settles around $23 by fiscal 2025.Long Term Price Target: About $460, based on a growth average 20 forward multiple on projected fiscal 2025 EPS of $23.Present Value: About $290, based on a 10% discount rate and a fiscal 204 price target of $460. Roku (ROKU)Source: Shutterstock TTM Gain: 111%The Bull Thesis Tag Line: &quot;The Cable Box of the Streaming World&quot;Core Bull Thesis: When I first created the STARS acronym, the most controversial stock on the list was Roku, given what many perceived as huge competition risks. But, ROKU stock is up 111% over the past year as the company's secular bull thesis has drowned out competition risks.The core bull thesis here is that Roku is becoming the central access point (or &quot;cable box&quot;) of the streaming world -- a platform which consumers everywhere rely on to access their favorite streaming services like Netflix, HBO, Amazon Video, and the like.A year ago, there were concerns that Roku couldn't maintain this &quot;cable box of the streaming world&quot; positioning because bigger competitors would come in and gobble up its customer base. But, those concerns missed three big things: 1) Roku is content-neutral, it's competitors aren't, and this content neutrality ultimately makes for a more friction-less viewing experience; 2) Roku is already the runaway leader in this space, and consumers like the intuitive Roku UI; and 3) the streaming space will big enough to accommodate more than one service platform aggregator.As such, Roku has done nothing but rattle off big-growth quarter after big-growth quarter over the past year, and ROKU stock has more than doubled in the process. The streaming market globally is still relatively nascent, and ad dollars are just now starting to follow consumers into the streaming channel, so Roku's long-term growth narrative is in its first few innings. Over the next several years, the company will continue to rattle off big-growth quarters and ROKU stock will trend higher.Key Growth Projections:  * The global streaming-video-on-demand (SVOD) market grows from roughly 300 million households today (25% TV household penetration), to around 600 million households by 2025 (35% TV household penetration, assuming mild global TV household growth).  * Roku's platform goes from about 30 million accounts in 2018 (about 10% market share) to about 100 million by 2025 (about 17.5% share).  * Average revenue per user rises at roughly 15% per year into 2025, as unit SVOD revenue moves higher due to higher streaming service prices and more streaming service subscriptions per account, and AVOD revenue moves higher from a higher inflow of ad dollar volume.  * Total revenues rise at a 25%-plus pace into 2025.  * Platform gross margins scale towards 70%, while player gross margins stay around 5%.  * The opex rate drops to 40% as robust revenue growth drives significant operating leverage.  * EPS settles around $5.50 by 2025.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Long Term Price Target: About $165, based on a big growth 30-forward multiple on projected fiscal 2025 EPS of $5.50.Present Value: About $100, based on a 10% discount rate and a projected 2024 price target of $165. Square (SQ)Source: Shutterstock TTM Gain: 22%The Bull Thesis Tag Line: &quot;The Backbone of Modern Commerce&quot;Core Bull Thesis: The secular bull thesis on Square is based on the idea that Square is transforming into the backbone of the the modern commerce world by creating a payments ecosystem tailored to 21st century consumption and retail habits.Consumers globally are pivoting away from cash transactions towards non-cash transactions, because non-cash transactions are significantly more convenient and more levered to digital shopping. As such, global non-cash transaction volume has risen at a steady 10%-plus clip for the past several years.Over the next several years, non-cash payments volume is expected to run at a 10%-plus pace, driven by heavier card usage in developed economies and broader urbanization and digitization in developing economies.Square has built a payments platform which helps merchants of all shapes and sizes process these non-cash transactions. On top of that, the company has developed a myriad of tangential solutions - such as a digital peer-to-peer payments app, an enterprise payroll app, and lending services - all of which are tailored to the consumption and retailing habits of the 21st century.Square is developing a payments ecosystem which is built for modern commerce. Yet, the platform still only accounts for 0.35% of all global retail sales. As such, the trends and addressable market here imply that Square has a lot of room and firepower to grow over the next several years.Key Growth Projections:  * Global retail sales grow at a 5% compounded annual growth rate into 2025 to nearly $34 billion, due to inflation and global urbanization trends.  * Square's market share of the global retail sales pool rises from 0.35% in 2018, to 1% by 2025, as the company expands its reach in the physical retail world from micro-merchants to bigger merchants, and as the company takes a deeper dive into the e-commerce world.  * Square GPV grows at a 20%-plus annualized pace into 2025, while revenues grow at at 25%-plus annualized pace, driven by incremental revenue from hardware and ancillary solutions.  * Profit margins move steadily higher over the next several years as increased scale drives positive operating leverage.  * EPS settles around $4.50 by fiscal 2025.Long Term Price Target: About $135, based on a payments stock average 30-forward multiple on fiscal 2025 EPS of $4.50.Present Value: About $85, based on a 10% discount rate and a fiscal 2024 price target of $135.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, SHOP, TTD, ADBE, ROKU, and SQ.

2019-07-18,"Legacy software providers have been looking for ways to compete with the leading CRM cloud-based software provider, Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM). One idea to slow down CRM’s rapid growth was to send all the data collected from their various products to a single location where additional analysis could be performed. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) and SAP AG (SAP) announced their joint participation in the Open Data Initiative this September. This collaboration comes as cloud-based software becomes more prevalent, which can make it harder to gain actionable insights from data when information is stored in various disparate systems. “You have these very sophisticated, rich application suites from SAP, from Adobe, from Microsoft. And the commitment you’re hearing from the three of us is that we’re going to unlock the data across all of these suites,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. While analysts believe this initiative represents a promising opportunity for these companies, we wanted to take a closer look to see if they really have what it takes to compete with Salesforce.  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)With a market cap of $1 trillion, it’s no question that Microsoft is still a force to be reckoned with.  The company has maintained its place as a leader in the software market with both its legacy and cloud-based solutions. CRM has been mirroring Microsoft by tailoring its products to run alongside its customers’ existing software, something MSFT has already been doing for quite some time. Salesforce recently acquired MuleSoft, Inc. and Tableau Software, Inc. (DATA), both of which have software offerings that run with pre-existing on-premises systems.  CRM’s Sales Cloud has also consistently outperformed MSFT’s cloud-based sales product, Dynamics 365&#92;. The aggregated data from this project will be used to improve Dynamics 365 as well as its Azure product.    Ahead of today’s Q4 2019 earnings release, share prices are up 34% year-to-date with management saying it’s only going to get better. Q4 fiscal revenue is expected to reach $33 billion, representing a 9% increase. Expected EPS is $1.21 which would be a 7% jump. Most importantly, management is projecting $9.6 billion in revenue to be generated from its Intelligent Cloud. Oppenheimer analyst, Timothy Horan mirrored that sentiment today stating, “We expect a strong quarter from Microsoft as it is seeing momentum in its cloud-based business, which now represents a third of revenues and is growing 35% year-over-year.” The five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating and $145 price target. He has a 79% success rating and 17% average return per rating. Another analyst, Brent Bracelin, kept his Buy rating and $143 price target on MSFT yesterday. “We expect another solid quarter with revenue increasing 9% year-over-year to $32.8 billion, driven by strong commercial cloud tailwinds that could elevate the cloud revenue mix to 33% vs 5% in FY15,” he said. The analyst has an average return per rating of 31% and a 77% success rate. The stock boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and $147 average price target, suggesting 8% upside potential.       Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)In terms of delivering best in class visual solutions for both the consumer and enterprise sides, nobody does it quite as well as Adobe. Its cloud-based products are growing rapidly. The company’s Document Cloud, Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud are expected to reach 15% annualized revenue growth into fiscal 2025. If the initiative proves successful, this growth could accelerate at an even faster pace. In addition to its cloud-based software, ADBE created a software system, Experience Platform, to compete directly with CRM. It will unify business applications, and connect them with new apps from third-party developers and its customers’ other programs. ADBE had a strong second quarter, with revenue reaching over $5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS increased by 10% year-over-year from $3.21 to $3.54. While the stock’s valuation is on the high side, trading at 53.9 times trailing twelve month earnings, analysts believe Adobe can sustain its profit growth.Yesterday, analyst Jennifer Lowe said, “The company's profit growth should support the current enterprise value to expected 2020 earnings multiple of 31-times, and we expect Adobe shares to continue moving higher.” She maintained her Buy rating and $330 price target, suggesting upside potential of 7%. Lowe has a success rate of 69% and a 15% average return per rating. Another top analyst, Joseph Bonner, agrees that more growth is coming. “The company is well positioned at the center of the exploding market for digital video content with a unique asset collection in its Creative Cloud digital content portfolio. We see Adobe continuing to accelerate organic product refreshes and new rollouts as well as partnering with industry leaders to drive further growth,” he said. He kept his Buy rating and $320 price target on June 20.  The Street has high hopes for ADBE. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and average price target of $319, suggesting 3% upside potential.  SAP AG (SAP)In the past, the German software company has struggled to keep up with the other big names on this list. However, it has made a significant effort to redefine the CRM market. SAP believes it can take market share from Salesforce with its portfolio of SaaS applications including broad sets of apps for HCM, ERP and CRM.However, the situation didn't appear to be improving after the company released disappointing Q2 2019 earnings results today. Management said that investors should not expect big margin gains until 2020, with the company reporting a decline in operating profit of 21%. While support and software license revenues fell flat from last year at €3.8 billion, cloud revenue was up 35% to €1.7 billion. In its full year guidance, management stated that they believe adjusted operating profit will grow by 9.5% to 12.5%. They are committed to reaching their goal of margin expansion by 5 percentage points through 2023.  CEO, Bill McDermott, believes that operational performance is on track with 4-point expansion in gross margins for the cloud business. “As shown by our rising cloud gross margins, we are progressing nicely on our ambition to be the Best-Run SAP. With XM driving the CEO digital transformation agenda, we resolutely reaffirm our full year guidance,” he said.  Financial blogger, Gary Alexander said, “SAP remains one of the true value names among large-cap software stocks. Overall, SAP's cloud business continues to add recurring billings as it grows both organically and through M&A, while margins and cash flow are trending upward.”Brian Schwartz, an Oppenheimer analyst with a 79% success rate and a 30% average return per rating, reiterated his Buy rating and $141 price target last month. His price target reflects his confidence in the company’s ability to rebound as well as his belief that share prices could rise by as much as 11% in the next twelve months. The Street has mixed feelings about the last stock on the list. SAP has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and $138 average price target, suggesting 8% upside.",3 Software Stocks Inching Closer to Salesforce

2019-07-19,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) proved itself as King of the Cloud with earnings that surprised Wall Street.Source: Shutterstock Non-GAAP net income of $10.6 billion, $1.37 per share, on revenue of $33.7 billion, blew past analyst earnings estimates of $1.18 per share.After looking more deeply into the numbers, Windows got credit for the surprise. Microsoft is ending support for disk-based Windows 7 and thus pushed a lot of companies to the cloud-based Windows 10. Windows OEM revenue was up 18% year over year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Microsoft was already the most valuable company in the world before the earnings came out, at $1.045 trillion. The earnings bumped it up another 3%. It was due to open July 19 at over $140 per share. Those who hedged their bets in Microsoft going into earnings wound up looking foolish. MSFT Cloud PowerHow did Microsoft overtake Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which had nearly a decade-long head start, in cloud revenue and profitability?While Amazon was re-selling its infrastructure, Microsoft devoted itself to building a cloud platform and to use cloud to sell its software. It didn't give cloud away. It sold what cloud could do, directly and indirectly.The morning before the earnings came out, for example, Office 365 users were offered three months of free Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) &quot;Creative Cloud&quot; membership, the e-mail promising &quot;more ways to say thanks for subscribing in the works.&quot;Adobe and Microsoft have been partnering since 2016, their combined efforts aimed at building &quot;a new category&quot; of software combining Microsoft's back-office tools with Adobe's marketing cloud. Its competitive target is Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM).It's a game where so far there are no losers. Since the Microsoft-Adobe effort was launched in September 2016, MSFT shares have risen nearly 140%, Adobe's 185%. Salesforce is up 121%. The average S&P stock is up less than 40% in that time.Increased marketing automation, which lets companies combine online and offline efforts without increasing staff, is powering the whole economy. Don't Break Me UpAzure, which Microsoft calls its &quot;intelligent cloud&quot; segment, now brings in more revenue than the former Microsoft Windows monopoly, or the old Microsoft Office. It grew 64% in Microsoft's 2019 fiscal year. Microsoft executives call their cloud &quot;battle hardened&quot; and it continues to win deals.An example is a recent $2 billion contract with AT&T (NYSE:T).  AT&T spun this outsourcing as making its own operations more technologically-adept. Maybe it does.More good news could be coming soon, as President Donald Trump leans-in to make Microsoft the favorite over Amazon on the $10 billion JEDI contract to create a Pentagon Cloud.Microsoft is selling the concept of &quot;citizen developers&quot; for its Power Platform, which includes data visualization, workflow automation, and app creation tools.  Critics say using a proprietary platform to build apps makes companies dependent on that platform, but that's an argument for another day. Today, Microsoft profits and customers become more efficient. The Bottom Line for MSFT StockMicrosoft's success in tying cloud customers to its software is working like nothing else in the history of American business. It even sells Surface laptops. Cloud success gives Microsoft the cash to work on whiz-bang applications like &quot;holoportation,&quot; in which executives can beam a hologram of themselves over a network and do a sales presentation in another language, all in real time.It's a little bit crazy, but who thought five years ago that an Indian immigrant would make investors forget Bill Gates while keeping the antitrust police quiet?In the era of cloud, a hundred million miracles are happening every day.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-22,"Many investors still don't understand what a cloud even is, let alone a cloud computing stock. Clouds are networks of hyper-scale data centers, built with commodity hardware and open-source software, that enable the creation of scaled, global services delivered over the internet. Still, figuring out which cloud computing stocks to buy requires a big-picture look at the top companies.I divide cloud stocks into three types:* Cloud Czars, the owners of the biggest data centers, which now dominate the global economy.* Cloud Service Companies, which these clouds (and other, smaller ones) to deliver scaled services to consumers and businesses, selling them by subscription.* Cloud Retinue, companies that serve the cloud with products or services essential to maintaining the resource.During most of 2018, it was the Czars that dominated the market, but most have had a lousy second half of the year. You know them well by now -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Among these five companies are $3.5 trillion in market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's the problem with the Czars. People fear them. Politicians want them broken up, or at a minimum they want them bound by expensive regulations, and this will continue to hurt the stocks.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio Cloud service companies use cloud connectivity provided by another company in their business model. Think Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Salesforce.com (NASDAQ:CRM). They may serve either businesses or consumers. They use the economics of the cloud to reach global markets, replacing products like DVD players or corporate data centers. The best offer applications that were previously unimaginable.The cloud retinue is a term I created for this story. These are the suppliers of hardware, software and services to both the Cloud Czars and big customers now adapting to the reality of the cloud. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is part of the cloud retinue. So is Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DVMT). Cloud retinue companies may also serve other markets, but it's largely the cloud they're pointing to for the future, which is what makes them the top cloud computing stocks to buy.Beyond these obvious choices, the cloud retinue includes data centers that connect clouds to one another and companies that deliver essential software as a service to both the public clouds of the Czars and the thousands of private clouds now replacing corporate data centers.The retinue may offer the best gains of any group in 2019 because they can fly under the radar of casual investors while delivering fat returns.In this gallery, you'll find examples of all three types of cloud computing stocks. It's not an exclusive list by any means, and it may also become very misunderstood because everyone in 2019 will want to call themselves a cloud play. Adobe Systems (ADBE)By the standards of technology companies, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is ancient, having been founded back in 1982, when I still had a full-time job, making it one of the oldest cloud computing stocks to buy.What made Adobe one of the cloud service stocks to buy was a decision by CEO Shantanu Narayen, early in this decade, to move the company's operations entirely to the cloud. Popular tools like Adobe Photoshop became part of the company's Creative Cloud.What sent Adobe stock into overdrive was its marketing cloud, used by sales teams, and its experience cloud, used to design Web sites and direct people through them, based on data. These are essential tools if you want to compete with a giant online store such as Amazon, or even just stay in the game against it.Adobe shares were up 26% for the year and had been up over 50% until tech wrecked in October. Adobe's success is no secret, so the stock is pricey, selling for nearly 15 times its 2017 sales of $7.3 billion, and 49 times earnings.Adobe may come under pressure in 2019 as the market turns toward value and away from growth but consider this. While the company's revenue has been growing at 25% per year, net income has been growing at 45% per year. Amazon.com (AMZN)What keeps Amazon on the buy list for 2019 is partly the spectacular drop, starting in October 2018, that shaved over 20% off the stock's price, and partly its incredible prospects as it keeps finding new businesses to dominate.Source: Shutterstock For people who are under 30 and want to own an index fund, Amazon is one of the most compelling cloud computing stocks to buy for long-term gains.We think of Amazon as a retailer, but it's Amazon Web Services that is its secret sauce and makes this one of the best cloud computing stocks to buy. Amazon was the first to re-sell its cloud. It still dominates the market for cloud infrastructure, and the businesses using that infrastructure, like Netflix, continue to grow like weeds.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Some bearishness has crept into Amazon due to its enormous power and struggling HQ2 process, leading many to call for breaking it up. But you can't. Hundreds of thousands of small merchants depend on Amazon's fulfillment services to compete with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which remains more than twice as large as Amazon. These merchants would rise as an army if any serious move were made against it.Amazon can now depend on getting about $12 billion per year from doing nothing. That's what its $119/year Amazon Prime offering of free shipping brings in before it ships a single order or downloads a single movie, and while Amazon does offer free Prime content, it also re-sells others' movies and streaming services, including Netflix. Amazon's tentacles are now reaching around the world, to Asia, Europe and beyond.What makes Amazon more exciting for 2019 are the rise of new services. Some of them were inspired by its Chinese doppelganger Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) -- its growing move into finance -- while others came from more prosaic concerns like healthcare.Its purchase of Pillpack in 2018 makes it a pharmacy, and its joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) could quickly make it one of the nation's largest health insurers -- the three companies have over 1 million employees between them. Cloudera (CLDR)With the acquisition of Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) by IBM (NYSE:IBM) expected to close in 2019, Cloudera (NASDAQ:CLDR) becomes the closest to a pure-play open source company on the U.S. stock market. It is a key member of the Cloud Retinue, the companies serving clouds with hardware, software and services.Source: Shutterstock Cloudera was formed around Hadoop, a data analysis system created in the last decade by a team under data scientist Doug Cutting. Cloudera struggled early in this decade because support doesn't sell when customers have more people working on your software than you do.Cloudera is finally gaining traction by selling its software as a service for machine learning and data analysis. It can analyze data sets exceeding 50 Petabytes in size -- that's 1 million gigabytes. The company is also buying its largest competitor in the Hadoop space, Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP).Between them, Cloudera and Hortonworks had revenue of over $600 million last year, and a combined market cap of about $3.1 billion. The companies should do a combined $800 million in business during 2018, so the price to sales ratio looks like a bargain.They're cheap because neither partner in the merger is yet profitable, but their combined size could make them a tasty morsel for a larger cloud company in 2019, like Dell Technologies, IBM or even Microsoft. Equinix (EQIX)Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a data center REIT. That means it runs data centers, used by the Czars to connect their clouds, and by many enterprises to house their private clouds. It is organized as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), just like those owning commercial real estate or hotels, and is thus structured to send most of its profits back to shareholders in the form of dividends.Source: Shutterstock Over the last year, that meant $9.12 of dividends were paid for each Equinix share. The dividends have grown nearly 50% over the last five years, while the stock's value has risen 141%, to a market cap of $31.2 billion.For the cautious cloud investor, a data center REIT is a great place to play for 2019, because the business is still growing and you're getting maximum dividends. Equinix competes with such companies as CoreSite Realty (NYSE:COR), CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE) and Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), most of which were built on a real estate platform rather than a tech platform.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now In addition to handling connections between clouds, data centers like Equinix also host cloud equipment, expanding tits geographic footprint.Equinix was founded in 1999 as a &quot;co-location center,&quot; a neutral site where companies like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) might park computing equipment and connect it with private clients on its network. It didn't take the REIT form until 2015. In May 2017 Equinix completed the purchase of Verizon's data centers. FireEye (FEYE)FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) lives in one of the hottest and fastest-changing cloud niches -- security. It competes with such companies as Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR), as well as more established networking players like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and traditional security outfits like Checkpoint Software (NASDAQ:CHKP).Source: David via Flickr (Modified)FireEye is considered a &quot;next generation firewall&quot; company, selling its FireEye Cloud Security as a service to governments, corporations and other large enterprises. In addition to offering firewall services and corporate identity protection, the company also investigates threats. It is among the fastest-growing computer security companies.While other sectors of the cloud computing market fell hard in October, computer security companies like FEYE remained strong. Its market cap of $3.5 billion buys you over $800 million in 2018 revenue, but as with many other companies in the space, it must invest continuously to stay competitive and only became profitable in the third quarter of 2018, earning six cents per share.FEYE has over $1 billion in cash and short-term securities on its books, enough to pay off its long-term debt with room to spare. It consistently has been cash-flow positive. There are no guarantees in this part of the market, but FireEye has gained a solid foothold as one of the better cloud computing stocks to buy. With a market cap of just $3.5 billion, it could also become a takeover candidate. Intuit (INTU)Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), like Adobe, began life selling packaged software for PCs, but now sells that software mainly by subscription. The ongoing connections with customers have also brought it into other areas of finance, like Quicken Loans, which was spun out in 2002.Source: Mike Mozart via Wikimedia (Modified)Given the fact that taxes and accounting are its main business, Intuit revenues retain some seasonality, with almost half its sales coming in its quarter ending in April. For its 2018 fiscal year, which ended in July, this meant revenue of $5.96 billion, of which $1.21 billion flowed to the net income line. Its market cap is over $51 billion.Intuit's move toward the cloud remains a work in progress, but its strength in the accounting niche has let it move at the pace of its customers, many of them small businesses and householders who aren't computer savvy.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip The fastest-growing part of the business is Mint, an online financial services operation first launched in 2006. Mint is used for budgeting and offers Intuit the opportunity to partner with other financial service companies, including wealth management companies. Integration with these companies, meant to make forms easier to complete, help Intuit expand its niche.The move into the cloud has delivered shareholders a gain of 177% in their shares over the last five years and delivered a steady stream of dividends that have also doubled in that time. Intuit's size and its middle-class niche could make it a great acquisition for a bank or a Cloud Czar, but meanwhile, among the top cloud computing stocks to buy, it's a good defensive play because taxes are one of the two inevitabilities of life. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has become the strongest and least controversial of the Cloud Czars because its Azure cloud is mainly used to sell and develop software. Still it is easy to see why this is one of the safest cloud computing stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock Microsoft is best known for its Windows operating system and Office applications. Both are now updated exclusively online, but it also delivers software through Azure for hundreds of other companies. In the process of building Azure, Microsoft has also buried the hatchet with the open-source movement. Among its 2018 acquisitions was GitHub, the largest open-source repository.Microsoft was late to becoming a Cloud Czar, having committed to the platform only in 2014 upon naming Satya Nadella its CEO. Since then it has built a network that will soon cover every continent, including Africa. This means it has increased its capital budget to over $13 billion in 2018, from $8.9 billion just two years ago.Microsoft has become a growth company again. Revenue has been growing north of 12% for the last three years. Now that it appears to have permanently crossed the trillion market gap mark, if I could own only one Cloud Czar, it would be Microsoft.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-25,"Many eyes will turn to Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock as the Ontario-based software company releases its quarterly report on August 1st before the bell.Source: Shutterstock Shopify stock has seen a massive surge higher as the equity came off of its December lows. Still, with valuations at elevated levels and a growing threat of competition, investors face serious risks buying this company before the report. SHOP Likely to Report Earnings Beat, GrowthWall Street forecasts second-quarter earnings of three cents per share. This would come in 50% higher than the two cents per share posted in the same quarter last year. Analysts also predict revenues of $350.46 million. If the company meets estimates, revenues will have grown by 43.1% from year-ago levels when SHOP reported $244.96 million in revenue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Still, SHOP stock has beaten earnings estimates over the last four quarters. Hence, investors can probably expect more than three cents per share in earnings. Investors should also note that SHOP has risen by more than 180% since its December lows alone. Massive Growth, Leadership Keep SHOP Stock HighThis is why I stated in a recent article that SHOP stock had come &quot;too far, too fast,&quot; and it would struggle to move higher. Since that time, the stock has risen by about 10%. With the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of over 355, it becomes difficult to predict. The quarterly report could just as easily push the spike to a new record high as it could lead to a swoon.SHOP stock has likely risen so much because it is the &quot;anti-Amazon.&quot; It enables small businesses to reach the world through e-commerce without the involvement of an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), or other large e-commerce platforms.As our own Luke Lango stated, the global e-commerce market registered about $2.8 trillion in sales last year. About $41 billion sold on Shopify platforms, which comes to approximately 1.5%. Mr. Lango believes that it can rise to 2% this year. Analysts also predict global e-commerce sales will reach $4.9 trillion by the end of 2021. Little wonder that analysts forecast 56.79% average annual profit growth for SHOP stock over the next five years. SHOP Has Become UnpredictableAt that rate, Shopify stock might trade higher than current levels ten years from now. The question is, what it will do in the meantime? While 56.79% annual growth is impressive by any measure, does it justify paying over 355 times forward earnings?Moreover, businesses have other choices besides Shopify for independent e-commerce platforms. Due to my writing, I frequently come in contact with WordPress developers. When these developers create a retailing site, they speak only of WooCommerce, never mentioning Shopify.Numerous other small firms, as well as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), also compete in this industry. Further, thanks to its purchase of Magento, SHOP has attracted competition from a better-established software company, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).In fairness, anecdotal evidence shows that Shopify continues to outperform Magento in the marketplace. In the same way Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock has flown high by staying ahead of its competition, SHOP stock could continue to outperform. However, Netflix has also fallen back due to the competitive threat of Disney (NYSE:DIS). In much the same way, a strong peer could end the run in Shopify stock. Should Investors Buy Before Earnings?At current price levels, the risks do not justify buying SHOP stock. Without question, those who have owned SHOP stock since December or before have seen massive returns. Also, despite the 355-plus forward PE ratio, the stock could continue its march higher.However, I would avoid buying into earnings. At current levels, the financials price SHOP stock for perfection. Even a good quarterly report could cause SHOP to plunge if Wall Street expected a great report.Shopify stock is a long-term winner. I think at some point, it will trade above current levels. Still, for now, more can go wrong then right with SHOP stock, and buying into earnings has become a gamble.How lucky do you feel?As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-29,"With a &quot;Tariff Man&quot; in office, investors have been buffeted by volatility and uncertainty. Where will President Donald Trump's tariffs land next? Sure, Mexico is off the list for now - but it's clear that Trump favors the use of tariffs for more than just trade imbalances, which means anywhere on the map (including countries we've reached agreements with) is fair game for future trade wars.Which means it's important to consider stock picks not just based on the current tariff situation, but on the possibility that Europe, Mexico and other regions could become more problematic in the future.Finding insulation from the tariff effect is trickier than it sounds. For instance, most publicly traded casual dining restaurants operate most of their restaurants in the U.S. Thus, catering to primarily American consumers insulates them, right? Unfortunately, no. A University of California at Davis study shows 43% of fruit and vegetables - everything from strawberries and watermelons to avocados and onions - come from Mexico.Autos? More than 1,000 Chinese companies export parts to the U.S.; some U.S. firms already are switching their suppliers. Apparel? A lot of that textile work in China is going to, um, come out in the wash. Even utilities are tricky. Sure, their customers are almost entirely domestic. But many are converting to wind and solar power, and while those natural resources are American, many of the solar panels and wind turbines are not.Tariffs have far more impact than just the products themselves, too. The U.S. has slid from the fifth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists to 10th, thus losing some share of the estimated $315 billion they spend overseas. When considering the trade war, the warnings were about industrial companies and semiconductor firms. Few were thinking about the lodging industry.Here, then, are five stock picks with trade war safety in mind. They come from a handful of disparate industries that provide more insulation from current and future trade salvos than most.

2019-07-29,"With stocks continuing to court record highs and a dovish Federal Reserve meeting expected on the horizon, the backdrop continues to favor a bullish bias. In today's gallery, we're going to offer up three breakout stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock They all boast several attractive technical characteristics.First and foremost is the price trend, which is zooming to the moon. Second is relative strength with market-beating returns so far this year … third is a recent basing pattern that provides low-risk entries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTogether, these factors combine to present some exciting trading opportunities for the week ahead. As usual, we'll offer up specific trade ideas for each pattern.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold Let's take a closer look at three stocks to buy. Adobe (ADBE)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The long-term trend of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) belongs in a class of its own. It's up ten-fold since 2012, and short of one hiccup in the fourth quarter 2018, it has seen virtually zero giveback along the way. To deliver such gains over seven years is inspiring. But to do it with almost no corrections or nasty volatility along the way?It's the ultimate gift from the market gods.There's no doubt Adobe has been one of the best stocks to buy of this bull market. During this year's ascent, we've seen a modest amount of chop along the way, but each pausing period has ultimately paved the way for higher prices. I see no reason why the past month's high base won't end similarly.Look for a breakout over $313 resistance, then deploy bullish trades. With implied volatility in the tank and ADBE stock's hefty price tag, I like bull call spreads. Buy the Oct $310/$320 bull call spread for around $4.75. Costco (COST)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Costco (NASDAQ:COST) finds itself in a similar position. While its multi-year gains haven't been as jaw-dropping as ADBE, Costco has still been a fantastic stock to buy.The past two years have seen a surge in upside momentum signaling the uptrend is on strong footing. From a charting perspective, this year's trend has seen multiple bases and upside breakouts. Each has seen solid follow through, providing ample opportunity for breakout traders seeking stocks to buy.Currently, COST stock has built a two-week consolidation zone near $280. With the 20-day moving average fast approaching, the time is nigh for an upside pop. Watch for a breach of $284.31, then enter bullish plays. Like Adobe, the cheap implied volatility and the expensive price tag of Costco make it a good candidate for call spreads.  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right Buy the Oct $280/$290 bull call spread for around $4.75. Okta (OKTA)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the more speculative pick of the bunch. Since its 2017 IPO, the San Francisco-based software company has been a favorite among momentum traders. One glance at its price chart reveals all you need to know. Since opening at $23.56, OKTA stock has risen 474%This year OKTA is on pace for another barn burner. Its year-to-date gains have already eclipsed 110%. The best way to play it has been buying breakouts along the way. We've seen many bases deliver powerful upside runs. The current three-week consolidation zone presents another alluring setup.Today's drop suggests the stock may need some more time before an upside break transpires. Watch for a rise above $141.85, then enter bullish trades. The liquidity in its options is so-so, at best, so be sure to use limit orders. Buying the Nov $135/$145 bull call spread for around $4.60 if it breaks out is worth consideration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-30,"The IPO market has been strong, but iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) stock has not joined the party. Since becoming public last year, the shares are up a mere 6% or so, even though the company is often called the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of China.Source: Shutterstock But with expectations kind of soft for IQ, could this be a good time to buy IQ stock? Or should investors hold off for now? Well,IQ stock is certainly showing signs of momentum.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels During the quarter, IQ did report a big-time achievement: IQ's subscriber base exceeded 100 million for the first time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's what the CEO and founder of IQ, Dr. Yu Gong, said: &quot;Leveraging our exceptional capabilities in producing original content and deploying innovative AI technology, we have achieved remarkable membership conversion through our relentless efforts to cater to the diverse entertainment needs of our users and optimize their experience on our platform. Chinese consumers are increasingly willing to pay for high-quality content, a trend underpinned by the rapid evolvement of the entertainment industry and technology in China.&quot;And the company had some other notable highlights during the quarter:  * At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, the Central Radio and TV Station, Shanghai General Station and the CCTV Financial Channel jointly granted IQ the &quot;Mobile Internet Innovation Pioneer Award.&quot; IQ received the award mainly due to its use of cutting-edge AI (Artificial Intelligence) and VR (Virtual Reality) for content creation. After the news of the award was released, IQ stock jumped by 10%.  * IQ launched an interactive video-platform plug-in that can be utilized in conjunction with video-editing software from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Using IQ's plug-in, a producer can easily change plots and edit story lines  * IQ hosted the 2019 VIP Fan Carnival in Shanghai, which included more than 60 celebrities and 7,000 fans. Held in partnership with Weibo Corp (NASDAQ:WB), the event attracted about 1 billion views.But IQ's  growth is still likely to meaningfully decelerate. For example, in Q2  analysts, on average, expect its  revenues to climb by 9% year-over-year to $1.02 billion. In Q1, the company's top line jumped 43% YoY. The company's losses are also expected to continue. Analysts' average estimate is a loss of 44 cents per share of IQ stock (during the same period a year ago, the loss was 45 cents per share of IQ stock). The Issues With iQiyi StockIQ faces some tough challenges. One hurdle is the wild card of regulation. Keep in mind that the Chinese government has recently instituted new requirements for online video - with a focus on historical dramas -- which could hamper IQ's growth and hurt IQ stock.Next, the competitive environment remains intense. IQ must fight against rivals like Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which have massive platforms and enormous financial resources.And while IQ has a hefty subscription base, the monthly payments are only$1.50 to $2 a month (IQ, however, also generates ad revenues). Furthermore, another InvestorPlace columnist, Josh Enomoto wrote: &quot;Moreover, from a historical perspective, the Chinese don't value media content as much as we do. For decades, China was ground zero for content piracy. Guess what? Nothing has changed. Under this context, I just don't see Chinese consumers forking over their hard-earned yuan for something that they can get for free. That poses major challenges for IQ stock.&quot;In the meantime, IQ continues to spend significant amounts on original content. And those costs are likely to escalate, as IQ is planning to develop movies.In other words, it could be tough for IQ to become profitable. That is why the company has continued to raise money by a variety of means, including its recent $1 billion convertible bond offering. That move was not encouraging,  as it came relatively soon after the IPO of IQ stock. The Bottom Line on IQ StockEven though the expectations for iQiyi stock are far from robust,  the shares may not be worth buying right now. The company faces some tough headwinds - and they could easily cause its guidance to miss consensus expectations. So for now, investors shouldn't rush to buy IQ stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-07-31,"Dashed hopes have come to define iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) stock since its March 2018 IPO. Three months after its debut, iQiyi stock had risen by more than 150%. However, within six months, it had given back all those gains, and then some.Source: Shutterstock IQ stock doubled in price between December and February, but now the equity has again fallen back towards the original IPO price.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August iQiyi will continue to benefit from significant revenue growth. However, political and economic conditions will prevent those gains from boosting IQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What's Good for Iqiyi Does Not Seem to Help IQ StockMany compare iQiyi to a similar U.S.-based company, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). However, the platform seems to come closer to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube with a content budget.Admittedly, they have brought creativity by incorporating editing software from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to change stories and plot lines. As I mentioned in a previous article, they want consumers to think of them as the next Disney (NYSE:DIS).However, this creativity has failed to translate into massive growth or stock gains. China may hold the advantage of operating in a developing market with a population almost four times as large as that of the U.S. However, as our own Tom Taulli points out, it has &quot;lost its mojo.&quot; Even after hitting the 100 million subscriber mark, analysts expect year-over-year revenue growth to slow from 29.9% in the last quarter to about 15.2% in Q2.iQiyi also faces increasing competition from giants such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Both are large, profitable companies that can fund a content war. IQ stock will have to rely on outside funding for such endeavors. Analysts expect iQiyi to lose $1.81 per share this year, and Wall Street does not predict a profit until at least 2021.Also, the performance of IQ stock has likely dispelled any notions that iQiyi will become a second chance for those who missed the move higher in Netflix stock. More than 16 months have passed since Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) spun it off into a separate company. IQ currently trades at just under $19 per share, barely above its IPO price. At a price-to-sales (PS) ratio of only 3.5, traders appear in no mood to bid iQiyi stock to Netflix-like valuations. Numerous Factors Hold Down IQ StockI think IQ stock fails to gain that kind of traction for several reasons. Netflix operated for years by staying ahead of its competition. iQiyi has no such benefit. Moreover, ad-related revenue growth has slowed considerably. Many businesses have not taken with the ad platform, and it has barred some from its ad platform out of fear of regulatory authorities.Still, I think the overriding factors are the macroeconomy and geopolitics. A slowing economy might presumably help iQiyi as fewer people working would probably bring higher viewership. However, stocks overall tend to underperform in a slowing economy.Moreover, we must remember that so-called &quot;Chinese stocks&quot; are actually Cayman Islands-based holding companies who represent Chinese firms. As a result, traders have not bid these stocks as high as their American counterparts. This does not affect only IQ. Alibaba stock has faced a similar struggle. That trend could worsen if the economy slows. The Bottom LineInvestors may continue to regard iQiyi as the &quot;Netflix of China,&quot; however, political and economic conditions will deter any Netflix-like valuations in IQ stock. iQiyi has reached its 100 million subscriber milestone, and revenues continue to grow. Some believe this will turn iQiyi into a profitable company by 2021.That has not translated into significant gains for IQ stock. Many cite declining ad revenues and competition. The ongoing trade war also continues to hurt Chinese stocks and the Chinese economy overall.Still, I think traders cannot fully get past the fact that IQ stock is not truly stock in iQiyi. I do not see a significant chance on iQiyi reneging on the agreements that keep IQ stock afloat. However, as long as iQiyi stock remains a proxy, I see its growth potential as limited.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

As for the top line, Wall Street is looking for revenues of $350.46 million, up about 43%.Now if this pans out, it will be a deceleration. Keep in mind that - in Q1 - the growth ramp was 50%. In fact, during Q1 in 2018, the growth was 68%. But hey, its really tough to keep up the momentum, especially as the revenue base gets much larger. Shopify Stock and the Highlights of the Second QuarterDuring Q2, Shopify had its mega Unite conference. And yes, there were lots of announcements, including the following:  * There was a major upgrade to the online store platform. It is now easier to create and customize storefronts -- without having to code.  * There is the Shopify Fulfillment Network, which is similar to what Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has for its merchants. That is, it is a sophisticated system that leverages AI (Artificial intelligence) to optimize products for low-cost inventory and delivery.  * Shopify Plus, which is for larger merchants, has been upgraded. There are better capabilities for viewing of data across locations and permissions. There is also a system that allows for automating repetitive processes.  * The Shopify POS offering has undergone a major revamp. There are also new features, such as the ability to use a loyalty program.  * Shopify has made it easier to implement video and 3D models in a store. There has also been the addition of 11 languages along with multiple currencies in Shopify Payments. The Bottom Line On SHOP StockShopify has done a great job of capitalizing on the megatrend of ecommerce. By creating an easy-to-use and affordable platform, the company has been able to amass a base of over 800,000 businesses across 175 countries.Yet I think investors should still be cautious with SHOP stock ahead of earnings. Let's face it, the shares are already factoring in the good news -- and then some. Consider that the valuation is a hefty $35 billion and the multiple is a steep 30 times sales. Interestingly enough, Wall Street's price target on SHOP stock is $322, which assumes only 2.5% upside.The competition is also getting more intense. SHOP has to fight against rivals like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and even Square (NYSE:SQ). They all have tremendous resources and large distribution footprints, as well as diverse product offerings.So for now, it's probably better to be patient and wait for a better price on SHOP stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-06,"Welcome back, volatility. From the beginning of June to the end of July, the S&P 500 climbed to all-time highs. It did so without ever retreating more than 2%. Now stocks have dropped more than 5% in just a few trading days. Why? The market received bad news in back-to-back days with regards to the only two things investors care about.Source: Shutterstock First, the Fed &quot;only&quot; cut rates by 25 basis points. They also signaled a more hawkish-than-expected tone regarding future rate cuts. Second, U.S. President Donald Trump upped the trade war ante the very next day. He implemented a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods that, up until early August, had simply been talk.I get why markets are plunging in response to these two downward catalysts. I also think that stocks will bounce back soon. Trump wants lower rates. The easiest way for him to force the Fed to cut rates is to up the trade war. So he did just that. Now, the Fed is going to cut rates. That will normalize the yield curve by dragging down the short end.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the same time, the 10-Year Treasury yield will remain below 2% because of muted inflation. That's ideal for the stock market since it supports higher equity valuations. Further, once rates get cut, it's very likely that we get some good news on the trade war front (both because Trump will have what he wanted in lower rates and because this trade war follows a rather predictable cycle).  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Thus, today we have a sharply inverted yield curve with the threat of sizable tariffs on the horizon. By the end of 2019, though, we will most likely have a normalized yield curve with tariff threats reduced. The 10-Year Treasury yield will also likely be below 2%. That's a recipe for materially higher stock prices.Consequently, I think this late summer dip in stocks is a buying opportunity into the end of the year. Which stocks am I buying in particular? Here's a list of 10 stocks I think look good amid recent trade war weakness. Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip: Adobe (ADBE)% off 2019 Highs: 9%Trade Exposure: Visual cloud giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) doesn't have much trade war exposure. There is the risk that escalating trade tensions continue to drag on global economic growth, which may weigh on enterprise IT spend and could eat into Adobe's growth trajectory. But, that is about as limited trade war exposure as you will find in the market.Secular Growth Drivers: Adobe is supported by multiple secular growth drivers which should withstand trade war tensions. The first of these secular drivers is the enterprise pivot from on-premise to cloud solutions, which remains only about 20% complete. Due to the cost-saving advantages of cloud over on-premise, this should withstand the rising cost aspect of tariffs. The second secular driver is the global consumer pivot towards visual consumption. The world is becoming increasingly visual every day, and as it does, more enterprises are adopting Adobe's visual cloud solutions to create visually compelling content that resonates with consumers. This pivot will not be disrupted significantly by trade war tensions.Near Term Catalysts: Adobe just reported yet another double-beat earnings report which comprised robust revenue and profit growth. Thus, the growth trajectory here remains favorable. As it does, strong earnings reports will converge on a depressed stock, and spark a nice recovery rally in ADBE stock. Adobe is a stock to buy. Facebook (FB)% off 2019 Highs: 11%Trade Exposure: Digital advertising giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has some trade war exposure as higher costs could pressure U.S. companies. Tariffs mean higher input costs for a lot of small- to medium-sized U.S. retailers and merchants. Many of those companies will not be able to pass on those higher costs to consumers. As such, they will have to absorb higher input costs. That will pressure margins. In response, some of those companies may reduce their ad budgets. If so, that would mean less ad revenue from these companies into Facebook.Secular Growth Drivers: It's unlikely Facebook gets hit much by this reduced ad spend. Instead, if U.S. companies do reduce their ad spend in response to higher input costs, they will likely reduce spend on smaller ad platforms, like Yelp (NYSE:YELP). They almost certainly won't cut Facebook or Instagram ad spend. And that speaks to this company's secular advantage -- it's unparalleled size and reach among the global consumer. So long as this advantage remains in play, and so long as ad dollars continue to shift into the digital channel -- which they should given increases in digital content consumption -- Facebook's secular growth trajectory will remain robust, regardless of trade war noise.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Near Term Catalysts: Facebook just started pushing forward on the e-commerce front. As relatively nascent e-commerce businesses like Instagram Shopping gain traction over the next several quarters, investors will start to salivate over the long-term potential of the commerce growth vertical. This will lead to strong investor demand for shares of FB, which should ultimately push Facebook stock higher for the foreseeable future. Electronic Arts (EA)Source: Shutterstock % off 2019 Highs: 17%Trade Exposure: Video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has very limited exposure to the trade war since the video game industry has been largely exempt from tariffs, and projects to remain so for the foreseeable future.Secular Growth Drivers: There are three big secular growth drivers supporting EA stock, all three of which will withstand and outlast trade war noise. First, the sleepy video game industry is on the verge of a huge leap forward with the 2020 release of next-gen consoles -- the first in eight years -- and the 2019/2020 release of cloud gaming platforms. Second, EA has successfully jumped into the &quot;free-to-play&quot; arena with Apex Legends and is set to win big as free-to-play games gain traction over the next few years. Third, EA's portfolio line-up, including Madden and NBA Live, is optimally positioned for eSports. As eSports continue to grow over the next few years, EA should be at the center of all that growth.Near Term Catalysts: Over the next few quarters, it's all about cloud gaming, new consoles, and Apex Legends for EA stock. The release of cloud gaming platforms in late 2019 should breath life back into the stale video game industry. New console releases in 2020 should build on that momentum, and supercharge growth across the whole industry. Meanwhile, EA's second iteration of Apex Legends has been a big success so far. As such, this company's numbers will significantly improve over the next few quarters, and as they do, EA stock will bounce back, making this a stock to buy. Square (SQ)Source: Shutterstock % off 2019 Highs: 22%Trade Exposure: Payments processor Square (NYSE:SQ) has some exposure to the trade war, but it is largely limited to increased input costs for its hardware devices, which represent an increasingly small and unimportant part of Square's overall revenue and profit pie.Secular Growth Drivers: The secular growth driver supporting SQ stock is the global pivot from cash to cash-less payments, which has been happening rapidly and will continue to over the next several years, regardless of how the trade war plays out. The bigger the trade war gets, the less consumers spend, and the slower Square grows. But, the cash-less movement will remain robust, so regardless of how broader consumption trends play out, Square's secular growth driver will remain strong.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now Near Term Catalysts: SQ stock is down recently because the company gave a weak guide shortly before the market started to tank. The two compounded on each other, and Square stock now finds itself in bear market territory. But, management is notorious for &quot;sandbagging&quot; guidance. Thus, Q3 numbers will likely come in much better than expected. If that happens, you will have a double-beat report converging on a depressed stock, which should result in a big rally for SQ stock the next time earnings roll around. Lululemon (LULU)% off 2019 Highs: 10%Trade Exposure: Of all the stocks to buy on this list, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) arguably has the most trade war exposure, since nearly 60% of the company's products are manufactured in South East Asia, with 12% manufactured in China. Thus, bigger tariffs mean higher costs, and presumably lower margins.Secular Growth Drivers: There are two secular drivers supporting LULU stock. One, athletic apparel adoption rates are soaring across the world, since consumers are increasingly obsessed with looking good, being healthy, and leading active lifestyles. Two, Lululemon dominates the high-quality niche of this secular growth athletic apparel market, and as such, has exceptionally high consumer demand and brand equity. This will enable the company to weather the trade war by passing higher costs onto consumers without adversely impacting demand. Revenues and margins should remain on a steady uptrend for the next several years, regardless of trade war noise.Near Term Catalysts: The market is presently underestimating the secular strength of the athletic apparel market, and Lululemon's ability to pass higher costs onto consumers without adversely impacting demand. As such, while investors are expecting next quarter's profit numbers to come in lighter than expected, they won't. Instead, it will be yet another double beat quarter, the likes of which will converge on a relatively depressed LULU stock to spark a big rally. Qualcomm (QCOM)% off 2019 Highs: 23%Trade Exposure: Chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has plenty of trade war exposure, since at its core, this is a smartphone company, and the core of the smartphone growth narrative is the rapid urbanization of developing economies, the biggest of whom is China. Thus, rising trade tensions could impact global smartphone demand, which could have an adverse impact on Qualcomm's numbers.Secular Growth Drivers: The bigger story -- and more important growth driver -- at Qualcomm is the mainstream and widespread roll-out of 5G smartphones in 2020. Much like next-gen console releases in 2020 will breathe life back into what has become a stale video game industry, 5G smartphone releases in 2020 will similarly breathe life back into what has become a stale and tired global smartphone industry. This reinvigorated growth will power strong results for Qualcomm over the next several years, which should keep QCOM stock on a long term winning trajectory.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Near Term Catalysts: See above. It's all about 5G, and 5G smartphones will start to roll out in 2020. Ahead of that big catalyst, you will likely see investors buy into QCOM stock, especially if trade tensions cool off. Alphabet (GOOG)% off 2019 Highs: 11%Trade Exposure: Digital ad giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), much like Facebook, has exposure to the trade war through reduced ad spend as tariffs force U.S. companies to potentially re-think ad budgets.Secular Growth Drivers: The secular growth drivers here are two-fold, and are the same as Facebook's secular growth drivers. One, consumers are only spending more time in the digital channel, so ad dollars will continue to pivot in bulk into that space. Two, Alphabet is the biggest player in the digital ad space with the most reach, so even if U.S. companies do start to re-think their ad budgets, they likely won't reduce spend on Alphabet's platforms. On top of all that, Alphabet's cloud business is supported by secular cloud adoption tailwinds which won't be impacted in any big way by trade issues.Near Term Catalysts: Alphabet just reported a really strong second quarter earnings report wherein revenue and profit growth accelerated sequentially, powered by increasing cloud momentum and improving margin performance. GOOG stock popped big in response to that report. It has since given up all of those gains because of macro headwinds. These macro headwinds won't stick around. Once they disappear, investors will look back at the Q2 earnings report and say, &quot;hey, that was a pretty good print.&quot; They will consequently buy back in, and GOOG stock will turn back higher. Twilio (TWLO)Source: Shutterstock % off 2019 Highs: 18%Trade Exposure: Cloud communications company Twilio (NASDAQ:TWLO) has essentially zero direct trade war exposure, although it could be negatively impacted by a global economic slowdown as a result of escalating trade tensions.Secular Growth Drivers: The secular growth narrative at Twilio is all about cloud communications. Real-time communication is becoming an increasingly important part of the consumer experience. That is, in order to enhance their experiences, enterprises are increasingly employing real time communication. Twilio enables this real time communication. As real time communication becomes the norm in consumer experiences over the next several years, every company will adopt these services. Many of them will adopt Twilio, since they are the leader in the market. Nothing about this secular growth narrative is adversely impacted in the long run by trade tensions.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Near Term Catalysts: Twilio just reported a double beat-and-raise earnings report which topped expectations everywhere. Q2 revenues and profits beat estimates. The Q3 revenue and profit guides were above-consensus, too. The FY19 revenue and profit guides were lifted to above-consensus marks. Despite this strength, TWLO stock is down big since that report. Why? Macro noise. This macro noise will fade. When it does, the company's strong internals will move back into spotlight. That transition should propel a nice rebound in TWLO stock over the next few months, especially if rates remain depressed (and if the Fed cuts rates further). Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock % off 2019 Highs: 40%Trade Exposure: Cannabis giant Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has limited exposure to the U.S.-China trade war. However, the worry here is that tariffs are the new norm everywhere. If so, Canadian-based Canopy Growth could have a tough time expanding globally.Secular Growth Drivers: The secular growth narrative is that Canopy is the unchallenged leader in a cannabis market that while small today, projects to be huge at scale, given underlying consumption trends which show marijuana's popularity is huge and growing. Trade disputes impact this narrative to the extent that they might stifle Canopy's international growth prospects. But, it seems like a leap to assume that tariffs are the new global norm. Anything short of that, it's tough to see Canopy's secular growth narrative being derailed by trade.Near Term Catalysts: Canopy's numbers last quarter weren't good. In fact, they were bad enough that the CEO got fired. Next quarter's numbers should be a lot better. Canadian cannabis volume trends have improved significantly over the past few months. Peer Aphria (NYSE:APHA) also reported strong numbers which underscore that things are getting better. Further, cannabis 2.0 products like vapes and edibles are set to launch in Canada later this year. The launch of these products should provide meaningful revenue and margin tailwinds for Canopy. Net net, the numbers over the next few quarters should improve dramatically, and spark a big rebound in CGC stock. Alibaba (BABA)% off 2019 Highs: 22%Trade Exposure: Chinese commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has a ton of trade war risk. Most importantly, Alibaba goes as the China consumer economy goes. That consumer economy has weakened as trade tensions have risen. If trade tensions keep going up, China's consumer economy could keep slowing. If so, Alibaba's once super robust growth trajectory will continue to flatten out.Secular Growth Drivers: The long term fundamentals underlying BABA stock are highly favorable. What you have in China is a consumer economy with well over 1 billion consumers, less than 60% of whom are connected to the internet. In developed economies like the U.S. and Canada, the internet penetration rate is essentially north of about 90%. Thus, China has ample runway to add hundreds of millions new internet-connected consumers over the next several years. All those consumers will flow into the Alibaba ecosystem, since Alibaba is the de facto e-commerce platform in China. Against the backdrop of this secular growth narrative, current trade war noise is just a bump in the road.Near Term Catalysts: It's tough to point to a catalyst on the horizon for BABA stock. The reality is that, so long as trade tensions remain hot between the U.S. and China, BABA stock will remain weak. Thus, buying the dip here require patience. Long term, such patience will be rewarded. This stock has tremendous growth potential in a multi-year window. Alibaba just has to move past near term trade issues in order to realize that long term potential.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE, FB, EA, SQ, LULU, QCOM, GOOG, TWLO, CGC, and BABA.

2019-08-06,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has dropped recently as the stock market has tumbled on interest rate and trade-war concerns. MSFT stock, like the the S&P 500, presently trades about 4% off of its all time highs.Source: Shutterstock The reality of Microsoft stock is that, if the market keeps dropping on trade and interest-rate concerns, so will MSFT stock.MSFT is not immune to these market headwinds. The company's double-digit-percentage revenue growth rate is somewhat reliant upon healthy macro economic conditions, and those  conditions are deteriorating because of rising geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Meanwhile, MSFT stock is also somewhat reliant upon rates staying lower for longer in order to support its rich valuation, and investors are unsure as to whether or not rates will stay lower for longer.Thus, if the market keeps dropping on interest rate and trade concerns, MSFT stock will keep dropping, too, no matter what Microsoft news is reported.But it will drop a lot less than other tech and growth stocks because. relative to other tech and growth stocks, Microsoft stock is significantly less exposed to interest-rate and trade headwinds. That's because the valuation of MSFT stock isn't that rich, nor is its business that dependent on favorable economic conditions.Consequently, for investors who are looking for safety amid the recent market turmoil but also want growth, MSFT seems like the perfect stock to buy. Microsoft Stock Isn't Immune, But It's Partially ShieldedMicrosoft stock is not immune to interest rate and trade headwinds. But it is partially shielded, and this partial protection makes MSFT stock an attractive, &quot;safe tech stock&quot; to buy in turbulent times.On the trade front, MSFT is partially shielded from trade headwinds because its core business is supported by non-cyclical  adoption tailwinds.Specifically, Microsoft's business is all about the cloud today. The company is capitalizing on the non-cyclical pivot from on-premise solutions to cloud solutions.This pivot may slow somewhat as global economic conditions deteriorate and as enterprises pull back on IT spending and investment.But the pivot won't stop. Instead, enterprises will continue to shift to the cloud.The pace of the transition could even increase if the economy slows because cloud solutions provide significant cost savings relative to on-premise solutions.As a result, Microsoft's business won't materially slow as a result of escalating trade headwinds. Instead, its business should remain largely steady and stable.On the interest rate front, MSFT stock is partially shielded because its valuation isn't that rich relative to other tech/growth stocks. MSFT stock trades at 25 times analysts'  average forward earnings estimate.That's rich. But it's not that rich. Other big cloud stocks - like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW), and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) - all trade at over 35 times analysts' average forward earnings estimate.Thus, if rates do creep higher, Microsoft stock won't be pressured as much as other big-name tech stocks.For these two reasons, MSFT stock is a relatively good buy in turbulent times. Indeed,  this scenario is already playing out. MSFT stock is presently only 5% off its recent highs. By contrast, every FANG stock is in correction territory. This relative outperformance of MSFT stock will persist. The Long-Term Outlook of MSFT Stock Remains CompellingThe long-term bull thesis on Microsoft stock remains compelling, even amid recent market headwinds.As stated earlier, Microsoft's core cloud businesses are supported by non-cyclical cloud adoption tailwinds. These tailwinds may slow somewhat in the face of global economic uncertainty. Or they may accelerate, as enterprises  look to cut costs as times get tough. But these tailwinds won't die. Only 20% of enterprise workloads are in the cloud today. Over time, that number will rise towards 100%. Thus, MSFT can easily sustain double-digit-percentage revenue growth for the next several years.MSFT's gross margins will continue to rise as its cloud businesses, particularly Azure, grow. Double-digit-percentage revenue growth should also be enough to increase its profitability.  Share buybacks will also be in play.That combination should produce roughly 15% EPS growth. Reasonably speaking, then, Microsoft's EPS could reach $12 by fiscal 2026. Based on a  forward PE multiple of 20, which is average for growth stocks, that equates to a fiscal 2025 price target of $240. Discounted back by 10% per year, we arrive at  a fiscal 2020 price target of roughly $150.Thus,MSFT stock can rise meaningfully both over the next 12 months and the next five years. The Bottom Line on MSFT StockThings are getting choppy in the stock market right now, and as they do get choppy, tech and growth stocks will get hit extra hard because they have ample exposure to trade and interest-rate headwinds.But, relative to that tech and growth group, Microsoft stock will outperform in turbulent times because it has less-than-average exposure to the aforementioned headwinds. As a result, for investors looking to stick with growth  but also seeking some stability amid the recent volatility, MSFT stock looks like a good choice.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MSFT and ADBE.

2019-08-12,"There's no denying Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has shocked the world. SHOP stock is up more than 165% in 2019, and Shopify stock has rallied an incredible 2000% since its 2015 IPO by doing what many said can't be done. That is, penetrating an e-commerce market dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Source: Shutterstock SHOP's magic formula has  been behind the stratospheric surge of SHOP stock. That formula involves  empowering online merchants with tools and information that eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Amazon don't exactly want their sellers to have. The fact that 5,300 companies are using Shopify's products shows that it's got what businesses want.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Sell Right Now The enthusiasm of the owners of SHOP stock is understandable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe huge rally of Shopify stock in just the past few months, though, has left SHOP stock uncomfortably vulnerable to profit-taking and short-selling. Shopify's growth  doesn't justify the current valuation of SHOP stock. Shopify Validates the Business ModelFor ages, investors have argued about how far into the future they should look.Amazon is the obvious poster child for an answer along the lines of &quot;many, many years.&quot; It was a habitual money loser since its inception in 1994, and didn't start turning consistent profits until 2015. But, now that it's in the black, it's tremendously in the black.Shopify may well be on a similar path.There's a dangerous difference between Amazon then and Shopify now, however. Then, it wasn't entirely clear that e-commerce could ever be profitable. Now, with the industry fully matured, it clearly can be profitable. As a result,  many companies with new approaches will enter the sector, while established players like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are stepping up their game.SHOP, in fact, is one of those newcomers. It's the un-Amazon. It's not even eBay  facilitating the establishment of truly independent e-commerce platforms.Others will follow. Shopify Stock Really Does Have a Valuation ProblemThis competition won't be problematic for Shopify stock, though. Indeed, even though Shopify's 10% share of the all-in-one e-commerce platform market is less than that of WooCommerce's and Squarespace, SHOP has arguably already won the battle for mind-share. It should be the market leader, sooner or later.As of the most recent look, however, SHOP stock, with a market cap of $44 billion, is valued as 34 times its trailing 12-month revenue of $1.3 billion. That's not 34 times its earnings, to be clear, which would be considered frothy by most standards. That's 34 times revenueSHOP stock reached that huge valuation even though SHOP wasn't consistently profitable  until last year. Based on this year's projected profit of $69 million, SHOP stock is valued at 637 times SHOP's earnings.That's not necessarily the end of the world. Shopify is a work in progress. The market has rewarded less successful names, with less promising prospects.But the point where the current SHOP stock price of $369 will be justified is so far down the road that it can't actually be seen. The 2021 outlook for revenue of $2.7 billion and net income of $218 million still leaves Shopify stock valued at 16.3 times the company's sales and more than 200 times its earnings.On average, stocks are valued at three times companies' revenue, and between 15 and 20 times their earnings.Most people don't realize that the current valuation of Shopify stock isn't justified. It's all based on hype, rooted in the premise that somebody finally figured out how to beat Amazon at its own game. Shopify would have to obliterate its estimates for the next several years to justify the current price of SHOP stock (let alone a higher price) at a time when competitors are improving their own products. The Bottom Line on SHOP StockI'm not suggesting SHOP stock is destined to immediately roll over and lose a big chunk of its value.It's entirely possible -- even likely -- we're at the start of something of a melt-up, as the fear of missing out on continued rallies by Shopify stock pulls more buyers into the incredible rally. Things like fundamentals don't matter until the majority of traders decide they matter, and right now, they don't matter for Shopify stock. A short squeeze may also be in play, artificially pushing the shares higher.Make no mistake though. Every stock always eventually reflects tangible value. Even on a risk-adjusted, potential-adjusted basis, SHOP stock is already in jeopardy.Tread lightly.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-14,"From the beginning of June to late July, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was on the comeback trail. Nvidia stock went from $134 to $179 during this period.Source: Shutterstock Yet lately things have come undone. Of course, the overall market has been bearish and the situation with U.S.-China relations have deteriorated quickly. So yes, the Nvidia stock price has come under lots of pressure.In fact, for the past 12 months, the return is an awful -39%. This is certainly in stark contrast to the prior years when Nvidia could do no wrong.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what now? Perhaps NVDA is an opportunity here? Well, on Thursday the company will report its results for the second quarter after the market closes, and this will certainly be an important one.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul Here's what the Street is looking for:  * Revenues are forecasted to drop by 18% to $2.55 billion (keep in mind that the company's own estimate is for a range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion).  * Earnings are expected to come to $1.14 per share.Even with the estimated decline on the top-line, NVDA still may have a challenge in beating the forecast. The data center business appears to still be languishing, especially given the impact from rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The gaming business also continues to have problems.Here's what Instinet analyst David Wong wrote:&quot;With data-center (GPU) sales growing just 4% QoQ in the October 2018 quarter, then falling 14% sequentially in the January 2019 quarter and a further 7% QoQ in the April 2019 quarter (April 2019 down 10% YoY), we expect another YoY decline in data-center segment revenues in the July 2019 quarter and possibly again in the October 2019 quarter.&quot; Nvidia Stock Quarterly HighlightsNVDA definitely had an active quarter. Here are some of the notable announcements:  * The company said that partners like Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Lenovo and BOXX will release ten new NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops and professional-grade mobile workstations. They will highlight new capabilities like real-time ray tracing, advanced AI and ultra-high-resolution video editing.  * At the SIGGRAPH conference, NVDA announced that top software developers, such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), have created over 40 applications for the RTX technology.  * NVDA launched various new GPUs, including GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER and GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, allowing for next-generation games. What's more, this core RTX technology will be used in the eagerly awaited game, Cyberpunk 2077 (it won over 100 awards at E3 2019).  * The company entered a strategic alliance with Volvo Group for the development of autonomous trucks.  * NVDA announced a breakthrough in AI language understanding, which should make it easier for businesses to engage with customer conversations. The company's AI platform can train one of the most sophisticated models, called BERT, in less than an hour -- making inferences in just over 2 milliseconds. Bottom Line on Nvidia StockThere's no doubt that NVDA has been prescient in leveraging its GPU expertise into markets beyond gaming, such as the data center and AI. The result is that the company has become a mega powerhouse in the chip industry.But the problem is that the competition is starting to take a toll. For example, companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are creating their own AI chips. There are also a myriad of startups, like Graphcore, that are gunning for the opportunity.In the meantime, the situation with US-China relations appears to be far from resolved. This is particularly troublesome for NVDA because it has about 23% exposure to China.So in light of all this, it's probably best to hold off on the stock ahead of this week's earnings report.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-15,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock continues to struggle. Since hitting highs above $215 per share in 2013, the shares have seen a steady decline. Today, the IBM stock price has fallen below $132 per share.Source: Shutterstock Amid evolving technologies, IBM has to pivot again to remain relevant. It has attempted this feat by buying Red Hat. Investors are bailing out of the shares as integration of the Linux maker will take time. Given the time lag and the falling profits, owning the stock amounts to a gamble on whether management can successfully absorb Red Hat into the company. IBM Stakes its Future on Red HatAs the name International Business Machines implies, the company came to prominence by providing the &quot;computers&quot; that stood at the cutting edge of technology decades ago. What was once known as &quot;Big Blue&quot; has long since ceased to act as an innovator. Yet, it has remained relevant for decades by building businesses around technologies invented by others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe question on investors' minds now revolves around whether this company can reinvent itself yet again. In a software arena dominated by the likes of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the company faces a daunting challenge.It took a huge leap forward in the cloud by purchasing Red Hat. As InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel wrote earlier this week, the move makes IBM a &quot;serious contender&quot; in the open-source software arena. Still, one can understand why IBM stock plunged following management's last quarterly report when they told the public that Red Hat would not help boost earnings until 2021. Where Will IBM Go Next?This leaves investors in International Business Machines stock with two key questions: how will IBM perform while the company fully absorbs Red Hat, and will the acquisition ultimately lead to a turnaround in the shares?  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The drop in IBM stock following the last earnings report means investors should expect very little of the equity for now. Revenue and profits will fall for fiscal 2019. Also, analysts only see modest growth on both measures in 2020. This makes the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 9.8x appear less appealing. Moreover, the sentiment helped to take the IBM stock price down to about $131.25 per share after Wednesday's market carnage.Answering the question of whether Red Hat will turn IBM around will simply take time. It has remained a force in technology years after the tech it invented became obsolete. That by itself stands as a testament to the firm's resiliency. Still, I would not consider a comeback in IBM stock a sure thing. In truth, it has become a riskier stock than one might think. Mind the DividendThis danger is strongly tied to the IBM dividend. At first glance, the payout looks robust. It currently yields 4.9% and has increased for 22 straight years. The coveted &quot;dividend aristocrat&quot; status requires 25 years of payout hikes. However, this dividend currently eats up more than 65% of the company's profits; that number was about 26.5% as recently as 2014.  * Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now Slashing a payout usually leads to years of stagnation for an equity. Hence, companies like to maintain these streaks if possible. In 1993, IBM reduced its dividend in a bid to save the company. Fortunately for shareholders, the dividend cuts then led to only a short-term selloff in IBM stock. Still, should Red Hat fail to turn the revenue and profit picture for IBM around, the company may have no choice but to cut the payout again. If this happens, traders should not count on a quick recovery for the stock this time. Bottom Line on IBM stockThe near-term prospects for a recovery in IBM stock begin and end with Red Hat. Evolving technologies have hurt profit growth for the venerable tech firm. The company hopes its takeover of the Linux maker will give IBM the technology -- and street cred -- it needs to remain relevant.Simply put, though, IBM stock has no obvious path to recovery without Red Hat. Moreover, the increasing cost of maintaining its dividend depends on this success. Should it cut its payout, it could suffer years of stagnation like other companies forced to surrender their dividend aristocrat status.For now, buying IBM stock has become a gamble on the company's success at integrating Red Hat. A favorable outcome would probably take it back to 2013 highs above $215 per share. A failure means lower dividends and a stagnant or falling stock price, possibly lasting years.How lucky do you feel?As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

At Strategic Trader, we have set up our portfolio to be able to take advantage of moments like these.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOur option-selling strategies can generate income when stocks are rising and when stocks are falling.This week, we're looking to generate some short-term income on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).We took possession of shares of ADBE last week when the ADBE August 9th $302.50 put write we had sold against the stock expired in the money.When that happened, we not only got to keep the premium we received when we sold the put write, we also got some shares of ADBE that we can sell covered calls against to generate income.ADBE has been quite volatile the past two weeks, but that volatility is a good thing for us as covered-call sellers because volatile stocks tend to have options with higher premiums.Daily Chart of Adobe (ADBE) -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe higher the premium, the more income we make when we sell a covered call.For this covered call, we set our strike price at the same price we paid for the shares of ADBE when the stock was put to us.By using this same strike price, we guarantee that we will break even on the stock trade if ADBE suddenly shoots higher and closes above our strike before the calls expire and the stock gets called away from us.But regardless of whether the call we're selling expires in the money or out of the money, we'll get to keep all the profits we make based on the call option's premium.Because we expect ADBE to remain below our strike price in the short term, we've set our expiration date for this trade out only about two weeks.If the option expires out of the money at that time, we plan to sell another covered call against our shares as soon as possible to generate even more income.To find out which ADBE covered calls we're selling--and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades--sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.InvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

2019-08-21,"During the past 15 years, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been one of the best performers in the tech world. Keep in mind that the average annual return on CRM stock was an impressive 31%.Source: Shutterstock But lately things have not been so stellar. For example, the year-to-date return is 5%. This has lagged other mature tech companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe (NADAQ:ADBE) and even IBM (NYSE:IBM).OK then, might Salesforce stock be an opportunity for investors now? Is this the right entry point?  Well, perhaps so. In fact, we'll get more details on Thursday on how things are tracking as the company will report its fiscal second-quarter results.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's a look at the Wall Street expectations:  * For revenues, the consensus forecast is for $3.95 billion, up 20.4% from the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that CRM's own forecast is for a range of $3.94 billion to $3.95 billion.  * Wall Street is looking for earnings to hit 47 cents a share. This compares to 39 cents a share a year ago.As for the prior quarter, CRM posted revenues of $3.74 billion, up 24% on a year-over-year basis. There was also a nice 34% jump in operating cash flows to $1.97 billion.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential What's more, the company announced full-year guidance on revenues of $16.10 billion to $16.25 billion, for a growth rate of 21% to 22%. An Eventual QuarterThe biggest event for CRM stock during the quarter was the $15 billion acquisition of Tableau, a top player in the analytics space. The deal is actually the largest in the company's history.Founded in 2003, Tableau focused on a new approach to analytics, with an attempt to disrupt the dominant legacy companies in the industry like IBM, SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). At the heart of the platform was a focus on interactive data visualization that seamlessly integrated with a myriad of databases and spreadsheets.As for CRM, Tableau will become a key part of the Customer 360 analytics system. The deal will also provide a nice boost to the top-line (last year the revenues came to $1.16 billion).But of course, there were other notable highlights for the quarter. Here's a look at some:  * Salesforce shelled out $1.35 billion to acquire ClickSoftware Technologies, which is a provider of field service and workplace systems. The company will become part of the Service Cloud.  * A report from Forrester (NASDAQ:FORR) quantified the total economic impact and benefits of Salesforce Lightning for the Service Cloud. The result: there was a 475% return on investment over a three year period for a typical customer.  * Gartner (NYSE:IT) reported that Salesforce was positioned as a leader in its 2019 Magic Quadrant for Multiexperience Development Platforms. Bottom Line for the CRM Stock PriceSalesforce.com has a knack for beating its numbers. And this upcoming report should be no different. If anything, the Tableau deal should be a help (at least for the guidance).But the dealmaking will also be critical for the long-term of CRM stock. The focus on data companies is spot-on since this allows for the leveraging of next-generation technologies, especially AI (Artificial Intelligence).In the meantime, Salesforce remains dominant in its core areas like CRM, service/support and marketing.Then again, when it comes to CRM stock, it may not be realistic to expect the kinds of standout returns of prior years. The company is much more mature nowadays and it is getting tougher to gin up organic growth.Regardless though, CRM still looks like a good choice for a core holding for investors that want exposure to enterprise categories like the cloud and AI.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-25,"Escalations in the US-China ‘trade war’ led to steep drops in the markets last Friday. The S&P 500 lost 2.4%, and the NASDAQ, with its overrepresentation of China-sensitive tech companies, lost 3%. It was a market rout, and a bad day for investors.Which is not to say that everyone lost. While tech companies have proved particularly susceptible to the US-China trade disputes, the software sector is proving highly resilient to trade pressures. Their relative strength in the face of those pressures makes sense; software companies don’t have import-export trade exposure that tech hardware companies have, and their higher margins give them room to maneuver around the customer billing exposure that they have to face. Let’s look at three software companies that outperformed in last session’s retreat. Adobe, Inc. (ADBE)With a share price of $282, and a PE ratio well above 50, Adobe is an expensive stock – but the expense has proven worthwhile, as ADBE shares have appreciated 178% in the last three years. The company is well known – it created the PDF document, Photoshop, InDesign, Acrobat, Dreamweaver, and Flash, to name just a few of its more ubiquitous products. It’s a profitable company, too, having reported a 4% EPS beat back in June, marking the seventh time in eight quarters that the company had beaten earnings expectations.So, Adobe is an investor’s dream, there is no doubt about that. It’s also, in today’s market climate, a relatively defensive stock. Where the NASDAQ fell 3% in the last session, ADBE shares only slipped 1.8%, outperforming the index. We’ll get a better picture of just how resilient Adobe is next month. The company is scheduled to report earnings on September 17, and is expected to show an EPS of $1.59, the third straight quarter of earnings growth.In the meantime, Wall Street’s analysts consistently like what they see in ADBE. Writing back in June, Barclay’s analyst Saket Kalia put a $330 price target and 16% upside on ADBE, saying after the last earnings report, “The two key numbers to imply from the print are $1.55B in fiscal 2019 net new Digital Media annual recurring revenue and ~43% Q4 exit operating margin. While $1.55B is not guidance, we can get there from the Q2 beat, Q3 guide, and Q4 commentary…”Writing just a few weeks ago, UBS analyst Jennifer Lowe says, “The company can sustain an operating profit and earnings growth of 20% or more. Profit growth should support the current enterprise value to expected 2020 earnings multiple of 31-times. Expect Adobe shares to continue moving higher.” Like Kalia, she puts a $330 price target on Adobe shares.Overall, ADBE receives a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 buys and 4 holds given in recent months. The stock is expensive, at $282 per share, but the average price target of $318 suggests an upside potential of 12%. Coupa Software, Inc. (COUP)California-based Coupa is not was well known as Adobe, but it’s a leader in the field of Business Spend Management. The company’s software products are cloud-based systems designed to make it easy for customers to view and control their business expenditures and invoices in real time.Coupa’s been growing steadily since early 2018, buoyed by the need its products fill – companies always want to know their bottom line, and they want to know it at a glance. Despite EPS losses, Coupa’s revenues have been strong. And in last week’s market rout, COUP shares lost only 0.9%, outperforming the NASDAQ by a wide margin.In fact, COUP’s growth has been so strong that the stock is actually showing a downside; share price growth has accelerated past the average price target in recent weeks, and the more recent, higher, analyst targets have not yet caught up. A look at some of those recent analyst reviews tells the story.5-star analyst Brent Bracelin, of KeyBanc, says that Coupa has potential to “leverage over $400B of annual spend across more than 1,000 customers on the Business Spend Management platform. We estimate the new Coupa Pay digital payment opportunity could grow to $270M by fiscal 2024 from $3.7M in fiscal 2020. Coupa Pay could alone be worth an incremental $35 per share.” Bracelin gives COUP a $171 price target, implying an upside of 22%.Chiming in more recently, Wedbush’s Steven Koenig says that Coupa has a “large market of business spend management and relatively weak competition creating a long runway for sustained sales growth and margin expansion.” He gives Coupa a $168 price target, for a 20% upside.Coupa’s analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy, derived from 9 buys and 3 holds. The stock shows a downside – as described, the share appreciation has accelerated past an obsolete price target. COUP shares are currently selling for $140. Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM)Salesforce is the outlier here – the stock that didn’t just outperform the market during a day’s slump, but actually finished that day in the green. CRM shares gained 2.25% while most of the market was showing losses. While some of that outperformance can be attributed to CRM’s status as a cloud-based software company, most of it is probably attributable to the company’s August 22 quarterly report. CRM simply clobbered the forecasts for fiscal Q2 2020.Quarterly revenues showed a 22% year-over-year gain, to $4 billion, and beat the estimates by 1.25%. Earnings were even stronger, with the 66 cents reported beating the 47 cents expected by an eye-opening 40%. It was Salesforce’s first quarterly earnings report since purchasing Tableau Software for over $15.3 billion, and it easily allayed investor concerns that the company had bitten off more than it could chew. Even better, company management’s forward guidance on Q3 revenues indicates accelerating growth – the $4.4 billion expected is 31% higher than last year’s Q3.The earnings results gave CRM a boost in the markets and it’s still rising. CRM also got a run of positive vibes from analysts that are still coming in. Tom Roderick, writing for Stifel, said of the earnings report, “The company once again finds itself sitting atop the throne with its head held high and its crown intact after its revenue, EPS and Current Remaining Performance Obligations beat expectations.” Roderick’s $195 price target indicates confidence in a 28% upside potential.Also weighing in on CRM was Canaccord’s Richard Davis, the 1 rated analyst in TipRanks’ database. He said, “…the results were good in every metric that mattered and allayed investor fears of a slowdown. We like the current valuation.” His price target, slightly conservative at $185, still suggests room for a 22% upside to CRM shares.Like the other stocks in this list, Salesforce has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The consensus is based an impressive 30 buy ratings, and only 1 hold. The average price target, $186, suggests a 22% upside from the current share price of $151.Find CRM, and many more trending stocks, at TipRanks’ Trending Stocks tool, and see what the analysts are saying now.",3 Software Stocks that Outperformed the Market Rout

2019-08-28,"There's really only one question when it comes to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock  -- what is it worth?Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com After all, this is a wonderful business. Revenue growth comes in over 20% annually like clockwork. There's some competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But Salesforce has established its dominance in CRM. Switching costs are high and acquisitions combined with marketing and commerce cloud offerings provide additional growth drivers.But CRM stock isn't cheap. Even raised earnings per share guidance following the company's fiscal second-quarter report last week still suggests a price-to-earnings multiple of 54x. There is some noise in there due to accounting surrounding the company's recent acquisitions. Among mature companies, Salesforce stock is up there with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as perhaps one of the two most dearly valued stocks in the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, I've long argued that CRM stock is a key barometer of market sentiment. If the argument really is about valuation, then CRM's valuation suggests what investors are willing to pay for growth. Right now, after a strong earnings report, that suggests the gains at least in tech may be set to stall out. CRM Stock Gains Modestly After EarningsIt's not a good thing that Salesforce stock only gained 2.3% after its Q2 earnings report last week. The report itself was a blowout. Adjusted EPS beat expectations by $0.19. Revenue growth of 22% was a point better than expected.Full-year guidance was raised on both the top and bottom lines. Both figures were well ahead of the Street, particularly in terms of profits. Analysts on average had expected $2.68 in non-GAAP EPS this year; Salesforce guided for $2.82-$2.84.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income And yet CRM stock gained barely 2%. Admittedly, there are two factors at play here. First, investors likely expected a beat. Salesforce hasn't missed either revenue or profit estimates in at least six years. The so-called &quot;whisper number&quot; likely was higher than Street estimates suggested.Secondly, as InvestorPlace's Tyler Craig noted, Salesforce picked the wrong day for a blowout report. Trade war concerns pressured the market in trading on Friday, the day after earnings. And so a 7% after-hours spike turned into a just a 2%+ regular session gain. Why Salesforce Stock Reflects the MarketOf course, the fact that market worries pressured Salesforce stock is precisely the point. Worried investors are going to question paying 50x+ earnings for any stock. They're going to look at taking profits when and if they can.And the longer-term trend in CRM stock certainly suggests there's a ceiling on valuation at this point. CRM shares snapped back from a Q4 selloff -- but have traded essentially sideways since February. That stretch includes three earnings beats. Yet Salesforce stock has shown a consistent, and often bearish, pattern of lower highs and lower lows (if modestly so on both fronts).The question to ask would be: What's really changed with the Salesforce story? The answer is essentially nothing. Yet the stock is drifting downward. That's a market effect, not a Salesforce problem. And it suggests that the days of investors paying continually higher prices for growth have come to an end. Next WeekFor Salesforce stock, that does suggest that investors worried about the market as a whole might want to take profits. Nimble traders might also keep a close eye on CRM stock, shorting any spikes and buying any dips (like the move to $140 earlier this month that quickly reversed).For investors more broadly, the trading in Salesforce stock only adds to the general sense of caution, if not dread, in the market right now. There are a lot of external worries -- and not a lot of cheap stocks out there, particularly in tech.But I'd also recommend putting a check on the response to CRM stock -- which after all, is only one stock. As I noted in &quot;3 Earnings Reports to Watch,&quot; high-flyers Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) report this week. Those stocks, too, should provide a barometer on sentiment.Reactions similar to those that met CRM stock could provide further proof that, as Barron's wrote in July, software stocks are showing signs of a bubble. And they'd show that after a decade-long bull market, investor focus is returning to valuation over growth at all costs.As of this writing, Vince Martin held none of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) surged to record highs on Tuesday after an analyst upgraded Shopify stock. The ecommerce platform has defied predictions and rose to record highs amid optimism about the future of e-commerce.Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com However, valuations concerns with SHOP have arisen, and the equity gave back its Tuesday gains during Wednesday's trading sessions.Although nobody can tell whether Shopify will stop moving higher anytime soon, investors take on high levels of risk by buying at current levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shopify continues to receive upgradesSHOP stock moved higher on Tuesday as Rosenblatt raised its price target from $410 to $481 per share. Analyst Mark Zgutowicz predicted that revenue from the Shopify Fulfillment Network will surge from $300 million in 2021 to over $6 billion by 2025. Zgutowicz also raised revenue estimates for future years.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Yes, investors have good reason to believe in the Shopify business model. I have often contrasted it with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as this &quot;anti-Amazon&quot; allows small businesses to open their own ecommerce store without any involvement from the ecommerce giant.It also enables stores that would otherwise have only a local reach to find customers throughout the world. Moreover, it can bring innovative products to market without having to rely on larger players.But nobody should confuse Shopify, the company, with Shopify stock. It has risen by about 190% since the beginning of the year, and 26% since Aug. 1, when the company announced its massive earnings beat. This stands in stark contrast to what I had forecasted back in June and on many other occasions.Yet, in spite of charges that it is a bubble setting itself up for a massive swoon, it continues to charge higher. The stock selloff last fall temporarily slowed SHOP down. Trade wars, inverted yield curves, analysts downgrades, and lengthy economic expansions have stopped many equities in their tracks. Not Shopify. Both myself and many of my colleagues have had to eat a lot of crow on SHOP stock. Cracks Are Starting to ShowThe question for investors is, does this justify a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 416? I still emphatically insist &quot;no.&quot; However, as we've proven over these last few months, investors may continue to bid Shopify stock higher.In fairness, Shopify stock deserves a high valuation. The Ottawa, Ontario-based firm plays a significant role in driving the future of ecommerce. Consequently, Wall Street forecasts profit growth of 63.2% this year and 56.5% in fiscal 2020. I consider that phenomenal growth, just not 416 times forward earnings phenomenal.However, as we all know, SHOP stock has traded mostly independent of the numbers. Still, even if the herd continues to ignore issues, I think the nature of this stock demands a reminder of those challenges.Shopify does not have a monopoly on small-business ecommerce sites. In addition to smaller names such as WooCommerce, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all compete in this space. Moreover, if a recession truly is coming, many of the small shops on which Shopify depends will shutter their stores.Clearly, few now seem to care. They could go on not caring for some time to come. However, as Warren Buffett's mentor Benjamin Graham said, the stock market is a weighing machine in the long run. Someday, it will weigh and weigh big. The Bottom Line on Shopify stockAlthough Shopify stock continues to defy predictions, traders face a high level of risk buying at today's prices. Admittedly, most have stopped caring about SHOP's stratospheric valuation.The upgrade from Rosenblatt shows price targets will follow suit as long as the stock keeps moving higher. Analysts such as myself have grown tired of guessing wrong on Shopify.Given the profit growth, I think SHOP stock will carry a high valuation for years to come. However, as soon as traders begin to care about PE ratios, it will matter and matter a lot. I would advise the risk-tolerant to go short, and everyone else to just go away when that time comes.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-10,"Undoubtedly, cloud services companies like Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) offer the most relevant products and platforms. With more organizations taking advantage of the connectivity and cost efficiencies that cloud functions provide, OKTA stock has witnessed a surge in buying interest.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com That said, the industry is still relatively in its infancy. While early leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have emerged to take the lead, there's no guarantee that they'll keep it. Technology is always in flux, and demand -- or lack thereof -- can change on a dime.Previously, this circumstance has benefited Okta stock. But recently, Wall Street has apparently take a dim view on the cloud and various tech names. On Monday, OKTA stock dropped nearly 10%. That made it one of the worst performers of the day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Happened to OKTA Stock?Naturally, whenever we see a massive hemorrhaging in the markets, we want (or demand) an explanation. In most cases, the answer is apparent: A company flubbed an earnings report or the industry faces a decimation in revenue-making opportunities.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market But with Okta stock, none of these things apply. For one thing, shares have absolutely skyrocketed this year. Even with Monday's market erosion, OKTA is up almost 73%. That, my friends, is what we call resiliency.It also points to the fact that, up until at least recently, investors believed in the narrative for OKTA stock. A quick rundown of their client list reads like a &quot;who's who&quot; of major industry players. For example, we're talking about names like JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Western Union (NYSE:WU).Fundamentally Okta stock is on the up and up. About two weeks ago, OKTA released its earnings report for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a bull, the company provided exactly what you could hope to expect. On the profitability front, the company narrowed an expected loss of 10 cents per share to a loss of 5 cents. On the top line, OKTA rang up $140.5 million, easily surpassing the consensus estimate of $131 million.Yet OKTA stock dropped on the financial disclosure, puzzling many onlookers. Curiously, shares never really recovered. For those hoping that Monday would provide a fresh spark, they were obviously badly disappointed.Worst of all, no one knows why. However, peer-to-peer comparisons offer some clues. For example, several rivals, including Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) incurred double-digit losses on Monday. Although it's speculation, investors may be rotating out of tech plays and into what are perceived as safer opportunities. Portfolio Shifting May Have Hurt OKTA StockIn the absence of a better explanation, investors probably shifted their exposure to safer bets. This in turn created, and then later amplified, volatility in OKTA stock.First, while the cloud services company's bulls have lauded its growth trajectory, I must bring up the counterargument: The robustness of that growth has declined significantly in magnitude.For example, back in Q1 of calendar 2017, OKTA generated $49.3 million, which was good for an 82% lift from the year-ago quarter. In the most recent earnings report, the year-over-year lift was comparatively small at 48.5%. With the exception of a few quarters, the sales growth rate has consistently declined between Q1 2017 to Q2 2019.Ordinarily, that shouldn't cause panic. Because of the law of small numbers, it is increasingly difficult to sustain outrageously high growth rates as the nominal revenues get bigger. However, OKTA's quarterly revenue is now $140 million, which isn't that big compared to its market capitalization of $13 billion. Thus, investors might be freaked out about the rich premium on Okta stock.A second point to consider is which names jumped on Monday. I can't help but notice that energy-related names, like Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) outperformed. Perhaps with the noise President Donald Trump's administration has been making geopolitically, investors see value in recently undervalued companies. How to Approach OKTAOverall, I have reservations about engaging a technically overheated play like OKTA stock. Even with Monday's decline, I still have these reservations.Irrespective of your opinion about Okta stock, we must respect that the markets severely penalized it. With the volatility, shares are now sandwiched in between the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average. It's currently straddling an area of weak support, suggesting further volatility.For conservative investors, I'd stay away for now. If on the other hand you're bullish on OKTA, you might enjoy this discount. Still, my bet is that a deeper discount lies ahead for those who wait.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"The back and forth in the current market could be caused by several different issues. Besides trade and falling profits, one important concern is psychological -- investors are worried about a repeat of the 2018 bear market that kicked off this same time last year.We aren't usually much for &quot;seasonality&quot; or seasonal investing, but fears of a third or fourth quarter decline probably still have traders temporarily on edge. As a result, we want to earn income on our long stock position in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which we've been managing since our ADBE August 9th $302.50 Put Write expired in the money.Rather than branch out into new positions on new stocks, we can sell a covered call on ADBE and collect income while we wait for the rest of the market to settle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Waiting on the European Central Bank  A renewed rally in the major indexes would likely push ADBE higher, but the European Central Bank's (ECB) announcement on Thursday is our focus right now. The chair of the ECB will host a press conference following the central bank's interest rate decision this Thursday.Any signs the ECB will step the in to market with more stimulus should help ADBE find support now that it has broken below $280. The ECB's announcement could even send ADBE's price slightly higher in the short term.While it may sound odd to suggest the ECB will affect ADBE's short-term prospects, the health of the European Union is very important to ADBE's growth rates.ADBE provides software services to businesses all over the world, and any relief for the European economy could stimulate business growth. If the ECB announces new rounds of easing, business spending could pick up, and ADBE could see subscription growth.That growth would benefit our long stock position in both the short and long term, and it's one of the reasons we think now is a good time to trade on ADBE. Stuck in a Tight Range  Like most tech stocks, ADBE has been stuck in a tight range. Trade and interest rate volatility have kept new buyers from stepping into the stock, pushing the stock lower.While that isn't great for our long stock position, it does present us a good opportunity to sell covered calls against ADBE for more income.Daily Chart of Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) -- Chart Source: TradingViewADBE made lower highs throughout August, and its next down-trending resistance level is at around $290. Since we are selling a covered call, we want to choose a strike price that ADBE is unlikely to cross.We think that, even with the potential boost from easing in Europe, ADBE will stay below the $290 in the short term. If it does, we can sell another covered call for more income while we wait for ADBE to rise above $302.50, the original price we purchased it for.To find out which ADBE covered calls we're selling--and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades--sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.InvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

2019-09-11,"Terrifying and quick-to-counter terrific headline tweets are no way to buy or sell tech stocks. In today's often volatile market, trusting the price charts of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and applying smart trading strategies to those decisions is the only way to navigate and profit in a daily and ongoing trade war. Let me explain.August was undoubtedly a tough one for the market and even more so for many technology stocks. For a time and in the first part of the month, countering trade war jabs from the U.S. and China and an inverted-yield curve got the better of Wall Street. And let's just say, conditions turned quickly ugly on the price charts of most risk-assets.But given the medium of Twitter and unusual negotiating skill set of POTUS, taking any particular day's headline and message to the market as written in stone is a fool's game. And by the second half of August, Wall Street was already picking up the pieces. On Aug. 13 the broader indices quietly scored a bullish and historically robust follow through day amid still chaotic headlines and uncertain political theater.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now At the end of the day, investors have to ask themselves if it's better to react to the loose cannon in charge or proactively listen and watch the price charts for clues to what the future holds. When it comes to tech stocks ADBE, TWLO and SHOP, the decision of whether to buy or short shares is an easy one. Tech Stocks to Buy: Adobe (ADBE)Adobe is a large cap, household name that has been around nearly as long as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And right now the ever-popular software graphics powerhouse is setting up as a buy.On the weekly price chart, shares of Adobe are testing prior pattern resistance and the 38% level for support as stochastics sets up in oversold territory with a bullish crossover signal.My suggestion is to allow for a bit of price confirmation on the weekly time frame before buying ADBE stock. As we move into the second half of the trading week, a move through $285 with an initial stop-loss of 5% looks about right, without waiting on a picture-perfect entry. Twilio (TWLO)Twilio is sending a loud and clear message to short shares on the weekly price chart. The in-app communications specialist is a high-profile growth play. Still, as any seasoned investor knows, even the best stocks go through corrections from time to time. Right now appears to be one of those periods.  * 7 Strong-Buy Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Now Currently TWLO stock has broken below bear flag support this week. Shares are slightly oversold as evidenced by Twilio's stochastics and price action pressed into the lower Bollinger Band. As such, I'd wait for a small counter-trend rally before positioning. More importantly, given this tech stock's bullish run over the past two years, its troublesome failure through trendline support and its wide Fibonacci zone that's still untested, this one is a short! Shopify (SHOP)I'm a buyer of cloud-based business solutions platform Shopify, but only if today's price support holds. The weekly chart shows SHOP stock is challenging trendline support and prior pattern resistance tied to a high-level corrective base.Ultimately and similar to TWLO, Fibonacci support still isn't in play and that's obviously a concern. As stated above, all stocks, even a great growth story like Shopify, is bound to have periods of bearish price action which will test bulls' mettle. And given this technology stock's impressive rally in 2019, that point is all the more important to prepare for.Given the potential for more impactful and not necessarily benign volatility, I'd advise using the SHOP stock daily chart. The lesser time frame shows a bullish stochastics crossover in oversold territory as weekly technical support is being tested. If necessary, exiting below this week's lows if shares fall beneath $333 makes good sense both off and on the price chart.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-09-13,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season has ended, and once again, stocks have rallied. One might think that a lighter earnings calendar would be troublesome for stocks, given that news for U.S. corporations remains mostly positive. It hasn't played out that way.Indeed, stocks began to gain in early June once earnings reports had slowed to a trickle. The S&P 500 then turned south in late July -- at the peak of earnings season. Last week, with reports for major companies pretty much complete, U.S. equities again bounced: as of this writing, the S&P 500 is back above 3,000.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been an odd trend, but one that suggests the rally in stocks has at least a month to go. Interestingly, the earnings calendar does give investors a chance to check that thesis next week.There actually are several key companies reporting next week that will give data on key areas of the economy and the market. Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) can give a read on the confidence of the consumers who are supporting the economy. Results from office furniture manufacturers Herman Miller (NASDAQ:MLHR) and Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) should show confidence on the business side. Reaction to the second-quarter report from Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) will highlight investor attitudes toward, and patience with, newer IPO stocks, some of which have struggled.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy But three earnings reports next week look even more helpful in trying to judge investor sentiment at the moment. A classic tech growth stock will get another challenge. An economic bellwhether delivers an always-important release. And a consumer leader will update on the progress of its turnaround in an industry that has seen some trouble. For investors trying to figure out if history will repeat itself, these are the three earnings reports to watch now. FedEx (FDX)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrEarnings Report Date: Tuesday, September 17, after market closeEarnings from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) historically have been seen as a proxy for corporate sentiment. After all, FedEx revenue was pretty much directly linked to U.S. business spending. Strong results from FedEx usually meant confident executives and a positive macroeconomic outlook.FedEx doesn't quite have the status it used to, but its report still matters. FedEx management actually has been bearish in recent quarters, owing in large part to trade war issues. With the domestic economy still strong, management might have different news to deliver this time around. And a bullish stance from FedEx could be enough of a catalyst to give U.S. equities a further boost.Meanwhile, the quarter is a key one for FDX stock itself. FDX shares have been stuck in a range since December. They're down over one-third from early 2018 highs. Investors are worried about pending competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a potential cyclical turn. For a rally into earnings to hold, FedEx needs to put up a strong quarter and inspire some confidence from investors in itself. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, September 17, after market closeAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) seemed to get the benefit of the doubt after its fiscal second-quarter report in June. The combination of soft guidance and a high valuation often sends a stock tumbling, but ADBE actually rose after the report, and kept climbing.In a seeming reversal of the market-wide trend, it's been a lack of news that's been trouble for Adobe stock since. ADBE has pulled back 11% from late July highs, and heads into earnings near a three-month low.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now With that pullback, Adobe stock looks more intriguing at 28x forward earnings. But at that multiple, and with growth likely to slow at some point, ADBE still has valuation concerns. That makes earnings an interesting test. Does a strong earnings report lead Adobe stock to rebound? If the answer is no, that suggests valuation is becoming a more important factor in the cloud space. That would make Adobe earnings an omen for other stocks across tech. General Mills (GIS)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, September 18, before market openEarnings from General Mills (NYSE:GIS), too, will impact entire sectors. GIS stock was collapsing less than a year ago, but increasing investor optimism toward its turnaround, and its pivot into pet food, has led to strong performance in 2019.It's important to the industry that General Mills keep performing with its fiscal Q1 report on Wednesday morning. After it looked last year like the consumer packaged goods space was in trouble, many stocks have rallied. There's a growing belief that the industry can adapt to competition from smaller, focused brands -- and from private label rivals being backed by supermarket customers.General Mills numbers need to be good enough to keep that confidence intact. This is a stock up 39% so far this year in a sector that, with a few exceptions, generally has rallied. Investors clearly are pricing in better news going forward. If General Mills can't deliver, there's a long way down to go.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-16,"In the month of September, there has been a significant, sharp and quick shift out of momentum stocks -- which have been working all year long -- into value stocks -- which haven't been working for a long time. In this shift, no momentum stock has been spared, not even blue-chip cloud computing giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). In fact, over the past five years, ADBE stock has experienced a 10% correction only five times, which is very few for a momentum growth stock.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Right now, ADBE stock is in the midst of one those 10% corrections. How did the other five corrections play out? With a big ADBE stock rebound, and huge gains in the long run.This will one play out in a similar fashion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the big picture, there's nothing wrong with momentum stocks or ADBE stock. Instead, investors are simply voicing confidence in the economy by booking profits on their momentum winners, and buying the dip in beaten up, economically sensitive stocks. Historically speaking, such a pivot has almost always happened right before big market rallies. Thus, zooming out, this shift out of momentum stocks will pass soon. When it does, it'll be replaced by a cyclical bull market rally in all stocks.With respect to ADBE stock, you still have a secular growth stock supported by favorable long-term trends, with big revenue growth rates, even bigger margins and an exceptional clarity to big profit growth in the long run. On top of all that, recent weakness has plunged ADBE stock into slightly undervalued territory -- a rarity for a secular winner.Net net, don't worry about the recent weakness in ADBE stock. It isn't indicative of much. Instead, embrace it, and use it to buy at a discount. The Fundamentals Are Rock SolidThe fundamentals underlying ADBE stock are about as good as it gets.Long story short, Adobe is the unchallenged leader in a secular growth market, with a robust track record of big revenue growth, a ton of runway to keep growing and sky-high margins that are only moving higher.Let's break this down. The digital media market is a secular growth one. There are three big secular trends here. One, everything is going digital -- consumers everywhere are spending more time on their phones, computers and tablets than ever before. Two, everything is going visual -- an increasing amount of time spent in the digital channel is spent with visually focused apps, such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, etc. Three, consumers and enterprises alike are increasingly producing and sharing digital media content.The result? A secular rise in consumer and enterprise demand for digital media and marketing products. This secular rise has powered consistent 20%-plus revenue growth at Adobe over the past several years.This big growth streak has a lot of runway left. When you combine all of Adobe's verticals -- ranging from helping consumers create movies, to helping businesses digitize their documents and workflows, to improving digital media campaigns for enterprises, the addressable market here is north of $100 billion. Adobe's revenues this year are expected at just over $11 billion. Thus, there's plenty of room for this big growth narrative to stay big.Perhaps most importantly, in this space, Adobe is first, and there's no close second. Because of this, the company commands tremendous pricing power over customers. This leads to big gross margins, which stand at nearly 90% today. They could go even higher with murmurs of another price hike on the way.Big picture -- Adobe stock has all the ingredients of a long-term winner. The Valuation Leaves Room for UpsideUsually, when a stock has all the ingredients of a long-term winner like Adobe stock, that stock persistently trades at a premium valuation because investors are willing to pay a premium for all those winning ingredients.That isn't the case today, and that means this is a rare opportunity to buy Adobe stock at a discount.The numbers here are easy to follow. Adobe has reported 20%-plus revenue growth in each of the past several years, and 25%-plus revenue growth each quarter this year. In other words, this is a big growth company whose growth momentum isn't slowing. Given the aforementioned secular trends supporting the digital media market and the $100 billion-plus addressable opportunity here, I don't see Adobe's top-line momentum slowing much into the foreseeable future.Nor do analysts.Consensus Street estimates call for 24% revenue growth this year, 18% revenue growth next year and 15% revenue growth in 2021. Into 2025, revenue growth should realistically remain north of 10%, putting revenues on a visible pathway toward $25 billion by 2025, from $9 billion in 2018.Gross margins are around 88%. They should inch towards 90% thanks to gradual price hikes. The opex rate hovers around 50%. It has room to fall towards 40% in the long run as revenues more than double over the next several years and big revenue growth drives positive operating leverage.Net net, Adobe could very reasonably turn into a 50% operating margin company by 2025 with revenues of about $25 billion. That combination makes $23 in earnings-per-share seem doable by then. Based on a growth stock average 21-times forward multiple and a 10% discount rate, that implies a 2019 price target of about $300 for ADBE stock. Bottom Line on ADBE StockAdobe stock is down 10% over the past few weeks. But, there's nothing wrong with Adobe stock. The fundamentals remain strong, the valuation remains reasonable, and the optics remain favorable.As such, this 10% selloff is nothing more than a small, normal and temporary correction in an otherwise still healthy long-term uptrend. What's the best thing to do with such temporary corrections? Buy the dip.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.

2019-09-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current period that fell short of Wall Street estimates, signaling slower sales growth for its newer marketing products.Revenue will be about $2.97 billion in the period ending in November, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected $3.02 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has made several acquisitions in the past two years for marketing and e-commerce products to boost revenue, which has climbed at least 20% each quarter since 2015. While the company has put more emphasis on corporate applications to compete with rivals Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp., it also recently unveiled new augmented reality and 3D-imaging technology to maintain its advantage as the leader in creative software such as its flagship product, Photoshop.Sales from Adobe’s experience cloud division, which includes marketing, analytics and e-commerce tools, are projected to increase 23% in the current period after climbing 34% in the fiscal third quarter. Executives said products gained from its 2018 acquisition of Marketo aren’t growing as fast as anticipated. Adobe plans to invest more money to boost sales in the unit, according to prepared remarks from Chief Financial Officer John Murphy.Murphy said Adobe also has had challenges generating bookings for its Analytics Cloud, which sits atop a new Experience Platform meant to connect clients’ data. The company believes the ongoing global introduction of the software platform will lift revenue, he said.Adobe’s shares declined about 3% in extended trading after closing at $284.69 in New York. The stock has climbed 26% this year after a 29% gain in 2018.Profit, excluding some items, will be $2.25 per share in current quarter, the company said. Analysts estimated $2.30 a share.In the period ended Aug. 30, sales jumped 24% to $2.83 billion from a year earlier. Adjusted profit was $2.05 a share. Analysts projected profit of $1.97 a share on revenue of $2.82 billion.Sales in the creative cloud division, which includes Photoshop, jumped 22% to $1.96 billion in the quarter and are projected to increase 20% in the current period.(Updates with additional details on experience cloud’s slower growth in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Projects Slower Sales Growth for Marketing Products

2019-09-17,"Currently, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is going from strength to strength in terms of its revenue and operating earnings. Its focus on helping business clients &quot;digitally transform&quot; themselves in all aspects of cloud marketing and analysis is working extremely well. But CRM stock is priced for perfection.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com Salesforce has a market value of almost $135 billion. Stripping away all the hype about its sales growth, its actual free cash flow (&quot;FCF&quot;) was only $2.06 billion in the last six months ending in July. So its valuation is 33 times annualized FCF.It's also priced at 50 times future earnings per share, another high-flying valuation for CRM stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow to be fair, free cash flow is up 26.5% year-over-year. This is a very respectable growth rate. But it has to continue to accelerate to justify these high valuation metrics.There is another reason why the market keeps CRM stock's valuation so high. SaaS Revenue Gets Valued Higher In Stocks like SalesforceThe market loves subscription revenue companies like CRM. About 94% of CRM's revenue is Subscription-as-a-Service (&quot;SaaS&quot;).  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip These SaaS clients tend to be sticky. It becomes a big hassle for a large company like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) to switch out of Salesforce's marketing system software. When the renewal comes around for the software contract, the decision is usually &quot;stay.&quot;In fact, analysts and CRM itself use a special metric to measure this &quot;stickiness.&quot; Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) Is Key for CRM StockAnalysts use a non-GAAP accounting measure called &quot;Remaining Performance Obligation&quot; (&quot;RPO&quot;) to measure future sales growth. This includes unbilled and non-accrued deferred revenue which will be billed within the next 12 months. CRM calls this &quot;current RPO.&quot;This metric also includes as unbilled, non-accrued deferred revenue (&quot;non-current RPO&quot;) which won't be billed within 12 months. This is effectively the remainder of the signed life of subscription contracts. This non-current RPO is a measure of how many years of built-in revenue (upon renewal) can be expected and later billed. The total of current and non-current RPO equals total RPO.Here's what analysts love about Salesforce: its total RPO grew by 20% to $25.7 billion by the end of the second quarter (July). CRM stock can count on $25 billion in future revenue if it does not bring in any new SaaS clients.In fact, CRM's current RPO -- i.e. the dollar amount of sales that can be expected over the next 12 months -- is now $12.1 billion. Keep in mind that in Q2 CRM had $4 billion in sales, or $16 billion annualized. So three-fourths of the next fiscal years' sales are already &quot;in the bag&quot; as current RPO.Salesforce &quot;bakes in&quot; its growth with sticky subscription revenue. So growth is almost unavoidable. CRM has to bring in only one-quarter of last year's new client base. That would match the previous year's growth rate in sales.That's why the market is willing to place such a high valuation on the Salesforce stock. So why am I recommending not buying CRM stock right now? The Market Has a Love-Hate Relationship with CRM StockThe truth is that analysts hate high-flying names like Salesforce stock at market lows. For example, in 2018 CRM rose 55.5% at the peak of the &quot;love&quot; cycle. But by the end of the year, it was up only 31.7% for the year.This same love-hate thing happened this summer. CRM stock fell from its high of $167.56 to a summer hate-low of $139 and change.The market gets nervous about overpaying for the company's expected growth. You can see this in a CNBC roundtable where analysts were negative at the end of last year on the stock right at its bottom. Guidance for CRM Stock Is Attractive, But Be Wary of the Valuation Salesforce provided guidance for its Q3 and full fiscal year on page 5 of its Q2 earnings presentation. CRM forecasted revenue growth of 26 to 27% and current RPO growth of 24-25%.The problem is these numbers do not show growth that is accelerating. But CRM stock's high-flying valuation assumes incrementally higher growth rates.Therefore I suspect CRM stock is vulnerable to any downdraft in the general market. This is especially so if there is a possibility of a slow-down in corporate profits growth.In summary, pick your spot with CRM stock. You can buy it at a cheaper price sometime in the future. The market is valuing the expected growth at a high price right now.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-18,"After a couple of quiet days for equity investors, we finally got some action in the stock market today. The move comes after the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds rates.Just the day before, we had noted that the likelihood went from a sure-fire rate cut a few weeks ago to a coin toss. Well, the Fed delivered with lower rates and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed will be accommodating in the future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) climbed 0.1%, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) rallied 0.2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) slipped 0.04%.  Fed CutsWhile the Fed statement says it will be accommodating, the group does not seem interested in a spree of rate cuts. That's according to the voting members and where they stand in regards to cutting rates both this month and throughout the rest of the year.That's not to say they will not cut rates -- the Fed overall sees at least one more rate cut this year -- but the group's stance caused some dovish investors to recoil initially.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars Have no fear, though. While Powell said he doesn't anticipate negative interest rates, such as in the European Union, he also said the Fed may have to raise its balance sheet sooner than expected. Further, the Fed will only stop taking accommodating action once it is warranted.If anything, it was a reassuring meeting where equity investors got the rate cut they wanted and heard the Fed has their back. Powell called it an &quot;insurance&quot; move, and that's exactly what it was. Roku WreckedDespite the accommodating stance of the Fed, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was smashed on the day. Shares had already declined notably from its highs near $176, but they were holding up pretty well between $140 and $150 as the 20-day moving average was buoying the stock.That is, until today.Despite Guggenheim analysts maintaining their &quot;buy&quot; rating and moving their price target from $119 to $170, the stock plunged more than 14% at one point. The stock came within this close of hitting its 50-day moving average on the decline.From a trading perspective, it's got some investors wondering if ROKU will test and hold this mark, or if it will knife right through it like so many other red-hot tech stocks did earlier this month.In any regard, the decline comes as both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announce over-the-top products and platforms. Increasing competition, especially from these juggernauts, dealt a blow to Roku today. Let's see where it ends up finding support. Movers in the Stock Market TodayAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) initially took a tumble after reporting earnings. The company beat on earnings and revenue expectations, but provided lower-than-expected guidance for next quarter. As such, shares sank 1.8% on the day.(Here's how to trade Adobe stock now, by the way).Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) were creamed on Wednesday and deservedly so. Revenue was flat year-over-year and in line with expectations, while earnings missed analysts' expectations. Worse, the company cut its full-year revenue and earnings outlook, with the midpoint of the latter coming in roughly 16% below consensus estimates. Shares fell almost 13% and hover just above its 52-week lows. The result is also ushering in a slew of Wall Street downgrades.Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) fell 6.2% after the company reported earnings. Revenue grew 43% year-over-year and topped expectations, while earnings missed estimates. However, margins expanded and EBITDA topped estimates. Let's see how this recent IPO does in the coming days and weeks.General Mills (NYSE:GIS) slipped 0.9% after beating earnings and missing on revenue expectations. Management reaffirmed its full-year outlook and while the quarter wasn't great, it wasn't terrible either.

2019-09-18,"A trio of earnings announcements set the tone at the top of Wednesday's PreMarket Prep show.  After the close on Tuesday, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) disappointed the Street with a third-quarter miss along lower guidance for 2020 EPS and sales.  The next issue on the hit parade was Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY).","PreMarket Prep Recap: A Trio Of Earnings Debacles, Facebook Pulls A Fast One On Roku"

2019-09-18,"It has been a quiet week, but stocks were on the move Wednesday after the Fed announced it would cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Let's look at a few top stock trades going forward. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: RokuRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was by far the top focus on Wednesday, with shares falling more than 14% at one point. The fall comes despite the stock consolidating at its 20-day moving average and receiving a nice price target increase on the day. However, both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced over-the-top streaming products for its customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems like investors were just looking for an excuse to sell Roku. After all though, shares ran from ~$100 pre-earnings to more than $175 a month later. As if a 75% rally in one month weren't absurd enough, shares were up almost four-fold from the December lows before that rally.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars So what now?Shares puked right down into the 50-day moving average. Is it still enough to unwind that overbought condition? We won't know until ROKU puts in a few more sessions. Right now, it certainly looks like more losses could be on the way.Perhaps not in the next day or two, but looking forward to the intermediate term. That said, we don't have a crystal ball and we need to keep watch day by day.At $120, Roku stock would be back to its gap-up post-earnings open and at the 38.2% retracement. Should we get a Q4 swoon where the market is hit hard, one could see a scenario where Roku is back down into the $100 to $110 level.A reversal could change the tune for Roku, with bulls back in control if shares reclaim the 23.6% and the 20-day moving average. Let's start with the 50-day and see how Roku does from there. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Adobe SystemsAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell after reporting earnings, but held a very key spot. Support came into play from the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line).I would love to see ADBE stock reclaim the key $277 level, as well as the 20-day moving average. In this event, look for a possible rally up to the 50-day moving average.Below Wednesday's low is cause for concern for longs. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Beyond MeatBeyond Meat (NYSE:BYND) is on the move lower after Tim Horton's will reportedly pull BYND's products from most of its locations.So far though, BYND remains mostly range-bound. Below uptrend support near $145, and range support at $140 is on the table. Below that mark certainly raises a red flag for bulls, but if it holds, a rebound could be in store.Should support hold or should Beyond not even fall to that point, look for a possible rally to range resistance near $170 and the 50-day moving average, currently near $168. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Bristol-Myers SquibbAfter hitting a low point in July, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock has been slowly but surely making its way higher. Remember it's in the midst of acquiring Celgene (NYSE:CELG) too.In any regard, look to see if we can get a move over $50. If so, it puts a run up to $53 on the table.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip On the downside, I want to see prior short-term resistance near $48 act as support. Below uptrend support and/or the 20-day moving average, and BMY may need more time to setup.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long CELG.

2019-09-18,"Enterprise software has been one of the most notable bright spots in the tech world. Just look at some of the recent IPOs which have soared in value from companies like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and Elastic (NYSE:ESTC) But even mature firms, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), have rejuvenated their businesses.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com And then there is IBM (NYSE:IBM). The company whiffed on the cloud. It also whiffed on mobile. And even in AI (artificial intelligence) - in which IBM has invested for a  long time - the results have been mixed.The irony is that IBM should have been a huge beneficiary of these trends. It has a trusted brand, a global footprint (it has 60 datacenters across the world) and a massive customer base. But unfortunately, the company did not adapt quickly enough.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars  The Good News for IBM StockDespite all its problems, IBM is still healthy from a financial standpoint, as it continues to generate substantial cash flows. The company also has incredibly talented employees.More importantly for IBM stock, the company has made critical moves to restructure its operations. Specifically, it has eliminated jobs and unloaded non-core assets, while also retooling its software to keep up with the competition.But I think the most consequential point is that the company has been willing to make big bets, as shown by its $34 billion mega-acquisition of Red Hat.True, there is a good deal of irony in this deal. When Linux and other open-source software platforms emerged in the 1990s, IBM's reaction was to fight back - and hard.But it was a losing battle. Open-source software has become a critical part of companies' arsenals. So with the Red Hat deal, IBM has become the leader of the space.There are clear benefits to open-source software. Specifically,  adoption of it can be rapid because the technology is free and it's continuously being updated by developers.Red Hat has been able to leverage its technology to create an extensive platform that enables a hybrid cloud environment. Because of security, privacy and regulatory concerns, larger companies need to combine different, i.e. hybrid, options when it comes to the cloud. For example, they can utilize a mix of private and public clouds. Among the companies that provide public cloud infrastructure are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and MSFT. As a result of this need for flexibility, the flexibility of the open-source model, for the most part, has proven to be spot-on.As part of IBM, Red Hat will benefit from the tech giant's tremendous distribution capabilities. What's more, the cloud opportunity is still massive. IBM believes that the typical enterprise has only transitioned 20% of its data  to the cloud.Here's what the Senior Vice President and Chief Analyst of research firm IDC , Frank Gens, said about the acquisition of Red Hat: &quot;As organizations seek to increase their pace of innovation to stay competitive, they are looking to open source and a distributed cloud environment to enable a new wave of digital innovation that wasn't possible before. Over the next five years, IDC expects enterprises to invest heavily in their journeys to the cloud, and innovation on it. A large and increasing portion of this investment will be on open hybrid and multicloud environments that enable them to move apps, data and workloads across different environments.&quot;In other words, the deal has the potential to generate growth for IBM and should help make Big Blue a major player in cloud computing. That should definitely be positive for IBM stock. The Bottom Line On International Business Machines StockI can understand why there is lots of skepticism regarding the bull case on IBM stock. Consider that, over the past five years, IBM stock price has fallen 2%.But I think the Red Hat deal will be a game changer that will get IBM stock back on track. In fact, investors are already more upbeat on the shares, as IBM stock price has  jumped 25% this year.There will likely be bumps in the road for IBM stock, as acquisitions are never easy. But with the dividend yield at 4.56% - one of the highest in the tech world - and the forward price-earnings ratio standing at only 10.5, IBM does look interesting.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.08% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.10%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.09%.Source: Shutterstock In the options pits, trading volumes came in well below average on Tuesday. Calls still led the way, as usual, with about 16.9 million calls and 13.7 million puts changing hands on the day. With today's looming Fed announcement, traders seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach.The gap between calls and puts increased enough to send the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio sliding back toward this month's lows at 0.56. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average pushed to yet another two-month low at 0.59.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity soared in stocks reporting earnings. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares are plunging this morning after whiffing on earnings. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) joined them in the dog house with weak forward guidance. Finally, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) saw call volumes zoom to the moon during a rousing stock rally.Let's take a closer look: FedEx (FDX)Optimism and powerful rotation into economically sensitive sectors buoyed FedEx shares ahead of last night's earnings report. In the three weeks leading up to it, FDX stock pushed 17.2% higher, from $147.82 to $173.30. Unfortunately, the improving sentiment proved ill-placed. FDX is getting thrashed (-10.6%) this morning after a disappointing quarterly report.For the fiscal first quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 on revenue of $17.05 billion. According to Refinitiv, the Street was estimated earnings of $3.15 on revenue of $17.06 billion. Adding insult to injury, FedEx also revised its full-year earnings guidance down to between $10 and $12 per share.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy The company had a laundry list of headwinds contributing to the poor performance, including trade tensions, policy uncertainty, rising FedEx Ground costs and the recent loss of its delivery contract with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).On the options trading front, activity was split evenly between calls and puts ahead of the report. Trading surged to over five times the average daily volume, with 93,539 total contracts traded.Options were pricing in a gap of $8.68 or 5%, so this morning's 10% drop falls well outside of expectations. Count this one as a big winner for volatility buyers ahead of the event. Adobe (ADBE)The trend of earnings disappointment continues this morning with Adobe. The software giant delivered earnings and revenue numbers that exceeded expectations for the quarter, but soft guidance sent shareholders for the hills.For the fiscal third quarter, Adobe earned $2.05 on revenue of $2.83 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.97 per share on $2.82 billion. Looking to the fourth quarter, the company expects $2.25 earnings-per-share on $2.97 billion in revenue.Ahead of the bell, ADBE stock is trading 3% lower. As far as price action goes, the gap only returns us to yesterday's lows, so it's not exactly a trend killer. The primary problem is the stock is already trending lower beneath its 50-day and 20-day moving averages, so this morning's weakness could kickstart a new downswing. Watch how the stock reacts to the 200-day moving average near $270. If we can stay above it, bulls have a chance. But if we break it, I have nothing nice to say.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts on Tuesday. Activity swelled to 478% of the average daily volume, with 107,852 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 62% of the session's sum.Premiums were baking in an overnight gap of $12.49 or 4.4%, so this morning's 3% decline is well within expectations. Snap (SNAP)Snap shares surged 6.8% amid heavy accumulation Tuesday. It was the largest gainer among all the liquid stocks in my watchlist Tuesday. The rally cleared short-term resistance setting the stage for a run toward its 52-week high at $18.36. Its price trend has been a beast all year long, and with SNAP now completing its recent consolidation pattern, the future looks bright.  * 7 Fantastic Fidelity Funds for a Range of Investors On the options trading front, the stock pop sparked a mad dash for call options. Total activity climbed to 256% of the average daily volume, with 286,595 contracts traded; 81% of the trading came from call options alone.With the increased demand, implied volatility jumped to 53%, placing it at the 14th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of 56 cents or 3.3%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Yet it's important to keep in mind that -- for the year so far -- the performance has still been pretty good. The 2019 return: a hefty 38%.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com This is in stark contrast to the fast five years when Qualcomm stock was essentially dead money (the average return was a mere 3%) as many other old-line tech companies did much better, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).  * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf Now the company certainly faces some notable headwinds. Of course, there is the wildcard of litigation. While the company got the benefit of a stay from an adverse opinion regarding a Federal Trade Commission ruling from the U.S. District court, there's no guarantee that Qualcomm will ultimately prevail. There are also various legal actions and claims in other jurisdictions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet perhaps the biggest problem for QCOM stock is the U.S.-China trade war. Consider that about two-thirds of revenues for the company come from China.Oh, and then there is the nagging issue with Huawei, which the U.S. has imposed severe restrictions on. Even though QCOM has found some workarounds, there has definitely been an adverse impact on sales. For example, during the latest quarter, the company reduced its full-year unit shipments of smartphones by 100 million to 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. Much of this was due to the situation in China. The Positives for QCOM StockDespite what's happening in China, I still think there are some potential catalysts that should help drive QCOM stock. One is the settlement of the patent dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This not only has cleared up a major legal cloud -- which could have been particularly damaging -- but also will result in a substantial revenue stream from royalties.Then there is 5G. In fact, this is likely to be game changer for QCOM stock. On the latest earnings call, CEO Steven Mollenkopf said: &quot;For the first calendar quarter of 2020, we anticipate reaching the inflection point as our financial results begin to reflect the benefits of our substantial efforts over the years to bring 5G to the market worldwide.&quot;No doubt, the company has been pushing the boundaries of innovation. This actually helps explain why AAPL settled its legal dispute. The company realized that it really needs QCOM technology.For example, one of the differentiators for the company is dynamic spectrum sharing, which allows carriers to seamlessly change 4G spectrum to 5G. This capability is likely to lead to more adoption.Next, there have been breakthroughs with security, millimeter wave and massive MIMO. What's more, QCOM is the only chipmaker that has 5G solutions for sub-6, gigahertz and millimeter wave bands.As a result, the company has been getting lots of traction. According to Mollenkopf on the earnings call: &quot;5G network rollouts are progressing at a much faster rate when compared to 4G. We expect over 20 operators to launch 5G service and over 20 OEMs to have 5G devices in the first 12 months after the first commercial launch. This compares to four operators and three OEMs with the launch of 4G with the major difference being that China is launching 5G in the first year.&quot; Bottom Line on QCOM StockWith 5G, there are no guarantees. Let's face it, there will need to be some killer apps to help with the growth. But given the significant increases in speed, it seems like a good bet that there will be interesting innovations that will emerge.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 In the meantime, QCOM stock is trading at reasonable levels, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 18x. There is also an attractive dividend of 3.1%. So all in all, QCOM stock does look like a good way to play the lucrative 5G megatrend.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

It was a blast to meet so many like-minded people… and to hear how much you guys get out of your Legacy membership.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI (Chris) hope to see you again at next year's event.  * 7 Next-Gen Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains And if you couldn't make it, I'll have more for you in tomorrow's Cut about the key takeaways from this year's event.So stay tuned for more on that…Summit regulars know it pays to come to our events…We held last year's inaugural summit in Bermuda. And we shared more than a dozen new recommendations with attendees.For instance, Palm Beach Trader editor Jason Bodner recommended five stocks - Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Paycom Software (NASDAQ:PAYC), Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD), and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN).Since Jason recommended these stocks last year, the average gain is 24%. And the top performer is up 63%.That compares with a 2.5% gain since then for our regular stand-in for the U.S. stock market, the S&P 500.If you'd acted on Jason's recommendation in Bermuda, in other words, you'd have made nearly five times the returns of the broad market.Jason is a pro…If you don't already know him, he made partner at Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald at the age of 28.And he became one of the few people on Wall Street with the authority to make trades worth $1 billion.Then, after 12 years in the trenches at Cantor, Jason took what he'd learned on the Street and built his own proprietary trading system.It's able to spot the multibillion-dollar trades he used to execute for his clients… and the price spikes they cause in stocks… before the rest of Wall Street finds out about them.This allows his readers to ride these stocks higher as billions of dollars flow into them over time.It's so successful, Jason sells his picks to hedge fund managers who want to emulate his success.Jason also has a track record of making money for his readers…His top three winners in the Palm Beach Trader model portfolio - TTD, PAYC, and SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG) - are up 115%, 95%, and 50% since he recommended them.But here's the thing…The folks in our marketing department tell me they've had a tough time getting our readers to grasp how profitable Jason's strategy is.That's why we're doing something special for you on October 2…I know you're skeptical of claims like the ones I'm making today.You should be. There are a lot of folks out there making big claims about systems that beat the market. And a lot of them are bogus.That's why, next Wednesday, Jason is going to show you on camera how he picks the stocks he recommends at Palm Beach Trader.And he's going to prove to you his strategy beats the market over time.How is he going to do that?Jason has put together a panel of industry experts to &quot;stress-test&quot; his strategy.You'll hear from a $2.5 billion money manager, Louis Navellier. He's been in the business for almost 40 years.

2019-10-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Zendesk Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mikkel Svane recently hosted a routine two-cocktail lunch for more than a dozen employees celebrating four years at his company and realized he no longer recognized most of his workforce.“I know there’s a lot of shiny objects out there, so I want to thank you for spending four years with the company,” Svane said to the employees. “Four years is a big number in the world of tech startups.”While the maker of customer-service software has been public since May 2014, co-founder Svane continues to think of it as a startup. Annual revenue growth has been more than 30% and analysts estimate it will top $1 billion in 2020. Zendesk has seen its stock jump almost eightfold since its initial public offering, and its workforce increase to 3,200 from less than 1,000 five years ago. Svane has sought to bolster his skills and assemble a strong team to manage all of them.Over the last year, the company has taken a series of steps to compete head-to-head against Salesforce.com Inc. It’s difficult to mount a serious challenge to the bellwether cloud applications company built by Marc Benioff. But Zendesk wants to expand while retaining transparent pricing and its distinctive quirks -- and avoiding the bragging that is a hallmark of the business technology market.On Thursday, during a user conference in San Francisco, Zendesk unveiled two more products meant to maintain sales momentum.The first is Sunshine Conversations, an extension of the company’s platform for managing customer relationships. The tool will help consumers make payments, browse products and book reservations in their preferred messaging system, Zendesk said in a statement.The second is called Gather, which will let clients such as Logitech International SA and InVision AG better provide customer support through online forums on their websites.The new products may help attract more large corporate customers. The company’s software already is used by Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc., Peloton Interactive Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc. -- companies born in the cloud-computing era that have grown alongside Zendesk.Chief Financial Officer Elena Gomez said Zendesk’s sales growth rate of more than 30% is sustainable.“For the foreseeable future, I would call that almost our floor,” she said in an interview.Svane, Alexander Aghassipour and Morten Primdahl founded Zendesk in Copenhagen in 2007. The company moved to San Francisco in 2009. Perhaps because he’s an outsider, Svane is the rare tech CEO who doesn’t see his job in grandiose terms.“Everybody wants to be Steve Jobs and change the world,” Svane said in an interview in a brick-lined boardroom that doubles as his office. “And for most of us, that’s not really the case. We build business software.”Still, the company has a strong philosophy on its work. It coined the word “humblident” -- a mash-up of humble and confident -- to describe its culture. While the word doesn’t roll off the tongue, executives said it’s an accurate way of describing the company’s demeanor, which they say is confident without being arrogant, and eager to earn the trust of clients.On Wednesday, Zendesk disclosed it suffered a data breach affecting 10,000 customer accounts created before November 2016. Hackers gained access to the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of business users and consumers, as well as concealed password information. Zendesk discovered the security lapse on Sept. 24 and said it found no evidence the passwords were used to access additional systems. The company said it hired forensic experts to assist with an investigation and notified law enforcement.“Our goal is to communicate this information as quickly as possible with transparency and guidance on how to address,” Zendesk said in a blog post. “We will be updating and sharing more information in this blog post and our help center as it becomes available.”Svane hopes to change the experience of business software users and their consumers so that their systems are simpler. He said most software is sold on “PowerPoints and lies” and he’s always wanted Zendesk to be different. The company has explicit pricing for its products on its website and pitches customers on the value of its software versus Salesforce.But Salesforce is the market leader. The company generates $3.6 billion from customer-service software each year, as well as $4 billion from its signature sales-tracking tool that has become the standard of the industry.Zendesk has competed well against Salesforce for small- and mid-sized clients though. Last year, Salesforce said it would sunset two sales and customer support tools that failed to catch on with smaller customers. Instead, Salesforce began offering pared-down versions of its high-end software.Zendesk has experienced some growing pains. After going public, new executives joined the company, leading to a period of cultural clashes and sales struggles. In the aftermath, Zendesk in August 2017 promoted Chief Information Officer Tom Keiser to chief operating officer, overseeing the sales organization and many operations as Svane focused on technology, vision and culture. The arrangement is similar to the one Salesforce has between co-CEOs Benioff, who co-founded the company, and Keith Block.Zendesk has also hired senior executives from Salesforce, Microsoft Corp., and Adobe Inc., who have experience running pieces of large organizations. Svane is open about needing as much help as he can get.“I still have a lot of work to do to be a fantastic CEO,” Svane said. “I think I’m a pretty good founder and I think having a founder CEO is a strength for a company because every single employee knows that I’m in it because I think it’s the most amazing thing and that I’m dedicated.”To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Zendesk Debuts New Products in Effort to Catch Salesforce

2019-10-04,"The third quarter was definitely a bumpy ride for the stock market. One could call it a roller coaster -- primarily because roller coasters usually drop you off at the same spot where you got on. The S&P 500 saw gains of just under 0.5%, the Dow Jones gained 0.75% and the Nasdaq lost a bit more than 1%.Must like the rest of the market, the Best Stocks for 2019 race didn't see a lot of lasting moves. A CBD company continues to move among the top five, a cutting-edge telahealth company holds onto second, and a direct-to-consumer retailer continues its explosive growth. There's one quarter left for big moves, but it's far from anyone's game.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? Without further ado, let's get into the Best Stocks for 2019, ranked from bottom to top.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10&#92;. Syrah Resources (SYAAF)Investor: Eric FryYear-to-Date Change Through Q3: -70%Q2 Ranking: 10The story for Syrah Resources (OTCMKTS:SYAAF) went from can it be the best stock for 2019 to can it survive 2019?It looks like it will. 2020 is a bit less likely. Beyond that…well SYAAF really needs that electric vehicle revolution to come soon.The bull thesis for Syrah is that as electric vehicles become more profitable, the companies that supply the materials needed for the cars' batteries will also take off. Graphite is an often overlooked one of these materials, and Syrah owns Balama Mine, the world's highest grade graphite mine. But the prices of these battery components didn't increase as expected.In his update, Eric Fry explained:&quot;Despite the booming market for electric vehicles worldwide, an &quot;echo boom&quot; in the prices of the so-called battery metals has failed to materialize. The prices of copper, cobalt, lithium, and graphite are all languishing near three-year lows. Nickel is the lone standout among the key battery metals, as its price recently hit a new five-year high.In response to the dire conditions in the graphite market, Syrah slashed production by two-thirds last month. And there is no guarantee that this deep production cut will be the last, as the price of graphite has slumped about 15% since the start of the year.&quot;Read more about SYAFF stock here. 9&#92;. Weibo (WB)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Investor: Kyle WoodleyYTD Change: -23%Q2 Ranking: 9Though it's up a modest 1.84% in Q3, Chinese digital company Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) hasn't turned around just yet. It was still down 23% at the end of Q3.But Investorplace's Luke Lango believes that WB has turned around and that turnaround is here to stay:&quot;Weibo stock has been in a secular downtrend since early 2018. But, all major signs (improving fundamentals, favorable optics, and bullish technicals) imply that this downtrend is over.&quot;The biggest challenge remaining for WB -- and all Chinese stocks? The trade war. We keep hearing from the Trump Administration that a trade deal is close, but that's about as good as having no information about trade talks at all.  * 7 Important IPO Stocks to Watch for the Long Run Will things improve for WB in the coming years? Almost definitely. Will they improve before the end of 2019? Probably not. 8&#92;. Canada Goose (GOOS)Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com Investor: Will AshworthYTD Change: 1%Q2 Ranking: 8Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) had a much better Q3 than Q2, rising over 10% and bringing it back to flat returns for 2019. The turnaround was based mostly on solid double-beat earnings report that saw revenues grow 59% and earnings grow 37% year-over-year. GOOS's wholesale business also rebounded, retaking the lead over the company's DTC business.Investors were disappointed that it was just a double beat quarter, and not a double-beat-and-raise quarter, however.And Canada Goose isn't out of the woods just yet. As Investorplace's Ashworth stated:&quot;One class-action lawsuit filed in early September suggests that Canada Goose management failed to disclose or made misleading statements about its sourcing of down and fur.While I picked GOOS as my top stock of 2019, I too am concerned about the way it treats the animals used to source its down and fur. As an animal lover, I wouldn't stand for any ill-treatment of animals. The company denies its suppliers' abuse the animals that are used in sourcing materials for its parkas, etc. I've chosen to take them at their word.&quot;Whether or not these lawsuits have merits remains to be seen, but it is pretty clear that GOOS will not take the top spot this year.Especially once you take into account that the 10% gains of Q3 have been erased in the first two sessions of Q4.Read more about GOOS stock here. 7&#92;. Viper Energy Partners (VNOM)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Neil GeorgeYTD Change: 10%Q2 Ranking: 8Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM) is an oil and gas play, but it's not a traditional one. Instead of producing either material or refining it, VNOM owns prime parts of the Permian Basin which it leases out to E&P companies. This should isolate VNOM from some of the volatility of the energy sector, and it has.&quot;Viper has generated a return through the first three quarters of 2019 of 10.81% -- well outpacing the traditional E&P companies' stocks.It has also been expanding its properties thanks to its affiliation with Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) which founded the company through a drop-down of property assets to Viper back in 2014.&quot;The problem? The energy sector itself. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLE) was up 1.2% for the first nine months of 2019. So VNOM's investment thesis held true, but the energy sector is seriously lagging other stocks this year.This doesn't mean Viper Energy isn't a good stock or dividend play, but it does mean 2019 isn't its year.  * 7 High Volatility Stocks to Buy as the Market Rebounds Read more about VNOM here. 6&#92;. LyondellBasell (LYB)Source: Via LyondellBasellInvestor: Charles SizemoreYTD Change: 10%Q2 Ranking: 7LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) is a plastics, chemicals and refining company -- and that wasn't the right sector to be in this year. Furthermore, with just a 9x trailing P/E and 7x forward P/E, LYB is deep in value stock territory.&quot;With cheap valuations like these, you might assume that Lyondell had hit a rough patch. But nothing could be further from the truth. Gross margins and operating margins have trended higher for years, and revenues have been stable.The lack of investor interest in Lyondell has far less to do with company performance and far more to do with the neighborhood it's in. In a world of social media hype, a plastics, chemicals and refining company just isn't all that interesting. But as investors rotate out of the story stocks of the last decade in search of new opportunities, they're likely to give reliable dividend payers like Lyondell a closer look.&quot;LYB didn't win the Best Stocks for 2019 contest, but the stock is still worth a look - especially if you think value stocks will come back in 2020.Read more about LYB here. 5&#92;. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Investor: Readers' ChoiceYTD Change: 16%Q2 Ranking: 5Readers' Choice stock Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) didn't have a great quarter. Though it held onto the 5th place slot, it's actually down 10% in Q3. Right now, AMZN stock isn't even beating the S&P 500 for 2019. Maybe it's time to pick a different stock for 2020?What this loss seems to come down to is that investors are growing weary of Amazon's growth without thought for profits attitude. The strategy got AMZN to $1 trillion in market cap, so it did pay off, but it looks like investors are starting to expect a more mature company.&quot;This was highlighted earlier in Q3 when AMZN missed Q2 earnings per share expectations and plummeted nearly 12% in a few sessions. That's over $100 billion in market cap erased over a miss of 35 cents per share.This plunge was despite a revenue beat, so the message investors are sending here is clear: They expect more in profits than Amazon has been delivering.&quot;Of course, the long-term narrative for Amazon is still strong, but AMZN winning the Best Stocks for 2019 at this point depends more on the leaders taking a nose dive than several hundred billion in market cap flowing into AMZN in the next three months.  * 5 Stocks Under $10 Worth the Risk Read more about AMZN here. 4&#92;. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Investors: John Jagerson and Wade HansenYTD Change: 22%Q2 Ranking: 4Despite holding onto 4th place, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) didn't have the best Q3. It fell 8%. But one bad quarter isn't much in the scheme of things for a stock like ADBE. Adobe produces industry leading products and was one of the first companies to capitalize on the new software subscription revenue model.Can ADBE rebound from its Q3 losses and take the top spot in the Best Stocks for 2019 contest? That remains to be seen.Read more about ADBE here. 3&#92;. Charlotte's Web Holdings (CWBHF)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Matt McCallYTD Change: 25%Q2 Ranking: 3For a third place stock, Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) has a better shot than you might think of winning the Best Stocks for 2019. One reason is that Charlotte's Web is in the very volatile pot sector. Who could forget the day Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) ran up to $300 from $230 and back to $150 in a single trading session? I'm not saying Charlotte's Web - or the 2019 pot sector - is nearly that volatile, but a run of 40% over three months is certainly possible.Another reason a win is still possible is Charlotte's Web's size. Other than SYAAF, CWBHF is the only one of our stocks sporting a sub-$1 billion market cap, that means less investor money is needed to move the needle. For today's $675 million market cap to hit 60% gains for the year, only about $200 million would needed to be invested in the company.We only check in with the Best Stocks once a quarter, but CWBHF has topped 100% gains twice in 2019, the last time being Aug. 5. It's as if we're just getting snapshots of a race, and that works just fine for a lot of stocks, but most stocks are much steadier than Charlotte's Web. Will the next snapshot happen on a day when Charlotte's Web has once again sprinted into first place before being overtaken again by a steadier runner? We'll have to see.Matt McCall pointed out that Charlotte's Web is well-positioned for this growth even among pot stocks:&quot;Charlotte's Web remains one of a handful of cannabis companies that is able to turn a profit. That's huge. CWBHF is expected to earn $0.19 per share this year, followed by $0.69 in 2020 and up to $1.07 by 2021.…The stock is undervalued based on both earnings and revenue forecasts. Using the 2021 numbers, which is less than two years from now, CWBHF stock trades with P/E ratio of 14.3 and a price-to-sales of 1.67.Stocks that are in high-growth sectors such as cannabis and CBD should (and typically do) trade at valuations higher than the overall market. A P/E ratio between 40 and 50 for Charlotte's Web would be in-line with other high-growth stocks.&quot;In my opinion, Charlotte's Web has a higher chance to take the top spot than even the next stock on the list.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale Read more about CWBHF here. 2&#92;. Teladoc (TDOC)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Jason MoserYTD Change: 37%Q2 Ranking: 2Teledoc (NYSE:TDOC) has had its ups and downs in 2019 to be sure, but the moves haven't been nearly as wild as the ones in Charlotte's Web stock. As a result, TDOC is up a very respectable 37% as of the end of Q3.Teladoc is the undisputed leader in the telehealth space. It's a company that makes it possible to seek medical attention, virtually without having to travel to a doctor's appointment. As more services and industries become digital in some way and the U.S. cries out for healthcare reform, a company at the intersection of these two things stands to profit big.And its growth is going well. As The Motley Fool's Jason Moser pointed out:&quot;TDOC stock's second-quarter results showed us the business remains on track. There were a couple of leadership additions with Mala Murthy coming on as CFO and David Sides as COO… TDOC's revenue for the quarter came in just over $130 million -representing 24% organic growth.&quot;Moser also pointed out upcoming catalysts for TDOC:&quot;Medicare Advantage will be a nice catalyst in the coming years as it will open them up to an opportunity as large as 20 million additional members.It also sounds like the CVS (NYSE:CVS) partnership continues to develop nicely. There was plenty of positive language on the earnings call regarding the relationship building with CVS and Aetna. Minute Clinics have expanded to 8 additional states, and the Aetna acquisition has stoked the HealthHub concept …In fact CVS plans to have 1,500 HealthHUB locations operating by the end of 2021.&quot;Will any of these catalysts hit in time for the end of 2019? That remains to be seen.Read more about TDOC here. 1&#92;. Lululemon (LULU)Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com Investor: Louis NavellierYTD Change: 58%Q2 Ranking: 1And finally, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) holds onto the top spot for the second consecutive quarter, and no one else really came close. LULU closed out Q3 a whopping 21 percentage points ahead of TDOC.Louis Navellier of Growth Investor attributes Lululemon's success to two things: being an entirely direct-to-consumer company and smart management.The first allows LULU to control costs and quality and keep close track of what customers want. LULU keeps production costs down and can release new products strategically in a way that won't leave them sitting on shelves. This lets LULU &quot;charge a premium for quality products that are in limited supply.&quot;&quot;The second force that keeps LULU stock chugging along is the company's smart management. The key to success here is that its management has known how to time Lululemon's growth.Lululemon hung back as its popularity grew, choosing to focus on building out its yoga business into the women's athleisure force it is today. Thanks to this, it was able to grow its reputation in a much more profitable way than simply flooding the market with stores and products. That cachet with its target market (and, thus, staying power) is a big reason I named it as my pick for the InvestorPlace Best Stocks of 2019 contest.And now, as it enters the men's space, analysts are drooling over the potential.&quot;So will LULU keep it's lead through the end of Q4 and win the whole thing? It seems likely, but nothing in the market is certain so I'm not betting against the other front runners either.Read more about LULU here.As of this writing, Regina Borsellino held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

In September of last year, many thought Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could do no wrong as NVDA stock climbed north of $290 per share. I can also remember when people thought the same about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). At one point in early 2000, CSCO rose above $80 per share, briefly becoming the world's most valuable stock.However, NVDA stock lost about 60% in less than three months last year. Cisco would go on to lose 90% of its value over two years as the tech boom went bust. Nearly 20 years later, CSCO stock has not yet regained its all-time high. Competitors, Economy Could Hurt ShopifyBut is it possible that those who are bullish on SHOP stock will be proven correct? Of course. The unimaginable happens every day. InvestorPlace contributor and Shopify stock bull Nicolas Chahine predicts that, &quot;the breakout in either direction will be strong.&quot; I agree with his assertion.Still, many signs indicate that SHOP stock cannot continue to trade at such high valuations. Unlike some other stocks that have broken out to the same extent, Shopify has competition. WordPress developers tend to gravitate toward WooCommerce. Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) purchase of Magento has made ADBE a competitor of SHOP.Furthermore, if a recession occurs, it will probably hit the small and medium-sized business that Shopify serves will be especially hard-hit. Shopify could attract new business as unemployed workers scramble for a way to earn money. However, that turnover will create uncertainty that could lead investors to question the high valuation of SHOP stock. How to Trade SHOP StockSHOP stock could move back to its record high or even beyond.But Shopify stock looks like a bubble. Virtually no company can justify a 330 forward price-earnings ratio, regardless of  its performance. Investors also need to remember that even the seemingly most solid of companies can lose almost all of their value.Despite the high price of Shopify stock, I see SHOP as a long-term winner.  Even with the rising competition in the e-commerce space, businesses often choose SHOP when they want an e-commerce platform that's not tied to Amazon or other large tech firms. Although a recession could disrupt the company's growth for awhile, its business has just scratched the surface of its potential, given the explosive outlook of e-commerce. Shopify will benefit as more businesses utilize e-commerce.Unfortunately, in light of the sky-high valuation of SHOP stock, investors do not know whether these catalysts will boost SHOP stock within several days or several years. That makes SHOP too risky to buy at its current levels.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-10-16,"The indices did not move too much on Wednesday, but a handful of tech stocks were hit hard on the day. Let's look at a few of the top stock trades going into the latter half of the week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Adobe (ADBE)Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) came under pressure Wednesday following a downgrade from Citi analysts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares have been trying to break out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and were actually succeeding before Wednesday. However, the tepid bullish action was not enough to withstand today's selling.Nor were the 20-day and 200-day moving averages, as ADBE stock gapped below both metrics. However, it's finding some reprieve from the 38.2% retracement. Now investors want to know, can ADBE reclaim the 200-day and downtrend resistance or are lower prices in store?If it's the latter, look for a decline down into the $258 to $260 area. There it will find a notable level of support as well as the 50% retracement. If that fails to hold, ADBE stock may be in trouble. On the upside, the charts are pretty cluttered until Adobe can clear the 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Netflix (NFLX)Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is very much a mixed picture ahead of the company's earnings report on Wednesday after the close.On the plus side, shares have broken out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and are maintaining above the 20-day moving average. On the downside, they are stuck below the 50-day moving average and the 38.2% retracement.So what now?Should shares decline, look to see if the 23.6% retracement at $267.75 can support the name. If not, $260 could be on deck, with the September low of $252.28 below that. Below the September low and the December low is possible.On the upside, see that NFLX reclaims and holds the 50-day moving average and 38.2% retracement. Above that opens the door to the 50% and 61.8% retracements at $308.61 and $326.81, respectively. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Abbott Labs (ABT)Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) was mixed on Wednesday after it reported earnings. However, with clear-cut support nearby and breakout potential, it's worth watching.Look at the past year of action. Shares have a consolidation period, then tend to break out to new highs and consolidate again. The old highs also tend to become support.Luckily, the prior highs near $79 to $80 also intersect with the 200-day moving average and 61.8% retracement. That makes it a pretty solid risk/reward area for investors. Below $79 and traders may consider stopping out.On the upside, see if ABT stock can break out over downtrend resistance and the 50-day moving average. Over it and a move back to $86-plus could be in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: ServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) was hammered on Wednesday and it leaves the stock clinging to support. Shares are just above the 200-day moving average and range support near $250.Below $250 and the October low of $243.54 is on the table. Below that and the stock could struggle a bit.If support holds, look for NOW to reclaim the 50-day moving average and rally back up to range resistance near $275. Over $275 and perhaps ServiceNow could retest the backside of its prior uptrend (blue line). Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Workday (WDAY)Thought ServiceNow investors were having a bad day? Just look at Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which was hit even harder on the day.The 61.8% retracement held WDAY in check on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the 38.2% retracement is acting as bulls' saving grace. Below the 38.2% and Wednesday's low, and the $145 mark could be on the table.If current support at the 38.2% retracement holds, look for WDAY to reclaim the $165 to $166 area. Above that and it will also have to reclaim downtrend resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-10-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. is nearing the consumer launch of Photoshop for Apple Inc.’s iPads a year after it was officially announced, however the company and early testers have said that the application will lack some key features from the desktop version.The San Jose, California-based company will hold its annual creative software conference, Max, in early November in Los Angeles and will provide an update on Photoshop for iPad at that time. The mobile app, which was announced to much fanfare and anticipation at the conference in 2018, is still on track to reach consumers by the end of this year, Scott Belsky, chief product officer of Adobe’s Creative Cloud division, said in an interview. The company hasn’t provided an official update on the software launch since last year.Adobe has been testing Photoshop for iPad under the codename Rocket with a small group of beta testers since earlier this year. Participants have told Bloomberg News that some beta versions don’t include well-established features they expected to be part of the release. They complained about less advanced or missing features around core functionality like filters, the pen tool and custom paintbrush libraries, vector drawing, color spaces, RAW editing, smart objects, layer styles and certain options for mask creation. Their disappointment about these limitations stems from Photoshop’s established reputation as a leading professional photo-editing program on the desktop.“Feature-wise, it feels like a beefed-up cloud-based version of their existing iPad apps and not ‘real Photoshop’ as advertised,” said someone beta-testing the software, who declined to be named talking about an unreleased app. “I understand it is based on desktop Photoshop code, but it doesn’t feel like it right now.” Other testers have called the app “rudimentary” and said, in its current state, it is inferior to other apps like Procreate and Affinity on the iPad.Belsky said that the beta feature set won’t represent the final version for consumers, and the need to collaborate with Apple meant that a lot of features are “coming in hot” ahead of the launch. At launch, he said that Photoshop will still lack some familiar features, but that will only represent version one of the product. “Launching every single feature that was accumulated over 25 years on the iPad on day one would not best serve our customers and the needs they have.” Usage on a desktop and an iPad isn’t “apples to apples,” he said, and Adobe “will definitely expand the capabilities” of Photoshop on iPad over time.Apple has positioned the new iteration of Photoshop as a selling point for its iPad Pro tablets since the moment the app was announced. It was highlighted during the launch of the most recent iPad Pro models about a year ago, and the Cupertino, California-based company has steadfastly featured the software on its website even though customers have been unable to download the app.Adobe has bolstered its mobile app strategy in an effort to reinvigorate growth in its Creative Cloud division, a suite of programs that lead the art and design software markets. Most of Adobe’s revenue comes from these tools, whose pace of growth has slowed from last year. Adobe offers a Lightroom CC app for iPads and iPhones, and it has unveiled several standalone mobile apps to capture a broader swath of customers than just the group who’d typically subscribe to all of the company’s creative tools.Adobe engineers prioritized the Photoshop functions they think will be most useful for customers with the first iPad release, the company said. It can work with “any Photoshop file in the world” and adjust every layer of an image in a non-destructive way, Belsky added. While Photoshop for the iPad runs on a version of the flagship tool’s underpinnings, the mobile version won’t support any three-dimensional workloads. The result, Belsky said, is a Photoshop that’s easier for beginners to use, but robust enough for professional projects. It will also synchronize files and edits with the desktop version via Creative Cloud.The app was heavily promoted by Adobe as being “real Photoshop,” a phrase that many professional users took to mean “full Photoshop.” “I want to say it’s the best product in the world for specific workflows and not have to apologize that it’s not full because that’s not what the customer needs,” Belsky said. The new version of Photoshop will also debut entirely new tools that take advantage of features — such as stylus and touch input — that are native to the iPad, he added.Bloomberg News first reported last year that Adobe was developing Photoshop for iPad and it was announced last October for release this year.“I couldn’t be more proud of where we landed,” Belsky said. “People will see for themselves.”To contact the authors of this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netNico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Vlad Savov at vsavov5@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Photoshop for iPad Nearing Launch With Some Key Features Missing

2019-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. has picked Illustrator as the next major application it will put on Apple Inc.’s iPad, the latest effort to create a version of the software maker’s top desktop products for mobile devices, according to people familiar with the matter.The San Jose, California-based company will preview Illustrator for iPad at its Max conference in November before launching it in 2020, according to the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the decision. Illustrator, which designers rely on for digital drawing and creating graphics, would follow in the footsteps of Photoshop, which is scheduled to be available on the iPad later this year. Illustrator is one of Adobe’s most popular apps in its Creative Cloud software suite and would mirror many of the features from the desktop version when running on the iPad.“We have nothing new to share at this time,” an Adobe spokeswoman said when asked about the company’s plans.Adobe has recently launched a slew of other iPad apps, including Fresco and Premiere Rush, that don’t have as many features as the upcoming Photoshop and Illustrator apps. Still, early testers of Photoshop for the iPad have criticized it for lacking some key elements of the version for personal computers, Bloomberg News reported last week.The new apps underscore Apple’s effort to position the iPad as a computer replacement and Adobe’s need to deliver software to consumers on whatever devices they use. Adobe, founded in 1982, is revamping major apps for mobile devices to maintain a leading position in creative software amid waning consumer enthusiasm for PCs. Adobe’s mission is twofold -- to satisfy the professionals who rely on its software for photo-editing and illustration, and to capture casual users. The strategy may boost sales growth for the company’s Creative Cloud unit, which has slowed over the last year.Adobe’s plan to place the iPad at the center of its cross-platform strategy is another signal the software maker and the Cupertino, California-based hardware giant are long past a once-contentious relationship. Although Apple had been an investor in Adobe, Steve Jobs in 2010 criticized Adobe’s Flash player for video and games on the internet, saying it hurt device battery life, privacy and security. In recent years, Adobe has been a fixture at Apple product announcements, continuously being used as an example of software that takes advantage of new Apple devices.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Plans to Launch Illustrator App for iPad After Photoshop

2019-10-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Starboard Value contends Box Inc. has underperformed its competitors due to a slowing growth rate and poor profitability and could be an attractive takeover target.Starboard sees the software maker as having multiple avenues to unlock value, including accelerating growth, striking a better balance between its sales growth and profitability, or potentially even seeking a buyer.“We believe this company is very, very attractive and could be acquired,” Starboard Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smith said Thursday at the C4K Investors Conference in Toronto.Box’s shares rose as much as 4.5% in New York trading. They closed up 3.7% to $16.36, giving the company a market value of $2.42 billion.Starboard disclosed a 7.5% stake in Redwood City, California-based Box last month, putting more pressure on the company, which has struggled to accelerate sales and become more profitable.Preferred AvenueSmith said later Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg TV his preferred avenue for the company to create value wasn’t through a sale. He acknowledged several potential strategic buyers, such as Adobe Inc. or Oracle Corp., along with private equity firms, may be interested in acquiring Box.A representative for Box declined to comment.Box is facing problems similar to those of other companies whose organic growth has slowed while having trouble shifting their model, Smith said. Box hasn’t met lofty sales growth targets that are common in the cloud-computing market, as it tries to transition to a broader software suite from from its current data-storage products.“The issue comes when you’re promising more growth than you’re achieving and you’re not able to pivot and balance that profitability and instead, as you may see in Box, you instead continue to spend more and more dollars chasing that growth,” Smith said. “Those companies that are reaching that level really need to also understand how to balance profitability.”Starboard has been one of the busiest activists this year, launching 10 campaigns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those targets have included Dollar Tree Inc., EBay Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Papa John’s International Inc., where Smith was appointed chairman in February.(Updates with closing share price in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Michael Bellusci, Erik Schatzker, Nico Grant and Josh Friedman.To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;Hema Parmar in New York at hparmar6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Matthew MonksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Starboard Says Software Maker Box Is Attractive Target

The San Jose, California-based software maker said it shut off public access to a database of customer email addresses last week, according to a blog post Friday.“This issue was not connected to, nor did it affect, the operation of any Adobe core products or services,” the company said in the post. “We are reviewing our development processes to help prevent a similar issue occurring in the future.”A researcher also found users’ member identifications, subscription status, payment status and whether the user was an Adobe employee, according to the website Comparitech, which first reported on the security lapse.

2019-11-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. gave an upbeat recurring revenue forecast for fiscal 2020 that reassured investors the software maker will see steady demand for its creative applications.A measure of fresh demand for the company’s creative and document software, net new annual recurring revenue for digital media, will be $1.55 billion next fiscal year, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday at a financial analyst meeting. Analysts projected $1.53 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street is paying close attention to the metric amid slowing revenue growth overall.Adobe unveiled new software products Monday at the company’s annual Max conference in Los Angeles, including versions of Illustrator and Photoshop apps for Apple Inc.’s IPad. While many of the applications cater to creative professionals seeking more sophisticated capabilities, Adobe also is trying to expand the appeal of its photo-editing and illustration software to hobbyists. The strategy may boost sales growth for the Creative Cloud unit. Adobe projected in September that sales growth for its smaller marketing software unit would slow down in the current period, raising pressure on the main creative business.Profit will be $9.75 a share in fiscal 2020, Adobe said, compared with analysts’ estimates of $9.69. Revenue will be $13.15 billion, the company said. Analysts, on average, projected $13.14 billion.The company expects revenue from its Creative Cloud and Document Cloud suites to jointly grow 19% in fiscal 2020, while its marketing software suite will grow 16%.“Our expanding universe of customers, strong global brand, market-leading products and continued innovation position us for a stellar 2020,” Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen said in a statement.The software maker estimated that the total market for its products will grow to about $128 billion in 2022 from $108 billion a year ago. Most of that, $84 billion, represents marketing and customer experience software. The creative software industry would be worth $31 billion and the company’s Document Cloud would be part of a $13 billion market.Adobe, founded in 1982, is among the best-performing software companies in the decade, with its stock increasing almost ninefold since the beginning of 2012. Shares jumped about 5% in extended trading following the release of the fiscal 2020 projections.

2019-11-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. announced a slew of products, led by a version of Illustrator for Apple Inc.’s iPad, meant to fortify its position as the leading provider of creative software.Design app Illustrator will come to the iPad in 2020, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. Bloomberg News reported last month that Adobe would announce a version of Illustrator for the iPad. Adobe also formally launched Photoshop for iPad, a year after announcing the product. The company introduced the new offerings at its annual creative conference, called Max, in Los Angeles.While many of the applications cater to creative professionals seeking more sophisticated capabilities, Adobe also is trying to expand the appeal of its photo-editing and illustration software to hobbyists. The strategy may boost revenue growth for the Creative Cloud unit. Adobe projected in September that sales growth for its smaller marketing software unit would slow down in the current period, raising pressure on the main creative business.Adobe, founded in 1982, is among the best-performing software companies this decade. Its stock has increased almost ninefold since the beginning of 2012, gaining 23% this year to $277.82 at Friday’s close. Now, the company is revamping major apps for mobile devices amid waning consumer enthusiasm for PCs. The new apps underscore Adobe’s need to deliver software to consumers on whatever devices they use as it tries to fuel continued growth.The announcements Monday are akin to “launching a new version of Creative Cloud for a new era of creativity,” Scott Belsky, chief product officer of Adobe’s Creative Cloud division, said in a blog post.The company said it was eager to get feedback from Illustrator users as it develops a mobile version of the software for the first time.“We’re still in the early stages, but fundamentally, we’re reimagining the Illustrator experience from the ground up to take advantage of the unique capabilities a tablet offers in terms of touch and Apple pencil,” Adobe said in a blog post.The company also revealed a new tool for its XD software interface design app that allows users to collaborate on the same project in real time, called Co-Editing. It’s currently in beta testing. The concept is similar to that of Figma Inc., a creative startup whose main product competes with the XD app.Here are Adobe’s other major announcements:The software maker expanded a partnership with International Business Machines Corp.’s design services arm.

2019-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok, the music-video-sharing mobile app owned by China’s ByteDance Inc., unveiled new tools to let third-party developers integrate their content onto its platform, seeking to deepen ties in the U.S. even as it faces growing scrutiny from lawmakers over data security.The new features will let TikTok users edit videos in other apps, such as Adobe Inc.’s Premiere Rush, and publish them directly on TikTok, helping users create new original content. In addition to Adobe, TikTok is also teaming up with augmented-reality company Fuse.it, photo- and video-editing program PicsArt, image-animating app Plotaverse and other outside app developers. TikTok, known for light-hearted, buzzy short videos, is one of the few Chinese internet companies to catch on in the U.S. Integration with third-party services can help apps expand into new audiences, and it’s a strategy that was used aggressively by social media companies like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. in their earlier years. But such integrations have also posed a threat to user privacy, primarily because users who agree to post from one app to another often share much more information than they realize.This kind of data sharing is at the root of almost all of Facebook’s privacy issues that have surfaced over the past two years. Facebook had many information-sharing relationships with third-party developers, and some of them, like the researcher who sold user data to Cambridge Analytica, took advantage of the partnership to collect massive amounts of data from Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook has since tried to clean up those partnerships, and announced in September that it had severed ties with tens of thousands of third-party apps that were using its software. TikTok has been downloaded more than 110 million times in the U.S., and has been growing more popular among U.S. teens at a time when tensions have escalated between the U.S. and China over trade and technology. TikTok’s burgeoning popularity has made it a fresh rival to Facebook and Instagram, and has also drawn the attention of U.S. senators who see it as a potential threat.Last week, the U.S. government opened a national security review of TikTok, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Beijing-based ByteDance bought Musical.ly two years ago for almost $1 billion to merge it with TikTok. The deal was seen as a way for the Chinese company to expand abroad and capitalize on an increasing appetite for short video. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., also known as CFIUS, which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, has begun to review the purchase amid increasing concern about TikTok’s expanding influence.The companies included in TikTok’s new program are likely to get a boost from the integration. For a small developer like Plotaverse, a partnership with TikTok could have a sizable impact on visibility and growth.(Removes an earlier misstatement from Plotaverse in the last paragraph of the Nov. 4 story saying TikTok would help it access the Chinese market. Plotaverse later retracted that statement.)&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the author of this story: Candy Cheng in San Francisco at ccheng86@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s New Tools Seek to Deepen Ties With U.S. App Developers
2019-11-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. debuted its most important mobile application ever this week when it finally released Photoshop for Apple Inc.’s iPad. But with key capabilities missing, many within the company’s vast fan base have panned the application, prompting the app’s overseer to publicly defend his product.Scott Belsky, chief product officer of Adobe’s Creative Cloud division, tweeted about the “painful” early reviews for a product his team has worked on for years. Right now in Apple’s App Store, Photoshop for iPad has a user review rating of 2.3 out of 5 stars. Belsky tweeted a screenshot of the metric, saying it made sense that a re-imagination of a popular 30-year-old product would displease many. Bloomberg News reported last month that the beta version of the touchscreen Photoshop app upset testers who missed many of the popular functions they’d grown accustomed to over the years.“If you try to make everybody happy w/ a v1, you’ll either never ship or make nobody happy,” Belsky tweeted. “Such feats require customer feedback to truly exceed expectations. You must ship and get fellow passionate travelers on board. But for a team with the right vision and commitment, being doubted and critiqued is motivating and informing.” Belsky also responded to users who tweeted about not enjoying Photoshop on Apple’s tablet, recommending they try Adobe’s drawing app, Fresco. While it’s hard, it’s important to build products “with customers” rather than “hidden in the lab,” he added.Read more: Adobe Pitches Illustrator, Photoshop for IPad Amid Slowing SalesAdobe has embarked on the arduous task of bringing its most successful software franchises to mobile devices to maintain its stature as the world’s largest maker of creative software.

2019-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. said new features are coming to its Photoshop for iPad application, responding to criticism that the first version lacked basic functions users expected would be retained from the desktop model of the best-selling image-editing software.The company said Thursday that before the end of the year it would add a Select Subject mode, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically identify and select a subject in an image, and an upgraded version of the Cloud documents function, which synchronizes Photoshop files between the desktop and iPad apps. In the first half of 2020, Photoshop for iPad will get support for Curves, which adjusts the color of an image, and improvements to layers, brush sensitivity, the ability to rotate the canvas and integration with the Lightroom app, the company said in a blog post.Adobe didn’t address other missing elements that users have complained about, including RAW image editing and smart objects. Bloomberg News reported earlier this year that beta testers of Photoshop for iPad said the app was far more watered down than expected.Earlier this month, Scott Belsky, chief product officer of Adobe’s Creative Cloud division, tweeted about the “painful” early reviews for a product his team has worked on for years.

2019-11-26,"In early September, we saw an unprecedented shift in the investment landscape from momentum stocks to value stocks. This came amid a recovery in economic fundamentals and a sharp rise in interest rates.By mid-September, the the iShares Momentum Factor ETF (BATS:MTUM) was down more than 1%, while the iShares Value Factor ETF (BATS:VLUE) was up more than 7%. This big divergence prompted me to write a piece on InvestorPlace outlining seven momentum stocks to buy on the dip.The logic was simple. These sharp momentum-to-value shifts don't happen often. But, when they do, it's when the things are getting better. See late 2016. It is investors voting with their money that the coast is clear to buy stocks that require a good economy to head higher. As such, these shifts are normally temporary, and a harbinger of a broader market rally. When they end, both value and momentum stocks power higher alongside a rising economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThus, I reasoned that the September weakness in momentum stocks presented a solid buying opportunity into 2020, when all stocks would power higher supported by easing trade tensions, re-accelerated global capital investment and economic activity, revamped corporate profit growth, healthy labor markets and supportive central bank policy.Fast forward two months. Since then, both the Momentum Factor ETF and Value Factor ETF are up more than 3%, five of the seven momentum stocks I recommended are up more than 8%, and three of them are up more than 20%.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in December I think this momentum stock rebound will continue. As such, let's take a deeper look at five of my favorite momentum stocks that have shown impressive strength since mid-September. Momentum Stocks to Buy on the Rebound: The Trade Desk (TTD)Source: Shutterstock % Gain Since Sept. 16: 20%At one point in time, programmatic advertising leader The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) was one of the biggest losers in the mid-2019 momentum-to-value shift. Shares had shed almost a quarter of their value by mid-September. But, since then, shares have soared 20%.This big rebound in TTD stock will persist for a few reasons.First, the long-term fundamentals are favorable here. Programmatic advertising is &quot;smart&quot; advertising, which leverages algorithms, data and machine learning to transform ad transactions and ad spend allocations from a guess-and-check process, to an automated and optimized process. The whole ad industry is pivoting into programmatic advertising, yet only a small portion of global ad dollars are transacted programmatically today. The Trade Desk is at the center of this pivot. Thus, as more ad dollars flow into the programmatic channel over the next few years, TTD's revenues and profits will continue to roar higher.Second, the valuation remains reasonable. By my numbers, The Trade Desk will net $12 in earnings per share by fiscal 2025, behind 20%-plus annual revenue growth, steady profit margin expansion and 25%-plus profit growth. Based on an exit multiple of 35-times forward earnings (which is average for application software stocks) and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target for TTD stock of $260 -- above today's $250 price tag.Third, the optical backdrop will remain supportive. Yields appear to be done surging, so the valuation headwinds which hit TTD stock in September also appear to be over. At the same time, easing trade tensions should support a rebound in enterprise capital spending, and as that picks up, companies should spend more on their programmatic advertising pivots.Ultimately, TTD stock should stay in rebound mode. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com % Gain Since Sept. 16: 8%Shares of creative solutions giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) weren't hit that hard by the mid-2019 momentum-to-value shift. But, ADBE stock has still rattled off an impressive 8% gain since mid-September as momentum stocks have come back in favor. Shares presently trade just a few bucks shy of all-time highs.The fundamentals here imply that ADBE stock should hit new all-time highs soon.The economic and market backdrops are healthy. Trade tensions are easing. Easing trade tensions will support a rebound in capital spending, which will fuel a rebound in the global economy. As the global economy rebounds, stocks will broadly power higher. This rising tide will lift most boats, including ADBE stock.Adobe's internals are equally healthy. This is a company which dominates the secular growth creative solutions market with essentially no real competition. Growth is big because enterprises and professionals are investing more into creative solutions as the world becomes more visually based. Margins are huge, because Adobe commands tremendous pricing power. Profit growth is consequently big, too. All of this should continue for the foreseeable future, and at an accelerated rate in 2020, thanks to a rebound in enterprise spending trends.Also of note, the valuation on ADBE stock remains tangible. By my projections, Adobe will remain a double-digit revenue growth company for several years thanks to creative market tailwinds, while margins will naturally improve with scale. Those growth projections create visible runway for earnings per share to hit $20 by fiscal 2025. Based on a systems software sector-average 25-times forward earnings multiple and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target for ADBE stock of $310.  * 7 Unsteady Stocks Investors Should Consider Selling Before 2020 All in all, then, the data here suggests that ADBE stock will remain in rally mode. Okta (OKTA)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com % Gain Since Sept. 16: 24%Another momentum stock which was hit hard during the momentum-to-value shift was identity cloud company Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA). Much like TTD stock, OKTA stock lost about a quarter of its value during this shift. Since mid-September, though, OKTA stock has rattled off a 24% gain.OKTA stock should continue to rebound for three big reasons.First, Okta is a big growth company with strong long-term fundamentals. At its core, this company is reinventing the way companies protect their data. Instead of building a castle of security surrounding an entire enterprise ecosystem (as most traditional cybersecurity solutions do), Okta is outfitting each member in an enterprise ecosystem with personalized &quot;armor,&quot; under the idea that if each individual is protected, so is the entire ecosystem.Okta calls this new method the Identity Cloud. This Identity Cloud is surging in popularity, because it improves enterprise flexibility, mobility and convenience, without compromising on security integrity. Still, Okta is a relatively small company (less than $500 million in revenue) in a huge cybersecurity market ($170 billion and growing), so there is ample room for Okta to stay on a big growth trajectory for a lot longer.Second, the valuation on OKTA stock isn't stretched. My modeling suggests that Okta has a visible opportunity to net $11 in EPS by fiscal 2030 (assuming 20%-plus revenue growth, sustained big gross margins, and significant positive operating leverage). Based on an application software sector-average 35-times forward multiple and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target of nearly $150.Third, the optics are improving. Specifically, capital spending trends are rebounding, and Okta's revenues come from the capital spending well.Big picture -- OKTA stock can and will keep moving higher. Chegg (CHGG)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com % Gain Since Sept. 16: 11%On seemingly no catalyst whatsoever, shares of digital education giant Chegg (NASDAQ:CHGG) tumbled from nearly $50 in late July 2019, to below $30 by early November 2019. Then, Chegg reported strong third-quarter numbers, which implied that the selloff was grossly overdone. CHGG stock has since rebounded to $40.This rebound should continue until CHGG stock runs back to its $50 all-time highs.Chegg is a big growth company. This company has created a connected learning platform which is increasingly becoming a necessary and vital part of the learning experience for high school and college students. That's because Chegg has built the first education platform that caters to modern student's needs. They want digital services, they want on-demand services, they want streamlined services and they want all-the-time services. Chegg provides all four, all in one place.As such, it isn't too far off to think that Chegg will one day be used by most high school and college students across America. There are 36 million students who fit that description. Chegg has only nabbed 3.1 million of them. Thus, with a meager 10% penetration rate in a highly fragmented market that is ripe for disruption, Chegg is primed for big growth over the next few years.This big growth simply isn't priced into CHGG stock today. By my numbers, Chegg has a realistic opportunity to hit $2.50 in EPS by fiscal 2025. Based on a big-growth 30-times forward earnings multiple and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target for CHGG stock of $45.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 That's well above where shares trade today. So long as shares remain fundamentally undervalued and the momentum/growth stock backdrop remains favorable, CHGG stock should grind higher. Splunk (SPLK)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com % Gain Since Sept. 16: 28%Big data analytics company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) was hit hard in mid-2019 on cash flow, growth, and margin concerns. But, Splunk reported third quarter numbers in November that put those concerns to ease. SPLK stock has since sprinted to all time highs.Although the valuation on SPLK stock seems somewhat stretched here, most signs indicate that this rally will continue.First, Splunk is in the game of turning data into actionable insights. Current trends imply that demand for this service is surging. Not only did Splunk just report strong Q3 numbers that included 30% year-over-year growth, but Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) also recently acquired Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) in a data acquisition play, tennis players have recently started using big data to prep for matches and the real estate industry is getting in on the big data trend.Second, recovering business sentiment -- thanks to easing trade tensions -- should provide a lift to Splunk's revenue trends, since the higher business sentiment goes, the more those businesses spend on things like data, and the more money makes its way into the Splunk ecosystem.Third, Splunk is in the early stages of realizing the financial benefits of its recently launched Data-to-Everything platform. Building that platform has been a multi-year, multi-billion dollar commitment. That investment phase is over. Now comes the growth part. This transition should provide a lift to SPLK stock.I'm slightly concerned about valuation on SPLK stock up here. But, momentum stocks have a tendency to ignore valuation risks when they have full momentum. That's exactly what Splunk has right now. So, for the foreseeable future, shares should keep making new highs.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TTD, ADBE, OKTA and CHGG.

2019-12-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Google is pulling powerful targeting tools from political advertisers, a move that prompted a sharp rebuke from President Donald Trump’s campaign.Because of the changes outlined last month, campaigns that use Google to place election ads on Google Search, YouTube and other websites can no longer target them to a particular audience based on political affiliation.But the new policy has a loophole that means large swathes of Google ad space on the web can still be highly targeted by candidates and other political groups looking to sway voters during the 2020 election.The internet giant lets advertisers buy some of its marketing spots using their own targeting data, and technology from other companies. Political advertisers could embrace these alternatives to get around Google’s policy.This loophole shows how the labyrinthine advertising-technology ecosystem makes it difficult for internet giants to police election ads. Google and Facebook Inc. dominate the digital ad market, but hundreds of smaller companies crunch data and provide tools to advertisers.Google, Facebook at Center of Rising Political-Ad TensionsGoogle provides three main types of ad space: Search, YouTube and display. Display ads include banners and videos placed on websites around the world. Google acts as a middleman between those sites and advertisers. To buy, advertisers can go directly through Google, or they can use other providers such as Trade Desk Inc., MediaMath Inc. and Adobe Inc.That’s where the loophole shows up. Google’s new limits should work on YouTube and Search ads because they can only be bought through Google. But many Google display ads are put up for auction on Google’s ad exchange, and advertisers can bid on these marketing spots using whatever targeting data and tools they want.“Advertisers can skirt this policy and still access the exchange,” said Grace Briscoe, a vice president at Centro Inc., which sells tools for marketers to bid on ad exchanges, including Google’s.There’s not much Google can do to close the loophole because the company can’t check targeting data it doesn’t control, and can’t impose its policy on other ad-tech companies, according to Briscoe.Trump Campaign Says Google’s Ad Changes Will Suppress 2020 VoteThe policy applies to Google’s ad-buying tool, known as DV360, but not to Google display ads bought through other companies like Trade Desk, a Google spokeswoman said in an email.Spokesmen for Adobe and Trade Desk said it was possible to buy targeted ads on Google using their tools. Trade Desk doesn’t allow targeting down to the individual for political ads, the company’s spokesman said.Adobe’s policies require political ads to be clearly labeled. Specific targeting is allowed if advertisers bring their own data, a spokesman for the company said. A spokeswoman for MediaMath declined to comment.Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.Online advertising giants Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are at the center of a major debate over political advertising in the U.S. The companies allow highly tailored messages to be delivered to small groups of people, changing the way campaigns operate and making it possible to send ads that the wider world never sees. Both companies require political advertisers to upload their ads to a public database.Twitter Inc. banned political advertising completely last month while Facebook says it will keep accepting ads from politicians and won’t check them for accuracy.&#92;--With assistance from Mark Bergen and Bill Allison.To contact the reporter on this story: Gerrit De Vynck in New York at gdevynck@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Google’s Limits on Political Ads Have a Loophole Trump Could Tap

Tech stocks are increasingly borrowing a concept from the services model: subscriptions. Consumers like the lower cost of entry compared to paying big upfront for a software package. Enterprise customers have bought in too. And investors love the resulting financial benefit.&quot;Manufacturers benefit from the subscription model,&quot; says John Conlon, Chief Equity Strategist, People's United Advisors. &quot;It provides them with a very steady stream of revenue. It's a lot easier to get a handle on what a company's revenue stream will be using a subscription model. It lowers the entry point for potential customers, which encourages more customers to pay for the service offered. It's an easier business model.&quot;Here, we examine 11 tech stocks to buy that have the potential to deliver super-sized software profits.

Adobe stock has performed well this year, and at $303.03 it is up 34% so far in 2019. Will that growth continue? Here's what to expect from Adobe next week.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Adobe will be reporting both its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings after the bell next Thursday. The first hint of what to expect came when the company updated investors on its third-quarter performance. Q3 Reaction to Q4 ADBE Earnings GuidanceThe company's Q3 earnings report on Sept. 17 resulted in ADBE stock dropping as much as 4% in after hours trading, before closing down 1.7% the following day. The reason for the negative market reaction? It wasn't the company's Q3 performance (it beat analyst expectations on both revenue and earning), but softer than expected guidance for Q4.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Adobe told investors to expect EPS of approximately $2.25 per share on revenue for the quarter of roughly $2.97 billion. CNBC reported at the time that analysts had been expecting EPS of $2.30 per share on $4.03 in revenue. Coming in under expectations with that Q4 guidance spooked the market, resulting in a loss for ADBE stock instead of the gain one might expect for the Q3 beat.Following the negative reaction to the Q4 guidance, Adobe stock had a rocky patch for just over a month, eventually bottoming out at $261.09 on Oct. 22 before beginning a rally that extended to the end of November. Whatever trepidation the market had been feeling appears to have passed. Factors That Could Impact Adobe's Q4 EarningsIn June, ADBE unveiled its new AI-powered Adobe Experience Cloud, an update to its enterprise marketing and analytics offerings. That division saw slightly lower-than-expected earnings in Q3, but Adobe said at the time it would be boosting its investment in sales generation.It also delivered a big win with Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), announcing in June that it would adopt Adobe Experience Cloud. If the promised marketing boost pays off, the company's enterprise revenue should get back on track for Q4. Creative Cloud business was up 22% year-over-year in Q3. In its guidance, the company says it expects to see 20% growth in Q4. That business accounted for 69% of Adobe's Q3 revenue, so if it comes out even slightly ahead of projections and closer to Q3 growth levels that will make a big difference.What about China? The trade war between the U.S. and China has impacted the performance of many tech stocks this year. However, Adobe says it has minimal exposure for either its creative or enterprise businesses.One thing thing to keep in mind -- despite the soft guidance for the quarter -- is that in three out of the last four quarters, Adobe has beaten consensus EPS estimates. Bottom Line for Adobe StockAdobe is one of those tech companies that successfully upended its business model to adapt to changing times. The company went from selling boxed software customers would buy a new version of every three to five years, to providing cloud-based monthly subscription access to its apps. After more than a decade of tepid growth, since going to a subscription-only model with its &quot;Creative Cloud&quot; in 2013, ADBE stock has grown in value by over 600%.Among investment analysts it's a consensus &quot;buy&quot; with a $323 median 12-month stock price target. Not spectacular performance expected there -- especially in comparison to the 34% growth posted in 2019 -- but there's still upside.Regardless of what happens in the short-term after the company's earnings report on Dec. 12, Adobe remains a solid long-term investment. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. will move its marquee annual user conference to Las Vegas, abandoning its longtime venue of San Francisco due to the rising cost of visiting the city and its homeless crisis.Oracle’s OpenWorld will be held in Las Vegas beginning next year, the San Francisco Travel Association said Tuesday in a statement. The travel group, in an email reported earlier by CNBC, said the software company committed the conference to Las Vegas for three years, costing San Francisco an estimated $64 million. Oracle, headquartered about 22 miles south of San Francisco in Redwood City, California, told the travel authority that its conference guests were unhappy with San Francisco’s dirty streets and costly hotel rates, according to CNBC.Las Vegas is a key destination for technology conferences. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud-computing arm, Dell Technologies Inc., Adobe Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. are just a few of the companies that host conferences in the desert city -- drawn to its large venues and inexpensive hotel room rates.Oracle declined to respond to requests for comment on the move.Oracle also holds OpenWorld conferences in Dubai, London, Singapore and Sao Paulo. The company encourages customers and partners to “register for an OpenWorld near you,” reducing the importance of the San Francisco gathering, where the company unveils new software products. The San Francisco OpenWorld generally attracted about 60,000 attendees. For years, the conference has been overshadowed by Dreamforce, rival Salesforce.com Inc.’s annual confab that the company describes as the world’s largest software conference. Dreamforce had more than 170,000 registered attendees in November.San Francisco hasn’t been a happy home for OpenWorld or Dreamforce for years, with residents complaining about street closures caused by the conferences and a surge of pedestrian traffic downtown. Local hotels swell room rates in anticipation of demand among attendees.Oracle held the first official OpenWorld conference at San Francisco’s Moscone Center in 1996, according to its website. The company’s user gatherings date back to 1982, when 50 attendees gathered for International Oracle Users Week at a hotel in San Francisco.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Oracle Conference Leaves San Francisco, Costing City $64 Million"

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. reported sales that topped Wall Street estimates, signaling strong demand for the company’s creative and marketing software.Revenue was $2.99 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $2.97 billion.Adobe shares rose about 3% in extended trading after closing at $305.96 Thursday in New York. The stock has climbed 35% this year.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen is trying to maintain sales growth of at least 20% to convince investors Adobe is worth its lofty valuation. To do so, he’s making acquisitions, including VR business Oculus Medium this month, and investing in new products, such as Photoshop for Apple Inc.’s iPad.“Fiscal 2019 was a phenomenal year for Adobe as we exceeded $11 billion in revenue -- a significant milestone for the company,” Narayen said in prepared remarks for the company’s earnings call with analysts. “Our record revenue and EPS performance in 2019 makes us one of the largest, most diversified and profitable software companies in the world.”Despite the upbeat reception from investors, Adobe projected it will slip below the 20% growth threshold in fiscal 2020 with revenue of about $13.15 billion. Sales will increase 17% in the first half of the year, and 18% in the second half, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in the prepared remarks.“Adobe is about to become the first large cap software company in the SaaS era to decelerate below the 20% revenue growth threshold,” Canaccord analyst Richard Davis wrote in a note ahead of the report.In the fiscal fourth quarter, marketing software sales rose 24% to $859 million. Adobe said the unit will grow 15%, year-over-year, in the current quarter.Products from Marketo, a marketing company Adobe acquired in 2018, saw more momentum among mid-sized clients, Murphy said in the prepared remarks. Executives said in September that Adobe would invest more money to boost sales in the unit, which at that time wasn’t growing as fast as anticipated.Revenue from the creative and document cloud division, which includes Photoshop, climbed 22% to $2.08 billion in the quarter and is projected to increase 19% in the current period.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Reports Quarterly Sales That Beat Analyst Estimates
2019-12-12,"Adobe Inc.  maintained its 20%+ revenue gains as it rounded out its fiscal year, the software company reported Thursday afternoon, sending shares toward record highs in late trading. Adobe reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $851.9 million, or $1.76 a share, on sales of $2.99 billion, up 21.4% from revenue of $2.46 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of $2.29 a share. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $2.97 billion, according to FactSet. Adobe was expected by some analysts to slide lower than 20% sales growth, which might have created some concerns beyond the Photoshop maker. &quot;The foundational reality is that if our forecasts, and a couple dozen others', are correct, Adobe is about to become the first large cap software company in the SaaS era to decelerate below the 20% revenue growth threshold,&quot; Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a note earlier this week. &quot;This rate of growth has taken on a near mythical importance, at least in Silicon Valley as 20% historically has been the demarcation between the cool kids and the clod kickers who reside in flyover states.&quot; Adobe's stock closed with a 0.7% gain at $305.96, then jumped more than 3% in after-hours trading to more than $315.

This compares to eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) $29 billion. In fact, among eCommerce companies, Shopify stock has the second-highest value.Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Keep in mind that the return for the year has been a sizzling 180%. What's more, for the past three years, the average gain on Shopify was 109%.Now the success is certainly well deserved. Over the years, the company has focused intensely on innovation, such as by adding new services like lending, mobile commerce, point of sale systems, and so on. Shopify has also been smart with its partnership strategy, having struck deals with companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe result is that the company has built a massive base of merchants, with over one million.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd But despite all this, I think there actually should be some caution. There are signs that the investor enthusiasm is overdone - and that 2020 may not be a sure thing.So let's see why: GrowthThe idea for Shopify came when Tobias Lutke couldn't find a good way to sell snowboards. So he started his own platform! Interestingly enough, Shopify took a few years to get much traction. But this was fine as Lutke wanted to evolve the system to meet customer needs.The strategy has certainly paid off in a big way as Shopify has been a long-time fast grower.Yet as the revenue base has increased, there has been a notable deceleration. For example, in 2015 to 2016, the growth was over 90%. But by 2017, revenues jumped by 73% and a year later, it was 59%.And as for the most recent quarter? Well, the revenues rose by 45%. In fact, for 2020, it looks like the increase will be 37% or so.True, this is definitely strong. However, given the lofty expectations and the high valuation, this growth may not be enough. CompetitionIn today's dynamic world, it is extremely tough to maintain an edge in the tech market. There are huge amounts of venture capital sloshing around the globe looking for cutting-edge startups.Although, regarding Shopify stock, the main competitive threat appears to be the large tech companies. They are looking for ways to keep up their growth, and eCommerce is certainly an attractive way to do this.To this end, Facebook's Instagram has been making moves into this category. The platform is massive but also allows for immersive experiences that younger buyers appreciate.Then there is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which has transformed itself over the past few years. Part of this has been a focus on cloud computing. But Adobe has also been assembling a set of powerful eCommerce assets, such as Magento and Marketo. These have synergies with other parts of the business like web and graphic design tools.Finally, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been leveraging its Dynamics 365 system for eCommerce. While still in the early stages, the company certainly has the resources to make a big play here. Valuation of Shopify StockYes, the valuation on Shopify stock is really stretched. After all, the shares are trading at a nosebleed 32-times sales.While it's true that the company should fetch a premium, this one is really off the charts. Even worse, despite the large revenue base, the company still has a cash burn. And with the decelerating growth rate, it's going to get tougher to maintain the valuation and it seems inevitable that there will be a risk of disappointment and perhaps soon.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-12-27,"We are now at the end of 2019, and what a year it has been for the stock market. A year ago, stocks could do no right. They were going through their biggest correction since 2008 amid escalating concerns that a recession was just around the corner. That recession never happened. Instead, throughout 2019, the global economic outlook has only improved.Now, at the end of 2019, stocks can do no wrong. The S&P 500 is up nearly 30% year-to-date and presently sits at record highs.Who called it? I don't mean to brag, but yours truly. In my 10 predictions for the stock market in 2019, my first prediction was that the S&P 500 was going to have its best year this decade. Up nearly 30% year-to-date, the S&P 500 is already having its second best year of the decade, and with just a few more up days, it could end 2019 with its best annual performance since 1997.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlso in those 10 predictions for 2019, I nailed Disney's (NYSE:DIS) big breakout year (up more than 30% year-to-date), Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) big breakout year (up nearly 30% year-to-date) and huge outperformances from Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Square (NYSE:SQ), among which the average year-to-date gain is over 150%.Now, it's time to unveil my bold predictions for 2020. Will the market have another breakout year? Or will stocks falter after a big 2019? Which stocks will do particularly well? Which stocks won't perform up to par?  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Let's answer those questions, and more, by taking a deep dive into my five boldest predictions for the stock market in 2020. Stock Market Predictions: Stocks Fall FlatSource: Shutterstock Why It Could Happen: I was very optimistic on stocks in late 2018 because awful was priced in, but awful was not the reality. At the end of 2019, though, we have a very different situation. Great is priced in. While great may be the reality today, it may not be the reality throughout the next 12 months.I do believe that U.S.-China trade tensions will continue to ease into the 2020 presidential election, and that those easing trade tensions will provide a meaningful lift to the global economy. But, I also believe that at 17.6-times forward earnings (versus a five-year average multiple of 16.6), a lot of that &quot;lift&quot; is already priced into the S&P 500. It's also worth noting that investors have entirely forgotten about the inverted yield curve. History says that the big pullback in stocks usually doesn't happen until 12-18 months after an inversion. That timeline puts us squarely in the middle of 2020.Why It Might Not Happen: The global economy will improve in 2020 thanks to easing global trade tensions. As it does, corporate leaders will become more confident. They will pour more money into the economy, which will provide more fuel for growth. Against this favorable backdrop, companies across the globe will report far better-than-expected earnings, management teams will lift their guides and analysts will keep pushing up their forward earnings estimates. Given all those favorable tailwinds, valuation might not matter in 2020. Stocks could keep pushing higher behind robust profit growth, with higher forward estimates being a justification for today's premium valuation. Ride-Hailing Stocks Bounce BackSource: Daniel Dror / Shutterstock.com Why It Could Happen: Ride-hailing giants Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) had awful initial public offerings in 2019. Since then, both stocks have been duds on Wall Street for various reasons, ranging from slowing growth, to extended valuations, to legislative and C-suite noise. In 2020, though, those headwinds should reverse course.At both Uber and Lyft, growth has already slowed meaningfully, with recent quarterly trends implying that this deceleration is moderating and that growth rates could stabilize in 2020. International expansion at Uber and new product launches at Lyft will also help stabilize growth. At the same time, both Uber and Lyft are trading at a fraction of their IPO valuations, so expectations are significantly depressed. Legislative and C-suite noise should also ease. As stabilizing growth trends converge on depressed valuations without any optical noise, ride-hailing stocks could bounce back in a big way in 2020.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Why It Might Not Happen: UBER and LYFT stock may remain weak in 2020 if their growth trends continue to decelerate and losses continue to widen. This is unlikely. But, there is a chance that ride-hailing tailwinds continue to ease in 2020. The easing of these tailwinds could force even more promotional behavior from Uber and Lyft, the sum of which will result in weaker margins and bigger losses. If that does happen, neither of these stocks will rebound. Cannabis Stocks Will ReboundSource: Shutterstock Why It Could Happen: Pot stocks were killed in 2019. That's thanks to demand headwinds in the Canadian market, margin pressures from black market competition and snail-like progress on the U.S. legislation front. All of those headwinds converged on extended pot stock valuations, and caused companies like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Aurora (NYSE:ACB) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) to shed more than half of their value.In 2020, the exact opposite could happen. Demand headwinds could turn into tailwinds with the launch of cannabis 2.0 products (edibles and vapes). Margin pressures from black market competition will ease as legal supply and logistics improve. And, U.S. legislation could make meaningful progress as the House just passed the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act. All of those positive developments could converge on what are now discounted valuations in the cannabis category and spark a big rebound rally in pot stocks.Why It Might Not Happen: The 2020 pot stock rebound thesis is entirely predicated on three things: revenue trend improvements, margin trend improvements and U.S. legislation progress. But, revenue trends may not improve if cannabis 2.0 products aren't a hit. Margin trends may not improve if legal supply and logistics improvements aren't sufficient to compete with the black market. And, U.S. cannabis legislation may not make much progress in a Republican-controlled Senate. If those three things don't happen, then pot stocks won't rebound. Nio Stock TriplesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Why It Could Happen: Chinese premium electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) is one of my favorite high-risk, high-reward picks going into 2020 for a few reasons. First, the stock was massively beaten up in 2019, and is well positioned to soar higher on any good news. Second, China's economy will rebound in 2020 after slowing for most of 2018 and 2019, thanks to easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Third, as China's economy rebounds, China's auto market will rebound, too. Fourth, China's EV market will rebound in an even bigger way, because legislation in China remains supportive of EV adoption. Fifth, NIO's sales trends are improving heading into 2020. Sixth, NIO is launching a new car next year, so today's improving sales trends should persist into 2020.Putting all that together, I think NIO stock has a reasonably good chance to more than triple in 2020.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Why It Might Not Happen: The rebound thesis in NIO stock is entirely predicated on improving U.S.-China trade relations providing a spark for China's economy and auto sector. If that doesn't happen -- and it might not, considering how volatile trade relations have been over the past year -- then NIO stock won't rebound, because investor sentiment will remain depressed and sales trends won't accelerate in the way they need to in order to support a multi-bag rally in NIO stock. Beaten-Up IPO Stocks Stage a ComebackSource: Shutterstock Why It Could Happen: Many high-flying IPO stocks hit a brick wall in mid-2019 and have since dropped off a cliff. See Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), Slack (NYSE:WORK), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), among many others. I think most of those stocks will bounce back in 2020.These stocks were inarguably over-hyped following blockbuster IPOs. A few downward catalysts later, and they are all under-hyped. But, these are still great companies, pioneering change across big and valuable industries. Because of this, under-hype won't stick around for long. These beaten up IPO stocks will bounce back in 2020, behind sustained robust growth. Of note, I particularly like Beyond Meat and Pinterest as potentially 100%-plus upside candidates for 2020.Why It Might Not Happen: The batch of 2019 IPO stocks may remain weak in 2020 if: 1) interest rates move materially higher and create bigger valuation pressure on growth stock valuations, 2) broader stock market sentiment turns cautious amid choppy U.S.-China trade relations, and/or 3) these companies fail to make progress on the profitability front (pretty much all of them run losses today). As such, while IPO stocks look good for a big rebound in 2020, there are also multiple risks to that rebound thesis.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TSLA, SHOP, TTD, ADBE, ROKU, SQ, LYFT, CGC, NIO, BYND, CHWY and PINS.

2020-01-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. unveiled a cloud-based system to help clients build websites, bringing one of its last legacy products to the cloud almost a decade after shifting to internet-based software.The new content management system already is being used by some customers, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. The software maker announced the service at the National Retail Federation conference in New York.Adobe is the largest vendor for enterprise customers in a $3.8 billion market for software that builds websites and manages digital assets, according to data from research firm IDC. The company said it’s the first to provide a purely cloud-computing based solution to large business clients. The software maker currently manages 15 billion web page visits per day and more than 50 million digital assets, including images and videos, across its customer base. Wix.com Ltd. and closely held Squarespace are among the competitors in the field.Companies are increasingly attempting to differentiate themselves with personalized customer experiences, led by websites and marketing materials. Adobe’s “Experience Manager” is also being used to power in-store, interactive screens that retailers have begun using to teach shoppers more about their products.Adobe has spent almost four decades quietly dominating small patches of the technology industry. While it is synonymous for its creative and design software, led by Photoshop, the company has continually invested in new products to maintain leading positions in areas such as marketing, advertising, and customer experience software. The product expansion fueled a 24% revenue increase last year. Wall Street responded favorably, with Adobe’s stock climbing 46% in 2019.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen moved much of Adobe’s product suite to the internet in 2011, leading to years of growing revenue and setting an example followed by other software makers, including Microsoft Corp. For years, clients who used content management systems weren’t ready to change their way of doing things, Loni Stark, a senior director of strategy and product marketing at Adobe, said in an interview. But added pressure on brands to modernize with sophisticated websites and applications have changed their calculations.Experience Manager’s transition to the cloud “means companies can deliver content faster and be always current on the latest capabilities we’re delivering out there,” Stark said.Apparel company Under Armour Inc. and mapping company Esri Inc. have begun using the new service, and extolled the quicker uploading times and ease of use.“There are no servers to manage,” Bill Phillips, an applications manager at Esri, said in an interview. “Our developers can focus on developing our website and helping get our marketing message out there quicker.”Adobe Experience Manager was previously available as a hosted service, with the software maker managing the infrastructure for clients. But it relied on old-school software that required lengthy download periods for patches and updates, rather than the continuous updates available with internet-based software.“I think of this as a new beginning, a new decade,” Stark said.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Brings One of Its Last Legacy Products to the Cloud

2020-01-16,"(Bloomberg) -- When Salesforce.com Inc. emerged two decades ago, it lashed out at the software establishment: large companies that allegedly locked clients into dated products. Now, a coalition of newer rivals have extended that criticism to the cloud applications pioneer.  Ten software upstarts kicked off a public campaign Thursday that knocks customer relationship management, or CRM, titans, including Salesforce, Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, by saying the large companies keep clients trapped in subpar software suites, potentially shutting out smaller rivals with newer technology.The “Platform of Independents” leading the effort include Segment Inc., Amplitude Inc., Outreach Inc., Pendo.io Inc. and Drift.com Inc. Some of the companies are privately held unicorns, with valuations exceeding $1 billion. Each caters to a different software niche. The campaign began with a two-page ad in Thursday’s print edition of the Wall Street Journal and includes a web page and information sessions for prospective clients. More than 190 companies co-signed the main tenet of the campaign, that CRM software “isn’t enough” to provide good customer experiences to consumers.“We, as independent software companies, have built our products with the belief that a business should never be locked into a suite, never forced to have a one-size-fits-all technology approach, and its data should never be siloed,” the companies said in a statement. “It’s time to break free of the data monopoly.”The smaller companies argue the large software makers focus more on selling bundled packages of products than serving their clients’ needs with continuous innovation. Large technology companies have come under increasing antitrust scrutiny for their business practices, including how they wield power to maintain advantages over smaller firms. Beyond panning the quality of the bigger players’ technology, the chief executive officers of the startups said their larger rivals use acquisitions to bolster their market power.“If any of these guys becomes too big, that’s a threat to all of us in this ecosystem,” said Spenser Skates, CEO of Amplitude, which helps clients understand user behavior to improve product experiences. “Salesforce bought MuleSoft, Cisco bought AppDynamics. This is continuing to happen. It’s definitely a concern.”Representatives for Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Salesforce has been well served by its strategy in the CRM market. The company’s shares climbed about 19% last year. Oracle’s stock rose about 17%. Salesforce led the market for customer-management applications with 16.8% as of 2018, the last full year for which data is available, according to research firm IDC. Oracle was next with 5.7% while SAP came in third with 5.6%. Adobe Inc. and Microsoft Corp. rounded out the top five.Salesforce, founded in 1999, is the youngest company in the group. The others have been around for about four decades.“I think there’s something significantly broken that there’s been no big CRM company built in the last 10, 15, or 20 years,” Peter Reinhardt, the CEO of Segment, which helps companies compile their data about consumers, said in an interview.Reinhardt, who spearheaded this campaign, said he isn’t interested in being acquired. Rather, he wants to work more closely with his Platform of Independents peers to jointly sell packages of software solutions to clients, as a way to counter the selling advantages and software product bundles of larger companies. And Reinhardt is optimistic that a shakeup is possible in enterprise technology.“I think we have a temporarily dominant set of companies,” he said. “But I think there’s a huge opportunity for another rewrite of the CRM world.”(Updates with 2019 share performance in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Software Upstarts Hit Salesforce, Oracle on Tech and Sales Practices"

2020-01-24,"The analyst team over at Wells Fargo recently sounded a bullish tone on enterprise software stocks for 2020. The thesis? Enterprise software spending trends will pick up over the next few quarters, and as they do, most enterprise software stocks will head higher, too.For the record, I 100% agree with this thesis. Corporations hit the pause button on robust enterprise software spend in 2019 for two big reasons. One, they spent a lot on enterprise software in 2018 (spend rose nearly 14% year-over-year), so there wasn't a glaring need to up spend further in 2019. Two, rising trade tensions created immense economic instability, and companies didn't want to spend big against that backdrop.Consequently, enterprise software spend rose just 8.8% in 2019 -- one of its weakest annual growth rates in recent memory.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut, in 2020, corporations will re-accelerate their software spend, also for two big reasons. First, they didn't grow spend as much as normal in 2019, so there is ample room to re-up spend growth in 2020. Second, trade tensions are easing, stability is being injected back into the global economic environment, interest rates globally remain low, and corporate spending conditions broadly remain as favorable as they've been since 2017.As such, it should be no be surprise that Gartner projects global enterprise software spend to rise nearly 11% in 2019, up about 2 points from 2019's growth rate.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy Against that backdrop, enterprise software stocks will rally. Here are my favorite picks in the group. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com One enterprise software stock which Wells Fargo raised their price target on and which I think is a long-term winner is cloud giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).In the big picture, there are a lot of things to like about Adobe. The company dominates in the creative and document cloud worlds, runs at sky high gross margins, has been growing revenues at a steady 20%-plus clip for several years, and is a cash flow and profit machine. But the upside bull thesis in ADBE stock is all about the company's new growth potential in the enterprise cloud.Specifically, everything in the enterprise world is pivoting towards a focus on the consumer experience, or CE. At the same time, CE is becoming increasingly visually-focused, because visuals do a much better job at immersing a consumer than words. Broadly, then, enterprises are putting more money into creating visually powerful CEs.When they do that, they are trusting Adobe to do it better than anyone else. Why? Because Adobe has long been behind the market's best-in-class media creation and editing tools, and is now leveraging its expertise in creative media to built robust media-based CEs for enterprises of all shapes and sizes.This trend is just beginning. In 2020, it will gain serious momentum as enterprises increase their investment into CE. Adobe's growth rates will move higher. Profits will keep roaring higher. And ADBE stock will soar to new highs above $350. Autodesk (ADSK)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo really likes shares of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) software giant Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK). They hiked their price target on ADSK stock to a Street-high $240. ADSK stock presently trades around $195.But, can ADSK stock -- which is already up 140% over the past three years -- rally another 25% over the next twelve months?I think so. Autodesk dominates the AEC software vertical with widely-used and largely unparalleled solutions such as AutoCAD (used for 2D and 3D modeling) and Revit (used for Building Information Modeling). This dominant positioning means that as AEC firms up their software spend in 2020 -- and they will, because AEC markets were among the hardest hit by trade issues -- most of them will up spend on Autodesk services. Autodesk's revenue, margin, and profit trends will consequently remain healthy over the next several quarters, and that will provide support for continued gains in ADSK stock.It also helps that valuation isn't that much of a problem for Autodesk. Realistically, this company is looking at over $6 in earnings per share by fiscal 2022 (current Street estimates sit around $6). Based on a 35-times forward earnings multiple, which is average for application software stocks, that implies a fiscal 2021 price target of at least $210 (keep in mind, Autodesk is almost at the end of fiscal 2020).  * 10 Stocks to Buy as the 2020 Presidential Election Approaches So is $240 achievable? I think so, mostly because as Autodesk keeps beating estimates, forward estimates will move up, and fiscal 2022 earnings per share estimates will shake out somewhere well north of $6 when all is said and done.   Microsoft (MSFT)Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo also upped its price target on cloud giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and reiterated its &quot;overweight&quot; rating on the stock. I like this call, too, mostly because accelerating enterprise cloud momentum will support huge growth at Microsoft in 2020.Long story short, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has long been the king of the cloud infrastructure market with Amazon Web Services. But, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure offering, Azure, has been rapidly gaining on AWS for several years now. This culminated in late 2019, when the two services went head-to-head in a competition for a multi-billion dollar Pentagon cloud contract. Microsoft won.It was a surprise victory from a company that has historically placed second in the cloud infrastructure market. And, it marks a critical pivot wherein Microsoft's days as second place are coming to a close. In 2020, I expect multiple enterprises of all shapes and sizes to take note of Microsoft's big Pentagon cloud contract win, and choose Azure over AWS as their public cloud infrastructure provider. The more this happens, the more momentum Azure will gain.That's great news for MSFT stock. Over the past few years, as goes the cloud sector, so goes Microsoft stock. Splunk (SPLK)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Perhaps the boldest move from the Wells Fargo team in its recent software stocks update was upping its price target on big data company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) to a Street-high $200, calling for another 30%-plus upside in shares over the next twelve months.Can it happen? Yes. Mostly because the data boom is just starting.In a nutshell, Splunk helps enterprises of all shapes and sizes turn their raw machine data into valuable and actionable insights through their Data-to-Everything platform. Three big trends will promote increased adoption of this platform over the next several years.First, the volume of data globally will surge higher thanks to a proliferation of data-generating devices, like smart watches, smartphones, smart appliances, smart cars, etc. Second, the ability to generate valuable insights from that data will get better and better, thanks to things like machine learning. Third, enterprise data-driven decision making will go from luxury to necessity, as companies that don't do it will be left behind the curve.Broadly, then, Splunk projects to go from a niche data analytics platform today, to a must-have data-driven decision making companion by 2025. This transition will power sustained long term gains in Splunk stock.Of note, in 2020, SPLK stock will be pushed higher by: 1) increased enterprise software spending trends, 2) continued migration from a legacy license model, to a cloud-based business model, and 3) a 5G boom accelerating the data growth narrative.Overall, Splunk stock looks good both for 2020 and into 2025.AS of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE.

The improving fundamentals have provided the fuel needed to generate one of the best price trends on the planet. Time and time again, ADBE stock has delivered eye-popping profits to shareholders.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com That said, let's break down the metrics that matter and offer up a trade idea for those that think $400 is on the horizon. Adobe's EarningsStocks don't rise from $70 to $370 over four years on fluff. Such longlasting gains are the byproduct of a company discovering how to slap rocket boosters on their sales and earnings growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsADBE stock is one such success story.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Buy for Big Gains in 2020 Consider, for instance, Adobe's fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) growth for the past three years (2017 - 2019): $1.26, $1.83, $2.29. Furthermore, the company's quarter-over-quarter performance proves equally impressive and provides the same takeaway. If the digital media and marketing software behemoth can continue its well-entrenched growth trend, then the future is very bright.If this were a story of a little known company with explosive growth that Wall Street has not noticed yet, then it would be a compelling tale indeed. Unfortunately, investors are well aware of Adobe's strengths and have rewarded their share price accordingly.For example, ADBE stock has risen nearly 2,240% since its 2009 low.Even if you strip out the 2008 debacle and subsequent recovery, Adobe shares have still climbed more than 650% since breaking above their 2007 high in 2013. Therefore, I think its safe to say investors have priced-in the business's boom and then some. ADBE Stock ChartsThe weekly chart has everything you would expect from a rocket ship stock.All major moving averages are rising to reflect buyers' dominance across the field. The current upswing saw a substantial increase in momentum, signaling the trend is gaining steam. ADBE stock has rallied for fifteen of the last sixteen weeks, and jammed the RSI up to 72 in the process. The most persuasive argument against deploying new bull trades here is the stock's overbought posture. There's no doubt it could use a cooldown to digest the gains, but you could have said the same thing in December -- and it's risen for five straight weeks since.That said, I don't blame you if you'd prefer to wait for a lower-risk entry.On the daily view, you can see how effective the 20-day moving average has been in providing support during the ascent. Dips have been shallow, and bulls have been quick to buy the few drops that have arisen along the way; Volume patterns have been supportive of the trend for months.In the short run, ADBE has extended itself from the 20-day moving average. Therefore, I would not be surprised if we see some consolidation or a pullback, -- as either development will create a more compelling chance to buy. Buy Call Spreads of ADBE StockOptions offer a lower-cost avenue for exposure if you think the rise in Adobe continues. Buy the April $370/$390 bull call spread for around $8. The risk is limited to the initial cost of $8 and the reward is $12, offering a potential 150% return.That said, ADBE would need to rise past $390 by April expiration to capture the entire profit.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-14,"If you're like many Americans, retirement is arguably the biggest expense you're saving for. To that end, there's a good chance that your biggest pool of assets is your 401k account at work.According to industry group Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2018 there are more than 55 million Americans actively participating in their 401k accounts. Moreover, they have just over $5.7 trillion dollars in those accounts. And it's easy to see why as 401k's do provide plenty of benefits. From tax-deferred savings to employer matching, the accounts can be a real cornerstone to meeting retirement goals.The problem is that many 401k accounts are plagued with lousy mutual funds. Thanks to loose fiduciary standards, many plan providers aren't doing their part to help investors find the best mutual funds for their portfolios. Truth be told, the average 401k plan is a minefield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen) But luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we care about your returns and reaching your retirement goals. To that end, we've combed through the hundreds of portfolio options to bring you the best mutual funds to buy in your 401k.These 10 funds appear in plenty of plans and represent some of the best mutual funds to buy for long-term savings. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX)Expense Ratio: 0.04%, or $4 per $10,000 invested annuallyIt should come as no surprise that an option from Vanguard would be top-dog on a list of the best mutual funds. Investors are waking up to the power of index funds as they tend to outperform active management and feature rock-bottom expenses. And Vanguard is the indexing king.Plenty of 401k plans feature the top-notch Vanguard 500 Index Admiral (MUTF:VFIAX), which tracks the S&P 500. However, the Vanguard Total Stock Mkt Index (MUTF:VTSAX) may be a better choice for your 401k.The reason comes down to simplicity. VTSAX tracks everything. And we do mean everything. The mutual fund follows the CRSP US Total Market Index. This measure looks at the entire U.S. stock market. That includes giants like Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as absolute small fries that you've never heard off. All-in-all, VTSAX holds more than 3,590 different U.S. stocks.That huge breath of holdings means there's no need to hold individual funds covering every corner of the market. It's all here in VTSAX. This makes the option one of the best mutual funds for your core portfolio. After all, the whole point of a 401k is long-term growth. With VTSAX, you can get that all with ease.You also get some decent returns as well. Since its inception in 2000, the fund has managed to return at least 7.2% annually. Part of that comes from the fund's rock-bottom expense. VTSAX costs just 0.04% or $4 per $10,000 invested.With low costs, good returns and one-ticker access, VTSAX is a great core mutual fund for your 401k account. Fidelity Puritan (FPURX)Expense Ratio: 0.53%Thanks to their all-in-one diversification, balanced funds are often seen as one-stop shop for 401k investors. That's because they own both stocks and bonds under one ticker, usually at a 60/40 stock/bond split. The Fidelity Puritan (MUTF:FPURX) is considered a balanced fund. But one big twist makes it one of the best mutual funds to own for the long haul.FPURX isn't static in that 60/40 allocation. Unlike most balanced funds, Puritan's underlying asset allocation can shift as market conditions change. Managers can gauge market sentiment and play with that 60/40 weighting.So, in rising and bull markets, that 60/40 stock/bond split can be as high as 80/20. In declining markets, the reverse is possible. And since the fund's managers aren't tied to an index in either their bond or stock allocations, they can move around in this regard as well.This means they can load up on dirt-cheap values or small-cap stocks as well as tread into high-yield bonds. As a result, FPURX is a very different balanced mutual fund than what most investors are used to and it is more of a total return element for a portfolio. That makes it perfect for a tax-sheltered 401k.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness Speaking of those returns, Puritan has been spot on. Over the last decade, FPURX has managed to beat the average balanced fund in its category by roughly two percentage points annually. That return has been pretty close to the S&P 500 as well. And yet, FPURX has managed to produce less volatility.With low expenses of 0.53%, FPURX is a great all-in-one choice for your 401k. American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX)Expense Ratio: 0.57%&quot;The Bluest of the Blue Chips&quot; would be a prime way to describe American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (MUTF:AWSHX) fund. The reason for that moniker comes down to conservativism and stock picking requirements of its managers.Founded in 1952 specifically for fiduciaries, lead manager Alan N. Berro and his team use a variety of strict eligibility screens covering everything from debt levels, quality of earnings, dividend strength and other fundamental criteria. Only about 1% of all available U.S. companies are good enough to make into AWSHX's holdings.The end result in those strict requirements is a list of those stocks that absolutely dominate their respective fields, have been around since the beginning of time and feature strong sales/profit profiles. They churn out some hefty dividend income, too. Top holdings for the fund include Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).A despite being a gigantic fund -- with more than $120 billion in assets -- AWSHX has been pretty nimble. The focus on strong dividend-paying equities and holding them for the long-haul has resulted in some great returns. Over the last decade, the mutual fund has managed to pull in just over 12% annually. That's not too shabby at all.What's also not too shabby is its expenses. As an active fund, AWSHX's expense ratio of 0.57% is actually lower than some index funds. That makes it one of the best mutual funds to own for 401k investors heading into retirement. Dodge & Cox Stock (DODGX)Expense Ratio: 0.52%While &quot;growth&quot; has been a favorite since the recession, &quot;value&quot; has been the proven winner. And that's why 401k staple Dodge & Cox Stock (MUTF:DODGX) has been one of the best mutual funds to own.The fund has long had a contrarian and value tilt to its stock holdings. The key to DODGX's 8.95% annual return over the last two decades has been its unique strategy for picking stocks.DODGX runs on a committee basis. That is, each of its managers come up with stock ideas and screen for various value and metrics. Those ideas are taken to the fund's underlying committee who hold a vote for inclusion into the fund.Because stocks require an all or nothing vote, only a handful of values make into the portfolio. The fund has nearly $70 billion in assets and it only spreads those onto just 63 different names. Top holdings include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX).  * 10 Best Cloud Growth Stocks Right Now This, plus the fact that that DODGX tends to hold stocks for a long time once they're in the portfolio have made it an outstanding performer over the long haul. That includes besting the S&P 500 for much of the fund's lifetime. However, the shift to growth over value stocks in recent years has put pressures on its performance. But given values history of winning, it shouldn't be long before DODGX is back on top.With low expenses and a 1.79% dividend yield, investors can sit comfortably while they wait. Metropolitan West Total Return Bond (MWTRX)Expense Ratio: 0.67%Interest from bonds and cash holdings are generally taxed at ordinary income rates. So, a 401k or similar retirement plan is a great place to park fixed income mutual funds. The Metropolitan West Total Return Bond (MUTF:MWTRX) could be one of the rock stars of the sector.As its name implies, MWTRX is a so-called &quot;total return&quot; bond fund. That means the team at the fund isn't just buying bonds and clipping coupons. They are actively performing credit analysts to find bonds trading for discounts to their par values and underlying cash flows.At the same time, they're willing to sell overvalued bonds or securities that have seen their discounts shrink from their portfolio for gains. The combination of coupon clipping and price improvements results in the fund's return.This also has the fund not just buying IOUs from Uncle Sam. MWTRX holds a mix of government debt, corporate bonds and asset/mortgage-backed securities.The real win is that MWTRX's team happens to be one of the best at doing this. Fixed income is one of the few areas that active management can actually add real alpha to a portfolio. What makes this one of the best mutual funds to buy is its returns. Over the last decade, MWTRX has managed to outperform the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by more than 1% annually. For boring fixed-income investments, those are some serious extra returns.Moreover, those extra returns make the fund's expenses of 0.67% much easier to justify. T.Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (TRBCX)Expense Ratio: 0.7%Most active managers are pretty terrible. But when they are good, they are really good. Case in point, Larry Puglia and the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (MUTF:TRBCX). Puglia has been guiding TRBCX for twenty-five years and the results have been more than impressive.Since the fund's inception back in 1993, it's managed to produce an 11.01% annual total return. This compares to just a 9.6% return for the S&P 500 over that time. The reason for those extra returns comes down to stock selection.Puglia's combs the large- and mid-cap stock universe for stocks that have plenty of competitive advantages and wide moats. He then screens for those that have faster earnings growth than the broader market as well as high measures of free cash flows. The combination creates a portfolio of stocks primed for long term capital appreciation.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends And speaking of the long haul, Puglia tends to stick with his winners. For example, he's held Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) shares for roughly than 15 years. Add in a relatively concentrated portfolio of holdings -- at just 128 different stocks -- and you have a recipe for one of the best mutual funds to buy.Perhaps the only hit to TRBCX could be its expense ratio of 0.7%. However, given the continued gains and market-beating record of the fund, the higher than average expense ratio is justified. In the end, TRCBX is proof that active management can work. Vanguard PRIMECAP (VPMCX)Expense Ratio: 0.38%As we said, Vanguard is the index king. But you know what? It's a pretty great active fund manager as well. And the Vanguard PRIMECAP (MUTF:VPMCX) is its top dog.VPMCX is closed to new outside investors, but there is a backdoor. The fund is still open to those investors who have it as a 401k. Those investors should jump on the opportunity to own one of the best mutual funds around.Primecap is run by arguably one of the best sets of active managers in history. And while each of the fund's five managers are responsible for their own sleeve of assets, the idea is the same. PRIMECAP focuses on large- and mid-cap stocks that trade at bargain prices. However, these stocks do have plenty of growth behind them and many have specific growth catalysts that could propel them forward. This could mean an announced massive buyback program, segment disruption or even restructuring efforts.With the fund currently holding 139 different stocks, VPMAX's managers aren't afraid to place their bets on just a few key ones. Top holdings include Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Better still is that the team at VPMAX tends to hold stocks for the long haul in order to realize those growth catalysts and value creation.The end result? VPMAX has crushed the S&P 500. Over the one, five and 10-year periods, the fund has managed to beat the S&P 500 by over 1% annually. Constant outperformance is what makes Vanguard PRIMECAP a top choice for your 401k. Vanguard Real Estate Index Admiral (VGSLX)Expense Ratio: 0.12%When it comes to real estate mutual funds in a 401k, there really is only one option. And that's the Vanguard Real Estate Index Admiral (MUTF:VGSLX). Luckily, VGSLX is a great option and investors don't really need to look anywhere else.Thanks to its immense size -- nearly $70 billion in assets -- VGSLX was recently forced to switch indexes to accommodate that heft. It now tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50.But that switch may not be a bad thing after all. VGSLX's new index includes previous ignored real estate segments like data centers and timber REITs as well as real estate management firms like CBRE Group (NASDAQ:CBRE). This provides extra diversification and the ability to tap into some niche real estate sectors. All in all, the new index expands the fund's holdings from about 150 to 185 different real estate stocks.It's hard to gauge returns for VGSLX because the index transition is relatively new. However, over the longer term, the fund has done a great job mirroring its exposure and has produced some hefty average annual returns.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility And there's a reason to believe that VGSLX will keep that streak alive. Once again, as a Vanguard index fund, fees are dirt cheap for the fund. VGSLX only charges 0.12% in expenses. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX)Expense Ratio: 0.62%Retirement plans are required to include some specialty mutual funds and diversifiers in their mix. There's a good chance that includes the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund (MUTF:FLPSX), which is good because FLPSX has long been a great performer for investors.The fund is a bit of an odd bird in that manager Joel Tillinghast is forced to buy, as its name implies, low-priced stocks. The fund's mandate requires managers to only buy stocks that are initially trading for less than $35 per share. While that may seem crazy, it actually is really smart and helps generate some really big returns over the long haul.For starters, that low price requirement causes FLPSX to buy many small- and mid-cap stocks. Secondly, this requirement tends to skew the portfolio towards value names. The combination puts the mutual fund right in the sweet spot of the market. Small-cap value stocks have traditionally been the market's best performers for decades. And the fact that Tillinghast typically holds onto stocks for a long time only enhances this effect for the fund.What it really does is cause FLPSX to produce some top-notch returns. Over the life of the fund, FLPSX has managed to crush the Russell 2000 Index by nearly four percentage points per year. Meanwhile, the fund has managed to see lower drawdowns versus the index during rough patches such as over the last year.In the end, FLPSX is weird and but funky, and it has been a proven winner in many 401k plans. Vanguard Target Date Retirement SeriesTarget date funds get a bad rap from many investment professionals. And it's easy to see why. Many come layered with fees, under-performing active management and too much or too little risk for timelines. But when they are done right, they can be wonderful core or sole positions in a 401k plan. It's not surprising that Vanguard offers the gold standard.Funds like Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (MUTF:VFIFX) and Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 (MUTF:VTTVX) offer a blend of stocks and bonds that get more conservative as investors get closer to the date listed in the fund name. The funds are set up as &quot;through&quot; retirement funds and, as such, do include stock allocations during retirement.Vanguard uses just four underlying broad index funds to create the asset mix: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund and Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor Shares.With those four holdings, investors literally own every stock and bond on the planet. The diversification is amazing and supports long term growth until retirement. Even better is that Vanguard does a roll-up fee scheme in that the 0.15% you pay to hold the target date fund is the total fee for everything.All in all, if your plan offers Vanguard's target-date funds, it could be the only holding you need to have. And that makes them some of the best mutual funds around for retirement savers.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held a position in VFIFX.

2020-02-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Computers using artificial intelligence are discovering medicines, designing better golf clubs and creating video games.But are they inventors?Patent offices around the world are grappling with the question of who -- if anyone -- owns innovations developed using AI. The answer may upend what’s eligible for protection and who profits as AI transforms entire industries.“There are machines right now that are doing far more on their own than to help an engineer or a scientist or an inventor do their jobs,” said Andrei Iancu, director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. “We will get to a point where a court or legislature will say the human being is so disengaged, so many levels removed, that the actual human did not contribute to the inventive concept.”U.S. law says only humans can obtain patents, Iancu said. That’s why the patent office has been collecting comments on how to deal with inventions created through artificial intelligence and is expected to release a policy paper this year. Likewise, the World Intellectual Property Office, an agency within the United Nations, along with patent and copyright agencies around the world are also trying to figure out whether current laws or practices need to be revised for AI inventions.The debate comes as some of the largest global technology companies look to monetize massive investments in AI. Google’s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai, has described AI as “more profound than fire or electricity.” Microsoft Corp. has invested $1 billion in the research company Open AI. Both companies have thousands of employees and researchers pushing to advance the state of the art and move AI innovations into products.International Business Machines Corp.’s supercomputer Watson is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a research lab to develop new applications of AI in different industries, and some of China’s biggest companies are giving American companies a run for their money in the field.The European Patent Office last month rejected applications by the owner of an AI “creativity machine” named Dabus, saying that there is a “clear legislative understanding that the inventor is a natural person.” In December, the U.K. Intellectual Property Office turned down similar petitions, noting AI was never contemplated when the law was written.“Increasingly, Fortune 100 companies have AI doing more and more autonomously and they’re not sure if they can find someone who would qualify as an inventor,” said Ryan Abbott, a law professor at the University of Surrey in England. “If you can’t get protection, people may not want to use AI to do these things.”Abbott and Stephen Thaler, founder of St. Louis-based Imagination Engines Inc., filed patent applications in numerous countries for a food container and a “device for attracting enhanced attention,” listing Thaler’s machine Dabus as the inventor.The goal, Abbott said, was to force patent offices to confront the issue. He advocates listing the computer that did the work as the inventor, with the business that owns the machine also owning any patent. It would ensure that companies can get a return on their investment, and maintain a level of honesty about whether it’s a machine or a human that’s doing the work, he said.Businesses “don’t really care who’s listed as an inventor but they do care if they can get a patent,” Abbott said. “We really didn’t design the law with this in mind, so what do we want to do about it?”Still, to many AI experts and researchers, the field is nowhere near advanced enough to consider the idea of an algorithm as an inventor.‘Just Computer Tools’“Listing an AI system as a co-inventor seems like a gimmick rather than a requirement,” said Oren Etzioni, head of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle. “We often use computers as critical tools in generating patentable technology, but we don’t list our tools as co-inventors. AI systems don’t have intellectual property rights -- they are just computer tools.”The current state of the art in AI should put this question off for a long time, said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, who suggested the debate might be more appropriate in a “century or two.” Researchers are “very far from artificial general intelligence like ‘The Terminator’.”It’s not just who’s listed as the inventor that is flummoxing patent agencies.Software thus far can’t follow the scientific method -- independently developing a hypothesis and then conducting tests to prove or disprove it. Instead, AI is more often used for “brute force,” where it would simply “churn through a bunch of possibilities and see what works,” said Dana Rao, general counsel for Adobe Inc.Human v. Machine“The question is not ‘Can a machine be an inventor?’ it’s ‘Can a machine invent?”’ Rao said. “It can’t in the traditional way we view invention.”A patent is awarded to something that is “new, useful and non-obvious.” Often, that means figuring out what a person with “ordinary skill” in the field would understand to be new -- for instance, a knowledgeable laboratory researcher. That analysis gets skewed when courts and patent offices have to compare the work of a software program that can analyze an exponentially greater number of options than even a large team of human researchers.“The bar is changing when you use AI,” said Kate Gaudry, a patent lawyer with Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton in Washington. “However this is decided, we have to be consistent.”Iancu likened it to debates a century ago over awarding copyrights to photographs taken with a camera.“Somebody must have created the machine, somebody must have trained the machine and somebody must have pushed the ‘on’ button,” he said. “Do we think those activities are enough to count as human contributions to the invention process? If yes, the current law is enough.”Still, Rao said, there needs to be some way to help companies using AI to protect their ideas. That’s particularly true for copyrights on photographs created through a type of machine learning systems known as Generative Adversarial Networks.“If I want to create images to sell them, there needs to be ways of determining ownership,” Rao said.Abbott said one option would be similar to U.K. law where computer-generated artistic works are given a shorter copyright term than those created by a human. The U.S. requires copyright owners to be human, and famously denied a registration request on behalf a macaque monkey that had taken a “selfie” with a British nature photographer’s camera.The evolution of machine learning and neural networks means that, at some point, the role of humans in certain types of innovation will decrease. In those cases, who will own the inventions is a question that’s critical to companies using AI to develop new products.Iancu said he sees AI as full of promise, and notes that agencies have had to address such weighty questions before, such as genetically modified animals created in a lab, complex mathematics use for cryptography and synthetic DNA.“It’s one of these things where hopefully, the various jurisdictions around the world can discuss these issues before it’s too late, before we have to play catch up,” Iancu said.(Updates with copyright issues in fourth paragraph from the bottom.)To contact the reporters on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.net;Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Edison, Morse ...

2020-03-09,"Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE) survived the market sell-off last week. And it did it relatively well. As most of the tech sector, its stock has fallen from its peak price and now it looks it has even started to rebound. But the question of how far it will go keeps popping up and is surely on investors' minds.Background Photoshop is probably one of the company's main products or least the product which made Adobe famous as everyone knows the company by it. But today, Adobe is so much more than just Photoshop. Adobe has become a significant name in the cloud-based design, data analytics and document management software (DMS).It provides graphics software solutions with its Creative Clouds. Also, it offers Documents Clouds services equipped with its PDF document format. And there is also marketing software and services, offered through Experience Cloud services.Main Competitors Adobe's wide number of services and activities competes with many companies and their respective business segments. Even Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) can be considered as Adobe's competitors in some segments, but more appropriate competitors are DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: DOCU), Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ: DBX), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM), Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE: SSTK), Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK).Earnings Estimates The company is expecting quarterly revenues of $3.04 billion, which is an increase of 17% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Expected operating earnings are $2.23 a share, which is an increase of 30%. Whole year sales are expected to be $13.15 billion with a profit of $9.75 per share. If the company manages to beat expectations, investors will surely help the company's stock get back up. If the results fall short, that might push the company back to a selloff point.For the past three years, Adobe has achieved an annual earnings per share growth rate of 24%. This is a very remarkable figure, making Adobe above its competitors in the desktop software market. So, maybe Photoshop made Adobe a leader in the desktop software industry years ago, but the creation of Creative Cloud shows that the company is reinventing itself every day with new challenges, fortifying its leadership position as opposed to living on past glory.Outlook We should maybe take into consideration that 15% of the company's revenues come from the Asia-Pacific region. And due to the Coronavirus outbreak in China, some of the company's revenues may take a hit. On the other hand, it is logical to assume that those predictions are included in the company's expectations.Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss's viewpoint is in favor of slow-but-steady assets with long-term growth prospects, like Adobe. His target price for Adobe between $410 and $450, which is a nice increase from the current share price. With earnings coming up on March 12th, expectations are that Adobe will maintain its strong financial position, and it will continue to demonstrate its champion qualities. Let wait for the earnings call so you can still hold ADBE stock with confidence.This Publication is contributed by IAMNewswire.comPress Releases - If you are looking for full Press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.comContributors - IAM Newswire accepts pitches.

The company posted net income of $955 million, or $1.96 a share, up from $674 million, or $1.36 a share, in the year-prior quarter. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, up from $1.71 in the year-prior period and ahead of the $2.23 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had been modeling. Adobe's revenue rose to $3.09 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier, whereas analysts had been modeling $3.05 billion.

Adobe said in its release that the targets &quot;factor the expected impact of the global uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 situation based on the latest data and information available,&quot; referring to the disease brought on by the novel coronavirus.

2020-03-12,"Welcome back, bears.The Dow retreated further on Thursday and has now pulled back 26% from its all-time high, crossing the threshold considered to officially trigger a bear market. The latest sell-off came after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic and Trump addressed the virus in a speech in which he also announced a ban on most travel from Europe, without delivering the economic and medical response investors were hoping for.In a note to clients, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives reminds investors that as history has repeatedly shown, the many panics, fears, and sell-offs on account of different types of market and &quot;shock&quot; events, always present openings for investors.“We view these times of fear and ‘white knuckle’ Street panic as witnessed over the past week with the coronavirus outbreak as while tragic for the individuals and families impacted, representing golden buying opportunities to own the tech themes and stocks that we believe will be long term winners,” Ives said.Using TipRanks’ Stock Screener tool, we gauge the sentiment on the Street towards three stocks the Wedbush analyst notes are at bargain prices. Turns out, that the analyst consensus currently rates all three as Strong Buys. Let’s take a closer look.Uber Technologies (UBER)Following a very hyped IPO last year, Uber stock has crashed down the charts, as heavy losses and disappointing earnings results sapped investors’ morale. Since bottoming out in November, Uber finally got a foot back on the market ladder, with the ride sharing pioneer posting healthy gains in 2020. That is, until the recent downturn swiftly wiped them all out again.There is no doubt, as Ives notes, that Uber will feel the coronavirus’ impact on its daily business due to people travelling less. Although its closest rival Lyft has suggested Uber will take more of a hit as it operates in many different countries, Ives argues that Uber differentiates itself on account of its multi-pronged approach. Citing the company’s ability to morph its platform into a broader consumer engine with Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and autonomous initiatives as “just scratching the surface” on the full monetization potential of its business. The analyst believes that as the market leader in one of the most innovative growth sectors, Uber can turn into the Amazon of its industry.Ives concluded, “We believe Uber remains a core name to own for the coming years and attractive risk/reward to play these trends despite the near-term worries with coronavirus fears. We believe SOTP is the best way to value Uber as saying it’s just a ridesharing platform would be undervaluing the value of the entire company which has the DNA to become a game changing consumer distribution ecosystem over the coming years.”Along with his bullish call, Ives keeps an Outperform rating on Uber along with a $52 price target. The figure suggests potential upside of a very healthy 115% in the coming months.Is the Street still keen on catching an Uber ride? It appears so. Uber’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 26 Buys and 3 Holds. 90% upside could be attained should the $49.92 price target be met over the next year. (See Uber stock analysis on TipRanks)Microsoft (MSFT)With the market pressing the panic alarm, it is very easy to forget that only a few weeks ago, some of the world’s biggest companies were actually notching all-time highs. Microsoft has retreated by 24% since reaching the milestone a month ago. According to Ives, there may be an opportunity to buy the dip in the tech giant.Unsurprisingly, the world’s second largest company by market cap is feeling the pinch of the market’s downturn. Microsoft took its PC March guidance off the table on account of supply chain issues, which have affected scores of tech companies all over the world. The PC segment is clearly a focus for the Street, as it comprises roughly a third of revenue for MSFT.However, Ives notes that many investors will look past this issue as more of a temporarily blip than a longer-term worry. Importantly, the rest of Microsoft’s March guidance, which includes the enterprise, Azure, Office 365 and cloud segments, remains unchanged.Ives argues that based on Wedbush analysis, 32% of workloads are currently on the cloud, with the number set to increase to 55% by 2022. With a $800 billion TAM (total addressable market) the analyst believes MSFT is “poised to win the next phase of cloud.”Ives concluded, “Microsoft firmly remains our favorite cloud play for 2020 and beyond; despite the bad news from the PC/supply chain (which we view as temporary) this does not change our bullish thesis around Azure's growth and the longer-term prospects for Redmond over the coming years.”As a result, Ives reiterates an Outperform rating on Microsoft shares along with a $210 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing a 44% gain. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)The Street is almost unanimously bullish on the tech giant. 1 Hold countering a resounding 25 Buys, provides MSFT with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target comes in at $197.32 and implies upside of 36%. (See Microsoft stock analysis on TipRanks)Adobe (ADBE)A fellow large-cap with recent all-time highs is software company Adobe. The creator of ubiquitous offerings such as Photoshop, Adobe Flash and the PDF, reached a new peak of $383 on February 19. Unlike many tech companies reliant on the Chinese economy, Adobe has minimal exposure to the giant from the Far East. Still, Adobe hasn’t been spared in the recent bloodbath and is down 22% from its all-time high.Adobe’s growth has been impressive. Since the third quarter of 2015, the company has generated record revenue in every quarter and has posted year-over-year revenue growth of over 20% for 18 consecutive quarters. Investors will be keen to see if the company can keep it up when it will release its FQ1 2020 results this evening.Ives believes Adobe “represents a defensive and offensive core SaaS software stalwart.” The 5-star analyst notes the acquisitions of Marketo and Magento show it is successfully transitioning from its core consumer base to the B2B landscape.Ives said,  “We continue to see relatively healthy demand trends for the company’s creative and marketing solutions with ADBE driving increased customer lifetime value and TAM expansion opportunity with subscriptions over the next 12 to 18 months a key lever that may drive further upside over time. With ARR and subscription growth humming and further margin improvement on the horizon, ADBE fundamentally speaking has significant tailwinds heading into 2020 and beyond, in our opinion, with no major speed bumps that we see on the horizon.”Looking at the consensus breakdown, the bulls are leading the way. Adobe’s 17 Buys and 5 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The analysts put an average price target of $361.14 on the stock, expecting it to add nearly 22% over the coming months.

This situation may lead to some strategic and financial driven M&As, which will be perfect for companies with strong balance sheets like Adobe, Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL).Q1 Earnings Results The analysts expected Adobe to make earnings per share of $2.23 and sales of $3.04 billion. Adobe managed to beat those expectations and to achieve sales of $3.09 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 in Q1. If we compare year-over-year, Adobe's sales went up 19%, while earnings grew more, 33%. The results might have been even better for 7 cents a share if there were no additional cancelation expenses for the company's events like the annual Adobe Summit. An official announcement of the cancelation of the Adobe Summit in Las Vegas was made on March 2nd. The event was scheduled for March 29-April 2, and it will now be held as an online event. The Summit gathered more than 16,000 participants last year, and its focus is on technology related to customer experience management.Q1 results were the third consequent quarter where Adobe delivered accelerating earnings growth in software-as-a-service provider and cloud computing.Earnings Guidance For Q2 Adobe expects to make sales of $3.175 billion in its second fiscal quarter, which is lower than the analysts' predictions of $3.22 billion. On the other hand, Adobe's expectation regarding the adjusted earnings per share is $2.35, while the analysts predicted the lower value, $2.33 a share. In the second quarter of the previous year, Adobe achieved sales of $2.74 billion and earnings per share of $1.83.Outlook When you have a subscription-based business model like Adobe, revenues and earnings can be treated as quite predictable. Still, the Covid-19 is expected to make some sort of mark on its finances. Some financial defensive mechanisms may be to reduce marketing spending, defer bookings decisions or delay consulting services, but that may have an effect in the after periods. The subscription-based business model, which has proven again in Q1 to provide strong revenues, earnings, and cash flow, will be a good base for the company to cope with the uncertain period ahead.This Publication is contributed by IAMNewswire.comPress Releases - If you are looking for full Press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.comContributors - IAM Newswire accepts pitches.

2020-03-20,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced economic shutdowns around the world, as nations and governments try to cope with the ill and prevent or slow the further spread of the disease. Stock markets have crashed in recent weeks; the Dow Jones is down 32% from its most recent peak, and the S&P 500 has lost 29%. With the advent of a true bear market cycle, economists are growing more certain in their warnings of a recession this year.But despite the near-certainty that an epidemic-related recession is on the way (or already here), there is considerable doubt that it will be long-lasting in its effects. Economic conditions were reasonably strong before the coronavirus hit, and both the January and February jobs reports showed better than expected gains in employment and increases in wages. So, it may be no surprise that investment bank Morgan Stanley sees current conditions as an opportunity for traders.Expanding on that, the bank’s CIO of Wealth Management, Lisa Shalett, describes the main indexes as “close to a bottom.” She adds, “Now we see some very good opportunities to dollar-cost average back into a market that’s likely to bump around this bottom,” and says that investors should expect another three to six months on market weakness. Her colleague Mike Wilson gives a concurring analysis, pointing out that by now the markets are “pricing in” recession conditions, and that, with prices this close to bottom, now is the time to get back into stocks.In the mid-term, Morgan Stanley’s investment team sees a mild recession in the offing, with a shallow unemployment cycle. The bank’s analysts see earnings rebounding next year, and recommends moving into US-based large-cap stocks, as that is where the growth potential resides.Morgan Stanley didn’t just leave its forecast to the realm of general conditions. The firm’s analysts have also released reports on specific equities which they believe will lead the turnaround when markets improve. We’ve used TipRanks database to pull up the data on three of those stocks – each shows a Buy consensus rating, and greater than 10% upside potential. Let’s dig a little deeper.Chegg, Inc. (CHGG)Since everyone is home, and many school districts are closed, we’ll start with a company particularly well-suited to benefit from home schooling. Chegg is a tech company specializing in online textbook rental, flash cards, study guides, writing guides, and tutors – in short, all of the web-based services you’ll need for effective home schooling, whether short- or long-term. The company has expanded aggressively in the past two years, clearing its field by acquiring competitors.The value of Chegg’s niche is clear from a look at its earnings reports. The company has beaten the EPS forecasts in each of the last five quarters, and until the market collapse of the last few weeks it had been matching the S&P’s overall gains. The Q4 earnings capped this trend with a 17% EPS beat (35 cents per share reported) and a 34% year-over-year revenue gain, with the top line reported at $125.5 million.Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer sums up Chegg’s performance in clear, unmistakable terms: “Near-term, Chegg's value proposition becomes stronger as universities shift to virtual classes and students require more tools to supplement education. Long-term, a prolonged COVID-19 impact and potential recession in [our] bear case could result in higher student enrollment.”Baer reiterates his Buy rating on CHGG stock, and his price target, $49, predicts 63% upside growth, showing his confidence in the stock. (To watch Baer’s track record, click here)Chegg shares are rated a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, as 7 out of 8 recent reviewers came down on the Buy-side. The lone holdout rated the stock a Hold. The average price target of $44.75 suggests a premium of nearly 50% from the current share price of $31. (See Chegg stock analysis on TipRanks)Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Next up on our list is one of the largest players in the semiconductor chip industry. Broadcom was the sixth largest chip maker, by revenues, last year, and saw $22.6 billion in sales for the 2019 fiscal year. In Q4, the company brought in $5.8 billion revenues, and saw that improve sequentially to $5.9 billion in Q1 fiscal 2020. Earnings for Q1 were reported at $5.25, edging above the estimates but slipping 5.4% year-over-year.From an investor’s perspective, Broadcom’s value is enhanced by its reputation as a dividend champion. The current quarterly payment , $3.25, annualizes to $13, and gives an impressive yield of 6.8%, almost 3.5x the average among the company’s S&P peers, and far higher than Treasure bonds are yielding. Broadcom has been paying out dividends reliably for the last nine years, and has raised the payment three times in the last three years.5-star analyst Craig Hettenbach, writing on the stock for Morgan Stanley, rates AVGO shares a Buy. His $340 price target suggests an upside of 74%, strong by any standard.In his comments on the stock, Hettenbach says, “We … think the stock is poised to outperform after meaningfully lagging the past 2 years... This creates a low bar, and we think AVGO will be able to execute on synergies... If AVGO is able to execute in software it would add to what we view as a very compelling franchise in semis, creating a diversiﬁed, highly proﬁtable and cash generative business.” (To watch Hettenbach’s track record, click here)The analyst consensus on AVGO shares is a Strong Buy, based on no fewer than 16 Buy-side reviews against just 2 Holds. It’s not a cheap stock, selling for $191.20, but the $306.12 average price target implies an upside of 50% growth in the coming 12 months. (See Broadcom stock analysis on TipRanks)Adobe, Inc. (ADBE)We’ll wrap up with Adobe, a long-time staple of the markets. The company, first founded in 1982, has long been a leader in tech, invented the PDF format, and offers the popular Photoshop and Illustrator graphic editing software packages. The company’s strength is clear from its $11.2 billion in fiscal 2019 revenues.ADBE shares rose steadily for five months, from October last year until the current market drop began this past February 19. Unlike many companies, Adobe’s rise was high enough that it still shows a net gain for this period (up 17.6% from its most recent trough on October 23 last year). The company’s quarterly reports have reflected the share gains; Adobe has beaten the estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. In Q4 2019, ADBE showed $2.08 billion in revenue and $1.74 in EPS, which increased to $3.09 billion and $2.27 EPS in Q1 fiscal 2020.A solid financial base and popular, well-known products put Adobe in a sound position to hold its own during a market downturn, especially its software products are cloud-based and amenable to work-from-home conditions. According to Morgan Stanley, Adobe ‘carries momentum’ into the current viral epidemic crisis.The firm’s 5-star analyst Keith Weiss describes Adobe as a ‘steady ship in stormy seas,’ and writes of the stock, “In volatile environments, we favor owning the most durable EPS stories – where the business model, end-markets and management commitment to sustaining operating margins could enable profitability to better weather a difficult spending environment. In Q1 results, Adobe showed why they are included in our list of high-quality software franchises to own through the current volatility.”Weiss puts a $366 price target on ADBE shares, indicating room for potential growth of 19%, and supporting his Buy rating. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here)Weiss is not alone is rating ADBE shares a Buy. The company has received another 13 Buy-side reviews in recent weeks, and taken with the 5 Holds the stock has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. Adobe does not pay a dividend, and the stock is expensive at $307, so investors are looking for gains in share appreciation. The average price target of $344.50 suggests that there is room for 12% upside growth in the coming year. (See Adobe stock analysis on TipRanks)",Morgan Stanley: 3 Stocks to Snap up Now

In addition, they say the shift to cyber technology is accelerating the need for security systems outside the firewall, which should go a long way to benefit Zscaler Inc (ZS) , CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), and CyberArk Software (CYBR) among others.Already in coming months, Wedbush analysts Ives and Backe, expect a resurgence of mergers & acquisitions as “valuations start to reach levels which can ignite a long overdue deal frenzy that could start to put a floor on the software sector as well.” (See TipRanks’ Stock Screener for technology names that could stand out at current levels)“Microsoft, Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), and Oracle (ORCL) are just a handful of the strategic players looking to beef up their cloud portfolios over the next year with fortress like treasure chests abound,” Ives and Backe said.Ives has an Outperform rating for Microsoft, Apple, Salesforce and Zscaler, and an Underperform rating for Slack Technologies.

2020-03-27,"In the wake of the onset of the coronavirus from China, some unexpected opportunities have arisen in the markets. Work-at-home stocks have gained traction lately, including those in the e-signature niche. Therefore, an intriguing asset for investors in these troublesome times is DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com You might not have considered an e-signature company as a way to capitalize on the work-from-home trend. But social distancing might be here to stay for a while. In some areas, the stay-at-home mandate could last for months. This scenario sets DOCU stock for potential outperformance, even if the broader market corrects. The E-signature LeaderBecause of coronavirus concerns, business travel isn't always a viable alternative. No one can predict how much longer the virus will prevent people from traveling. For the time being, teleconferencing and other niches have come front and center.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong those niches is electronic signatures. Back in April 2018, when DocuSign went public, electronic document signature providers weren't exactly a hot topic. This was basically a cottage industry at the time. People weren't buzzing about DOCU stock on financial message boards and chat rooms.That's changing today due to the tremendous social and business impact of the coronavirus. The San Francisco based company is now thrust into the spotlight. It can fill a pressing demand as more companies avoid business travel and insist that contracts and other documents be signed electronically.  * 7 Buyout Targets to Watch for in 2020 Since this is what DocuSign specializes in facilitating, the company is a better fit in this specific niche than Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). If you invest in Adobe stock, you're participating in a more diversified company. If you want a pure and targeted play in e-signatures, stick with DOCU stock. Analysts Sign Off on DocuSignA number of prominent experts have given their &quot;signature of approval&quot; to Docusign. One such expert is William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri. He seems to suggest that Docusign could prosper even in the face of a broader business-activity slowdown:&quot;While the number of business agreements being signed globally may decline, those that are continuing to work are enabled by DocuSign to close agreements without meeting face to face … We expect that DocuSign will be relatively resilient in this environment given digital nature of the products DocuSign provides and the remote implementation options.&quot;Again, it's all about social distancing. Face-to-face business interactions are increasingly being frowned upon, and DocuSign already had robust technology in place to meet the newfound demand for digital-signature facilitation.Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky is similarly bullish on the company, stating, &quot;We see DocuSign well positioned within the defensive category of digital transformation spend.&quot;RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin, meanwhile, praised DocuSign's February 2020 acquisition of Seal Software. That acquisition will enhance DocuSign's ability to leverage the power of artificial intelligence in the domain of contract analytics.In Zukin's estimation, &quot;The opportunity to reduce time spent on manual workflows through the addition of Seal to the portfolio can help bolster the value proposition and drive ROI (return on investment) for customers.&quot;Along with the nods from the financial experts, we can appreciate DocuSign's strong fourth-quarter earnings results. Specifically, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter were up 12 cents per share. That's a 100% increase compared to the same quarter a year earlier.Moreover, DocuSign posted quarterly revenue of $274.9 million. This represents an impressive increase of 38% in relation to the same quarter from the prior year. Clearly, the experts are justified in their bullish stance on this exciting company. The Final Word on DOCU StockThe e-document market is likely to flourish as the coronavirus has forced businesses to change how they conduct contract signings and other digital-paperwork transactions. DocuSign's earnings have been strong, and the company is loved by analysts. Therefore, I'm more than happy to add my virtual signature to the growing list of DOCU stock bulls.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

Adobe’s engineers were also trying to resolve other potential issues in progress.“We’re working urgently to get back online as soon as possible,” Adobe told users in a tweet.

2020-05-29,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Once again, U.S. stocks are rallying, with the S&P 500 up over 2% in this shortened week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost twice as much. And once again, corporate earnings reports don't seem to be much of a driver.As has been the case for most of this earnings season, investor reaction to earnings reports themselves has been rather muted. There were a couple of exceptions. StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) soared 27% on Wednesday after a blowout Q1 report. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) fell 12% the following day on soft guidance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut among major names, investors mostly shrugged. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) posted same-store sales growth over 20% and its stock still dropped over 1%.Investors seem to be looking past near-term earnings. That may change next week, as a number of companies with short-term pandemic tailwinds take center stage.After all, the market rally off March lows has come as the market looks forward to better days. For many of these companies, however, the good times should have arrived already. And that could set up some potential declines if results fall short of expectations -- or even if investors take the opportunity to sell the news.Here are the seven key earnings reports to watch in what should be an interesting week:  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure   * Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM)  * CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)  * Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)  * Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)  * DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)  * MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)  * Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Zoom VideoSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 2, after market closeOne of the market's biggest ""pandemic plays"" gets its first big test on Tuesday afternoon. Among large-cap stocks, Zoom Video has been the third-best performer so far in 2020, rising 140%. Only DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and vaccine developer Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) have done better.But ZM stock has pulled back a bit in recent sessions, part of a broader rotation out of short-term winners. And that sets up an interesting fiscal first quarter release.After all, expectations are going to be sky-high. Zoom already has disclosed that its usage soared from 10 million daily participants in December to over 300 million in March.The questions are: How many of those users are paying? And how many will stick around as normalcy returns? With ZM trading at a staggering 74x trailing twelve-month revenue, Zoom needs to offer impressive answers on Tuesday. CrowdStrikeSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 2, after market closeCrowdStrike stock is another 2020 winner, gaining 59% year-to-date. As with Zoom, the pandemic is seen as a positive catalyst, as enterprises look to manage the security risks created by employees working from home.Unlike Zoom stock, however, CRWD still sits below all-time highs reached last year. Valuation certainly is stretched, at 34x revenue. But a potentially transformative company in the growing cybersecurity space could see that valuation expand if optimism continues to grow.A big report on Tuesday along with strong guidance, would seem to be a step in that direction. But it's worth considering the trading in fellow cybersecurity play Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) on Thursday afternoon.  * 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Great Potential That company handily beat analyst estimates and gave an above-consensus outlook. Shares dropped 1.6% in the after-hours session. It may take a monster quarter from CrowdStrike to extend the rally. As OKTA shows, even that might not be enough. Campbell SoupSource: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, June 3, before market openBefore the pandemic hit, Campbell Soup stock had traded sideways for about five months, trading mostly between $46 and $48. The last three months have seen enhanced volatility, but after all that movement, CPB still sits at $49 ahead of earnings next week.Clearly, there's still a ""wait and see"" approach from the market as Campbell executes a pivot into faster-growing categories like snacks and organic foods. But Wednesday morning's fiscal third quarter release might finally break the range.After all, consumer stocking and shuttered restaurants drove higher grocery sales in the quarter. Kroger (NYSE:KR) posted same-store sales growth of 30% in March. Campbell needs to show that it was able to capture some of that growth. Investors may not get a better quarter with which to judge the success of Campbell's transformation.With fellow packaged food play J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) reporting on Thursday morning, it's an interesting week for the sector as well. We haven't seen too many key reports from the industry since late April. Will investors still buy these defensive names in a more aggressive market that's looking to a more normal economy? BroadcomSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeSemiconductor stocks have held up reasonably well so far in 2020. Widely-held names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sit not far from their highs. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down just 2% year-to-date.Broadcom hasn't fared quite as well, with a 10% YTD decline. A strong fiscal Q2 report on Thursday could inspire confidence and allow AVGO to join peers in challenging past highs.But it's also a big report for the sector. Chief executive officer Hock Tan is widely respected, and his commentary on demand can move other chip names. For instance, chip stocks began rallying in early October, just weeks after Tan called a bottom in the business after his company's Q3 report.Meanwhile, Broadcom's reach is, well, broader than that of many other large-cap names. Its results could signal wider trends in tech as enterprises respond to the pandemic.  * 25 Stocks to Buy for the Reopening Rally Broadcom earnings often don't get the headlines accorded other chip giants. But its reports should be required reading for investors in any environment, particularly this one. MongoDBSource: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeYet another enterprise software provider with a sky-high valuation reports next week, as MongoDB releases first quarter results. Shares of the database platform operator aren't quite as expensive as ZM or CRWD, but at 28x sales are hardly cheap. A 64% gain YTD raises concerns about expectations.But MDB is a more 'under the radar' play than those larger software plays. And the tailwinds behind the company aren't quite as clear, or perhaps as stiff, as those benefiting CrowdStrike and Zoom. As a test for broader worries about valuation in software, MDB might be more useful than the better-known companies reporting earlier in the week. Slack TechnologiesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeTwo more pandemic plays report on Thursday afternoon. For Slack, the fiscal Q1 report seems like a huge opportunity.'Work from home' should be a tailwind for Slack as much as Zoom. Both companies are useful in connecting remote employees, and should benefit from what increasingly looks like a secular trend.  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 Yet while WORK has doubled from March lows, the stock is up 'only' 44% so far this year, and sits about even to August levels. A big report could continue the rally and lead WORK to the kind of breakout to new highs that ZM and CRWD have seen. DocuSignSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 4, after market closeDocuSign is yet another software play reporting next week with a huge valuation and a secular tailwind. Adoption no doubt has picked up amid closed offices and shut-in consumers. Presumably, once users move to e-signatures from paper copies, they don't return.But DocuSign may have less room for error than other software plays, even if a 24x revenue multiple makes valuation more reasonable (at least in context). The company faces a tough competitor in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), who can leverage its existing user base for its Adobe Sign. And DocuSign still needs to prove it can drive the incremental margins for which investors are paying so dearly at the moment.As with so many earnings reports next week, this seems like a crucial test for DocuSign itself. The sheer number of high-multiple, high-growth companies releasing earnings reports makes the week a crucial test for a market trying to claw back to past levels.

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. reported recurring revenue for creative and document applications that topped analyst estimates, signaling steady demand for Photoshop and productivity tools while users work from home.Annualized recurring revenue for the digital media division was $9.17 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter, the San Jose, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $9.03 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Adobe projected revenue of $3.15 billion in the current period ending in August, missing analysts’ average estimate of $3.27 billion, because of weak demand for the company’s Advertising Cloud product. The company withdrew its annual forecast announced in December.The software maker told investors in March that the coronavirus outbreak had created business uncertainty and reduced corporate marketing budgets, leading to weaker demand for its products. Thursday’s results showed the damage to the business wasn’t as bad as feared with quarterly sales increasing 14% to $3.13 billion. Analysts projected $3.16 billion.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has spurred Adobe’s revenue and market value to record heights since he transitioned the company to cloud-based software in 2012. Before the coronavirus pandemic and recession, Adobe’s torrid pace of growth was expected to slow, even as the company unveils a steady stream of new products to modernize clients’ technology systems and freshen mobile apps for consumers, designers and social media influencers. While Adobe has sought to diversify from the creative products that became household names with expensive bets on enterprise software, Photoshop and its brethren remains the company’s cash cow.“We have successfully navigated several crises and have always used them as a catalyst to make strategic and structural change to emerge stronger,” Narayen said in a conference call after the results. “Our employees, broad and diverse portfolio of products, strong balance sheet and rigorous operating cadence put us in a rarified atmosphere among companies of our size and scale.”Shares rose about 3% in extended trading after closing at $387.67 in New York. The stock has climbed about 18% this year.Profit, after some expenses, was $2.45 a share in the period ended May 29, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.34. Adobe said it will generate a profit of $2.40 a share in the current period, missing estimates by 5 cents.Revenue from digital media, led by Photoshop but including Acrobat and other document products, climbed 18% to $2.23 billion in the quarter from a year earlier and is projected to increase 16% year-over-year in the current period. Adobe said the unit’s annual recurring revenue will show a net increase of $340 million in the current period, pointing to continued growth for the business.Sales in the company’s digital experience segment, which includes marketing software, rose 5% to $826 million. Adobe said the Advertising Cloud business didn’t realize $50 million of expected revenue in the quarter because the company discontinued a low-margin product and due to the macroeconomic environment. Sales in the digital experience unit will be flat, year-over-year, in the current quarter, the company said.Adobe’s executives said that by stopping the product, which helped clients conduct advertising transactions, the company can instead invest in future growth areas, such as making web browsers a better platform for creating content, artificial intelligence and next-generation apps. Adobe has seen record web traffic for its document and creative products, but demand from small and mid-sized businesses has waned during the pandemic.(Updates with CEO quote in sixth paragraph and additional details in the final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Adobe Rises on Durable Demand for Creative, Document Apps"

2020-06-12,"Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500's (NYSE: SPY) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there's no question some big-name stocks did much better than others along the way.Adobe's Big Decade: One top performer of the last decade was digital media software company Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE).Adobe has spent the past decade building a dominant market position in the high-growth field of creative software. Key products include Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. In addition, it has generated impressive cash flow from its high-margin software business that it has used to aggressively buy back stock.Adobe shares started the 2010s trading at $37.09 and hit their decade low of $22.67 in late 2011. Adobe shares then went on a tear for the next eight years. Not even a major security breach in 2013 that exposed records of 150 million customers could keep the stock down for long.Adobe hit $100 for the first time in 2016, $200 for the first time in 2018, and eclipsed $300 in mid-2019. Adobe shares made it as high as $386.74 in February of this year before the COVID-19 market sell-off. Adobe briefly fell back as low as $255.13 in March before quickly bouncing back.2020 And Beyond: Adobe broke out to new all-time highs during the broad market rebound in May, peaking at $409.98 just this week.Overall, Adobe has been a home run investment over the past 10 years. In fact, $1,000 worth of Adobe stock in 2010 would be worth about $12,600 today.Looking ahead, analysts expect Adobe to cool off a bit in the coming months. The average price target among the 23 analysts covering the stock is $350, suggesting 11.9% downside from current levels.Related Links:Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Marathon Oil Stock Back In 2010 Would Be Worth TodayHere's How Much Investing ,000 In The 2014 GrubHub IPO Would Be Worth TodaySee more from Benzinga  * Here's How Large Option Traders Are Playing Gilead Following Latest COVID-19 Trial Data  * Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Lululemon Stock Back In 2010 Would Be Worth Today  * Microsoft Option Trader Bets .2M That 2020 Rally Will Continue(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it plans to sell Mac computers using processors designed in-house, signaling an end to its 15-year alliance with Intel Corp.The first Macs with the Apple-designed chips will debut by the end of the year, Tim Cook, the chief executive officer, said Monday at the company’s virtual conference for software makers. Apple is also working on models with Intel processors, Cook said.“When we make bold changes, it’s for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products,” Cook said. “The Mac is transitioning to our own Apple silicon.”The new chips will enable Apple to build computers with improved security and battery life, said Johny Srouji, Apple’s silicon chief. Developers will need to compile versions of their apps compatible with the new products for the software to run smoothly. However, Apple will provide a fall-back to make old apps run on the new system. Microsoft Corp. and Adobe Inc. have already begun updating Office and Photoshop, Apple said.Apple introduced an array of software enhancements to its products at the event Monday. It will make the most drastic changes to the iPhone home screen since the product’s release in 2007, bringing the software more in line with Google’s Android. Users will be able to place widgets that sit between the typical grid of apps, can be set to varying sizes and present information, such as the weather or a calendar, that updates throughout the day. The Apple Watch will get sleep tracking and hand-washing detection tools.The changes to the Mac are the most significant, though. Apple will release a major new version of the Mac operating system, called Big Sur, with support for the new chips. The design looks similar to the iPhone and iPad, with curved app icons, translucency, notification bubbles and the new widgets feature from iOS 14. The Messages and Maps apps will gain many of the features available in their mobile counterparts, and the Safari web browser will get a translation tool, changes to tabbed browsing and a customizable home page. Executives made a point of demonstrating how smoothly these apps run on Apple-designed chips.The partnership between Apple and Intel was formed in 2005, when Steve Jobs outlined a move away from PowerPC processors onstage at the same Apple event series for developers. Intel helped Apple catch up to Windows computers, some of which were more powerful at the time. In tandem, though, Apple was working on more energy-efficient chips for mobile devices based on Arm Ltd. designs and continues to use those to power the iPhone and iPad.In recent years, the speed and power efficiency of Apple’s mobile chips have rapidly increased, while the pace of improvement to Intel’s parts has slowed. This irked Apple executives, who pushed the company’s silicon unit to develop more powerful processors fit for the Mac, people familiar with the matter have said.The split from Intel has been a long time in the making. As far back as 2012, Apple was exploring a switch to its own chips, Bloomberg reported at the time. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that Apple would formally begin the transition away from Intel in 2020.In addition to ensuring legacy software runs well on the new Macs, a challenge for Apple will be to make processors speedy enough to replace Intel chips in its “pro” line of computers. Apple didn’t say Monday which models will get the new chips. Intel shares were about flat in intraday trading, while Apple’s stock was up 2% Monday, surpassing market-wide gains.Intel said in an emailed statement that it will continue to support Apple as a customer. Intel also boasted that its chips are the most advanced and offer the most open platform for software developers.The Mac is no longer the key revenue driver for Apple that it once was, but it safely sells about 20 million unit a year, delivering about $25 billion in revenue. The computers are also key for Apple to retain its professional market, which helps spur purchases of more popular devices like iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches.For Intel, a break with Apple is more of a symbolic blow than a financial one. The entire Mac laptop lineup represents less than 5% of Intel’s annual revenue, according to an estimate by Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The bigger concern is that Apple could embolden other computer makers to make similar moves, he said. “Now you have an actual PC that can run on something that’s not Intel.”Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has shrugged off attempts to unseat its dominance of personal computing for decades. Its only direct rival today is Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has produced newer processors that have begun to take share over the last two years. But AMD’s revenue is still less than 10% of that of Intel.Other efforts to break Intel’s lucrative grip on computer processors haven’t made much of a dent. Microsoft Corp. has a version of Windows that works with chips made by Qualcomm Inc. PC makers, including Microsoft itself, have made laptops based on that combination. Those products are praised for their battery life but haven’t grabbed significant market share. The Qualcomm processors are based on the Arm technology that Apple uses in its semiconductors.While Intel’s grip on the market is largely intact and its earnings continue to grow, analysts have seen signs of slippagge. Most of that stems from persistent delays in introducing new production techniques. Once the leader in the crucial means of making processors faster and more efficient, Intel now trails Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the producer of all Apple-designed chips.Those slip-ups may have accelerated Apple’s departure from Intel, said Matt Ramsay, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Apple is a technology leader partly because of its control over both the software and hardware and its willingness to replace suppliers when it spots a vulnerability or an advantage elsewhere. “Their reputation with suppliers is of being somewhat ruthless,” said Ramsay. “It looks like another consequence of Intel’s execution challenges.”(Updates with more details starting in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Apple-Made Computer Chips Coming to Mac, in Split From Intel"

2020-06-26,"Many tech stocks have won big during the novel coronavirus pandemic. But few can match the epic run of DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Since January, shares have soared from around $76 per share, to $167 per share today. And over the past twelve months, the stock has rallied nearly 216%.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com But now, with shares just a few dollars shy of their all-time highs, is there more left in the tank?Yes and no. From the bull's perspective, there's good reason why shares could head higher. As our own Louis Navellier recently put it, &quot;the new normal will be good news for DocuSign.&quot; Post-pandemic, employers now realize the many benefits of a fully remote workforce. This could help accelerate the &quot;work-from-home&quot; trend. Even as the outbreak enters the rearview mirror. That means a permanent pivot from pen-and-ink to electronic signatures.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the other hand, you can make a decent bear case for this stock as well.Mainly due to valuation. The recent run-up means shares are &quot;priced for perfection.&quot; But also, there's competitive risks to consider. Not only from those already in the electronic signature business, such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But, other big tech names as well could enter the scene.With this in mind, shares may cool off for now after their epic run. But, on a pullback, this newly-minted NASDAQ 100 (NASDAQ:QQQ) component could be a screaming buy. 3 Reasons Why DocuSign Stock Could Head HigherAt first glance, it looks as if most of this company's growth prospects are already priced into shares. Granted, the easy money has already been made with DOCU stock. Those who bought early, realizing how much of a boon the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; economy would be for the electronic signature giant, saw massive gains these past few months.  * 5 Housing Stocks to Buy Before the Housing Market Bounces Back Yet, for those looking at the stock today, there are many reasons why shares could head higher.Firstly, DocuSign's underlying business remains strong. For the quarter ending Apr 30, the company saw its sales jump 39% from the prior years' quarter. Next quarter should see as strong, or even stronger performance, given their coronavirus tailwind. But don't consider today's strong growth to fall back post-pandemic.Why? Corporate America's accelerated adoption of &quot;working-from-home.&quot; Remote working has been a viable alternative for years. But, many companies were cool on the idea. Mainly due to concerns about worker productivity. Yet, recent events have shown that remote worker productivity is as high, if not higher, than the traditional office environment.So, how does this benefit DocuSign? As business moves from in-person to remote, electronic signature demand will continue to soar. This will help the company meet or exceed its growth projections.Secondly, the market (for now) remains fully in love with tech stocks. Sure, this could mean we are in the midst of a bubble. But, as tech remains hot, stocks like this one should continue to perform well in the near-term.Thirdly, DocuSign was recently added to the NASDAQ 100 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Inclusion in tech's premier index could also help boost valuation.Yet, while all these factors work in the stock's favor, there are several risks to keep in mind before buying shares today. Why Shares Could Head Lower in The Near-TermAs with most high-flyers, valuation is a big concern with DocuSign stock. Shares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 348.2. By comparison, rival Adobe trades for 45.1 times forward earnings.Sure, there's a major difference in growth between the two companies. Analyst consensus calls for Adobe's earnings to grow 13.7% between this fiscal year and the next. By comparison, analysts estimate 75% earnings growth for DocuSign over its next fiscal year. With this in mind, a premium valuation is justified.Yet, is DocuSign's epic growth sustainable? High competition may limit how much they can scale up. As this commentator recently discussed, the company already competes with Adobe's Sign application. Also, as InvestorPlace's Larry Ramer wrote Jun 18, other big tech names could enter the market.Increased competition will make it very hard for the company to continue growing at such a rapid clip. And if said growth starts to slow, shares could fall significantly lower, as its premium valuation is no longer justified. Bottom Line: Wait for a Pullback With DocuSignThis stock's numerous catalysts are equally matched by a bevy of concerns. Between a rich valuation, and high competition, it's easy to see how shares could fall from today's prices.But that's not to say this is a name you should short. As tech stocks continue to outperform the overall market, it's too risky to go against the crowd.However, it may mean DocuSign stock is &quot;too hot to touch&quot; right now. Waiting for a pullback may be the best move.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

2020-07-09,"Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  stock fell 3.1% in Thursday premarket trading after the pharmacy retailer reported third-quarter earnings that missed expectations and reported a COVID-19-related sales impairment. Net loss totaled $1.71 billion, or $1.95 per share, after net income of $1.03 billion, or $1.13 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 83 cents fell short of the FactSet consensus for $1.19 per share. Sales of $34.63 billion were up slightly from $34.60 billion last year and ahead of the FactSet consensus for $34.30 billion. COVID-19 hurt Walgreens sales by $700 million to $750 million, which was almost entirely non-U.S. business. The most significant impact was in the U.K., where sales were down 85% in April and Walgreens took $2 billion in non-cash impairment charges. The results also reflect a 61-cent-to-65-cent per share operational impairment from the pandemic. The pharmacy business around the world was hurt by fewer doctor visits and hospital admissions. Prescriptions filled in the U.S. were down 1.3%, and U.S. retail same-store sales were up 1.9% due to increased demand for vitamins and personal protective equipment (PPE). &quot;Shopping patterns are evolving more rapidly than ever as consumers further embrace digital options, spurring us to accelerate our ongoing investments in digital transformation and neighborhood health destinations,&quot; said Chief Executive Stefano Pessina in a statement. Those efforts include the expansion of the clinic collaboration with VillageMD and partnerships with Microsoft Corp.  and Adobe Inc.  for omnichannel service. Under the terms of the expanded deal with VillageMD, Walgreens will open 500 to 700 clinics in more than 30 markets over the next five years. Walgreens will invest $1 billion in equity and convertible debt in VillageMD over the next three years, with Walgreens holding 30% ownership interest in the company when the investment is complete. Walgreens completed a $250 million equity investment on Wednesday. Walgreens will close 48 Boots Opticians and cut office support headcount by 20% in U.K., impacting 4,000 jobs, or about 7% of the company's workforce. Walgreens expects 2020 adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.75, including $1.03 to $1.14 impact from COVID-19. The company forecasts additional impact from the pandemic in the fourth quarter. Walgreens raised its dividend 2.2% to 46.75 cents per share on Wednesday, payable Sept. 11, 2020 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 19 2020.

(IBM) have formed a strategic partnership to help accelerate digital transformation and strengthen real-time data security for regulated industries such as banking and healthcare using hybrid cloud solutions.The partnership seeks to support companies in regulated industries such as banks in how to protect customer data, whilst they undergo digital transformations and are faced with data-driven marketing and the need to move core workloads to the cloud.As a result, organizations will be able to manage their content and assets within any hybrid cloud environment – from multiple public clouds to on-premise data centers. IBM will offer clients the flexibility to host, access and leverage data in an environment of their choice.&quot;Now more than ever companies are accelerating their efforts to engage customers digitally,&quot; said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president of Adobe Digital Experience. &quot;We are excited to partner with IBM to enable companies in regulated industries to meet this moment and use real-time customer data to securely deliver experiences across any digital touchpoint, at scale and compliant with regulations.&quot;Adobe joins as a strategic partner providing customer experience (CX) solutions for the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. Using IBM’s financial services public cloud, IBM will expand Adobe Experience Manager to professionals in regulated industries with the aim of helping them meet the highest security and regulatory requirements when delivering personalized experiences to their customers.As part of the partnership, IBM will begin using Adobe Experience Cloud and its enterprise applications for its own global marketing. Adobe Experience Cloud customers include the 10 largest U.S. financial institutions.IBM shares rose less than 1% to $126.86, while Adobe dropped 1.7% to $447.52 in afternoon U.S. trading.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill last month raised Adobe’s price target to $470 (5% upside potential) from $450 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares saying that digital media was the company’s “source of strength” in its recent Q2 results. He added that he remains confident in Adobe’s superior fundamentals and market leadership.The stock is up 36% year-to-date and has a Moderate Buy analyst consensus that breaks down into 16 Buy ratings versus 6 Hold ratings. The $434.45 average price target now implies 2.9% downside potential for the shares in the coming 12 months.

2020-07-22,"Adobe Inc. (ADBE) has announced that it is planning to build a universal camera app by bringing in Marc Levoy, the pioneer behind Google’s (GOOGL) smartphone camera software.Adobe hired the former researcher from Google to work on what the company calls an app that is “centered on the concept of a universal camera app.” Adobe currently offers a Photoshop camera app as well as a built-in camera for its Lightroom app. Adobe didn’t offer details on the new app's capabilities aside from its main developer.“Levoy will spearhead company-wide technology initiatives focused on computational photography and emerging products, centered on the concept of a universal camera app&quot; the company stated on June 21 in an email to Engadget.In 2014, Levoy joined Google at a time when smart developers sought to improve photos by incorporating more lenses and sensors into their devices. His work on Google’s Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 took photos using only one camera unit to dramatically improve and enhance an image. Levoy left Google in March. His other work with Adobe will include developing Adobe’s Sensei division to focus on artificial intelligence machine learning for creative work, marketing, and data analysis. Adobe’s creation of a dedicated camera app from a developer who revolutionized photography software is expected to also bring advancements to the company's smartphone video technology.Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner noted on June 15 that Adobe’s management has under-promised but over-delivered which has positioned the company at the center of the exploding market for digital video content and ad-creation. He reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target from $368 to $474 which implies 5% upside potential.Meanwhile Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on the shares stating that digital media was Adobe’s “source of strength” in the company's Q2 results. He added that he remains confident in Adobe’s superior fundamentals and market leadership. He maintains a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target from $450 to $470 (4% upside potential). Adobe is up 36% year-to-date with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus that breaks down into 16 Buy ratings versus 6 Hold ratings and no Sell ratings. The $434.45 average price target implies 3% downside potential for the shares in the coming 12 months.

2020-07-24,"Unomi is a developer of software to help animators. The focus is on reducing production time and the cost for content creation by anywhere from 30% to 70%. The company has also set up an equity crowdfunding campaign. To invest in Unomi, the minimum is $1,000.Source: Shutterstock The founder and CEO is Obi Onyejekwe. One of his prior ventures is Nito, which he sold to AOL. He has also provided marketing services to Fortune 500 companies and leading entertainment operators like Spike, BET and Nickelodeon.The team for Unomi also includes:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Arama Brown, the lead software engineer. She is a full-stack software engineer who has consulted with a myriad of businesses and startups. In 2015, her team placed in a hackathon for the International Women's Media Foundation.  * Llama D'Attore, who is also a full-stack developer. D'Attore has a strong background with 3D software tools. How It WorksThe animation and video game industry has certainly made considerable progress over the years. The graphics have gotten to the point where they are incredibly immersive and life-like.Yet despite this, the development of games remains highly labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It's similar to a feature film. But Unomi's vision is to attempt to disrupt the traditional model. Essentially, the technology is about bringing high levels of automation to the process -- without sacrificing the quality of the production.Unomi is a software-as-a-service platform, which means that the company charges a subscription for the technology and the system is based in the cloud. Of course, this approach is the standard in the software world and has propelled the growth of companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).At the core of Unomi is a voice recognition system, which can understand multiple languages. This is the interface for the creation process. The platform also has sophisticated motion capture functions (this helps to mimic human movements). The result is that an animator can quickly develop 2D and 3D animated characters.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever As for the product road map, the company is planning to release a variety of new capabilities. They include a 3D object plug-in for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) software that used augmented and virtual reality capabilities.The market opportunity is definitely large. The company estimated the global spending in the animation industry at $244 billion.And yes, there are also several niches Unomi can benefit from like:  * A $3 billion market for universities teaching video game marketing, animation and graphic design.  * A $10 billion market for YouTube animation content creators.  * And a $24 billion market for animation and ad agencies. Should You Invest in Unomi?So far, Unomi has raised only $1,000. But then again, there are 35 days left in the funding.Note that the crowdfunding round is at the seed stage and the valuation is at $5 million. The equity instrument is a Crowd Note, which functions like a typical convertible note. This means that you will not receive stock until a trigger event occurs like an acquisition or IPO.But this is not the only funding for the company. Note that -- during the past year -- Unomi has raised over $200,000 from two other convertible notes.But of course, given that this is an early stage company, investing in Unomi is very risky. Keep in mind that the competitive landscape is intense and there are numerous large companies in the space. They have enormous resources and talent to create next-generation technologies.Last year the company generated only $2,551 in revenues and had a net loss of $138,863. Also note that Unomi has not disclosed any customers. In fact, when compared to other crowdfunding deals, the investor profile is relatively sparse.Thus, when evaluating whether to invest or not, it is best to realize that it may take a long time to get to liquidity as the company will likely need to raise much more capital in the coming years.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast. He is also the founder of WebIPO, which was one of the first platforms for public offerings during the 1990s. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Investing through equity and real estate crowdfunding or asset tokenization requires a high degree of risk tolerance. Despite what individual companies may promise, there's always the chance of losing a portion, or the entirety, of your investment. These risks include: 1) Greater chance of failure  2) Risk of fraudulent activity  3) Lack of liquidity  4) Economic downturns  5) Dearth of investor education Read more: Private Investing Risks  More From InvestorPlace  * Why Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG   * America's 1 Stock Picker Reveals His Next 1,000% Winner   * Revolutionary Tech Behind 5G Rollout Is Being Pioneered By This 1 Company   * Radical New Battery Could Dismantle Oil Markets The post Invest in Unomi for Next-Generation Video Game Development appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Invest in Unomi for Next-Generation Video Game Development

2020-07-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Colleges are rolling out new technology for a mostly online semester that begins next month, but these efforts are unlikely to impress students paying tens of thousands of dollars for in-person instruction.The University of Michigan will provide stronger Wi-Fi and new cloud storage accounts to help students learn on campus while maintaining social distance. The University of Southern California plans virtual 3-D labs for some science courses, while the University of California at Berkeley is giving laptops, webcams and headphones to thousands of students in need.As the Covid-19 pandemic rages across the U.S., many schools are making permanent plans to conduct classes virtually this fall. Administrators heeded complaints about lockdown learning during the previous semester and are tapping technology to try to improve the experience. Students doubt e-learning will pass what is shaping up to be the industry’s toughest test yet.“Online classes kinda suck and there’s no technology that can fix that,” said Annie Tsan, a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.Without technological updates that make the online classroom more accessible and enjoyable, there’s no guarantee students will stay at their institutions. Some are considering a gap semester or two, withholding tuition payments or transferring. This risks another blow to a higher eduction sector that was already struggling financially before the pandemic.“70% of our revenue comes from tuition, room and board,” said Zach Messitte, president of Ripon College in Wisconsin. “If 30% of our students decide not to come back, that’s just an enormous revenue hit. This will impact the revenue of schools across the country.”The University of Michigan’s new Wi-Fi shows the potential and the pitfalls of this technology push by colleges. There will be more bandwidth and the Wi-Fi signal will be extended through additional routers, so even without in-person classes, Michigan hopes students will come to the campus. One proposal even encourages students to park at the college and turn their cars into makeshift study halls.“I don’t think it’s going to be as impactful as they think,” said Nicholas Silk, a senior at Michigan. “Most people who live on or off campus already have Wi-Fi in their residences. Plus, I don’t even have a car. I won’t be sitting outside of a building just to use campus Wi-Fi.”Read more: “Pandemic Pods” Frenzy Reveals Failures of Education TechMichigan is also partnering with Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Canvas, a learning-management system from Instructure Inc., to enable automated transcription during video conferencing classes. This will help students follow lectures more easily in real time and let them refer back to material after the class ends. Students will also have access to cloud storage from Dropbox Inc. and Adobe Inc.’s Creative Cloud software for video and sound editing.The University of Southern California in Los Angeles is teaming up with startup Labster ApS to provide virtual-reality science labs for students. The labs will function similarly to flight simulators, but be accessible remotely via laptop. Students can use Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR headsets to access the labs, though this device is not required. Labster’s 3-D labs focus on biology and cover dissections, medical diagnostic procedures, field sampling and other processes. Chemistry students will use VR software from startup Beyond Labz.Since the pandemic began, Labster said it has partnered with dozens of colleges, including George Washington University, Fordham University and San Jose State University. Schools are also using technology to keep less wealthy students connected. The University of California at Berkeley set aside more than $4 million to provide about 3,300 laptops, 800 Wi-Fi hotspots, webcams and headphones in August to those who qualify for a new Student Technology Equity Program.The University of California at Irvine has sent almost 300 students laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots. Almost 40% of those who attend the college qualify for Federal Pell grants that are given to low-income candidates. Tom Andriola, chief information officer for the University of California System, hopes the effort brings “equity in terms of the ability to access the internet and to watch a live stream lecture, or be able to access systems.”However, schools are often chosen based on physical resources, such as residence halls, research labs and media-production studios. For students counting on these assets, faster Wi-Fi, a free laptop and virtual reality may not be enough. Although some universities, like Princeton, have provided tuition discounts, many schools still expect students to pay the full amount. Some schools, like USC, even announced tuition increases before they released plans to go online.A number of students are still deciding if it is worth it to attend classes at all this fall. “If I do not have access to the resources that make USC, USC, there is no reason as to why I should be paying full price to essentially now attend school in my living room,” said Casey Gardner, a senior studying theater at the school.(Updates to add more colleges working with Labster in 11th paragraph.

2020-08-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It looks as if the long-awaited Apple Inc. subscription bundles are finally going to happen. But while it is a solid step in the right direction, the smartphone giant needs to do far more to change the game.Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Apple is preparing to launch several bundles, internally named “Apple One,” as soon as October. There will be multiple tiers — including a low-end package with Apple Music and Apple TV+, along with higher-end offerings that incorporate its Apple Arcade gaming service, Apple News+ and more iCloud storage. Further, the company is developing a new virtual fitness-class subscription that will compete with offerings from Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.Wall Street has been clamoring for years for Apple to do more on subscription bundles, citing the success of Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime service. Although these bundles seem like a decent start at first blush, they are too incremental and tentative. The problem is, with the exception of Apple Music, none of these other subscriptions have gained much traction with the general public. So the bundles are essentially just a price reduction for Apple’s current array of mixed and generally underperforming products. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that they will work with Apple’s Family Sharing system and could save customers $2 to $5 a month in the aggregate compared with current pricing.So, what should Apple do instead? The company needs to be much bolder. At a bare minimum, Apple should combine its hardware and software products into a larger monthly subscription. Already, Apple has its iPhone Upgrade Program, which enables annual smartphone upgrades and includes the AppleCare+ service. Combining this offering with the new subscription bundles is a no-brainer.In addition, Apple needs to follow the lead of its two other giant tech competitors. For example, Amazon’s Prime offers dozens of disparate features and consumer benefits from fast shipping, music, books and video to exclusive deals and discounts. And Microsoft Inc. has added similar deals in its latest 365 subscription plans, which now include additional free promotions worth hundreds of dollars from outside software and app makers like Adobe Inc. There is no reason Apple can’t do similar things.Frankly, it’s befuddling that Apple hasn’t taken advantage of its biggest asset — an avid, passionate base of more than a billion active customers. The tech giant should expand aggressively into financial services, commerce and retail, either by creating its own services or partnering with other companies. With the power of its huge scale, it shouldn’t be difficult to add a larger array of discounts and promotions, too.And nothing would engender more loyalty than creating a truly “must-have” comprehensive subscription for hardware, software and everyday lifestyle services. An offering that provides amazing value would be great for Apple’s customers and the company’s business.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-08-14,"I'll admit it. As far as stocks go, Wayfair (NYSE:W) is not one of my favorites. DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), on the other hand, has the makings of a 10-bagger. That's why I recently included DocuSign stock amongst a group of 7 Hot Stocks to Stay Hot for Years to Come.    Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com As an interesting aside, I also included Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) and Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) on this list; They just announced an $18.5 billion marriage. But I digress. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWayfair's stock is up 242.1% year to date through Aug. 11. When I suggested investors take profits in late May, it was only trading around $154, so if you listened to my advice, you missed out on $150 in further gains. My bad.  In my defense, I did suggest that I would be far more amenable to the stock if it were to make a profit. Well, it did just that in the second quarter, generating a GAAP profit (yes, you read that right) of $273.9 million on $2 billion in net revenue.If I thought that Wayfair's remarkable quarter was the result of incredible business execution or a spectacular product offering, I might be persuaded to consider its stock for the long haul. Alas, the novel coronavirus has made Wayfair's management look like geniuses. It won't last. The only way I see this being permanent is if the new customers it gained during Covid-19 return for more once a vaccine has inoculated the entire country and brick-and-mortar retail returns to something closer to normal.I see the customers DocuSign's gained during Covid-19 as being far more &quot;sticky&quot; than Wayfair's. Here's why. What's DocuSign Gained?As I stated in my July article about hot stocks that will stay hot, I pointed out that DocuSign is building a business that will be vital to the success of companies working from home.   * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List &quot;The company announced in the first quarter that it had almost 661,000 paying customers for products such as its eSignature digital signature and many others. As more companies move to a permanent work-from-home workforce, Docusign's going to be a significant beneficiary of that transformation,&quot; I wrote on Jul. 9. Not only do products such as eSignature make things easier for businesses to do business virtually, but the company is building a modern-day equivalent of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).I get venture capitalist Fred Wilson's daily blog post in my email every day. I like his stuff because he keeps the number of words to a minimum and, more importantly, on the subject. He's a must-read. Anyway, in his Aug. 12 message, he discusses his frustration with subscription agreements, lamenting the fact that despite all the technological advances in the past six-and-a-half years, he still has to fill them out. &quot;One great thing has happened on this issue in those six and a half years. Many/most subscription agreements are now sent digitally via DocuSign or Adobe,&quot; Wilson writes. &quot;That's great. It is certainly a bit easier to complete them online and once you have done that, there is no need to scan and email.&quot;During Covid-19, businesses and business people have found ways to keep transacting business while working virtually from home or wherever they've chosen to hang their hats. Companies like DocuSign are providing the tools to make this a permanent situation. More importantly, any time you have a business that makes or saves people time and money, you've got a winning formula. Wayfair, on the other hand, is just another online retailer. It doesn't sell anything particularly unique. It's certainly not going to make you any money unless, of course, you bought its stock, but it does have those kitschy Kelly Clarkson ads.  In 10 years, I would be shocked if Wayfair is making more money than DocuSign.  The Bottom Line on DocuSign StockI've written for InvestorPlace going on nine years. In all that time, I've only written about DocuSign stock on two occasions. Both were in the past two months, both because of the company's contribution to a post-Covid society. As I said in June, DocuSign is an innovative stock to buy in the new normal. Wayfair, not so much. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-08-17,"(Bloomberg) -- To many college students, the prospect of a year of school during a pandemic—with virtual classes, restricted movements and no parties—is a huge bummer. Some Silicon Valley startups, hungry for young talent, see it as an opportunity.Over the past few months, several companies have presented an alternative to school: a remote internship, aimed specifically at young people looking for alternatives to a dismal school year.Dozens of Silicon Valley startups are looking to hire fall interns, according to a list assembled by startup accelerator Y Combinator. This month, venture firm Neo organized a virtual career fair for 120 students and a range of startups, hoping to match pairs for internships during the upcoming academic year. And venture firm Contrary Capital is offering to invest $100,000 in five teams of entrepreneurs if they take a gap year from school to build a company. Such arrangements allow interns to get paid and learn on the job, while avoiding paying tens of thousands of dollars for Zoom University. It also means that companies willing to improvise on hiring and gamble on younger workers may get new access to fresh talent. Ali Partovi, Neo’s chief executive officer, said the firm surveyed 120 students who are part of its mentorship programs and found that 46% of them are interested in taking a gap semester and 21% are interested in taking a gap year.“There's a potential for a big shift right now,” said Alexandr Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Scale AI Inc., a startup that helps people train computer vision. He said Scale would hire up to 10 gap-year workers if they found the right people. For many students he talks to, school this year seems like a “sub-optimal” option, Wang said.Companies have varying approaches to what gap year hiring would look like. Food-delivery service Postmates Inc. said it’s considering extending the tenure of the summer interns in its robot-delivery team to allow for those who want to take time off school. And Lumos, a six-person web security startup, is offering around $80,000 to four full-time “fellows” to work on different projects during the academic year. Students, meanwhile, are trying to make sense of a dizzying array of choices, as on-campus options lose their appeal. “Everyone is uncertain,” said Evani Radiya-Dixit, a rising senior at Stanford University who is considering taking a gap year, and who recently interned at X, Alphabet Inc.'s research and development lab. Stanford made it even more confusing last week, when it abruptly announced that it was ending most on-campus housing for students for the fall quarter. “I’ve heard people say Stanford is going to be like a prison,” said Victor Cardenas, a Stanford sophomore and computer science major, now debating taking time off to build a company. “You're only allowed to be in your dorm, and someone not in your dorm can't be there. You have to eat 6 feet away from everyone.”Startups are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on Covid-19 campus jitters. Bigger companies often don't want to take on the legal hassles of bringing on students beyond regimented internship programs, said Scale’s Wang, who is 23 and has been working in tech since he dropped out of college.“A lot of students are thinking about it, and hopefully a lot of companies are willing to take a risk on these students,” Wang said. “If you'd hire them a year from now, you should be willing to hire them now.”Nimbler startups willing to experiment could gain access to star students who might otherwise have wound up in summer jobs at giants like Facebook Inc., Alphabet or Apple Inc., managers say. “Usually you would fight to get on the radar with people, and here people are reaching out,” said Emmanuel Straschnov, the co-CEO of Bubble, an app design service. Compared with regular recruiting, he said, “It’s like night and day.” The ultimate payoff isn’t just the student labor. “With recruiting you always play the long game,” said Nick Schrock, CEO of Elementl, a developer tools startup that’s planning to hire three gap-year workers this fall. “A great intern who has a great network can often yield compounded returns later down the line.”Students are assessing the trade-offs critically, and trying to decide if what they’re getting from schools is worth the cost, especially if classes happen virtually. Levi Villarreal, who will be a senior at University of Texas at Austin, pays his own tuition. Luckily as a Texas native it’s relatively inexpensive, but he’s still weighing his options. Villarreal has previously interned at Adobe Inc. and Google, and had been looking forward to living in New York City for his internship this summer. Instead, he worked remotely from an apartment in Austin and his parents’ house in Dallas. He’s open to the idea that his disrupted school year could lead to something new and interesting, but he also wishes things weren’t so upside-down.“I really want to have one normal year in college before I leave,” Villarreal said. “That's my hope.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Startups Tap a New Talent Pool: Pandemic-Weary College Students

2020-08-17,"Adobe and DocuSign are two companies enjoying significant gains from the accelerated adoption of technology due to the coronavirus pandemic. Work-from-home and contactless business operations have driven the demand for cloud-based services.According to a Fortune Business Insights study, the global e-signature market alone will reach $6.13 billion by 2026, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 28.77% in the 2019-2026 period.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will compare these two cloud companies to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe’s transformation into a SaaS or software-as-a-service company has facilitated its growth over the past few years. The company expanded beyond its creative software tools through other digital offerings like Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud. Adobe Document Cloud includes PDF and e-signature solutions while Adobe Experience Cloud provides products related to online marketing and analytics.Adobe’s revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended May 29) increased 14% Y/Y to $3.13 billion. Thanks to accelerated digital transformation amid the pandemic, the requirement for document signing, editing, and the company’s other cloud products spiked significantly. The company's adjusted EPS was up 34% Y/Y to $2.45.Notably, remote working drove a sequential rise of 40% in the company’s web-based PDF services and a 175% rise in the use of Adobe Sign since the start of the fiscal year. Also, mobile usage of the company’s offerings jumped with Acrobat Reader installations rising 43% Y/Y in the first quarter while Adobe Scan installations increased 66% Y/Y. (See Adobe stock analysis on TipRanks)On August 12, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated a Buy rating for Adobe stock with a price target of $430. In a research note, he explained “We view Adobe as a core investment holding and believe long-term software investors will be rewarded over the coming years as the company remains an underpriced earnings and free cash flow story.”Overall, Wall Street has a bullish call on Adobe with a Strong Buy consensus based on 16 Buys versus 5 Holds and no Sell ratings. Adobe stock has risen about 36% so far in 2020, and as a result, the average price target of $437.84 signifies a 2.2% downside over the next 12 months.DocuSign (DOCU)DocuSign is widely known for its e-signature solution. However, its cloud software suite includes several other processes that automate the entire agreement process. DocuSign has the first-mover advantage with an impressive market share of 69.04% (as per a Datanyze report) in the e-signature space. Rivals RightSignature, SignNow and Adobe Sign have a market share of 6.28%, 5.77%, and 5.28%, respectively.The COVID-19 led demand for DocuSign’s business reflected in a 39% rise in its fiscal 2021 first quarter (which ended April 30) revenue of $297 million. Despite strong sales, the company posted loss per share of $0.26. However, the company’s EPS was $0.12 excluding one-time items.The company expects the strong trend in its business to continue as its Agreement Cloud and DocuSign CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) applications will help in capturing growth beyond digital signatures. DocuSign added over 10,000 net new direct customers and 58,000 self-service customers in the fiscal first quarter, bringing the total paying customers to 661,000.Most notably, DocuSign has tremendous opportunity in international markets, which currently account for only 18% of the revenue. It is now making strategic acquisitions to expand its product offerings. In July, DocuSign acquired Austin-based Liveoak Technologies to leverage the start-up’s technology for accelerating the introduction of its DocuSign Notary product.In May, the company completed the acquisition of Seal Software—a provider of contract analytics and artificial intelligence technology. DocuSign believes that Seal’s AI expertise will bolster its offerings.Last month, five-star analyst Patrick Walravens raised his price target for DocuSign stock to $233 from $150 while reiterated his Buy rating. The JMP Securities analyst stated that “The core eSignature business remains an underpenetrated, high-growth business opportunity, where DocuSign has a dominant competitive position.”Walravens believes that the company has major opportunities in federal, mortgages and notary services. (See DocuSign stock analysis on TipRanks)DocuSign stock has risen about 169% year-to-date. It has a consensus analyst rating of Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 5 Holds and no Sell recommendations. The average price target of $186.17 implies a downside of 6.8% over the next year.Adobe and DocuSign are poised for long-term growth as the convenience of their services might continue to attract customers even when the pandemic abates. However, DocuSign has not yet turned profitable due to its growth investments. Moreover, growth prospects look fully priced in the company’s stock.Adobe appears to be the more favorable choice based on its diverse businesses and the analyst consensus rating.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-21,"Blue-chip stocks are often regarded as some of the best stocks to buy on Wall Street. Why?Because the companies behind the blue chips are supposed to be the cream-of-the-crop. Large-cap titans of industry, with long histories of growth, strong management teams, rock-solid balance sheets, robust future growth prospects and tons of visibility to long-term gains in revenues, profits and the stock price.In other words, these are the stocks that you want to buy today, and hold for the next 5 to 10 years, because strong fundamentals will power these stocks materially higher in the long run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever With that in mind, here are my 20 favorite blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s:  * Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  * Clorox (NYSE:CLX)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL)  * Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU)  * PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  * Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)  * AT&T (NYSE:T)  * Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  * Target (NYSE:TGT)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Facebook (FB)Source: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com One of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term is Facebook, and the bull thesis on the social media giant is shockingly simple.Through its ecosystem of four digital media apps with endless functionality, Facebook has created the world's largest and stickiest digital ecosystem, without competition. Engagement in that ecosystem will only increase over time. As it does, more and more ad dollars -- which are already pivoting from the offline to the online channel -- will make their way into the Facebook ad machine.Plus, the company has a huge opportunity in front of it to turn all that digital engagement into digital shopping, and create a world-class e-commerce platform with unparalleled reach.To that end, Facebook projects as a solid 20%-plus revenue and profit grower over the next few years -- and that's easily big enough growth to sustain a big uptrend in FB stock. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com A more classic blue-chip stock to buy for the long term is Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company. More importantly, though, the company has found a winning strategy which ensures that it will remain the world's largest beverage company for the foreseeable future.That strategy includes leaning into data-driven market analysis to identify up-and-coming beverage brands, taking small stakes in those up-and-coming brands, pushing them through Coca-Cola's vast distribution network, seeing which ones succeed in that distribution network and then subsequently wholly acquiring the brands that do succeed and fully integrating them into the Coca-Cola product portfolio.It's a win-win strategy which will forever ensure that Coca-Cola has the strongest and most relevant brands in its beverage portfolio, thereby sustaining solid revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.  * 10 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul That solid growth will power equally solid gains in KO stock. Blue-Chip Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Another classic blue-chip stock to buy for the long term is Apple.The world's largest technology company with a $2 trillion market cap, Apple isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The company's hardware business is flourishing, as the iPhone's global ubiquity is being protected by &quot;good enough&quot; hardware advancements, Mac and iPad sales should boom in an hybrid work environment and Apple Watch sales should keep surging as 5G unlocks a new era of advanced IoT communication.Meanwhile, Apple is rapidly expanding its software ecosystem, too, building out things like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, so on and so forth. These services will see continued robust uptake for the foreseeable future as consumer engagement shifts to the digital -- and specifically mobile -- channel.The convergence of growth in both its hardware and software businesses will help power big revenue and profit gains at Apple over the next few years. Those big gains will keep the current uptrend in AAPL stock alive for a lot longer. Nike (NKE)Source: pixfly / Shutterstock.com In the apparel world, the best blue-chip stock to buy for the the long term is Nike.The whole world is pivoting towards broader adoption of athletic apparel in situations outside of just working out, mostly because consumers are opting for comfort over fashion, and athletic shorts, leggings and tank tops represent some of the comfiest clothes out there. This trend won't reverse course anytime soon. Athletic apparel will remain the &quot;in&quot; style for many years to come.Nike is at the top dog in the industry. Without much competition. The company has leaned into its relentless product innovation, star-studded portfolio of athlete endorsements and purpose-driven marketing to continually elevate brand equity and consumer demand. This trend won't reverse course anytime soon, either. Nike will remain the king of athletic apparel for many years to come.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week It doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect those dots. Nike projects as the best-in-breed apparel retail company for a lot longer, a reality which means NKE stock is sold stock to buy for the next 5 to 10 years. Blue-Chip Stocks: Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Adobe is a great blue-chip stock to buy for three very simple reasons.One, the company dominates in the visual media solutions space -- a space which, thanks to the fact that the world increasingly communicates in pictures and videos, is underpinned by secular growth drivers. Adobe's solutions in this space will maintain robust demand over the next few years.Two, the company also dominates in enterprise virtualization solutions, helping companies on their paper-to-digital transformations. As the world increasingly pivots into a hybrid work environment, this transformation will accelerate, and demand for Adobe's digital document solutions will increase.Three, Adobe is making aggressive and impressive moves in the enterprise cloud world, where the company is leveraging its visual media expertise to develop visually-driven cloud marketing solutions for enterprises. This business has huge long-term potential.All in all, then, Adobe will continue to grow revenues and profits at a solid double-digit pace over the next 5+ years, a stretch during which ADBE stock should just keep running higher. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Peteri / Shutterstock.com When it comes to blue-chip technology stocks, Microsoft is about as good as it gets.The company has long been a global technology powerhouse. It has maintained this strong standing because the company continues to innovate and create relevant offerings in the tech world.The most recent innovation, of course, is in cloud, where Microsoft has developed a series of cloud-hosted infrastructure, productivity and collaboration tools which help facilitate hybrid work environments.Demand for these tools will remain robust for the next several years.  * 5 SPAC Stocks With Recently Agreed On Merger Deals to Watch As it does, MSFT stock will keep pushing higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com In the food space, the best blue-chip stock to buy is McDonald's.McDonald's dominates on the two things that matter most in the fast casual restaurant space: price and convenience.McDonald's consistently innovates to reduce labor costs and food costs so as to offer the lowest prices in the market on burgers, fries and shakes. At the same time, the company has the largest fast food footprint in the world, with a McDonald's seemingly on every corner of every city in the world. On top of that, technological improvements -- like automated ordering kiosks and streamlined digital ordering -- only enhance McDonald's convenience.So long as McDonald's continues to dominate on the price and convenience fronts, MCD stock will stay on a long-term uptrend. Intel (INTC)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The stock has been beaten and bruised over the past few months thanks to product delays, but semiconductor giant Intel remains one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s.The bull thesis is simple. Intel may be fumbling right now. But this is the 400 pound gorilla in the global CPU market, which has a long track record of operational excellence, and enough resources and talent to get the company back on track over the next few years.Once Intel does get back on track in terms of speed-to-market, there's a lot to like, mostly because the global CPU market will see significant demand growth in the 2020s thanks to the widespread proliferation of 5G, AI, IoT, cloud, AR/VR, self-driving, etc.  * 3 Terrible Investments That Are Better Than Hertz Stock With all that in mind, Intel stock is a great buy for the next decade. Blue-Chip Stocks: Clorox (CLX)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are entering a &quot;new normal&quot;, and because of that, Clorox stock is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s.I'm not all that pessimistic about the implications of the pandemic over the next several years. I don't think mask-wearing and social distancing will become the norm for years. Instead, I think the world will return to mostly normal over the next few years.But one thing that will permanently change is consumer awareness of hygiene and cleanliness. Individuals and businesses alike are going to use more hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, Lysol spray, etc.Who makes all those products? Clorox.As such, in the &quot;new normal&quot;, demand for Clorox cleaning materials will remain vigorous. This sustained vigorous demand will guide CLX stock higher over the next several years. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Ioan Panaite / Shutterstock.com Of course, this list of blue-chip stocks to buy would be incomplete without Amazon.The e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut with burgeoning digital ad, video game streaming and offline retail businesses is, without question, one of the best stocks to buy for the next 5 to 10 years.That's because everywhere consumers and businesses are pivoting, Amazon is already there, with a best-in-market offering.The company owns the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces. They also own the video game streaming market, and have a huge digital ad business. Plus, there's a ton of potential for Amazon to pioneer an era of next-gen, automated offline retail, and make a big splash in self-driving logistics with its recent acquisition of Zoox.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy That Can Shrug Off the Growing Volatility All in all, it's quite clear that Amazon will remain a big growth company for a lot longer -- and that AMZN stock will remain a big winner for a lot longer, too. Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com Next to Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, Alphabet is yet another solid blue-chip tech stock to buy for the 2020s.The bull thesis here really starts with the fact that Google Search is the ubiquitous backbone of the internet everywhere except China. That is, without search, the internet doesn't work. And Google Search owns more than 90% of the internet search market.This ubiquity puts Alphabet at the epicenter of the secular shift in ad dollars from offline to online, which in it of itself, will support solid growth at Alphabet over the next decade.But Alphabet's bull thesis doesn't end with Google Search.There's YouTube, a hyper-growth visual media platform that's also unrivaled in terms of size in that space. There's Google Cloud, the third largest cloud computing business in the world. And, of course, there's Waymo -- the company's self-driving unit that is widely considered the number one autonomous driving business in the world.Between all those growth levers, Alphabet -- and GOOG stock -- will remain big winners for the foreseeable future. Lululemon (LULU)Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com Athletic apparel is the hottest trend in the retail world today -- and will remain so for the foreseeable future.While Nike is the best blue-chip stock to buy in this space, Lululemon is a very close runner-up.What Lululemon lacks in size and age relative to Nike, it makes up for in growth and trendiness. The company has been consistently growing sales at a very healthy 10%-plus pace for several years, while the brand has rose to top-of-mind for young consumers. Some of this success is because of the company's high-quality clothes, while some is due to Lululemon's continued innovation in its product pipeline to extend well beyond its legacy leggings.All of these trends will remain in place for the next few years.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever As they do, Lululemon will continue to grow sales at a 10%-plus pace, and LULU stock will keep powering higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: PayPal (PYPL)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Cash is quickly becoming antiquated thanks to the consumer pivot towards e-commerce, and as a result, PayPal stock is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy today.Of course, when buying things online, you can't use cash. So consumers are rapidly adopting alternative payment methods for the digital channel. PayPal is the largest of those alternative digital payment methods.On that basis alone, PayPal should grow at a healthy pace over the next several years as consumers continue to pivot towards digital shopping.But PayPal also owns Venmo -- the world's hottest mobile payment platform -- which will continue to grow rapidly over the next several years as the mobile payments space expands globally.Venmo plus PayPal equals huge growth.And huge growth will keep PYPL stock on a winning streak. Alibaba (BABA)Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com Moving across the Pacific Ocean, Alibaba is the best blue-chip Chinese stock to buy for the 2020s.China's digital economy is booming. You have the largest country in the planet in terms of people. That country is rapidly digitizing and urbanizing. Incomes are rising. The middle class is expanding.Alibaba is at the epicenter of all of that.With the country's biggest e-commerce platform, biggest cloud computing business and various other hyper-growth digital businesses.That's a recipe for long-term success.  * The 10 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold Into 2021 Over the next several years, as China's digital economy booms, Alibaba will boom, too, and BABA stock will continue to track higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Maybe the most &quot;boring&quot; stock on this list of blue-chip stocks to buy is telecommunications giant AT&T.But don't let AT&T's boring-ness fool you.This is a top quality blue-chip stock, supported by a long track record of dominance in the telecom space, and enduring demand for wireless, internet and TV connectivity services.5G will be a huge catalyst for this stock, as it will increase demand for those connectivity services and likely lead to higher prices and better margins for AT&T. Plus, this telecom company is now basically a media company with the acquisition of Time Warner. Using media assets acquired in that deal, AT&T recently launched HBO Max -- the company's version of Netflix.All together, then, AT&T may not grow as quickly as the other companies on this list. But demand is stable, and the growth outlook is good enough that this really cheap stock should perform strongly over the next few years. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com One of the most defining megatrends of the 2020s will be the widespread proliferation and global normalization of 5G.The best blue-chip stock to buy to play this megatrend is Qualcomm.Qualcomm makes the chips which power smartphones, and the company has created what is essentially a monopoly in the smartphone chips market. This monopoly has been pressured by smartphone makers like Apple and Huawei trying to make their own chips in recent.Both companies were unsuccessful. Both are now long-term Qualcomm customers… again.To that end, it's clear to see that Qualcomm is really unrivaled when it comes to making smartphone chips, at a time when smartphone demand will roar high thanks to 5G making these phones faster and better than ever before.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy As the Industry Continues to Grow Thus, over the next few years, Qualcomm's revenues and profits will charger higher on the back of 5G tailwinds. So will QCOM stock. Blue-Chip Stocks: Netflix (NFLX)Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com Netflix is on its way to reaching global internet household ubiquity, and accordingly, NFLX stock is a great blue-chip stock to buy for the next 5 to 10 years.The idea here is simple.Netflix created the streaming TV category. Now, thanks to price and convenience advantages, streaming TV is replacing linear TV as the preferred media consumption channel. By the end of the decade, every internet household in the world will subscribe to some streaming TV service.Netflix will undoubtedly be one of the streaming TV services which every household in the world does subscribe to.Sure. There's lot of competition in this space. But Netflix has first-mover advantage, which has given the company more resources and more data to make better original content than anyone else in the streaming space.Better content attracts more subs.

The company has revamped physical stores and integrated them with a bunch of technology so that the in-store shopping experience is much better than before. The company has also created a robust e-commerce platform backed by a widespread logistics network, and developed a myriad of omni-channel capabilities (like buy online, pick-up-in-store) to marry the physical with the digital.In other words, Target has established a solid foundation to be a strong retailer for many years to come.

2020-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic, for all its human and economic tragedy, has spurred a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the technology industry, seized most visibly by the sector’s giants such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., and productivity players like Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc.A lesser-known beneficiary is Okta Inc., a decade-old cloud computing company based in San Francisco. Its software gives corporate customers a kind of border control for the internet, helping them authenticate the identity of their employees and customers as they connect remotely to a sprawling system of online applications.The Covid-19 outbreak, which has cast most workers out from behind their corporate firewalls and into their home offices, has helped to further popularize Okta’s software. It allows companies to seamlessly manage their employees’ use of the internet and to protect the corporate data on their devices.The stock has more than doubled since March, when lockdowns began, and has surged more than 10-fold since its initial public offering in 2017. The software maker has become an integral part of our new daily life, with its technology used by organizations as varied as Major League Baseball, Adobe Inc., FedEx Corp. and Seton Hall University. The boom has some investors betting that Okta and similar companies will accelerate their revenue through the crisis, even as it raises questions for executives about their good fortune at a time of suffering and massive job losses in the nation at large.“It can be mentally and psychologically confusing for me to both read the news and then see customers asking for our service,” said Frederic Kerrest, Okta’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “Because the world is not in a good place, but, you know, we seem to be able to provide some solutions that people really need, which is great.”From March through July, Okta’s main product, called Identity Cloud, was used almost 16 billion times to access an app or website. The multi-factor authentication service saw usage nearly triple in the period compared with a year earlier, and it hit a single-day peak of 145 million unique logins, the company said.Wall Street has bought into the story. The stock has soared 106% since March 12 when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed travel restrictions on Europeans. Now Okta must live up to the lofty expectations that come with a company valued at $27 billion. The shares slipped late Thursday after quarterly results reminded Wall Street that the company may not be able to accelerate sales growth forever.“We’re still being prudent about the rest of the year and the macroeconomic consequences ahead of us,” Chief Executive Officer Todd McKinnon said in an interview. “Headwinds to the business will be a little stronger in the second half.”The company has also lost money for most of its existence. However, investors are often willing to look far into the future when assessing cloud-based subscription businesses such as Okta. These companies spend heavily on sales and marketing to win as many customers as quickly as possible. Once the user base is large enough, distributing extra versions of the software online costs very little, and a highly profitable business can emerge -- one example being Salesforce.com Inc.Okta must lure as many paying customers as it can during this rare work-from-home boom, and then keep hold of them as the world slowly returns to some semblance of normalcy. Its work with FedEx suggests that this is possible.The logistics giant first partnered with Okta about a year ago, and now has more than 85,000 workers using the software maker’s service to access the FedEx virtual private network. Warehouse employees were given additional iPads to access apps with Okta, so they didn’t have to share devices and could maintain social-distancing rules, said Gene Sun, FedEx’s chief information security officer. Many of the company’s customer-service workers have Okta on their phones for the first time in order to securely pull up customer information while working remotely.Sun said the company greatly reduced its legacy sign-on system the week of March 16 in favor of Okta.“Okta really has enabled us to prepare the workforce to work from home in the March timeframe in a really smooth manner,” he said. “The thing about the backdrop of this pandemic is we have come to a conclusion that we should try to be moving aggressively toward using cloud services providers,” whose subscription payment plans help FedEx manage user prices.Like companies with workers at home, educational institutions have needed to figure out how to teach pupils remotely. Seton Hall University, a private Catholic school in South Orange, New Jersey, had a leg up because students and faculty had been using Okta since 2013. The college went from offering a few hundred online courses in the spring semester to providing more than 2,000 virtual classes in a few days, through Blackboard, which students access via Okta. The university also has an online portal named for its mascot, PirateNet, that is the information hub for its community, used for everything from paying tuition bills to registering for classes.“Really behind the scenes PirateNet is hundreds of apps inside Okta,” said Paul Fisher, an associate chief information officer of Seton Hall.When the coronavirus began to spread in March, Okta was among the first U.S. companies to publicly grapple with how to work around the pandemic. The company was scheduled to host a splashy San Francisco conference for customers, partners and analysts -- a software-industry ritual to strengthen future sales and telegraph the company’s strategic direction.McKinnon, the CEO, had to decide whether to cancel the event, delay until some unknown date or take it online. He opted for a remote conference, appearing from his home, and filmed a sketch in which he said his family promised not to interrupt him. His son walked into the frame anyway.The playful tone was a professional departure for McKinnon, a 6-foot-2-inch tall bodybuilder and a former CrossFit athlete. Pat Grady, a venture capitalist at Sequoia who invested in Okta and remains on its board, said that in an industry full of CEOs who use lofty language to explain how their apps are changing the world, McKinnon presents his company’s mission in a just-the-facts way that has gained him credibility, and a little criticism.Okta’s successful navigation of the pandemic has paid off for its co-founder. During these last five months, McKinnon, 48, has become a billionaire on paper. Bloomberg estimates his net worth has climbed to about $1.7 billion from about $900 million at the start of the year. Through a spokesman, McKinnon declined to verify his net worth.In 2016, McKinnon said Okta would give 1% of its equity to nonprofit organizations in its community. In the aftermath of the May killing of George Floyd, McKinnon and Kerrest pledged more than $1 million each for racial justice issues and said they will match employee contributions to civil-rights organizations. McKinnon and his wife also said they would provide $500,000 for Covid-19 relief efforts.Despite persistent rumors Okta may sell itself to a larger tech company, McKinnon’s long-term plan is to grow the business he co-founded into one of the world’s largest software makers. He says big challenges motivate him to work harder. Years from now, after the Covid-19 virus has been defeated, he expects his slice of the software market will only grow more essential.“We’re technology believers,” McKinnon said. “We think it’s not perfect. We think that there’s a lot of work we can do to make it better, easier to use more secure, more helpful for users. But that’s what’s exciting about we’re trying to do. It’s an almost boundless thing.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Remote-Work Boom Mints Another Internet Billionaire
2020-08-28,"The software world has rapidly embraced 'SaaS', or &quot;software-as-a-service.&quot; Also known as a 'cloud' offering, the SaaS model underpins the case for almost all of the software stocks to buy at the moment.Indeed, some of the biggest software stocks in the world have transitioned from &quot;on-premise&quot; models to the cloud. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest, and perhaps best, example. Others haven't done as well, with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) among the names threatened by cloud rivals while trying to transform their own businesses.The appeal of the SaaS model is obvious. Gross margins are enormous, often over 80%. Revenue recurs, as opposed to the one-time (if larger) sales booked under the past model.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to RunAnd once a customer is acquired, it's difficult for that customer to exit. Indeed, conventional wisdom suggests that SaaS contracts are better than secured debt. Customers, after all, can keep their operations going in a restructuring. They can't do if they give up on mission-critical software.The problem at the moment is that the market is not unaware of the value of the SaaS model. Stocks across the sector have soared to record highs, and potentially unsustainable valuations. But there are still software stocks to buy due to their SaaS strength, and investors should start their search with these four names:  * Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)  * Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY)  * Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  * Varonis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) Software Stocks to Buy: Salesforce (CRM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com If an investor is going to own an SaaS stock, one place to start is with the company that brought the model to the mainstream. Salesforce went after Oracle's dominance in CRM (customer relationship management) software via its cloud model.Since then, CRM stock has been one of the best in the market. It's returned 4,750% since its 2004 initial public offering. That's a staggering annualized return over 25%.The gains are going to slow going forward, but they're unlikely to stop. Salesforce still has a massive lead in CRM, though HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is trying to chip away. The 2016 acquisition of Demandware moves the company more heavily into e-commerce as well.To be sure, CRM stock isn't cheap. But it hasn't been pretty much ever. This seems a classic case of investors paying up for quality. Workday (WDAY)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Workday stock is interesting for two reasons. First, the business model is enormously attractive. Workday's HCM (human capital management) platform is of great value to large enterprises in particular. And it provides a base for steady expansion over time.The second reason the stock looks attractive is relatively muted performance of late. WDAY stock actually is down over the past year, if by just 0.3%. According to a screen on finviz.com, there are 55 software stocks with a market capitalization over $10 billion. Only four, like WDAY, are negative over the past 12 months, and one of those is pandemic victim Uber (NYSE:UBER).  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to RunTo be sure, it's possible concerns around the model explain that poor performance. Competition likely is one of those concerns. But it's equally likely that WDAY stock will catch up to the myriad other names that have been among the most popular software stocks to buy. Earnings this week proves the point, as the company beat estimates for the second quarter. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Outside of Microsoft, perhaps no large company has better managed the transition to SaaS than Adobe. Its Photoshop and Illustrator, among other platforms, traditionally were disk-based options.They are now part of bundles, including Adobe Creative Cloud, that have driven impressive and consistent growth in recent years.As with CRM, valuation admittedly is a concern. ADBE stock historically didn't look that expensive, often trading at 30x forward earnings or less. It's now as 43x.But with MSFT itself clearing 30x, and CRM over 50x, that multiple on its face isn't outrageous. And with Adobe's growth likely to include e-signatures as well, there's plenty of runway for the company to grow into the steep valuation assigned its stock. Varonis Systems (VRNS)Source: Shutterstock Varonis stock is one of the more intriguing Big Data plays out there. The company specializes in so-called &quot;unstructured data&quot; like PowerPoint presentations, documents, and even images. Varonis products both improve security (by controlling access to that data) and allow for analysis and sharing of that data.It's an attractive model. What makes it more attractive is that direct competition is limited. Varonis itself wrote in its most recent annual report -- as it has for years -- that &quot;we do not currently compete with a company that offers the same breadth of functionalities that we offer in a single integrated solution.&quot;  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to RunAs is the case with other SaaS names, valuation does look stretched. VRNS stock trades at almost 15x trailing 12-month revenue, and the company isn't yet profitable even on an adjusted basis. But there's a huge opportunity here, and a market capitalization under $4 billion doesn't seem commensurate to that opportunity.Investors looking for software stocks to buy are going to have to pay up, and VRNS looks like one of the better mid-cap options from that perspective.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-08-28,"Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $515.74.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-18  * Strike Price: $435.00  * Volume: 512  * Open Interest: 3563 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts.

2020-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- DocuSign Inc. projected revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, in a sign of robust demand for the application that lets businesses sign documents remotely during the coronavirus pandemic.Sales in the period that ends in October will be as much as $362 million, the San Francisco-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $336 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company raised its annual revenue to as much as $1.39 billion from an earlier expectation of $1.32 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.32 billion.DocuSign Chief Executive Officer Dan Springer has tried to integrate the e-signature software with a variety of other business programs so it can fit into the workflow of companies of all sizes. In an effort to differentiate itself from competitor Adobe Inc., DocuSign recently bought Liveoak Technologies Inc. to make it easier for organizations to handle transactions with videoconferencing.

2020-09-04,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is part of the novel coronavirus posse, meaning quarantine was a great driver for its business. As people rushed to get online, demand increased exponentially for its products and services. Consequently ADBE stock is up over 50% this year, and while it pales when compared to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), it is still outperforming the broader market.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com This is great news for current investors, but chasing stocks while they are at all-time highs is asking for trouble. We saw what could happen yesterday as the tech sector had a wretched day. Apple fell 10% in 12 hours and the Nasdaq Composite fell almost 5% in one session.What goes up must come down, and the longer high-flying names go without resting, the worse the accident.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs great as Adobe is, its stock is far too high to chase. This is not a knock against what the team at Adobe is doing, but it is a matter of picking the right levels to start long positions. I have issues with the price action because after decades of investing, I have never seen anything like this before. Investors have to be humble and admit that we are in uncharted waters.Therein lies the reason for my cautionary tone today. ADBE Stock Does Have Plenty of SupportSource: Charts by TradingView The United States is headed into an election season very soon and politicians are acting irresponsibly. Lawmakers just took a two-week recess before they could agree on a stimulus package. That shows they are not focused enough on their constituents. Because of this, I am confident they will do more to shake investor confidence soon.Coming into these highs I was also confident we would get a correction this year. If what started yesterday persists, the good news is that even though ADBE stock is vulnerable, it has many support lines. Buyers are likely to step in at various levels from current price into $505, $485 and $460 per share. The zone between $415 and $390 should be bulletproof in case the selling intensifies.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks Ideal for Any Investor I know it sounds crazy discussing 20% corrections, but keep in mind it just rallied 100% since March.Fundamentally, I do have a bone to pick with its valuation. ADBE stock carries a 67x price-earnings ratio, but I can overlook that. This is a growth stock so I expect it to spend a lot to deliver the growth. My problem is with its 21x price-sale ratio. That is too high -- it is more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) combined.Price-sales ratios are an important metric because they shows how much potential froth investors could shed during panics on Wall Street. Anyone who buys the stock today is fronting the company 21 years worth of sales for the privilege of owning the shares now. There Are Other Ways to Trade Adobe NowTechnically, the bulls are in charge of the action. They have established a strong higher-low and higher-high trend since the March bottom. What is more important is that they spent two months consolidating the price action above $410 per share. This gives the bulls a solid base to make room for higher prices, and the confidence to catch the falling knife if the selling persists.Adobe is going into an earnings report soon and those are binary events. Not even the CEO could guess how traders will react the morning after. Buying a full position into that makes for a coin flip. Alternatively, using options, eager investors do not have to wait for a dip to buy ADBE stock.The options markets are pricing in about an $80 move in either direction for October. An investor can sell the October $385 put and collect almost $10 for it. This leaves a 25% buffer from here before they lose money. And if the share price stays above $385, then they would profit without even needing a rally -- and with no out-of-pocket expense.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2020-09-07,"(Bloomberg) -- A report that SoftBank Group Corp. is making billions by using options to bet on technology stocks has stirred speculation the Japanese conglomerate could have been a driving force behind the rally -- but not everyone is convinced.Evidence suggests the kind of strategies pursued by institutions like SoftBank have a minimal effect on stock-market volatility, according to Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of hedge fund QVR Advisors. Citing commentary from derivatives trading desks, he said the real power is being wielded by day traders buying enormous amounts of call options on tech stocks.Eifert’s analysis speaks to a debate that’s been raging in the stock market about who is behind a surge in options trading and what it all means for investors. Over the weekend, the Financial Times reported that SoftBank spent $4 billion over the past few months buying equity derivatives on technology stocks.Several analysts have pointed out that the heft of large institutional players remains relatively small compared with the rest of the market. Retail punters shelled out $40 billion in call premiums in a month, data from the Options Clearing Corp. compiled by Sundial Capital’s Jason Goepfert show.Frenzied Tesla Speculators Propel 77% Surge in Options TradingEvidence of retail sway comes from parsing the types of trades, according to Eifert. Individual investors have been piling into call options that usually expire within two weeks. The short-term nature of the contracts requires hedging by market makers, which in turn fanned higher stock prices.In contrast, trades favored by large institutions don’t necessarily require market makers to buy and sell the underlying stock to hedge themselves, Eifert said. He said institutions tend to use strategies such as buying a call spread and selling the underlying shares -- a technique to profit from a rally, but also limit risk.“These transactions themselves did not represent meaningful buying pressure,” Eifert wrote on Twitter. The call spread trades did contribute to the curious phenomenon of the S&P 500 Index rising at the same time as VIX Index, he added.To be sure, it’s impossible to tell exactly who is behind a trade just by looking at the order flow. Parts of these big institutional trades were likely done over-the-counter, which makes it harder to gauge their full market effect, according to Kambiz Kazemi, principal at La Financiere Constance Inc.Options activity by both big and small traders has probably heightened market volatility, according to RBC Capital Markets strategist Amy Wu Silverman.“The sheer scale of call buyers both institutional and retail cause a ‘gamma’ squeeze situation for dealers, exacerbating moves in tech,” she wrote in a report on Monday. (“Gamma” is a term for option price drift that dealers often seek to offset by buying or selling the underlying stock.)Call options volumes started spiking in March, April and May as retail investors opened up Robinhood accounts and started a frenzy of day trading, Silverman said, adding that the jump was “for smaller and smaller contract sizes,” a typical footprint of retail.Big institutional trades in tech started arriving in August, according to Silverman. She cited call spreads in a handful of technology companies as having the hallmarks of a big institutional bet.The trades were placed on Aug. 5 in Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc., Adobe Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. options. By then, the Nasdaq 100 had rallied some 60% from the March lows, suggesting institutions were merely following others into the trade.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Nasdaq Whale Theory for Tech Stock Surge Is Stirring Doubts

2020-09-08,"(Bloomberg) -- As the debate rages as to who has had the most impact on option markets -- retail traders or institutions -- what’s becoming clear is the sheer size of the wagers of the professionals.RBC Capital Markets strategist Amy Wu Silverman noted bullish bets in a handful of technology companies in August as having all the hallmarks of a big institutional trade -- with “a staggering $1 billion-plus in premium spent.” Henry Schwartz at Trade Alert LLC cited trades with about $1.4 billion in premiums spent last month.The options data show that institutions jumped into derivatives trading to ride the powerful tech stock rally that started with day traders at home. Now with the Nasdaq 100 poised for another day of losses, the bigger question is how any pullback hit investors big and small.The most likely institutional trades were placed on Aug. 5 in options on stocks like Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc., Adobe Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., according to recent notes by RBC and Trade Alert. They involved call spreads -- strategies designed to profit from a modest increase in stock prices.One example is a call spread in November Microsoft options. The bet is designed to pay out if the stock -- which closed around $214 on Friday -- rises to between $220 and $240 at expiry. That was priced at $6.75 a contract and its value is now somewhere near $7, according to Schwartz.A second trade, which the investor has already closed out, was a similar strategy betting on modest gains in Facebook shares. That was bought for $10.50 a contract and sold for $15.60 with the proceeds put into a call spread with higher strike prices, he said.Huge swings in stocks experiencing heavy options volume have consumed investor attention recently as U.S. benchmarks surged to multiple records. On Monday, SoftBank Group Corp. shares tumbled in Tokyo after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.SoftBank previously said it invested in Adobe, Microsoft, Alphabet in a filing dated June 30, and founder Masayoshi Son mentioned Facebook during a recent post-earnings conference call.SoftBank’s Big Options Bet Tests Investor Faith in Masayoshi SonDespite the stock market selloff late last week, whoever was behind the early August trades is still doing well, according to Silverman.“While Thursday and Friday’s move certainly hurt, it is important to note that all the option positions initiated on August 5th are still marking up,” she said. The investor has reached the strike price in bets on Facebook, Adobe and Salesforce.com, though is still out of the money on wagers on Microsoft and Alphabet, she noted.Given the frenzy surrounding the options bets, traders will be keeping a closer than usual eye on pricing in the single stocks -- and the broader market -- as the expiry draws closer.“The investor will lose $1 billion if these trades do not expire in-the-money,” said Silverman.Nasdaq Whale Theory for Tech Stock Surge Is Stirring DoubtsHere’s a selection of some of the trades cited by strategists:Microsoft Nov. $220/$240 call spread initiated Aug. 5 that’s still open; price was $6.75, value is now near $7Facebook Nov. $250/$275 call spread initiated Aug. 5 that was bought for $10.50 and sold for $15.60 on Sept. 3 to buy a $295/$340 spreadSalesforce.com Nov. $200/$230 call spread initiated Aug. 5, bought at $12 and sold at $24.75 on Aug. 26 to buy the $250/$280 spreadAdobe Oct. $450/$490 call spread initiated Aug. 5 that’s still open; price was $17.20, value is near $23Alphabet Oct. $1650/$1950 call spread initiated Aug. 26; shares are lower since this tradeAdobe Oct. $520/$620 call spread initiated Aug. 26; shares are lower since this trade(Updates with Nasdaq futures in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Giant Trader Footprints Leave Trail to Tech Options Plays

2020-09-09,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. slid as much as 7.1% Wednesday, taking losses to about 14% this week after the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives in tech stocks before a broad sector selloff.The Japanese company touched a low of 5,432 yen in Tokyo morning trade. It has shed roughly $17 billion of market value since Monday as SoftBank’s big bets on high-flying tech stocks from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc. spooked investors.Investors are grappling with recent market turbulence, assessing whether the pullback for equities is a sign of market health or the start of a larger drawdown that has further to go. Tesla Inc., which had defied gravity and market watchers for much of the year, was the worst performer on the Nasdaq 100 Index Tuesday, which fell 4.8% amid a selloff in equities. SoftBank has said it held $122.9 million worth of the automaker as of June 30.“Even more than SoftBank’s actual exposure, it’s the very act that’s disconcerting,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Investors are very wary about ‘style drift.’ The question becomes ‘what are we investing in when we buy SoftBank? And is SoftBank a better investor than we are?’”Read more: SoftBank’s Big Options Bet Tests Investor Faith in Masayoshi SonSoftBank held stakes in 25 of the world’s largest technology companies worth about $3.9 billion as of June 30, according to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Aug. 17. The portfolio included $1.04 billion of Amazon stock, its biggest investment, a $475 million stake in Alphabet, $248.6 million of Adobe Inc. and $189 million of Netflix Inc.The Tokyo-based company booked a 65.4 billion yen ($617 million) gain on the sale of some of the holdings, it said in a presentation to investors on Aug. 12. SoftBank said it invested more than 1 trillion yen in “highly liquid listed shares” and sold 564.9 billion yen, all in the same quarter. The report made no mention of derivatives tied to those investments.SoftBank disclosed in August that it was establishing an asset management arm to trade public securities and said it could use derivatives. What has alarmed shareholders is that Son appears to be using options to amplify his exposure amid rising concerns over valuations being inflated by mercurial individual investors.The Financial Times reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion on options focused on tech stocks with an overall exposure of about $30 billion. The company is sitting on paper profits of about $4 billion in gains from those stakes, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.The speculative fever that drove bullish bets in options markets and saw shares in bankrupt companies surge broke in September, wiping out trillions in market value.Read more: SoftBank Chief Compliance Officer Has Left the CompanyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Selloff Hits $17 Billion After Tech Exposure Fear Grows

2020-09-11,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is considering revamping a controversial strategy of using derivatives to invest in tech companies, and its executives have met with investors in recent days to assure them that the bets are relatively conservative, according to people familiar with the matter.The Japanese conglomerate has stressed to investors that its billion-dollar positions have been concentrated in a handful of blue-chip tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc., and have involved call spreads rather than highly leveraged short-term bets, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.Media reports revealing details of SoftBank’s derivatives bets spooked investors, and caused the company to lose about $9 billion in market value the first day of trading after the reports.SoftBank has debated internally whether to disclose more details of its derivatives trading. But founder Masayoshi Son, who is leading the effort with support from a small team, has been reluctant to provide more information, the people said. The collapse in shares has caused Son to reconsider continuing the trading strategy, but it is not clear what changes might be made, the people said.The scrutiny from investors follows another controversial trade by SoftBank, which used complex securities to offload exposure to the now-collapsed German payments company Wirecard AG.SoftBank’s recent trading has focused on seven technology companies, one of the people said: Amazon.com Inc., Adobe Inc., Alphabet Inc., Netflix Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc., in addition to Microsoft and Facebook. It typically bought out-of-the-money call options to benefit if share prices rise and then sold even higher priced calls, one of the people said.A spokesperson for SoftBank declined to comment.The Tokyo-based company said in August that it would set up a new arm to trade public securities and later disclosed investments of about $3.9 billion in 25 companies. Bloomberg first reported that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion in public stocks as part of a new asset management arm.U.S. stock benchmarks declined after Bloomberg reported the SoftBank deliberations. The Nasdaq 100 tumbled more than 1%, hitting its session low as losses grew in megacap technology companies including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.“It’s just one piece of the puzzle, but the market did seem to sell off around the same time,” said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna International Group’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Is it necessarily rational, for however much market cap of companies to go lower because of a decision made by one institutional trader? Probably not. But is the market looking for reasons to selloff in one direction or another? Probably. This is the most talked about thing, so it’s definitely on everyone’s minds.”Options volume in single securities has rocketed to near-record levels in recent weeks. Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of hedge fund QVR Advisors, said that very large call purchases made in tech stocks over the last few months appear to have been defensive trades rather than all-in bets on further gains.Although he didn’t know SoftBank was behind the purchases until the recent disclosures, Eifert said the series of transactions look like each other and seem related. They have been primarily in call spreads and some calls with expiration dates between November 2020 and March 2021 in six or seven of the biggest names in technology.“Most of the big trades that are associated with SoftBank, or accounts like SoftBank, were done delta-neutral,” he said. “These are institutions that are already long tech stocks and are rotating some of that exposure into options to protect the downside.”Eifert estimated that the notional value of all the trading flow to be more than $50 billion with a few billion dollars spent on the premiums, or option cost. The purchases had far less impact on the bullish feedback loop driving tech stocks higher than did hordes of retail traders buying short-dated call options, he said.Read more: How Tech Options Juiced the U.S. Stock Market: QuickTake(Updated with additional context from 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",SoftBank Reconsiders Trading Strategy That Hurt Shares

2020-09-11,"Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $480.84.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $500.00  * Volume: 319  * Open Interest: 396Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 11, 2020  * A Look Into Adobe's Price Over Earnings  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. reported revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling robust demand for the software maker’s cloud-based creative tools during the coronavirus pandemic.Sales jumped 14% to $3.23 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 28, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $3.16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has tried to continue Adobe’s rapid pace of growth despite the company’s newfound status as one of the world’s highest-valued cloud software makers. The maker of Photoshop continues to invest heavily in designing new tools for creative professionals and hobbyists. The company said it has strengthened the marketing of these products to keep demand high during the pandemic.In the fiscal third quarter, sales of the company’s flagship creative offerings rose 19% to $1.96 billion. Adobe’s Document Cloud, which has benefited from the increase in remote work during the pandemic, generated $375 million, a 22% rise.Fiscal third-quarter profit, excluding some items, was $2.57 a share. Analysts were looking for $2.41.“Adobe delivered the best Q3 in our history in a challenging macroeconomic environment, demonstrating the global demand for our innovative solutions,” Narayen said in the statement. “We are confident that our leadership in the creative, document and customer experience management categories will drive continued momentum in 2020 and beyond.”The company’s shares climbed about 2% in extended trading after closing at $497.67 in New York. The stock has advanced 51% this year.Adobe projected sales of $3.35 billion in the period that ends in November, in line with analysts’ average estimate of $3.36 billion. Adjusted profit will be $2.64 a share in the current quarter, matching analysts’ expectations.Adobe said that revenue from its Digital Media division, including the creative and document clouds, will rise 18% in the current period, while sales of its marketing and advertising suite will be flat year-over-year.After years of acquiring businesses to bolster its marketing and customer-experience capabilities against rival Salesforce.com Inc., Adobe has acknowledged that corporate interest in some elements of that product suite has waned. The software maker said it will focus on higher-value customers that adopt multiple offerings, and has decided to leave a part of the advertising-technology market.The company will ramp up hiring in the current quarter and fiscal 2021 to capitalize on its large addressable market, according to prepared remarks from executives ahead of a conference call with analysts. Educational institutions and students have become a more valuable client base during the pandemic, when most learning in the U.S. is virtual, the software maker said.(Updates with Adobe’s forecast starting in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Reports Sales That Top Estimates on Creative Software

2020-09-15,"Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) shares are up 78.7% over the past year, but at least one large option trader is betting Tuesday afternoon's earnings report will be the end of the rally for now.The Adobe Trades: On Tuesday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received two option alerts related to unusually large Adobe trades.  * At 12:30 p.m., a trader sold 2,500 Adobe call options with a $510 strike price expiring on Oct. 16 at the bid price of $22.68. The trade represented a more than $5.6-million bearish bet.  * Less than a minute later, a trader bought 2,500 Adobe put options with a $510 strike price expiring on Friday at the ask price of $24.43. The trade represented a more than $6.1-million bearish bet.Why It's Important For Adobe Investors: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge.In this case, given the relatively large size of the put purchase on Tuesday, it could certainly be an institutional hedge.Adobe Earnings Miss Coming? The most obvious explanation for the large put purchase on Tuesday is that a deep-pocketed trader simply believes Adobe is going to report some disappointing fourth-quarter earnings numbers on Tuesday.Adobe has gotten some love from Wall Street ahead of the report. On Friday, Cowen upgraded the stock to Outperform and raised its price target to $555, citing multiple catalysts such as accelerating cloud spending. Cowen also said it's expecting big earnings numbers from Adobe.Analysts are expecting Adobe to report fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of $2.41 on revenue of $3.16 billion, up 11.3% from a year ago.If Tuesday's large option trader knows something about Adobe's report before it's official release, the rest of the market certainly doesn't. Adobe shares were trading higher by 2.5% on Tuesday ahead of the release.

The puts purchased have a break-even price of $485.57, suggesting at least 4.8% downside by the end of the week.Related Links:EOG Resources Option Trader Makes .3M Bet On 8% Downside How To Read And Trade An Option AlertSee more from Benzinga  * 14 Popular Tech Stocks With Room To Run  * Why A Nikola Short Squeeze Could Be Coming 'Very Soon'  * Here's How Much Investing ,000 In The XLK Tech Sector ETF In 2010 Would Be Worth Today(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-16,"Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE)  reported strong third-quarter results Tuesday. Here's what five analysts had to say after the print. The Adobe Analysts:  BofA Securities analyst Kash Rangan reiterated a Buy rating on Adobe shares with a $570 price target. BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman maintained an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $535 to $560.Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating and $560 price target.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Philip Winslow reiterated an Equal-weight rating and increased the price target from $375 to $500.Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin maintained an Overweight rating and increased the price target from $430 to $570.BofA On Adobe's Digital Story:  Adobe reported a strong quarter across the board, with revenues and pro forma earnings per share all beating consensus estimates, Rangan said in a note.The EPS upside was due to a 280-basis-point operating margin expansion, thanks to T&E savings and direct engagement momentum, the analyst said.BofA expects Adobe's Digital Experience margin improvement to drive 150-200 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal year 2021.Adobe's annual recurring revenue -- ARR -- improvement and Digital Media growth of 20% in constant currency was due to Creative Cloud retention rates returning to pre-COVID-19 levels; record traffic to Adobe.com; and remote work benefits, he said. The fourth-quarter guidance implied deceleration amid continued macro risk and longer enterprise cycles, Rangan said.&quot;Adobe is an underappreciated 'vaccine' and 'vitamin' (Cloud Wars XII) and will continue to benefit from sustainable pull-forward and higher priority of digital transformation initiatives.&quot; See also:  Option Trader Bets .1M Against Adobe Ahead Of Earnings BMO Confident In Durability Of Adobe's Growth:  Adobe's ARR exceeded expectations by much more than expected, Bachman said. ARR is a metric used by subscription businesses.Margins and free cash flow also continued to impress, the analyst said.View more earnings on ADBEThe results and guidance for Experience Cloud were disappointing, he said. &quot;Nevertheless, the net results increase our confidence in the durability of growth, particularly of Media Cloud.&quot; Morgan Stanley Names 4 Adobe Investor Questions:  While lauding Adobe for strong net new ARR additions, Weiss said the investor debate is likely to center on four questions: durability of Digital Media growth, Digital Experience turning the corner, room for further margin improvement and the right multiple for the stock.The fourth-quarter Digital Media guidance was well ahead of the  consensus and appears conservative, the analyst said. Adobe's management was bullish about opportunities to invest behind a big growth opportunity in Digital Media, he said. Digital Experience remains on track for improvement as the broader spending environment improves, Weiss said. Adobe is likely to see higher margins in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 as operating efficiency improves in the Digital Experience segment, the analyst said. Although Adobe's shares are trading well ahead of their five-year average P/E multiple relative to the broader market and software in particular, there is relative value in shares, according to Morgan Stanley. Wells Fargo Says Valuation Reflects Fundamentals: Adobe's transition to subscription and ability to increase its total addressable market is impressive, Winslow said.Yet the stock's valuation reflects these trends, along with much of the Experience Cloud opportunity ahead, the analyst said. Piper Sandler's Key Takeaways On Adobe:  Data-driven operating model benefits are on full display with Adobe's $114-million ARR beat, Bracelin said.Document cloud growth prospects are materializing, with document cloud ARR increasing 35% year-over-year to $1.34 billion and representing the next major pillar of growth for the company, the analyst said.Piper Sandler raised its estimates for Adobe, basing the expectations on Digital Media ARR topping $10 billion in the fourth quarter.Adobe is capitalizing on the &quot;great digital awakening,&quot; Bracelin said.ADBE Price Action:  At last check, Adobe shares were down 4.3% at $476.27 ahead of the close Wednesday.

2020-09-16,"After the markets closed on Tuesday, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) posted even better than expected financial results for its third quarter of the 2020 fiscal year that ended on August 28th, 2020. Adobe delivered the best Q3 in its history in a beyond-challenging macroeconomic environment as global demand for its innovative solutions was only strengthened by the pandemic.Q3 Earnings To begin, Adobe recorded $3.23 billion in revenue. What's more impressive than the figure itself is that it implies a 14 percent year-over-year growth. The Digital Media segment revenue was $2.34 billion which is a 19 percent growth on the same basis. Creative revenue grew to $1.96 billion, at the same growth rate. Document Cloud revenue was $375 million, topping the list with a 22 percent growth on the same basis.Digital Experience segment revenue amounted to $838 million as digital experience subscription revenue increased 7 percent year-over-year to $729 million. When advertising cloud revenue is excluded, the segment grew 14 percent year-over-year. GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $1.07 billion, and non-GAAP operating income was $1.40 billion. GAAP net income amounted to $955 million. Cash flows from operations were also at a record level of $1.44 billion.Competitive Landscape Adobe does what investors want to see: it is making money efficiently. Its gross margin is 83.4%, mostly due to the nature of its offerings. But even when we compare its results with its competitors, Adobe is still on top of the game as it has undoubtedly a great business. Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) reported a gross margin of 68% but it now has Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to compete with. Having one of the biggest tech players as your direct competitor does not make things any easier.Meanwhile, DocuSign Inc (NASDAQ: DOCU) reported a gross margin of 73.8% but it still saw prices jumping all over the place. Despite strong earnings, its stock price lost about 20% in three days during a tumultuous week. Revenue increased 45% from a year earlier, and billings were up 61% in the same period, so it all indicates that markets simply needed to correct its price. Sentiment is what counts and Adobe could also be influenced by it at some point. It's a great profitable company with a strong stock, but despite all of the amazing metrics, no upward rise can continue indefinitely. For now, Adobe has no true competitor and that is its greatest strength.Adobe Stock Is A Star Adobe shares have risen 51% since the beginning of this unprecedented year. During the last trading minutes on Tuesday, its shares hit $497.67 which is a rise of 76% in the last 12 months. Its price has been steadily increasing for several years now. Its creative portfolio that includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat certainly justify its success. Not only are they great products, but they have become integral to businesses and professionals as 2020 made us jump several years ahead into a digital future.Momentum Is Expected To Go Beyond 2020 Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe is confident that the company's leadership in the creative, document and customer experience management segments will drive continued momentum even beyond 2020. Adobe is successfully riding the tech wave which has brought immense gains during the pandemic, but more importantly, it made the world reliant on its products. The global economy plunged, but the world didn't entirely stop during the worst pandemic in modern history only thanks to technology. If it wasn't for companies such as Adobe, things would have been even worse.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

However, over the past month, the stock spiked by 5.20%, and in the past year, by 72.81%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 9.46%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on ADBEMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 37.89 in the Software--Infrastructure industry, Adobe Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 65.66.

2020-09-16,"It was a volatile day in the stock market, given that it was a Fed day. Let's look at a few top stock trades going into Thursday, where hopefully we will get more clarity.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Adobe (ADBE)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) opened higher after reporting earnings, but hasn't been able to sustain its gains. The fade lower is also putting shares below the 10-day and 20-day moving averages, as well as that key pivot level at around $492.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the downside, let's see how the ~$465 level act as support. There Adobe finds the 50-day moving average, the 161.8% extension and uptrend support (blue line).Should that area fail to hold, we could see some air come out of Adobe. It potentially puts the $420 to $430 area in play, but we'll likely need to see some broader market selling to get there.  * 20 Election Stocks to Buy if Joe Biden Wins in 2020 On the upside, we need to see ADBE reclaim $500 and Wednesday's high at $505.50. Above puts the two-times range in play at $518.36. Over that and the all-time highs are in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: General Electric (GE)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) was trading well on the day, up over 10% at its highs. The move is exactly what the bulls needed. It sent the stock over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). Those now become support levels to watch on the downside. If they fail, it puts $6 support back in play, followed by the September low at $5.93. Below and the $5.45 lows are in play. Should support hold -- or should GE continue higher before testing those lows -- look for a possible rally to the 23.6% retracement, near $7.30. Above that could put the 200-day moving average in play, followed by the June highs near $8.50.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Boeing (BA)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBoeing (NYSE:BA) bulls will now be looking for similar action to GE, which is a rotation over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as downtrend resistance.There was strength in the airlines and Boeing on Wednesday. As a result, I would keep them on my radar this week. A move over $175 could get a quick rally to $180, which has been acting as resistance.Over $180 and maybe we could get a move to the 38.2% retracement near $187. Above that puts $200 on the table.  * 5 Cloud Stocks Still Reaching for the Sky, Despite the Pullback On the downside, bulls want to see the $155 to $160 area continue to hold as support. A close below could accelerate the selling pressure and gives traders little reason to own it in the short term. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Gold ETF (GLD)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGold is always in focus on Fed days, so let's look at the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD). Last week, the GLD opened at the 50-day moving average and range support near $178. That held and shares quickly rallied higher, reclaiming the 10-day and 20-day moving averages. Now holding those moving averages as support, shares are trying to rotate over last week's high at $184.68. Above that and the GLD can make a push into the upper-$180s. Ultimately, we are looking for a move back to $190. Above puts the 261.8% in play near $197, along with $200. On the downside, though, a break of the 10-day and 20-day moving average should turn bulls cautious, but they shouldn't be alarmed as long as the GLD is above $178. Below and we'll have some issues.  Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: GameStop (GME)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGameStop (NYSE:GME) has been trading much better lately.We see that $6 resistance from earlier in the year is now acting as support, while GameStop has the 10-week moving average acting in its favor. I would love to see it hold above the $8 mark. Even better would be a weekly above the last two weeks' highs. Over $9 and perhaps we can see a tag of $11 and the 200-week moving average. It's a very, very wide range, but should we see a close below $6 and the 10-week moving average, that will be a cause for concern.

2020-09-16,Adobe's (ADBE) fiscal third-quarter results benefit from robust demand for the company's cloud-based creative tools amid the coronavirus pandemic.,Adobe (ADBE) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates
2020-09-16,"(Bloomberg) -- For more than a decade, game developers have been using a tool called the Unity engine and its easy-to-use tutorials to create more than half of the top 1,000 mobile games available on the Apple Inc. and Google app stores.That simplicity has turned Unity Technologies Inc. into a household name in the industry. But the 16-year-old company behind the engine has ambitions beyond games. Unity is going public this week seeking to raise $1.2 billion to expand into 3D software that helps companies solve a wide range of real-world challenges -- from training new employees to simulating passenger traffic in a busy airport. The stock market debut also comes as one of its biggest competitors, Fortnite creator Epic Games Inc., is locked in a legal battle with Apple.Unity plans to offer 25 million shares at an estimated price of $44 to $48 apiece when it lists on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company raised it’s price range Wednesday from a previous range of $34 to $42 per share. Based on the number of shares outstanding after the offering, the IPO could value Unity at $12.6 billion.More than 1.5 million people and a handful of big-name gaming companies across some 190 countries use Unity’s flagship product, the Unity engine, each month, according to the company. The software engine is available for free to hobbyists and by subscription for larger game studios. The company also operates a store that sells digital assets like three-dimensional dogs and robots, that can be included in games.Unity is betting that the next wave of growth, however, will come from selling its 3D technology to film, engineering and car companies. “The thing we’ve been searching for in science fiction and future imaginings of how the world will work, we’re the company building that,” Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello said in an interview earlier this year. In its securities filing, Unity said it sees a market opportunity of $29 billion across gaming and other industries.Today, the bulk of Unity’s revenue comes from external services such as a network for advertisements that helps developers put ads directly in their mobile phone games. Most games on iPhone and Android are free and supported either by in-app purchases or ads, with the latter model becoming more popular in recent years. In SEC filings, Unity revealed that it has been operating at a loss since 2018, although revenue has grown 42% to $541.8 million in 2019 from $380.8 million in 2018.“I don’t think the losses will deter investors in the near-term,” said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “The revenue growth trajectory of the company should enable it to scale over its fixed costs and turn profitable in a few years. Over time they can get to a roughly 20% operating margin.”Unity’s biggest competitor is the Unreal Engine, from Epic, which is seen as a more powerful, prestigious development platform. While Unity is more common among smaller, independent developers, Unreal Engine is used for big video game productions like the role-playing game Final Fantasy VII Remake and the popular shooter Borderlands 3.But Epic is waging a legal onslaught against Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, accusing them of anticompetitive behavior in their app stores. In August, Apple threatened to block Epic from updating and distributing the Unreal Engine on iOS devices, but a judge ruled that the block couldn’t go through. The war between Epic and Apple seems likely to continue for years, but opportunities for Unity may be limited. “It’s hard to see developers jumping ship from Unreal to Unity while the lawsuit continues, given the differences in the technology and the high switching costs between them,” Kanterman said.Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures, which has invested in Unity, said he’s bullish on Unity’s IPO prospects. Unity could be the next Autodesk Inc. or even Adobe Inc., Clinton said, two software companies whose products are used in engineering, illustration and design and have performed well, particularly in recent years as tech stocks boomed.“Real-time and interactive 3D content is the future of entertainment and social media,” Clinton said. “Engines that power those experiences are sort of like the next cloud infrastructure — the picks and shovels for developers looking to participate in this new interactive world.”(Updates with new pricing in third paragraph.

2020-09-16,"Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) moved higher by 16.01% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Adobe has.Adobe's Debt Based on Adobe's balance sheet as of June 24, 2020, long-term debt is at $4.11 billion and current debt is at $0.00, amounting to $4.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $3.04 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $1.07 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Adobe's $21.60 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.19. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Adobe: Q3 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For September 15, 2020  * Adobe Earnings Preview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-18,"It was a relatively quiet week for earnings, with Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) being the biggest names to report. Here's a recap. FedEx Analysts were beyond impressed when FedEx again managed to crush expectations as the shipping giant is getting ready for a holiday 'shipathon' that is just around the corner. FedEx delivered very strong results during the quarter that ended on August 31 with revenue increasing from $17 billion in the same quarter last year to $19.3 billion. The increased demand found its way to the bottom line with net income rising 60% to $1.28 billion.Adobe Adobe continued its winning streak by setting a new revenue record. It delivered the best fiscal third-quarter results in the company's history, exceeded expectations and maintaining its five-year streak of year-over-year quarterly increases in revenue.Lennar Corporation The U.S. real estate company Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN) topped analyst estimates both for revenue and earnings. It attributed higher demand to record-low mortgage rates as it sold 13,842 houses in its latest quarter. The housing market has only gotten hotter since the U.S. government eased COVID-restrictions as U.S. homebuilding posted its strongest growth in four years in July. Francesca's Holding Corporation Meanwhile, Francesca's Holdings Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FRAN) had a rough day when it posted its fiscal second-quarter results. The stock plunged 8.75% on September 16, reducing its market cap to $10.92 million. The pandemic has been rough on retail boutiques the group operates, especially the fashion apparel, jewelry, and accessories segments.Apogee Enterprises Apogee Enterprises (NASDAQ: APOG), a leading provider of architectural glass, framing systems, and installation services, has been disrupted by the pandemic but is slowly rebounding. Its stock fell 0.4% in pre-market trading after the company reported Q2 results, but earnings and revenue did manage to beat estimates. However, due to not knowing how severe nor how long will the downturn be, the company did not provide any outlook.Cantel Medical Meanwhile, Cantel Medical (NYSE: CMD) also topped forecasts. The Little Falls, N.J.-based infection prevention products and services company posted losses of $2.3 million from reported revenue of $233.4 million, a 2.5% year-over-year drop. The decline in organic revenue was greatly offset by the impact of acquisitions. Although medical revenue decreased 25%, dental revenue increased 59%. The company expects a full recovery, although the timing also remains uncertain.Acutus Medical Acutus Medical (NASDAQ: AFIB) reported revenue of $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 that ended on June 30th. This figure marks a 54% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Back in August, the arrhythmia management company completed an initial public offering and gained $163.3 million in net proceeds. Despite headwinds brought on by the pandemic, the company managed to execute its commercial launch. Although gross margin was negative at 135%, it greatly improved from last year's quarter when it stood at 232%. Therefore, economies of scale and greater efficiency in labor was achieved.Outlook Provided that the second lockdown can be avoided, it is possible that the worst is behind us. However, no one can tell with certainty as we are still not near to winning the battle against COVID-19. This week's results do show signs of an economic rebound but we are not out of the woods yet.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAM Newswire.

2020-10-12,"The team of Doug Clinton and Steve Van Sloun at Loup Ventures made a bullish case for Unity Software (NYSE: U), a company in which they have owned a stake since before the IPO in a blog post. ""Unity is on the road to becoming the next great creative software company,"" Clinton and Van Sloun said. Unity offers three major elements for a long-term thesis, the tech venture capitalists said: gaming as a social network, physical and virtual worlds merging and the growth of augmented and virtual reality.Loup Ventures compared Unity to Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ: ADSK), two publicly traded creative software companies.Adobe, Autodesk Parallels: Loup Ventures notes that many of Unity's customers are also using Adobe Creative Cloud and Autodesk products like AutoCAD, Revit and Maya.Loup Ventures believes Unity has a shot at hitting the market caps of Adobe and Autodesk in the long term.Current valuations show Unity trading at 24.6x enterprise value/2021 revenue estimates compared to 15.5x for Adobe and 11.8x Autodesk.""Unity deserves a higher multiple in part as it is growing twice as fast as Adobe and Autodesk,"" Clinton and Van Sloun said. Unity's revenue was up 39% in the first half of 2020, compared to 14% and 17% increases from Adobe and Autodesk, respectively.Related Link: Unity Software Opens Well Above IPO PriceUnity's Growing Subscriber Base: Unity Software will have to add 3.3 million paid subscribers and 10.1 million paid subscribers to match the respective totals of Autodesk and Adobe.Those figures are based on an average revenue per subscriber of $880.50 for Unity Software, Loup Ventures said. The average revenue per subscriber figure from Unity is much higher than the $435.10 and $695.53 seen from Adobe and Autodesk, respectively.The report notes it took Adobe six years to get from zero to 12 million subscribers when it switched to its new model in 2012. Autodesk took six years to go from zero to 4 million subscribers under a similar business shift.""Even if it takes Unity more than twice as long to reach this paid subscription level, it illustrates a plausible path for Unity to become the next great creative software company over the next decade plus,"" Clinton and Van Sloun said. Loup Ventures projects that Unity can reach the 3.3-million hurdle in five to seven years, which could boost the valuation of the company ""significantly higher.""The second hurdle of 10.1 million is seen as much harder, but Loup believes Unity has a shot at hitting the mark.Unity's Take: In its IPO filing, Unity listed a total market size of $29 billion, made up of $12 billion from creative solutions in the gaming industry and $17 billion seen from outside the gaming industry.""Looking to the future, we believe there are large opportunities within and beyond the industries and use cases we currently serve that represent a market potential multiple times larger than our opportunity today,"" the company said.

2020-10-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Twilio Inc. is buying customer data company Segment Inc. for about $3.2 billion in stock, after a boom in demand for online communications tools.Cloud-computing company Twilio has benefited during the pandemic as customers, such as retailers and health care providers, have increasingly relied on online software to sell and communicate to customers. San Francisco startup Segment helps companies manage the streams of data they collect about their customers from various platforms. It was valued at $1.5 billion in its last private funding round, with investors including Thrive Capital, Accel, Alphabet Inc.’s GV.The transaction will help Twilio compete in a total addressable market of $79 billion, the company said in a statement Monday. Twilio shares rose 2.4% to $313.49 at 9:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has tripled this year, valuing the company at $45.6 billion.Derrick Wood, an anlyst at Cowen & Co., said the acquisition could be a “game changer” for Twilio, as well as its customers and the broader customer relationship management software industry. The deal also puts Twilio in direct competition with Salesforce.com Inc. and Adobe Inc., he said.Segment, founded in 2011, is a cloud-based developer that helps companies such as Glossier Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Atlassian Corp. and Intuit Inc. provide better support and service by combining together all the different ways a company might collect data on a customer—in a store, through a mobile app, through email and more. It’s become a leader in offering a new type of software known as CDP, or customer data platform.Jeff Lawson, Twilio chief executive officer, said Segment helps companies “break down silos” of information across disparate systems to offer a complete picture of their customer. Combined with Twilio, the two can create a “more personalized, timely and impactful engagement across customer service, marketing, analytics, product and sales,” he said.Segment, led by CEO and co-founder Peter Reinhardt, will become a division of Twilio, according to the statement.The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter.

2020-10-12,"The coronavirus has decimated companies across multiple sectors including airlines, energy, hospitality, and retail. At the same time, the pandemic has acted as a tailwind for tech companies, driving stocks in this sector to record highs.The broader markets entered bear market territory in March and soon recovered to trade at pre-COVID-19 levels within a few months, primarily driven by the stellar performance of mega-cap tech companies.This means there are stocks trading at a lower valuation that have the potential to outperform the broader markets as we enter the fourth quarter of the year. Let's take a look at three tech stocks that are trading at a discount to sell-side price target estimates.Digital Transformation Heavyweight Adobe: The first company on the list is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), a stock that has already returned 45% in 2020.Adobe continues to post stellar numbers and managed to grow sales by 14% year-over-year to $3.23 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Its Creative Cloud business grew sales by 19%, while the Document Cloud and Experience Cloud businesses grew sales by 22% and 2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. The Creative Cloud vertical is part of Adobe's Digital Media business, which includes flagship applications like Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere.Adobe prices its bundle of 20 applications at $53 per month, but users can subscribe to individual applications at a lower cost as well.The Document Cloud vertical provides document storage and tools for PDF publishing and remote work. Adobe's Experience Cloud business provides marketing and advertising software to enterprises with which they can measure ad campaign results, purchase ad inventory, and engage with customers via email marketing campaigns.Each of Adobe's businesses has the potential to grow at a rapid pace in the upcoming decade.Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance have a 12-month average target price of $552.77 -- 9% above its current price.Software Technology Company Akamai: Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM) has a distributed intelligent edge platform from the enterprise to the cloud, enabling companies to deliver robust experiences and improve efficiencies.Content-delivery networking companies including Akamai experienced a surge in internet traffic when lockdowns were announced in the second quarter of 2020. Akamai sales in the second quarter were up 13% year-over-year at $795 million, while the operating margin soared 32%.During the company's earnings call, Akamai said its intelligent edge platform has grown to include 300,000 servers in 4,000 locations, with over 1,500 network partners at the edge of the internet.Akamai confirmed it is now working with over 220 of the world's largest over-the-top and broadcasting companies as well as with 24 of the 25 most popular video game publishers.Akamai stock is currently trading at $112.53, which is 10% below the average analyst price target estimate of $125.Virtualization Technology Specialist Citrix: Shares of remote work enabler Citrix Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) have gained over 20% year-to-date, despite trading 22% below their 52-week high.The company provides desktop virtualization applications that have grown in demand due to the work-from-home trend.In the second quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue grew by a robust 54% year-over-year to $949 million, while ARR for subscription sales was up 41% at $590 million. Citrix is changing its business to become a software-as-a-service company, which should help generate stable revenue across business cycles.This shift resulted in a 7% growth in the second quarter, which was significantly lower than the revenue growth of 20% in the March quarter.The change in product mix is expected to be a temporary disruption, and revenue growth is expected to normalize in the next 12 months.Analysts tracking Citrix have a 12-month average target price of $168 which is 17% above its current trading price.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Google Could Be Forced To Sell Chrome, Part Of Ad Business By US Government: Report  * Tiktok US Rival Triller Plans SPAC Merger To Go Public: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. debuted a software tool to help media creators prove their images are real, the latest move by the maker of Photoshop to combat the spread of deepfake technology.An attribution tool for Photoshop and Behance, a social-media service owned by Adobe, will be available for testing in the coming weeks and generally released in 2021, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. The software feature will let creators tag pictures with their names as well as the history and location of edits, to provide more transparency to a public growing increasingly skeptical of digital images.Adobe is undertaking this project as part of the Content Authenticity Initiative, a coalition of technology and media companies including Microsoft Corp., Twitter Inc., the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. These partners hope to build a new, open-source digital standard to help consumers online distinguish between genuine images and misinformation. Microsoft last month released a tool to help analyze videos and photos and provide a score indicating the chance that those images have been manipulated.The coalition’s effort is meant to build trust for images that feature transparent data and be more distrustful of pictures of unknown provenance. Adobe doesn’t generally weigh in on political matters, but Dana Rao, the company’s executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary, said he feared Americans would “disengage” from the political process due to online disinformation.“We’re worried that if people lose faith in facts that we aren’t going to be able to have any conversations about moving the country forward,” Rao said in an interview. “If none of us can agree on what is actually happening, we can’t have a policy discussion.”Rao said he wishes he could go back in time five years and undertake the initiative then, but believes the technology may help in the elections in two and four years.Adobe’s photo-editing products have made image manipulation mainstream. Photoshop and Lightroom are ubiquitous applications used to airbrush magazine covers, create art, and in some instances, to misinform the public. Rao said that in 99% of cases, customers use Adobe’s software in “productive, beautiful ways.”Rao said Adobe’s tool doesn’t try to detect deepfakes because artificial intelligence will make it increasingly difficult to keep up with and identify those fraudulent images. Instead, the company is trying to help consumers avoid manipulation by authenticating real digital images. While Adobe’s Photoshop engineers sometimes help law enforcement examine images of child abduction or exploitation for photo manipulation, the company doesn’t have enough people to quickly evaluate and call out a wave of political disinformation about the Nov. 3 U.S. election.“This is what we’re referring to internally as our digital citizenship,” Rao said of the effort against deepfakes. “We are committed to ensuring our technology and the use of our technology benefits society.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Unveils Authentication Tool in Battle Against Deepfakes
2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. is bringing its second iconic app to Apple Inc.’s iPad tablet after a challenging rollout for Photoshop, part of the software maker’s effort to hold on to artists and designers shifting to work on mobile devices.Illustrator, an app that lets users make graphics, logos and other ground-up designs, is now generally available to iPad users, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. The app has been reimagined for the tablet, with a simpler interface but professional-level functionality, the software maker said.“For Illustrator for iPad, what we did is what you could call the Nike approach, where you identify athletes you want to make this for,” Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer and the executive vice president of Creative Cloud, said in an interview. The company focused on how “really great illustrators” would want to use the software on the device, he said.Adobe announced the app as part of its MAX creative conference, which is virtual to limit the spread of Covid-19. The company has aggressively developed new apps and features -- especially for phones and tablets -- as the almost 38-year-old business expands to keep up with its users beyond computer desktops.Adobe has dominated the graphics and visual software industry for decades, and has seen its stock rise in the past 10 years almost 15-fold to a high of $533.80 last month. The shares, which have gained 50% this year, closed at $495.20 Monday in New York.The transition to mobile devices has presented an opportunity for upstarts, which have been gaining ground while Adobe undertook the thorny work of re-engineering mature apps for a different platform. As a result, Photoshop for iPad came out very differently than the desktop app.Belsky said when Adobe promised “real Photoshop,” some users expected “full Photoshop,” with all of the features of the standard version. Early customers of the mobile version panned the app online, though Adobe has since made updates and it now has a more than four-star rating in Apple’s App Store. Belsky said that one lesson from the Photoshop launch is to let consumers test the app for a longer period of time before making it widely available.Photoshop’s iPad app has reached about 2.6 million global installations since its launch in November 2019, according to estimates from research firm Sensor Tower.Belsky said that part of Adobe’s mobile strategy is offering apps that can be downloaded at no cost, including Photoshop Express Photo Editor, to attract more consumers to the company’s products because they may later upgrade to paid accounts. He acknowledged that design-software competition is intensifying with startups such as Canva Inc. and Figma Inc. emerging as rivals.“Competition is oftentimes the impetus to act,” Belsky said. “I look at our products and the mission is very simple. Our products need to become systems. That requires that old-school desktop files become cloud documents, it requires that people can be collaborative even at the beginning of their work.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Rolls Out Illustrator for iPad After Rocky Photoshop Debut
2020-10-20,"Adobe is betting big on its Sensei AI platform, and so it's probably no surprise that the company also continues to build more AI-powered features into its flagship Photoshop  applications.  At its MAX conference, Adobe today announced a handful of new AI features for Photoshop, with Sky Replacement being the most obvious example.  Other new AI-driven features include new so-called ""Neural Filters"" that are essentially the next-generation of Photoshop filters and new and improved tools for selecting parts of images, in addition to other tools to improve on existing features or simplify the photo-editing workflow.","Adobe Photoshop gets new AI smarts with neural filters, sky replacement and more"
2020-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Take all the physical assets owned by all the companies in the S&P 500, all the cars and office buildings and factories and merchandise, then sell them all at cost in one giant sale, and they would generate a net sum that doesn’t even come out to 20% of the index’s $28 trillion value. Much of what’s left comes from things you can’t see or count: algorithms and brands and lists.This is, in the broadest sense, a new phenomenon. Back in 1985, for instance, before Silicon Valley came to dominate the ranks of America’s biggest companies, tangible assets tended to be closer to half the market’s value.The shift picked up after the financial crisis of 2008 and is taking off anew during the Covid-19 lockdown, with the value of intangible-heavy companies like Google and Facebook soaring while smokestack stocks languish. All of which is a source of deep concern for those who worry about things like employment and inequality.The rise of intangibles helps explain why many American workers have recently had it so rough, with wages stagnating and benefits disappearing, and signals the slide could continue, according to the New York University professor whose writings have ignited a debate on the topic in academia, Baruch Lev.In the abstract, it’s behind the backlash against giant tech firms that found its way into Congress. Put simply, these assets don’t require the hordes of workers to create and maintain them the way old economy ones did.So for all the hand-wringing and fretting about how the pandemic run-up in tech stocks bespeaks a bubble that’s bound to burst, what if the bigger concern is that it doesn’t?“When people think about this growing income inequality, much of it comes from the growing inequality in the corporate sector,” says Lev, the director of accounting research at NYU’s business school. “Those that are successful are enormously successful. And the others that still employ lots of people really cannot get out of this trap.”At one level, this is all perfectly rational. Stock investors are just anticipating, and putting claims on, these companies’ ability to generate revenue streams for years to come. Industrial innovation has been framed as anti-human since its earliest days, often wrongly. Even the terms are squishy -- assigning market value to the tangible and intangible property is in many respects a judgment call.Still, researchers including Lev are stepping up warnings, concerned about the influence of Covid-19 on the economy and equality.By way of illustration, consider a company like Adobe Inc., whose programs altered the printing industry. So valuable are its formulas and algorithms that even with a market cap of $237 billion, the value of its hard, tangible assets comes out to virtually nothing. Adobe employs more than 22,000 people, by any measure a lot, but it’s part of a technological wave that by some yardsticks cut employment in printing by half. (An Adobe spokesperson declined to comment.)If you work at a company riding this wave or better yet own one, you’re doing well. Adobe shares are up 50% this year, part of a surge in tech shares that has added $2 trillion to their combined market cap even as a recession raged. For everyone else, the news is less good. One loose way of thinking of the impact is that while intellectual property tends to create a small set of well-to-do workers, it often displaces a larger set of hourly ones.“As we’ve all had to move into a digital world, it makes sense that a lot of the investments are in a digital world, which are intangible,” said Megan Greene, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. “It comes at the expense of the worker, though. This crisis has accelerated a lot of things, and that’s one of them.”While even experts differ on what constitutes an intangible asset, and some view Lev’s definitions as loose, expansion in the value of things like Facebook Inc.’s advertising platform, Netflix Inc.’s customer algorithms and Amazon.com Inc.’s user networks is attracting attention now if for no other reason than it explains a mystery of the pandemic era: the stock market’s uncanny resilience.Whenever someone points out that six or seven gigantic tech stocks dominate the S&P 500 like never before, they’re partly describing the rising dominance of invisible assets. Rallies in companies like Facebook and Alphabet Inc. are a key way the value of intellectual property has expanded.As a result of those gains, S&P 500 members held more than $21 trillion in intangibles at the end of 2018, more than double 2005, according to a report by research center Ponemon Institute and Aon Plc, a professional services firm that provides risk and insurance consulting. That’s 84% of the S&P 500’s market value, the most ever.To be sure, not everyone buys those numbers, which treat anything that isn’t directly ascribable to a tangible asset in the S&P 500’s market value as intangible. “I got a Ph.D in finance, not accounting, but I would say I’m not sure if I agree,” said Linda Zhang, CEO and founder of Purview Investments and senior adviser to Social Finance Inc. “Market cap is an indication of willingness to pay for future earnings. Part of that difference could reflect how much both tangible and intangible assets can generate in earnings in the future. I don’t think the difference is just intangible.”Even so, the market has never traded at such premiums to its hard assets. Data compiled by Bloomberg show the S&P 500 sits at more than 12 times its tangible book value, a record multiple.While premiums on invisible assets have risen before, particularly in the dot-com bubble, this trend is bigger and more entrenched, given the enormous earnings that intellectual property now generate. Like most things in the economy, it’s being amplified by Covid-19, which divides have and have-nots according to who can work from home. The rich are getting richer in markets, too: as shares rebounded, valuations for the most expensive firms rose three times faster than the rest, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.In the economy, that signal -- the market’s appetite for earnings based not on plants and machinery but ideas -- feeds itself. The share of business investment targeted at invisible assets is right now rising 1 1/2-times faster than it did during the financial crisis, itself a record period of hyper-investment in intangibles, estimates Jason Thomas, the head of global research at Carlyle Group.“Such spending tends to be motivated by a desire to do more with less,” Thomas wrote in a report last month. “Past increases in the intangible share of corporate outlays have been associated with slower recoveries in employment.”It’s a bleak projection for a labor market still reeling from the shutdowns, with close to 8% of people in the U.S. unemployed. Companies including Walt Disney Co. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc recently announced thousands of layoffs. Nearly 70,000 jobs have been cut across the banking industry this year.According to Vincent Deluard, director of global macro strategy at brokerage StoneX Group Inc., this transformation is inherently unequal because it weights rewards to companies that by definition require fewer people. Back in the 19th century, capitalism required large physical investments, such as canals, dams and railroads, which in turn created jobs. That’s true to a much smaller extent now.“Investments in intangible assets do not create many jobs. Think of the payment processing platforms versus the banks -- owning the network is always better than owning the physical branches. Think about social media versus newspaper -- owning the platform is much better than generating it,” Deluard said. “It is a huge secular transformation creating winners and losers everywhere.”Economic recoveries that focus more on intangible investments have increasingly been met with slower labor market bounce-backs. In the early 1980s, it took fewer than 30 months until employment levels returned to their prior peak, as spending on intangible investments rose 3.4%. Emerging from the dot-com bust, it took nearly 50 months. The labor market recovery after the financial crisis took about 70 months to return to prior levels as intangible investment spending rose a record 7.5%, Carlyle data show.One of the main ways intangibles sap employment and other growth measures is their scalability, according to NYU’s Lev. A product whose value is derived entirely from a formula, like a drug or software, can be sold millions of times with minimal additional investment.“But if you think about tangible assets, physical assets, they are not scalable,” Lev said. “You can use a seat in an airplane only once or twice a day. You cannot sell the same seat 5,000 times a day.”There’s little doubt which model the stock market prefers this year. Investors have been falling over themselves to reward businesses that deemphasize humans. At a time people are kept at home and companies with fewer digital capabilities have struggled, firms that rely least on their employees compared with intangible assets have beaten labor-intensive ones by 37 percentage points in 2020, according to an analysis by Deluard.The result has been already-giant companies in some cases doubling in size. The Nasdaq 100 is up 34% this year, compared with a 3% decline for the small-cap Russell 2000 gauge, and has almost doubled in less than two years. There’s a clear correlation between investment in intangible assets and market capitalization, according to the Aon report.Dominance by idea-based companies boiled over in 2018 when for the first time the five biggest companies derived a majority of their value from intangibles, using Aon’s definitions: Apple, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook. They’ve done nothing but get bigger since, grabbing market share in the lockdown and pushing their weighting to a record 23% of the S&P 500 and close to half of the Nasdaq 100.Compare that with 1985, when the five largest were IBM Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric Co., Schlumberger N.V. and Chevron Corp -- massive firms with plenty of tangible assets.According to NYU’s Lev, estimates of intangible asset value are somewhat nebulous considering no one can possibly predict the future. For example, the value of Apple’s patents depend somewhat on China’s continued willingness to allow the iPhone maker to sell freely in its market. Still, he estimates roughly 75% of S&P 500 value stems from intangible assets when taking into account fluctuations.The value of Moderna Inc.’s intangible assets heavily rely on the biotech firm’s ability to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Consider the math: Moderna’s market-cap amounts to about $28 billion, yet the company’s tangible book value (what can be found on its balance sheet) is less than $1.2 billion. That means $26.9 billion -- or 96% -- of Moderna’s market value is derived from intangibles. Shares of Moderna have soared 265% this year.Could it be a fad? To be sure, when some people hear “intangible asset growth” as a reason to justify stock surges and high valuations, they’re reminded of the dot-com bubble. Back in 1999, eyeballs and site visit numbers were inputs for premising investment, a strategy that ended in one of the greatest busts ever.“You have to peg valuation to something and I always get nervous when the discussion changes from earnings, revenue, margins -- whatever you want to use as your metric,” said Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. “Now we’re changing that metric to something else because of the situation that we’re in, and all that’s doing is justifying the high price. To me that becomes more bubble-like.”But Nolte acknowledges there’s a key difference between now and then -- that the darling megacap companies of today generate billions of dollars in profits. To some investors, there’s no obvious reason their preeminence should change.“It’s amazing how being long intangibles, short human beings has been such a winning trade -- not just this year, but for quite a while,” said Jared Woodard, the head of the Research Investment Committee at Bank of America. “Right now we have an economy structured to reward these asset-light business models.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Epic S&P 500 Rally Is Powered by Assets You Can’t See or Touch

2020-10-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is teaming with Adobe Inc. and C3.ai, the company of customer-software pioneer Tom Siebel, in another bid to better compete with Salesforce.com Inc., the market leader for such programs. C3.ai will release a new customer-relations management software program that blends its artificial intelligence tools with Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 CRM software and Adobe’s marketing and customer-targeting cloud. The offering pulls in an array of data from a client’s internal systems and outside information, such as social media sentiment and regulatory filings, to predict, for example, future revenue, what new products are needed and which customers might be ready to take their business elsewhere.Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, has been trying for more than 15 years to catch Salesforce, the top vendor in the $56 billon market for customer-relations management software, according to Gartner Inc. While Salesforce had 20% market share in 2019 compared with Dynamics 2.6%, the most popular choice in Gartner’s data was “other” with 68%. The fragmented market creates an opportunity for Microsoft, C3 and Adobe, according to executives of the companies. The shift to cloud computing and the demand for AI tools means there’s a desire for new products, especially those that can analyze formerly siloed sets of data. Of course Salesforce is trying to do similar things — it has AI tools called Einstein and spent $6.5 billion to buy MuleSoft to offer products that combine a customer’s in-house systems with data and apps on the public internet. “Salesforce has done a fantastic job, but they have 20% share and therein lies the story — we talk about this as if it’s all over, and the reality is it is a pretty competitive market,” Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in an interview. Called C3 AI CRM powered by Microsoft Dynamics 365, the software is available beginning Monday and will be jointly sold by the three companies. The partnership brings together executives with a long history in this part of the industry. Siebel pioneered software that manages and tracks a company’s interactions with clients when he founded Siebel Systems in 1993. Nadella ran the Dynamics business for Microsoft more than a decade ago and has reinvigorated Microsoft’s focus on it since taking over the top job in 2014. Adobe, the leader in software such as Photoshop for creative artists, has been a close partner of Microsoft in various efforts on its cloud businesses. Siebel’s C3.ai was founded in 2009 and now has customers including Bank of America Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and the U.S Defense Department. Siebel said customers want products tailored to their specific industry and that use AI to do things like reduce customer churn — tracking which customers may leave so the company can prevent it. Manufacturing customers meanwhile want to forecast how many units they need to make. Everyone wants to project revenue and the technology available today is “highly inaccurate,” he said. “Virtually every one of these customers that are approaching us are existing Salesforce users,” he said. Salesforce didn’t return a request for comment. Attracting more customers will also be a boon to Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure service, which is trying to narrow the gap with market leader Amazon.com Inc., and to Adobe’s Experience Cloud. The new product will run on Azure but will be able to take in data stored in other clouds. It’s a much bigger market than the traditional one for customer-relations software that Siebel started and Salesforce leads. “This is now blending what the sales person wanted and what the marketing person wanted and what the finance person wanted,” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen.(Updates with Siebel’s comment on competition with Salesforce in sixth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Microsoft Teams With Adobe and C3.ai to Take on Salesforce on Its Home Turf

Our model takes into account current levels and forecasts of bond yields, inflation, stock prices, GDP and corporate earnings. The model output is expressed in terms of standard deviations to the mean, or sigma. The mean reading from the model, going back to 1960, is a modest premium for stocks, of 0.18 sigma, with a standard deviation of 0.99. The current valuation level is 0.22 sigma premium for bonds -- and a discount for stocks. Generally, the model has done a good job of highlighting value. For example, stocks were very attractive compared to bonds in the late 1970s, when benchmark Treasury rates were in the high teens before heading consistently lower over recent decades. The model indicated that stocks were at a sharp premium to fair value prior to the &quot;dot-com&quot; crash of 2001 and at a premium prior to the Great Recession in 2007-2009. Starting in 2009, the model favored stocks -- another good call. As the chart shows, the market can manage with premiums and discounts for an extended time.

The deal will add to Adobe's offerings to business-to-business and business-to-consumer operations, according to a statement from the company.",Adobe Buying Workfront for $1.5 Billion
2020-11-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. said it will acquire Workfront Inc. for $1.5 billion to add a collaboration tool to its marketing software, providing expanded offerings during a pandemic that has forced companies to maintain productivity while employees work from home.The deal is expected to close sometime from December to February 2021, San Jose, California-based Adobe said Monday in a statement. Workfront, based in Lehi, Utah, will take its 3,000 corporate customers and 1 million users to the software maker best known for Photoshop. Bloomberg earlier reported that the acquisition could come as soon as Monday.Adobe has been a leader in the graphics and visual software industry for decades, but hasn’t offered collaboration tools. The company’s shares, which have climbed 43% this year, declined 4.8% to $471.14 at the close in New York.After recent stumbles, the acquisition is Adobe’s biggest effort to reorient its Experience Cloud division, which includes marketing, advertising and analytics software, toward areas that are growing. The company has sought to make its creative and business applications more collaborative, so that teams can more easily work together on projects. During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have found it essential to have better communication among colleagues working remotely. Adobe has curtailed some of its advertising services that had a low profit margin and said it had a new strategy of catering to customers that use multiple Experience Cloud tools.Unlike other makers of work productivity tools, including Asana Inc. and Atlassian Inc., which owns Trello, Workfront is focused on marketers, who use the software every day to “manage content, plan and track marketing campaigns and execute complex workflows across teams,” Adobe said in the statement. Marketers are also major clients for Adobe, which already integrates several of its products with Workfront’s offering.Workfront will be Adobe’s fifth-biggest acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The purchase marks the first major action by Anil Chakravarthy, an executive vice president, who joined Adobe in January after serving as chief executive officer of Informatica LLC. Chakravarthy said in an interview that Adobe and Workfront have more than 1,000 mutual clients.“Every customer that we talk to is investing more and more in digital marketing,” he said. “They want to get more efficiency out of digital marketing efforts. They want to get more agility and speed into their digital marketing efforts. As the investments grow the amount of work involved in marketing, is growing exponentially and they really need a system to be able to manage work so they get the right efficiency, productivity and collaboration across their teams.”Workfront has seen interest in its software increase during the pandemic as marketing companies seek to get more insight into which employees are working on what part of a project, Alex Shootman, Workfront’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. The Adobe acquisition, he said, is an “awesome outcome.”“When you have an opportunity to work with the company that CMOs rely on to run their business, which is Adobe, and you’re a company like Workfront, that takes us forward years in terms of what we would have been able to accomplish on our own,” Shootman said.Shootman will continue to run the Workfront team and will report to Chakravarthy when the acquisition is completed.Workfront has raised about $100 million to date, according to PitchBook. Last year, W Capital Partners, Susquehanna Growth Equity and AllianceBernstein’s AB Private Credit Investors acquired a minority stake in the company after buying out some of its investors for $280 million. It’s also backed by OpenView, Greenspring Associates and JMI Equity.The company, formerly known as AtTask, was founded in 2001 by Scott Johnson, who is now its chairman.

2020-11-10,"Adobe has entered into a definitive agreement to snap up Workfront, a work management platform for marketers, in a deal worth $1.5 billion.The move comes as Adobe (ADBE) is expanding its creative software tools through digital offerings like Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud, to meet the demand for remote work collaboration solutions exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.The acquisition gives Adobe more online marketing tools for Adobe Experience Cloud, which provides products related to marketing and analytics and is used by students, social media influencers, photographers, filmmakers, and designers, among others.Founded back in 2001, Workfront, which has more than 3,000 customers and 1 million users, facilitates businesses to efficiently manage content, plan and track marketing campaigns, and execute complex workflows across teams.“Adobe is the undisputed leader in content creation, management, delivery, and measurement and a trusted partner to digital leaders around the globe,” said Adobe’s Anil Chakravarthy. “The combination of Adobe and Workfront will further accelerate Adobe’s leadership in customer experience management, providing a pioneering solution that spans the entire lifecycle of digital experiences, from ideation to activation.”The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the first quarter of Adobe’s 2021 fiscal year.Adobe and Workfront already share a longstanding partnership with product synergies and a growing base of over 1,000 shared customers. Shared Adobe and Workfront customers include Deloitte, Under Armour, Nordstrom, Prudential Financial, T-Mobile, and The Home Depot. Workfront is equipped with APIs that enable a seamless connection to Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud.For the current fiscal fourth quarter, the company projects sales of $3.35 billion, almost in line with the $3.36 billion Street consensus, and adjusted earnings of $2.64 per share. Adobe expects digital media segment revenue to increase by 18% in the quarter ending in November, which is above the 16% forecasted by analysts.  (See ADBE stock analysis on TipRanks)Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz recently raised the stock’s price target to $550 (17% upside potential) from $430 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that the company’s conservative F4Q estimates reinforce his view that ADBE should be a core investment holding.“Adobe stands out from almost any group as the pioneering trailblazer of digital creative and marketing tools and services, and the company has transitioned and progressed into a verifiable cloud platform success story as it rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale, profits, and growth trajectory,” Schwartz wrote in a note to investors. “Adobe is highly profitable, unlike most of the other names in our SaaS/Applications universe, and this characteristic provides a unique level of valuation support versus company peers.”The rest of the Street shares Schwartz’s bullish outlook. The Strong Buy analyst consensus boasts 15 Buys versus 3 Holds. Despite this year’s 43% share rally, the $559.83 average price target implies upside potential of an additional 19% to current levels.Related News:   General Motors Embarks On Hiring Spree For EV Bonanza; Street Bullish   Nikola Says Partnership Talks With GM On Track; Shares Gain   Alibaba, Richemont To Invest $1.1B In Farfetch For China Push; Stock Up 323% YTD More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Beyond Meat, Pizza Hut Join Forces To Launch Plant-Based Meat Pizza   * Repay’s 2020 Sales Outlook Misses The Street; BTIG Sticks To Buy   * Sprout Social's 2020 Outlook Surprises; Stock Up 173% YTD   * Amgen, AstraZeneca Deliver Positive Results For Late-Stage Severe Asthma Trial",Adobe Inks $1.5B Deal To Buy Workfront; Street Bullish

2020-11-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is doling out hiring bonuses as high as $3,000 to make sure it has enough people to squeak through the busy holiday shopping season. That’s stoking resentment among existing workers who recently got coupons for Thanksgiving turkeys as a thank you for their hard work.Social-media chatrooms where Amazon workers congregate have lit up. One worker shared a photo of a $15 turkey voucher, prompting others to boast they received coupons for $20 or $25, while others lamented that they got nothing. When a worker in Alabama said his warehouse got $10 vouchers, colleagues joked that it was barely enough to buy a turkey leg. Others mordantly counseled fellow workers to look on the bright side—at least the turkey vouchers were tax-free, unlike the bonuses.Amazon’s willingness to risk dissension in the ranks reflects a dawning reality: Many Americans are reluctant to re-enter the workforce, despite a national unemployment rate of 6.9%, double the pre-pandemic level. Searches for seasonal work dropped 25% from 2019, according to job site Indeed.com. Partly that’s because some workers still receive unemployment benefits. Partly it’s because they’re afraid of catching Covid-19. To help avoid delivery delays during what’s already shaping up to be a blockbuster holiday season, the world’s largest online retailer has decided to throw people at the problem, even if it ends up with too many workers. So a few weeks ago, Amazon began dangling signing bonuses. The sums depend on where the recruits live: $3,000 at some facilities in California and Illinois, $2,000 in Maryland and Massachusetts and $1,500 at many other facilities around the country.“People who in the past might be thinking about picking up some money moonlighting with a part-time job are now thinking about the Covid-19 risk,” said Peter Cappelli, a management professor and director of the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “Many people without jobs still expect to be recalled, so they are having the same thought, whether picking up a short-term job is worth the risk. That’s why it is harder to find people even with the high rates of joblessness.”Amazon didn’t address Bloomberg’s queries about staff concerns. The company offers workers a minimum of $15 an hour, health and retirement benefits, job training and opportunities for career growth, Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said. “We encourage anyone to compare our overall pay, benefits, and workplace environment to other retailers and major employers across the country,” she said.When the outbreak struck the U.S. earlier this year, Amazon was overwhelmed by a spike in orders as Americans avoided physical stores. To get deliveries back on track and entice fearful workers to show up, the company offered temporary pay raises of $2 per hour as well as unlimited unpaid time off, no questions asked. Amazon also hired 250,000 workers to keep its operation running smoothly and will spend more than $10 billion this year fighting Covid in its warehouses.Warehouse ProtestsIn June, with Amazon’s stuttering delivery machine regaining momentum, the company ended the pandemic raises and began forcing workers to justify requests for time off. The decision was poorly received in the warehouses, which have been roiled this year by protests. On Monday workers in Alabama filed a petition with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board to form a union. With enough support, the petition will proceed to a vote among those working at the warehouse outside Birmingham on whether to unionize and be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Some Amazon warehouse workers in Europe are union members, but the company’s U.S. workforce isn’t unionized.Meanwhile, with Covid-19 cases resurging across the country, many workers believe it’s time their employer brought back the temporary raises, which many equate to danger pay.That’s why receiving turkey coupons, when newbies are getting bonuses, rankles so much. Some workers see the Butterball-branded vouchers as a slap in the face when they’ve toiled through the pandemic, helping to push the stock and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos’s wealth to record highs. The net worth of the world’s wealthiest man has surged more than $67 billion this year to $182.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s index.“If one worker gets a turkey and another worker gets $3,000, it’s the ultimate insult in compensation,” said Fred Whittlesey, a compensation expert and former Amazon employee “People constantly compare. It doesn’t matter if it’s money, a turkey or a share of stock. If someone got something I didn’t get, it immediately creates resentment.”A California warehouse worker, who requested anonymity to avoid angering his employer, said a smiling human-resources representative handed him a $15 turkey voucher at the end of his shift.  He used it to buy carne asada. “I was going to put it in the bank because it looked like a check, but it was a grocery voucher you couldn't redeem for cash,” the worker said. “They usually give us a few pieces of turkey and an extra 15 minutes for lunch break, but they can’t this year because of social distancing.”‘Bills to Pay’Warehouse workers get regular notices from Amazon that coworkers have contracted the virus, he adds, but most people keep reporting to work “because they have bills to pay. It would be nice to get paid a little more with all this stuff going on.”Amazon typically tries to foster a holiday atmosphere by encouraging workers to wear Santa hats and Christmas socks. Social media posts of employees smiling and embracing one another are used to lure new recruits. That’s impossible now given social distancing requirements. And while some workers still receive turkey dinners, according to one worker, this year they’re in to-go containers that people take to their cars. Amazon has been a primary beneficiary of the pandemic since so many businesses closed during lockdowns and many Americans prefer shopping online to the risk of visiting stores that remain open.With Covid-19 cases spiking anew and governments implementing precautionary restrictions, Amazon’s momentum is expected to carry  it through the holiday. U.S. shoppers will spend $189 billion online in November and December, up 33% from a year ago, according to Adobe Inc. Amazon gets nearly 40 cents of every dollar spent online, according to EMarketer Inc., making it the biggest beneficiary. Amazon’s advantage over other retailers grows late in the holiday season thanks to its reputation for prompt delivery.The company is erring on the side of caution by overstaffing its facilities, according to workers in multiple states. They often end up standing around waiting for a place to work due to social-distancing measures, they said, and are sometimes asked to take voluntary time off just 30 minutes into a shift if too many people have showed up. A worker in South Carolina said Amazon usually has two workers unloading trucks, one on each side of a conveyor that extends into the trailer. But due to social-distancing requirements, only one worker can be in the trailer at a time, creating significant delays. Employees in California, New York and Pennsylvania relayed similar accounts of idle workers and Amazon asking if they want to go home soon after their shifts begin.The company expects to spend $4 billion in the current period on Covid-related safety measures. Beyond masks, cleaning supplies and temperature checks, much of that expense owes to lost productivity as  employees take longer breaks and distance themselves from colleagues. The investment could pay off for Amazon if it retains workers as Christmas approaches.“As things get worse and worse, people aren’t going to want to come in to work,” said Kristen Gall, President of Rakuten Rewards, an e-commerce cash-back platform with more than 2,500 retail partners. “Amazon will be able beat competitors if it convinces wary workers, but it’s going to be really expensive.”(Updated in ninth paragraph with worker petition to form union in Alabama. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon’s $3,000 Signing Bonuses Irk Workers Who Got $10 Coupons"

2020-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud-computing division suffered an outage on Wednesday that affected several customers, including Roku Inc. and Adobe Inc.Amazon Web Services’s status page noted that its Kinesis data streaming service was “currently impaired” in the company’s U.S. East 1 region. The outages were also making it harder to post updates to a closely watched status page, the company said.The failure affected the ability of customers to use roughly two dozen services, hitting streaming hardware maker Roku, software seller Adobe and digital photo service Flickr.“Kinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that’s impacted some other AWS services,” a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “We are working toward resolution.”AWS is the largest provider of rented computing power and software services, and its data centers serve as the invisible foundation of much of the internet. That gives failures in its services an immediate visibility that rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google sometimes don’t face.AWS is a collection of more than 175 software services, from data storage to a range of databases and machine-learning software. Customers often use more than one, linking them together in ways that can cause a failure in one system to cascade across multiple programs.The Seattle-based company operates those services from 24 regions, or clusters of data centers, geographic redundancy designed to station computing power close to customers while limiting the chance that a failure in any single region will result in permanent loss of data. U.S. East-1, which relies on data centers clustered in northern Virginia, is among AWS’s most important regions, analysts say.Kinesis Data Streams, the service at the root of Wednesday’s outage, captures and performs analytics on data, including social media feeds, dumps of public records and internal application usage logs, which can be then be fed into a variety of other software programs.Jaspreet Singh, chief executive officer of Druva Inc., a data backup and disaster recovery software maker that uses AWS services, said his engineers first noticed the outage early Wednesday morning when the flow of notifications from an AWS data monitoring service were disrupted.While the outage didn’t completely sever access to a critical AWS service, it seemed to touch more products than previous outages, Singh said.“Typically what tends to happen is one service goes down” for a half hour or so, he said. “This is a different kind of issue. It’s bigger. Things are failing internally.”(Updates with detail on AWS and quote from AWS customer, beginning in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Amazon Cloud Outage Hits Customers Including Roku, Adobe"

2020-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. merchants around the U.S. say some products that normally reach customers in one or two days are now taking a week or longer just as the world’s largest online retailer heads into what’s expected to be a record-busting holiday shopping season.Seven merchants and consultants from California, Texas, Wisconsin and Florida said they had to ship products ordinarily handled by Amazon’s logistics service -- which is typically faster and cheaper. To the sellers, that suggests the company’s warehouses and delivery stations are at full capacity.The development, which began over the weekend and continued this week, worries the merchants because web shopping will peak in the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, the biggest online spending day of the year. Their experience was echoed by more than a dozen additional sellers in merchant chat rooms viewed by Bloomberg.Amazon continues to deliver most products in one or two days through its logistics service, the merchants said. But because the company has issued no warning or explanation, they said it’s hard to figure out if any specific product categories are being affected or whether the shift is happening more in some regions than others.One seller said Amazon seems to be prioritizing best-selling products for its own delivery system and letting merchants handle less popular items, echoing what happened earlier this year when Amazon was overwhelmed by panicked shoppers stuck at home when Covid-19 first swept the country.In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesman said a few anecdotes from merchants don’t necessarily add up to a broader problem. “We have not changed how offers are presented to customers to shift volume from Amazon fulfillment to seller fulfillment,” he said. “As always, product offers continue to compete to be the featured offer based on a variety of factors, including lowest price, availability, fastest delivery speed and best seller performance.”U.S. shoppers will spend $189 billion in November and December, up 33% from a year earlier and more than double the usual pace of growth, according to Adobe Inc. Amazon captures about 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., meaning the company is under enormous pressure to keep customers happy. Amazon shipping times averaged a little more than two days during the week of Nov. 2, when consumers took a break from shopping for the election, according to the most recent data from Rakuten Intelligence.Amazon has rushed to increase capacity since the pandemic hit -- hiring 250,000 workers and spending billions on new warehouses and delivery stations. To ensure it has enough people to pick, pack and ship orders, the company has been offering signing bonuses of as much as $3,000 to new hires.Even so, the merchants said, it appears Amazon is struggling to keep up.Molson Hart, who sells stuffed animals and games on Amazon, said about 70% of his inventory is being delayed as much as one week. Amazon is prioritizing the most in-demand products for fast delivery while slower-selling products are subject to delays, he said.“We can expect even longer delays and delivery disruptions come next week, when shipping volumes rise as much as five times,” Hart said. “The past couple of years, consumers grew accustomed to ordering products as late as December 20th and having them delivered before Christmas. That is not likely to happen this year.”One Amazon merchant said Amazon typically packs and ships almost all of his orders. But over the weekend, he was required to ship two types of product himself, including a power tool, even though Amazon had the merchandise in its warehouses. Another seller in Wisconsin, who sells flasks and tumblers, said he had to ship orders to customers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Georgia over the past few days. The two sellers spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from Amazon.“There’s no rhyme or reason to the geography of the customer,” the Wisconsin merchant said. “If Amazon has any weaknesses, this weekend will show them more than any other.”Online shoppers have come roaring back after an Election Day lull. Spending from Nov. 21 to Nov. 23 surged 49%, according to Adobe, putting a strain on delivery capacity. In recent weeks, Amazon’s marketing team has been exhorting customers to shop early in an effort to prevent a deluge of orders from overwhelming the company’s delivery operations.Chad Rubin, whose software company Skubana helps merchants sell products on multiple platforms, said Amazon shifting sales outside of its own network has a positive side. Too many Amazon merchants were too dependent on the company, he said, and were caught flat-footed in the early days of the pandemic when Amazon delayed delivery of their products. That prompted many merchants to develop their own delivery capacity, which will help Amazon get through the first pandemic holiday, he said.”Amazon is going to be just fine,” he said. “Their biggest merchants can let Amazon handle delivery or do it themselves, so it’s diversified. Not everything will arrive in two days. That’s the only downside.”Shoppers will tolerate delivery delays over the Thanksgiving weekend, which will give Amazon flexibility, but the pressure will intensify in the week before Christmas when other delivery carriers like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. no longer guarantee delivery by Dec. 25, said James Thomson, a former Amazonian who helps merchants sell products on the site through his consulting firm Buy Box Experts.“We expect sales to be insane December 15 to 24,” Thomson said, adding that customers will flock to Amazon because they’ve come to see it as the online retailer that can reliably ensure delivery in time for Christmas.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Merchants Say Deliveries of Some Products Are Delayed

What do these four companies have in common … besides absolutely massive gains?
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE)
They’re all well-known tech giants worth a ton of money, from Oracle’s $173 billion valuation to Microsoft’s $1.6 trillion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But there’s another more important answer that’s key to understanding a new opportunity that could match or even exceed those gains …
The most important thing those four companies have in common is that they are software companies.
If you know anything about software, you know it’s one of the greatest wealth generators of the past 50 years.
Investing with Bill Gates’ Microsoft in 1986 — just before the world went wild for its productivity enhancing software — led to shares skyrocketing 210,900%.

That’s enough to turn every $10,000 invested into more than $21 million.
An early stake in software innovator Larry Ellison’s Oracle in 1990 — just before the business’ software was adopted by thousands of companies — led to shares skyrocketing 93,533%.
Salesforce has become one of the world’s leading business software companies, and its shares have returned more than 6,000% since its IPO in 2004.
And Adobe Systems, the hugely popular software company, has returned more than 270,000%+ since 1986. Extraordinary.
This software connection is critical because  investing right now in select “altcoins” — cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin — is like investing early in these software companies.
The single most expensive belief out there might be that altcoins are “fantasy internet money.”
They are not.
Altcoins are investments in blockchain projects that make our lives easier, more productive, and more efficient.
These companies are laying the groundwork for an entirely new world. Buying an altcoin is like buying an early stake in the software programs that made the internet so revolutionary!
In fact, John Bates, director of product management for Adobe, says blockchain is “on par with technology like personal computers and the internet.”
Thinking of cryptocurrencies as traditional currencies could be the costliest mistake investors make. So please, ignore much of what you hear about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology they are built on.
Instead, focus on these two facts that matter most:
Fact #1: The blockchain is the next transformational technology platform.
Everything will soon use blockchain technology as it becomes the new internet. It will completely rewrite how business is done and personal fortunes are built in the modern age.
Fact #2: The only way you can have direct ownership in this groundbreaking technology is through altcoins.
Blockchain technology is going to destroy the middleman and revolutionize the way you bank, shop, travel, heat your home, and so much more.
Think of altcoins as revolutionary new software programs that will unleash tsunamis of productivity … and profits.
There are all kinds of amazing altcoins already making the world a better place. The best opportunities are in those harnessing blockchain technology to improve a massive issue.
Like MediBloc, a blockchain company that is shaking up the nearly $12 trillion global healthcare industry. It’s rewriting the way our personal information is stored and shared across numerous healthcare and insurance companies.
This will save you a lot of time and money. No more writing down your medical information every time you go to the hospital or a new doctor.
But it’s about so much more than convenience. It’s also about security. MediBloc allows you to completely control your own information. You choose who can see it and who can’t. That’s hugely important because it’s estimated that by 2024, everyone in the U.S. will have had their healthcare data compromised. Everyone!
Whether you realize it yet or not, MediBloc is on the frontlines fighting on behalf of you and your loved ones to keep your most sensitive data safe and secure.
Because of the incredible work it’s doing, the altcoin was up an amazing 754% at one point.

Blockchain technology will have a greater influence on our daily lives in ways you never would’ve guessed.
This technology will disrupt every single industry.
All this disruption and change is creating a once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity for those who get in early.
The only way to join the blockchain revolution is to own altcoins.
When people wake up to the fact that altcoins aren’t fantasy internet money — or a wannabe version of bitcoin — there will be an enormous rush into this asset class.
Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem and I call this “The Awakening,” and it will lead to mainstream acceptance of altcoins as a serious investment vehicle.
This awakening is lighting a fuse under the altcoin market, one that I expect will set off a huge explosion of wealth.
We may be seeing the beginnings of that right now. Just this past week, altcoins perked up as investors started pouring money into these smaller cryptocurrencies.
To claim some of that wealth for yourself, you must first understand what altcoins really are — not what most people think they are. They are revolutionary software programs built on a transformational technology platform that will change our world.
And they can change your financial situation, too.

2020-12-01,"Sales climbed to a record-setting $10.8 billion, marking the biggest online shopping day ever in the U.S.  Adobe's data tracks e-commerce transactions from 80 of the top 100 online retailers in the U.S. to arrive at its conclusions.  Curbside pickup on Cyber Monday jumped 30% versus last year.",Cyber Monday Sales Hit a Record $10.8 Billion
2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Online shoppers in the U.S. spent $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday, missing Adobe Inc.’s original projection by almost $2 billion, evidence that retailers pulled sales forward by offering deals earlier than usual.Still, the gusher of online spending was a record, rising 15% from 2019.“Cyber Monday continued to dominate the holiday shopping season, becoming the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, despite early discounts from retailers,” Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. “Throughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays.”Hot sellers included toys such as Lego sets and scooters, video games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and electronics including Apple AirPods, Hewlett Packard & Dell Computers and Chromecast, Adobe said.The pandemic-fueled stampede online was a valuable opportunity for retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy Co., which had been preparing for the 2020 holiday deluge for months. There were occasional hiccups, but the industry’s investments in delivery capacity and parking lot pickup helped get it through the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday.Black Friday spending of $9 billion also missed Adobe’s forecast of $10.3 billion, another sign of cautious consumer spending during the pandemic and shoppers reacting to deals earlier in the holiday season. Amazon vacuumed up $1 of every $5 spent over the Black Friday weekend, the first time the Seattle-based giant accounted for the highest share of spending for the period, according to market research firm Numerator.But Cyber Monday will likely still be the peak, because many shoppers are conditioned to hold off on big purchases in anticipation of price cuts.Cyber Monday deals mostly weren’t much better than Black Friday deals, said Kristin McGrath, editor at BlackFriday.com, which monitors web deals. Harkening back to traditional door-buster Black Friday tactics, many digital shops are likely to offer eye-popping discounts on popular products that usually sell out quickly to attract people to their site, hoping they linger and load up shopping carts with other things.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Cyber Monday Shoppers Spent $10.8 Billion, Missing Projection"

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for the earnings announcement.Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Adobe reporting earnings of $2.66 per share on revenue of $3.36 billion. Adobe reported a profit of $2.29 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $2.99 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on ADBEThe Wall Street estimate would represent a 16.16% increase in the company's earnings. Sales would be up 12.3% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2019  EPS Estimate 2.41 2.33 2.23 2.26  EPS Actual 2.57 2.45 2.27 2.29  Revenue Estimate 3.16 B 3.16 B 3.05 B 2.97 B  Revenue Actual 3.23 B 3.13 B 3.09 B 2.99 B  Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares of Adobe are up 60.39%.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2020-12-11,"Despite a troubled macroeconomic surrounding, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) topped both top- and bottom-line estimates in its fourth-quarter results as well as guided higher for the undergoing quarter and fiscal year 2021. The pandemic has underscored the ongoing importance of digital-collaboration tools such as videoconferencing by Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM), teamwork through Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Teams and Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK) and of course, Adobe Spark offering a wide range of design and media-creation applications. Adobe's blistering quarterly performance illustrates a digital media business that is firing on all cylinders with its shares up 45% this year, while announcing additional $15 billion in buyback authorization.Q4 EarningsFor its fiscal fourth quarter ended November 27th, Adobe achieved record quarterly revenue of $3.42 billion, up 14% YoY from $3 billion a year ago. Net income was $2.25 billion, or $4.64 a share, rising from $852 million, or $1.74 a share from last year's comparable quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.81, rising from last year's $2.29 or more precisely, 23% YoY. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $2.66 a share on revenue of $3.36 billion. The results confirm the remarkable the resiliency of Adobe's business, in addition to its ability to derive and react on insights from real-time data, as its Chief Financial Officer John Murphy told MarketWatch.As a testament to its operational excellence, cashflows from operations were $1.78 billion, achieving yet another record as Adobe and Microsoft have gone for a piece of the customer relationship management pie which has historically been Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) domain. Adobe also offers e-signature software which is DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) territory, as it boasts over a half million paying customers. But with its $200 billion market cap, Adobe is a much larger company than DocuSign which is valued at $40.9 billion.Stock drops despite earnings beat Adobe's Digital Experience business that includes the company's marketing software and services saw revenue rise 10% to $877 million in the reported quarter. The company's Digital Media business, that includes Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses, grew 20% YoY in the fourth quarter to $2.5 billion in revenue. While these businesses are doing great, Advertising Cloud is experiencing headwinds as it continues to wind down its transaction-driven ad network business. The San Jose, California-based company stock posted an all-time high in early September but saw its stock drop 1% in pre-market trading. But an earnings or revenue beat or miss may not the sole reason for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks lose ground despite an earnings beat simply because certain factors disappointed investors. Likewise, unforeseen catalysts can help stocks gain despite an earnings miss. There was nothing gloomy amid Adobe's just-ended fiscal 2020 in which earnings were an adjusted $10.10 a share on record annual revenue of $12.87 billion which marks a 15% YoY growth.Outlook For fiscal 2021, Adobe expects adjusted earnings of $11.20 a share on $15.15 billion in revenues, topping both $11.17 and $14.78 billion that Wall Street had predicted. This positive outlook hasn't been solely fuelled by the pandemic that accelerated the adoption of digital frameworks as Adobe has already enjoyed many years of revenue growth long before the pandemic thanks to its successful SaaS business model.View more earnings on ADBEThis article is not a press release and is contributed by IAMNewswire.

2020-12-18,"A stock buyback isn’t always the best way to maximize value for investors. It’s usually not the best capital allocation for growth stocks. But, for a mature company with ample cash flow, it can be one of the best ways to move the needle.
How so? By reducing the amount of outstanding shares, a company can increase its earnings-per-share (EPS) numbers. In turn, this can help boost its stock price, even if underlying profits do not increase year-over-year.
Sure, this act of financial engineering isn’t always a booster-shot for stocks. As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth detailed earlier this year, stock buybacks can backfire. But, you can spot many of these poorly-done buybacks a mile away. The worst performing buybacks have been in capital-intensive industries (like airlines). Borrowing heavily to finance repurchases, these companies were caught in a bind as headwinds affected their business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
For companies in stable industries, using earnings to finance repurchases, it can produce much better outcomes. These buybacks can return wealth to investors, without affecting the underlying business.
7 Growth Stocks You Don’t Want to Sleep On
What are some recent examples? These three major companies recently announced new stock buyback programs. Yes, all three are at or near all-time highs. But, their respective repurchasing plans could help each one continue to move the needle:

Like with other big tech names, the novel coronavirus was a tailwind for this leading software provider. But, after rallying in the wake of the “stay-at-home” economy, investors recently cooled on ADBE stock. Even after it exceeded expectations with recent quarterly earnings release.
For the quarter ending Nov. 30, the company beat on sales estimates. Not only that, EPS came in at $2.81 per share, versus Wall Street consensus of $2.66 per share. Yet, while investors have taken their feet off the gas, there’s something on the table that could help send shares higher in the coming years. I’m talking about its newly-announced share repurchase program.
This plan calls for $15 billion in repurchases through 2024. This comes as the company’s prior $8 billion repurchasing plan starts to wrap-up. With more than $5 billion per year in operating cash flow, and around $6 billion in cash, Adobe has more than enough to finance this aggressive buyback program.
At today’s prices, $15 billion in buybacks represents about 6.6% of the company’s outstanding shares. While it’s no game-changer, it could help bolster returns for ADBE stock in the coming years. Especially if the company continues to deliver double-digit earnings growth.

But, despite these challenges, AN stock crushed it in 2020. Even with March’s coronavirus crash, shares are up around 37.6% year-to-date. And, following October’s announced $500 million stock repurchase plan (representing around 8.5% of outstanding shares), the company could generate additional wealth for its shareholders.
Like with Adobe, this big buyback announcement came on the heels of a strong quarter. Beating consensus on earnings, both AutoNation’s new and used car sales numbers exceeded expectations.
7 Growth Stocks You Don’t Want to Sleep On
And, with the company not expected to deliver earnings growth in 2021, returning earnings to shareholders via a buyback may be the best way for it to put more points in AN stock. Sure, if the unexpected used car market strength in the time of Covid-19 starts to reverse, shares could cool from here. But, with the buyback program helping to shore up EPS, investors in this stock could still see solid returns going forward.

Sure, based on what I wrote above, I shouldn’t be including this major railroad company here. The old-school industry to beat all old-school industries, a railroad is going to be much more capital intensive than say, a SaaS business.
But, even with this and pandemic headwinds in mind, the $5 billion stock buyback program could help shore up shares. This new program is on top of the $1.1 billion remaining in the prior CSX stock repurchase program. Add them together, and that’s $6.1 billion available for repurchases, or around 8.8% of outstanding shares.
With shares changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25, valuation could be a concern here. Granted, its peers trade at similar (or higher) valuations. But, while most on the sell-side remain bullish, analysts at Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the stock, giving it a $60 per share price target (CSX trades for around $90 per share today). Valuation was the main rationale behind their decision.
Consider taking a wait-and-see approach for now, but keep CSX stock (and its massive buyback plans) on your radar in 2021.

Back in July, I recommended seven of the best stocks to buy for 2021 and beyond. As a group, they’ve done very well over the past three months. For instance, Livongo Health was acquired by Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) on Oct. 30 for $11.33 per share in cash and 0.592 times shares in Teladoc. 
But looking for a bit of a twist on my stock selection process, I’ve decided that this list will be based on the first letter of all 12 months. That means my stock pick for January will have a corporate name beginning with J, then an F for February and so forth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021				

All 12 will also have a market capitalization of $2 billion or more and positive free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. By this time next year, I’m confident that my picks, on the whole, won’t disappoint.
So, without further ado, here are my 12 best stocks for a brand new year:
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 
Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) 
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) 
MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) 
Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI)
Jeld-Wen Holding (NYSE:JELD)
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB)
Otis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)
Dollar General (NYSE:DG)

Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson represents the month of January on my list of best stocks to buy for 2021. Right now, it’s having a sideways kind of year in the markets. Its year-to-date (YTD) total return through Dec. 4 is just 2.6%. 
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow (FCF) of $18.3 billion and a current enterprise value (EV) of over $399 billion, JNJ’s FCF yield is a reasonable 4.7%. It might not be value territory — I consider anything above 8% to be cheap — but it’s pretty darn good. 
As InvestorPlace colleague Faisal Humayun recently stated, JNJ stock has an excellent product offering. 
“From a business perspective, the company provides diversified exposure to the segments of consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices,” Humayun wrote. “The company’s pharmaceutical segment growth for Q3 2020 was impressive with most therapeutic areas delivering strong numbers.”
Not to mention, JNJ is still very much in the Covid-19 vaccine race. That suggests that 2021 could be a breakout year for this Dividend Aristocrat.  

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)

Next on my list of best stocks to buy is Fidelity National Information Services, representing the month of February. This payment processor is having an underwhelming year relative to the U.S. markets as a whole. It sits just a fraction lower than it did this time last year. 
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.57 billion and an enterprise value of $109.75 billion, though, Fidelity National’s FCF yield is very decent at 3.8%.
You won’t find a lot of commentary from InvestorPlace contributors on this stock, despite the fact it does have a part to play in the technology side of the financial services industry.

However, on Nov. 19, the Florida-based company announced that it earned the top spot for the sixth consecutive year in a ranking of 100 leading providers of risk and compliance technology. 
Additionally, while Covid-19 has slowed the rate at which FIS can process transactions, it still has managed to generate organic revenue growth during its third quarter of 1% to about $3.2 billion. The company also increased adjusted net income by 18% to $887 million.
So, this is not a glamorous stock but its services are certainly in demand. 

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com
	
To represent March for the coming year, I’ve picked the golden arches of MCD stock. Like many of the names on this list, McDonald’s has an okay year going, up around 7% YTD. That’s better than many of its restaurant peers, but it’s trailing the U.S. markets as a whole.  
Thanks to Covid-19 shutdowns, McDonald’s trailing 12-month free cash flow isn’t nearly as strong as it usually is, now at $4.25 billion. Currently, the industry leader has an FCF yield of 2.7% based on an enterprise value of about $205 billion. 
Despite operating in one of the hardest-hit industries, McDonald’s has continued to look beyond the novel coronavirus, continually finding ways to transform its business without upsetting the core customer. 
For instance, the company recently gave Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) the cold shoulder by announcing it would be testing a line of meatless alternatives in 2021, including the McPlant burger. Interestingly — despite developing the plant-based burger with Beyond Meat’s input — the fast-food company decided to go its own way. 
The decision to go on its own was a result of two reasons. First, MCD didn’t want to alienate its meat-loving customers. Secondly, it’s not a fan of letting licensees and other brands into its house. Beyond Meat would have surely taken some shine off of the Golden Arches. 
McDonald’s has had a tough time, but it always bounces back. That makes it one of the best stocks to buy for the upcoming year.

Adobe (ADBE)

Adobe, the mastermind behind the PDF and so much more, is my pick for the month of April. It’s having an excellent year in the markets right now, with a YTD total return of over 47%. 
That’s considerably better than both its software peers and the U.S. markets as a whole, making it one of the best stocks to buy right now.  
Adobe’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $4.9 billion, while its enterprise value is nearly $232 billion for an FCF yield of 2.1%. Both its enterprise value and EV-EBITDA multiple have also risen dramatically in the past five years.

In 2016, the company had an enterprise value of $48 billion and an EV-EBITDA of 26.1. Presently, the stock has an EV-EBITDA multiple of 48.3.
In early February, I said ADBE stock was all but certain to hit $400 in 2020. It did and then some. Moving forward, I think it’s all but certain to hit perhaps $600 in 2021.  

MercadoLibre (MELI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
	
MercadoLibre is sometimes referred to as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America, although it more closely resembles Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). For my list of best stocks to buy in 2021, it represents the month of May. 
Currently, MELI stock is having a fantastic year in the markets with a YTD total return of nearly 200%. Like Adobe, MercadoLibre is faring far better than both its internet retail peers and U.S. markets as a whole.  
This company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $810 million, while its enterprise value is almost $76 billion for an FCF yield of 1.1%. While that might seem low, MercadoLibre’s free cash flow has never been higher. Likewise, its revenues are on fire and growing like weeds. 
True to the Amazon comparison, this name will also probably see exponential growth in its free cash flow over the next few years. 
I’ve been a fan of the company since as far back as 2013, when it was trading around $120. At the time, I argued that it had a dominant position in Latin American e-commerce and its stock would benefit from that. 
As I write this, shares are priced around $1,700 and moving higher in 2021.

Johnson Controls (JCI)
Source: Shutterstock
	
There aren’t a lot of great companies with a J as the first letter in their name. There are even fewer with strong free cash flow. Nonetheless, Johnson Controls represents the month of June on my list of best stocks to buy.
Interestingly, while it’s only generally matching the YTD performance of the U.S. markets as a whole, JCI stock is doing better in 2020 than it has in some time. Over the past five years, it’s delivered an annualized total return for shareholders of about 9.1%, well below the markets. 
However, up almost 14% over the past three months, the company appears to be gathering speed heading into 2021. 
In early November, Johnson Controls also announced its fourth-quarter results, which were excellent despite the challenging business environment. In fiscal 2020, it had sales of $22.3 billion and net income of $1.69 billion, flat to a year earlier.


					7 Biotech Stocks To Buy Beyond Covid Vaccine Plays				

That’s not bad for a company that manufactures, installs and services products designed for offices, industrial properties and other types of commercial real estate — all of which were hurt by the pandemic. 
Johnson Controls’ trailing 12-month free cash flow is nearly $1.8 billion, while its enterprise value is about $39 billion for an FCF yield of 5.3%. 
I view JCI as a nice stock for risk-averse investors who also like a little dividend income — its dividend yield is 2.28% at the moment.  

Jeld-Wen Holding (JELD)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
	
By far the smallest of the 12 names on this list, JELD stock has a market cap of $2.42 billion. This maker of windows and doors represents the month of July on my best stocks to buy list. 
Back in late January of 2017, Jeld-Wen went public at $23 a share. 
Now, though — if you bought shares in its IPO and are still holding — you’ve made almost no money on your investment. Year-to-date, it’s got a total return well below the booming returns of its building products and equipment industry peer group. Those stocks have mostly benefited from Covid-19. 
The company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $250 million, while its enterprise value is $3.8 billion for an FCF yield of 11.3%.
However, on Nov. 3, the company reported third-quarter results that were better than analyst expectations. On the top-line, revenue was $1.11 billion, $2 million higher than the consensus estimate. On the bottom line, it had adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, eight cents higher than analyst expectations. 
“Consumers’ focus on their homes, coupled with our strategy to deliver profitable market share with key customers, is driving increased demand for products in both residential new construction and repair and remodel channels,” said President and CEO Gary Michel.
As the focus remains on homes in 2021, I expect Jeld-Wen to snap out of its funk and do well.

Apple (AAPL)
Source: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com
	
For August, the famous maker of the iPhone is the next pick of this list. However, if there were a month beginning with the letter B, I’d recommend Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) because it’s a much better value play and happens to own almost 965 million shares of AAPL stock. 
Apple’s YTD total return is over 66%, which sounds rather ordinary, given its almost 30% annualized total return over the past 15 years. I’d take it every day of the week. 
As for free cash flow and enterprise value, they are almost $73.4 billion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. That’s an FCF yield of 3.5%, an excellent valuation for one of the world’s largest public companies. 
Put simply, Apple has become so much more than a maker of smartphones.

According to AppleInsider.com, Apple’s new “M1-equipped Mac mini” has jumped to the number one position in sales in the Japanese market for desktop computers — after only two weeks of availability. Further, Apple now has a 27% market share in Japan, up from roughly 13% a year earlier. 
So, I don’t think you can go wrong owning Apple over the long haul. Clearly, it’s one of the best stocks to buy for the coming year.

SVB Financial (SIVB)

Next, representing the month of September is my favorite U.S. bank. SVB Financial is the holding company that operates Silicon Valley Bank, the Santa Clara-based financial institution that focuses on entrepreneurs and innovators. 
Right now, it’s having an awesome year compared to peers in regional banking. While SIVB stock is up nearly 43% YTD, most of its peers are down. It’s also leaving the U.S. markets in the dust. That said, I won’t bother noting the free cash flow for this name because it’s not meaningful for banking institutions. Instead, the balance sheet matters most. 
SIVB reported Q3 2020 results that included earnings per share of $8.47, almost double the $4.42 per share it earned the year prior.
“We had an exceptional quarter driven by outstanding balance sheet growth, higher core fee income, strong investment banking revenue, solid credit resulting in a reduction of reserves, and outsized equity gains related to client IPO activity,” President and CEO Greg Becker, noted. “These results reflect the resilience of our markets and our ability to execute effectively.”
SIVB was on my 2013 list of the five best stocks to buy for the next 20 years, right up there with Amazon. I think you owe it to yourself to check it out in 2021.

Otis Worldwide (OTIS)
Source: rafapress/shutterstock.com
	
Back in early April, this elevator company spun off from United Technologies, which merged with Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) to become one of the world’s largest aerospace and defense companies.
While it won’t have a full 12-month track record until April, this representative for the month of October has risen 43.5% YTD, suggesting 2021 could deliver an excellent performance. 
In the trailing 12 months, Otis has a free cash flow of $1.47 billion and an enterprise value of about $33 billion. That makes for an FCF yield of 5.2%, so it’s reasonably priced. 
What’s more, the company’s third-quarter results demonstrate that it’s holding its own during the pandemic. Top-line organic sales fell 1.2% in Q3 2020 to $3.3 billion while its operating profit grew 7% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Also, operating margins increased 120 basis points to 15.4%.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

In November, Toronto-based portfolio manager Christine Poole made OTIS stock one of her three top picks on BNN Bloomberg’s Market Call, suggesting that its 17% global elevator market share makes it an excellent long-term investment with an excellent balance between sales and service, at 57% and 43% respectively.
That makes it worthy of this best stocks to buy list for 2021. Can you say recurring revenue?

NextEra Energy (NEE)
Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com
	
Recently, I recommended this Florida-based utility company because of its renewable energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, which generates almost 40% of overall earnings. I maintain that NEE stock is one of the best stocks to buy for 2021, representing the month of November on this list.
NEE stock is a thing of beauty if consistent returns are your thing. YTD, it’s up about 20%. Over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods, it has annualized total returns of 25.1%, 26.8% and 20.5%, respectively. Let’s say it’s crushing its peers over any of those periods.
NextEra’s free cash flow in the trailing 12-months is $2.1 billion, while its enterprise value is $190 billion, for an FCF yield of -3.2%. So, it’s certainly not cheap.   
But InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake made an interesting observation on Nov. 25 when he suggested that NextEra would buy another utility with its strong share price. As Hake would agree, that’s Capital Allocation 101. 
NextEra made overtures to Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Evergy (NYSE:EVRG). Both rejected the offers. However, I’m sure something will shake out soon enough. Like Hake said, a bid might come with more cash. 
What I do know for certain is that NextEra is one of North America’s best-run utilities. 

Dollar General (DG)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
Representing the final month of the year is Dollar General, the dollar-store discount chain with 17,000 locations in 46 states. It’s having another strong year, up almost 37% YTD. Combine that with a 10-year annualized total return of 20.8%, and you’ve got one heck of a long-term investment. 
As for trailing 12-month free cash flow, it has $3.1 billion, along with an enterprise value of nearly $64 billion. Right now, its FCF yield is 5.9%.
On Nov. 14, the company announced the opening of its 17,000th store in Fountain, Colorado. As a nice gesture to the community, Dollar General donated $17,000 to one of the local schools. 
“Since our founding more than 80 years ago, we have remained focused on helping customers save time and money,”CEO Todd Vasos said in the company’s press release heralding the occasion.
In my book, helping customers save time and money are the hallmarks of any successful business.
Back in November, I also recommended Dollar General as one of three stocks of relative values compared to Nio (NYSE:NIO), the Chinese electric vehicle maker. And while I like Nio long-term, it isn’t a name to buy for the short-term at current prices. DG stock is much more down-to-earth.
As long as working folk need to save money, Dollar General’s business remains a solid bet. In turn, that makes it one of the best stocks to buy going into the uncertainty of 2021.

That is how we started our write up on Disney (NYSE:DIS) last year. Little did we know just how tumultuous a year 2020 was going to be.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Yet here we are. 2020 is behind us — with DIS up more than 20% on the year — and 2021 waits on the horizon. So what do we think now?
We’re sticking with DIS as our favorite stock pick for 2021. The coronavirus pandemic proved that all of the reasons we liked the company before are even more important now.
Subscription-Based Revenue Models
Wall Street loves companies that can tap into the monthly/annual subscription model to generate revenue. Why? Because the revenue is consistent. You know it’s going to keep coming in month after month, year after year.


					Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year				

These companies operate in a variety of sectors. Here are just a few and the way they take advantage of the subscription model:
Retailers, like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)…annual membership fees
Application software providers, like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)…monthly/annual subscriptions
Media giants, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)…monthly subscriptions
DIS hasn’t always taken advantage of the subscription model to generate consistent revenue. It used to be much more reliant on big one-time product launches and movie releases. But it has been slowly building into a subscription model powerhouse during the past few years.
So how does DIS leverage the subscription model? Let’s take a look.
Disney+ and Hulu
DIS started its direct-to-consumer subscription gambit by joining the Hulu group in 2009. There were some growing pains, but Hulu ended up pummeling the subscription services most other individual networks were trying to offer.
In March 2019, DIS became the majority shareholder in Hulu when it bought many of the assets of 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, in May 2019, Comcast relinquished its remaining interest in the company to Disney.

But gaining control of Hulu wasn’t enough for Disney. It decided to take Netflix , HBO and others head-on with Disney+, and it knocked it out of the park.
After its first day of operation in November 2019, the company delighted Wall Street by announcing Disney+ had more than 10 million subscribers.
Fast forward to Dec. 10, when DIS announced it has attracted a jaw-dropping 86.8 million subscribers, and you can see why traders have pushed the stock up to new all-time highs.
And that’s just the beginning. Management believes Disney+ is going to continue adding millions of new subscribers in 2021 as the coronavirus continues to force people into socially distanced activities.
Certainly that rate of acquisition won’t last forever, but the more subscribers DIS can bring in now, the more recurring revenue it’s likely to enjoy down the road.
Movie Franchises & New Releases
The company is driving its Disney+ success by coupling the streaming service with its movie franchises and new releases.
DIS used to be in the one-and-done movie making business. Snow White had no overlap with Robin Hood, which had no overlap with The Lion King. But then the company realized it could capitalize on its own success by making movie franchises.
For example, Frozen was a smashing success so why not make Frozen II?
Everybody seemed to like Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 so why not break out of the bounds of a standard trilogy and make Toy Story 4?
Fans can’t seem to get enough of Star Wars so why not round out the third, yes third, trilogy in the series with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker?
But don’t stop there. Why not create even more spinoffs, like The Mandalorian, that will only be available on Disney+?
By combining movie franchises and new releases — like Mulan and Soul — with its Disney+ streaming service — that has everything from the Marvel movie catalog to The Simpsons on it — DIS has found the holy grail of subscription-based entertainment revenue models.

Theme Parks and Hotels
Now, it’s important to remember that DIS is trading near its all-time highs at a moment when Disneyland, and most of the company’s other theme parks, are closed. Walt Disney World in Florida is open to a reduced number of visitors, but theme park revenues are nowhere close to what they were before the coronavirus pandemic.
We expect this to change this year as the various coronavirus vaccines become available and state governments begin to ease their restrictions.
Just imagine the amount of pent-up demand there is to go see company’s new Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge area at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. In a post-pandemic world, people will be happy to pay the ever-rising prices for admission and in-park purchases.
Before the pandemic, DIS’s U.S. and international theme park and hotel business was responsible for more than 34% of the company’s revenue and 37% of the company’s earnings. If that segment of the business can bounce back to those levels in 2021, the sky’s the limit for DIS stock this year.
Bottom Line on DIS Stock
After bottoming out in March 2020, DIS began clawing its way back and eventually rocketed higher at the end of the year.
Click to EnlargeSource: Charts by TradingView
	
The stock recently broke above the up-trending resistance level it has been interacting with since early-2019. We expect this up-trending level to serve as support while DIS climbs even higher during 2020.
We anticipate DIS will break above $200 before the end of the year.

The plug-in allowed users to stream videos and play games after it was downloaded via dial-up internet. Flash was also key in helping YouTube host high-quality videos. The widespread availability of better technologies as well as the diminished use of Flash meant it was time to discontinue the service. Adobe stopped providing security updates since New Year’s Eve and will block Flash content from running on January 12, it said in a blog post. “Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems,” the company said. Since it was first released in 1996, the plug-in was hit with numerous security concerns and faced stinging criticism from the likes of former Apple boss Steve Jobs, who insisted the software would not run on the company’s devices. Other tech companies followed suit before HTML5, software that could handle all the tasks of Flash without needing to be installed, came along in 2014. HTML5 resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of Flash.

2021-01-04,"In 2020, the technology sector was hot, but many cloud computing equities were simply scintillating, a theme that's still in its early innings.What Happened: For investors that like the idea of cloud exposure, but don't like the idea of stock picking in this segment, there are three dedicated exchange traded funds to consider, all of which delivered impressive 2020 performances.To put those showings into context, the worst-performing cloud ETF gained almost 58%, but in a case of differences between ETFs that appear similar proving meaningful, the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund (NASDAQ: WCLCD) gained almost 110% last year. That's good for one of the best returns among all non-leveraged ETFs, thematic or otherwise.Why It's Important: WCLD, which debuted in September 2019, tracks the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index. The ""BVP"" stands for Bessemer Venture Partners, a firm with expertise in cloud investing and public cloud benchmarks.""Technology is increasingly driving global GDP and software is the fastest growing segment of technology,"" write Byron Deeter and Mary D'Onofrio of Bessemer.""Within software, the growth of cloud is moving at an impressive clip; it's becoming abundantly clear that cloud computing will become a majority of enterprise software by 2025, and the vast majority of all software by 2030. Simply put, cloud computing is increasingly consuming software, hardware, and services and is therefore the most exciting mega-trend in technology, making it one of the most compelling themes impacting global GDP over the coming years.""As WisdomTree points out, Bessemer coined a new investing acronym, one that could rival or supplant FAANG: MT SAAS.That's for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP).In alphabetical order, Adobe, the Dow component Salesforce, Shopify and Twilio are members of the WCLD roster.What's Next: The inclusion of those names in WCLD is relevant for myriad reasons, including revenue growth. To enter WCLD's index, new components must have revenue growth of 15% in each of the prior two fiscal years and to stay in the benchmark, a company must have a minimum of 7% top line growth in one of the past two years.And no, lacking Amazon and Microsoft exposure doesn't harm WCLD's long-term prospects.""MT SAAS is a mix of application (CRM, ADBE, SHOP) and infrastructure (MSFT, TWLO, AMZN) companies, incumbent giants (MSFT, AMZN) and hypergrowth challengers (CRM, ADBE, SHOP, TWLO), all sharing the same characteristics of cloud delivery models, cloud business models, high growth, and compelling long-term margin potential,"" notes Bessemer.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Betting On BETZ As New Year Rapidly Brings Sports Betting Consolidation Rumors  * Bitcoin Surge Renews Enthusiasm For Blockchain ETF(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-20,"Enterprises are realizing the importance of cloud computing like never before. The rapid transition to the cloud helped organizations adopt remote working and ensured that businesses were not interrupted by the pandemic-induced restrictions. Several companies offering cloud-based applications and tools experienced strong demand last year and continue to see favorable trends as enterprises are now more aware of the benefits of the cloud. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place two cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) companies, Autodesk and Adobe, alongside each other and select the stock offering a more attractive investment opportunity. Autodesk (ADSK) Autodesk offers design software and services that are extensively used in the architecture, engineering and construction, manufacturing, digital media and entertainment industries. The company’s transition in recent years from a perpetual license revenue model to a cloud-based subscription model has worked in its favor and is expected to drive profitability over the long-term. In 3Q FY21 (ended Oct.31), Autodesk experienced strong enterprise deal activity, improved subscription renewal rates, robust digital sales, and sequential improvement in new business trends. Third quarter subscription revenue increased 24% to $884 million and overall revenue was up 13% to $952 million despite demand softness in some regions. Also, adjusted EPS spiked 33.3% year-over-year to $1.04 as the operating margin expanded 300 basis points. Diving into other key metrics, recurring revenue accounted for 97% of 3Q overall revenue and net revenue retention rate was within the 100%-110% range. Current RPO (Remaining Performance Obligation), which indicates the revenue expected to be recognized in the next twelve months, came in at $2.4 billion, reflecting a 16% rise. Overall, the company ended the quarter with a total RPO of $3.6 billion (up 21%). Looking ahead, Autodesk predicts FY21 revenue growth of 15% (based on the mid-point of the guidance range) and FY22 revenue growth in the low- to-mid-teens range. (See ADSK stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 5, KeyBanc analyst Jason Celino increased the price target on Autodesk to $345 from $310 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst noted that despite the company's higher growth profile and expanding margins, it still trades at a five-turn discount to the broader industrial software average of 38 times 2022 EV(enterprise value)/free cash flow valuation multiple. Celino believes that Autodesk's market dominance in architecture, its fundamentals, and long-term growth prospects remain ""underappreciated"" and deserve a premium valuation. Overall, the consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and 2 Holds. With the stock rising about 61% over the past 52 weeks, the average price target of $319 indicates a modest upside potential of 2.6% from current levels. Adobe (ADBE) Adobe is one of the most diversified software companies, which caters to the requirements of students to large corporations, with several applications under its Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products. The shift towards all things digital has increased the importance of Adobe’s products and solutions. Amid a favorable business environment, Adobe is well-positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities across its key businesses. The company expects its total addressable market for Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud to increase to about $41 billion, $21 billion and $85 billion, respectively, in 2023. (See ADBE stock analysis on TipRanks) In FY20 (ended Nov. 27, 2020), Adobe’s revenue grew 15% to about $13 billion, with subscription revenue rising 21% to $11.6 billion. Specifically, revenue from the company’s largest segment—Digital Media (which includes Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings) rose 20% to $9.2 billion, due to increased digital engagement amid the work-from-home environment. Meanwhile, revenue from the Digital Experience segment grew 12% to $3.13 billion, while revenue from the Publishing and Advertising segment was down 24% to $510 million. All in all, strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion fueled a 28% gain in FY20 adjusted EPS to $10.10. The company ended FY20 with Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO of $11.3 billion, implying a 15% increase driven by new contracts and renewals in the Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings. Turning to FY21, Adobe expects its revenue to come in at $15.15 billion, based on 19% growth in the Digital Media as well as the Digital Experience segment. Following the company’s 4Q and FY20 results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated a Buy rating on Adobe with a price target of $550. The analyst believes that the company’s fundamentals remain solid based on “steady Digital Media strength, good midmarket recovery commentary, record cash flow, and strong growth in other key metrics” in 4Q. That said, the 5-star analyst also highlighted some unfavorable trends, including a slowdown in organic growth as indicated by the company’s FY21 guidance and moderating growth trends in RPO, ARR (Annualized Recurring Revenue), revenue and billings. Overall, Schwartz is bullish on the stock and concluded, “The durability of Adobe's growth and FCF model, along with a large TAM [Total Addressable Market], and likely conservative FY2021 estimates reinforce our view that ADBE should be a core investment holding.” The rest of the Street is also firmly bullish on the stock, with a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 8 unanimous Buys. Shares have advanced about 31% over the past year and the average price target of $575 indicates upside potential of 26% over the coming months. Bottom line The demand for cloud-based applications is expected to continue to benefit Adobe and Autodesk in the years ahead. While the Street’s Strong Buy analyst consensus for both companies indicates confidence in their long-term potential, currently the possible upside in Adobe stock makes it a better pick.

2021-02-05,"In light of stocks with the highest short float getting squeezed, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) may get a slight boost. PLTR stock has a short float of 9.3% but investors should not treat the short-covering event as a positive catalyst that will last. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The company has a market capitalization of above the $45 billion range. About 1.65 billion shares are outstanding, too. If anything, volatility will rise for this stock, increasing the related option prices. Investors more interested in holding the underlying shares should wait for the price to settle. Demo day and new multi-year contracts are the most recent events that matter more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PLTR Stock Due for a Dip Palantir shares could dip if analysts are justified in their caution. The average consensus rating is a “hold.” Notice the 31.8% sales growth lags the forward price-earnings ratio of over 100x. The P/E to growth (or PEG) is over 3x. Source: Data from Stock Rover Palantir will need to continue posting bigger contracts to justify the current valuations. Chances are very high that the software firm will do that. No other software company offers the same product. The company helps its customers cut costs and dramatically accelerate revenue. For example, in the third quarter, Palantir posted impressive customer additions. Global Head of Business Development Kevin Kawasaki said that one of its customers benefited from its Foundry modules and software-defined data integration. Using its enterprise resource planning suite, the customer had already saved over $50 million. It achieved this within a few hours of use. Word travels fast. That incredibly quick return on investment is attracting more customers. On Jan. 28, the company announced a multi-year enterprise agreement for its Foundry Platform with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO). Cyclical miners need data integration projects and digitization to transform the business. The mining and metals market is highly competitive. So, giant companies like Rio will need to operate more efficiently to survive. And as the pandemic continues, the company may optimize its value chains to maximize the safety of its staff and customers. On Jan. 19, Palantir said it would provide Pacific Gas and Electric Company (NYSE:PCG) with its Foundry software. This will enable PG&E to have an integrated platform, giving decision-makers “a real-time, complete operational picture.” The deal is for several years and is in the multi-million-dollar range. This is the first U.S. utility customer for Palantir. Downside Price Target Only six analysts offer a price target on Palantir. According to Tipranks, the stock has a downside target of $18.80. Morgan Stanley’s analysts posted the most recent analysis on the stock, citing valuation concerns. Palantir’s 49% jump in the last month contradicts the analyst’s opinion. But if the indices lose momentum, investors may sell Palantir stock, too. A drop in the share price would give investors who missed the $10 post-initial public offering entry price. A discount to that level is highly unlikely, though. The company’s product update on each of its platforms – Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo – will lift sales in 2021. Demos of the platform will attract commercial and government customers, too. Risks Palantir’s AI-based technology is not easy to implement. Its complexity will require more trained staff to support customers. The company will need to increase its operating expenses to hire staff as it wins more customer contracts. This will weigh on the near-term results. Investors with a long-term view of Palantir’s prospects will watch the growth in recurring (subscription) revenue. Just as software giants like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) post strong subscription sales each quarter, Palantir will eventually do the same. Your Takeaway PLTR stock has a solid moat in its platform and products. Patience will pay off for shareholders as the company continues to grow. When it reports quarterly results in the weeks ahead, management may raise its guidance. Government customers may increase their contract scope as their budget allows. Other software customers will lose business while Palantir takes on more work.

2021-02-19,"Investors usually don’t go looking for the most expensive stocks in the market. But, in recent years, that strategy actually has paid off well. This has been a market that has focused on growth over valuation. Whether due to low long-term interest rate expectations, a savvy understanding of “megatrends” in key sectors, or something close to a bubble, investors haven’t sold the most expensive stocks at the top. They’ve generally kept buying. Indeed, some of the market’s biggest winners of the past few years have been the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). None of those stocks looked particularly cheap to begin with. All the way up, skeptics (on occasion, myself included) voiced concerns about valuations, but long-term bulls have generated enormous returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s up for debate whether that trend holds. Again, with so many sectors offering explosive opportunities, there is a case for buying growth at almost any price. There’s an equally reasonable case that at some point, valuation has to matter, and that such a point is on the horizon. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of For investors who retain their optimism, there are expensive stocks (if not necessarily the most expensive stocks) that still can provide quality returns from this point. Here are eight of those potential winners: Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) Cloudlfare (NYSE:NET) Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Most Expensive Stocks Worth Buying: Luminar (LAZR) Source: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com At this point, there are basically no growth stocks in the auto sector that are cheap. Investors are going to have to pay up for exposure to the growth of electric and autonomous vehicles. In that context, quality matters most. And it seems like Luminar has one of the better stories in the group. The maker of lidar (light detection and ranging) technology seems to be the industry leader, having passed Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR). ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) revenue should allow the company to ramp revenue and possibly reach profitability before the AV trend kicks into high gear. Again, investors do have to pay up for the opportunity. Luminar has a market capitalization now over $10 billion, yet 2021 revenue likely comes in below $30 million. This story can go south in a number of ways. The long-term risk is competition. In the near term, a pullback across the sector wouldn’t be shocking given how many names (LAZR included) have posted triple-digit rallies over the last six months. But as I wrote last month, investors who trust the market and the sector should have LAZR on their watchlists. That’s still the case at the moment. Cloudflare (NET) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com At 41,035x the consensus earnings per share estimate for 2022, NET looks not like one of the most expensive stocks in the market, but the most expensive stock. Of course, that forward price-to-earnings multiple is inflated by the fact that earnings are expected to be so thin (two-tenths of a penny, to be precise). That aside, NET still does trade at 45x the consensus revenue estimate for 2021, one of the higher multiples in the market. But this seems to be a story worth paying up for. Cloudflare’s cloud-based solutions combine content delivery with security. The former trend is growing nicely thanks to demand for streaming video and edge computing. The latter is obviously important in this day and age, with Cloudflare allowing corporate IT departments to extend their security off premise and into the cloud. There are concerns. The first, as with so many stocks on this list, is whether even that impressive growth potential is priced in. Second, Cloudflare’s business model is different from other software companies in that capital expenditures are rather high. Cloudflare’s network requires worldwide reach, and that in turn requires significant capital. Capex including capitalized software was $75 million in 2020, more than 20% of revenue. That proportion will trend down over time, but this is not a capital-light business like many other software plays. Finally, 2021 guidance given last week did look a bit soft, with Cloudflare guiding for a deceleration of growth in 2021. As we’ve seen with smaller sector play Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), top-line disappointments are punished. NET stock has fallen 10% in two sessions since the release. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of In other words, execution risk is high. But given the opportunity for Cloudflare to become an integral part of the internet worldwide, for now the risks seem worth taking. Fastly (FSLY) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com FSLY is another name that shows the risk of disappointing in the CDN space. Investors bid the stock up aggressively from March lows, betting that the CDN provider would benefit from pandemic tailwinds. But preliminary third quarter numbers in late October were good but not quite good enough. Fastly stock plunged 27% the following day, and another 17% during a seven-session losing streak that followed. But long term, Fastly seems fine. Those tailwinds are intact. Growth remains impressive. The case for FSLY is that its Q3 will in retrospect look like the stumble at Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Twilio has gained about 1,600% from 2017 lows. FSLY isn’t likely to post those same kinds of returns, but there’s still upside ahead. Q4 earnings topped expectations, and guidance suggests another 30% increase in revenue in 2021. At the moment, that report again doesn’t seem quite good enough, with Fastly stock down in after-hours trading. From here, it looks easily good enough to support the long-term case, and to make FSLY a potential buy on any further weakness. Adobe (ADBE) Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com A year ago, I wrote that ADBE stock was a buy until proven otherwise. Simply put, it hasn’t been proven otherwise. Adobe earnings have remained strong despite pandemic impacts. Its Adobe Sign offers another potential growth opportunity, even if that business lags DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) in e-signatures. The company’s acquisition strategy remains on point, and management is solid. Certainly, Adobe stock isn’t cheap. 43x this year’s consensus EPS estimate is a big multiple, one that makes ADBE one of the most expensive stocks in the large-cap group. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of But ADBE has seen a bit of a buying pause since August. That consolidation seems like it’s setting up another rally. Yes, the multiple is big, but Adobe simply is one of the best companies out there. ADBE stock shouldn’t be cheap, and it likely won’t ever be for a very long time. Most Expensive Stocks Worth Buying: Bandwidth (BAND) Source: Shutterstock This relatively unknown CPaaS (communications-platform-as-a-service) provider has an intriguing bull case. Revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, with a roughly 40% increase expected in 2020 and high-30s growth likely this year. Certainly, the market isn’t ignoring BAND stock. Shares trade at about 14x 2020 revenue. But in the context of cloud names, that multiple isn’t completely out of line. Rival Twilio garners a far higher multiple. Meanwhile, Bandwidth should be able to at least match Twilio on the top line. Bottom-line improvements should follow beyond 2021, thanks to operating leverage in the model and gross margin improvements. The technicals look solid, with BAND challenging resistance for a third time, setting up a potential breakout if Q4 earnings impress next week. Bandwidth even could be a takeover target down the line. As with other cloud names, investors have to pay up for the potential here. But there’s a lot to pay up for. Snap (SNAP) Source: Puckpao / Shutterstock.com Snap has gone from one of the market’s biggest disappointments to one of its biggest successes. In December 2018, SNAP stock touched $5, down more than 70% from its initial public offering price of $17. User growth had stalled out, the launch of Spectacles looked like a disaster, and investors simply had lost faith in the company. In the 27 months since then, SNAP stock has returned more than 1,100%, including a 207% rally in 2020. Users have returned, social media is hot again, and Snap seems to be on the right track. In short, investor confidence returned in a big way. As long as that holds, SNAP stock can keep rising. Yes, a 100x forward P/E multiple seems astounding. But Snap still has a lot of runway both in attracting new users, and more importantly, monetizing its existing base. The nature of the platform model means a healthy chunk of that incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line. The resulting explosive earnings growth can justify that triple-digit P/E multiple in a hurry. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of Obviously, Snap must continue to execute. Just as obviously, the rally is going to slow. But as long as the status quo holds with the business, there’s room for more upside in SNAP as a stock. Canada Goose (GOOS) Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com I liked GOOS stock coming into 2021. Up 44% year-to-date, the stock still should have some legs. Yes, the price is higher. But this isn’t a case of the market mindlessly bidding up the stock. Canada Goose’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report earlier this month was a blowout. On an absolute basis, the quarter doesn’t seem that impressive. Revenue increased just 5% year-over-year. Operating profit actually declined. But it’s how the quarter played out that cheered investors, who bid GOOS stock up 21%. The revenue growth was the first for Canada Goose since the pandemic hit. E-commerce sales impressed. China, a key export market, is returning to normalcy. Given that Canada Goose still has some stores closed, and is facing significantly lower traffic at third-party channels, even 5% growth looks like a win. In short, this is a company that looks set to return to its growth trajectory. That projected trajectory was enough to push GOOS to $70 back in late 2018. If growth continues, there’s no reason it can’t get there again, which suggests roughly 60% upside from current levels. Amazon.com (AMZN) Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com AMZN stock long has had the reputation of being one of the market’s most expensive stocks. On a P/E basis, it’s often looked ridiculously inflated. Interestingly, that’s actually starting to change. Looking to 2022, analysts now see EPS of $66 (albeit with a very wide range), suggesting a forward P/E multiple around 50x. That figure sounds enormous. But I’ve long argued that investors shouldn’t use a single metric to value this company, and that’s still the case. It’s worth remembering that Amazon earnings remain deflated by the company’s enormous investments in all sorts of markets. Some of those investments will pay off. Some won’t. But long term, those investments either provide a return, which boost profits, or get cut, which does the same. Meanwhile, the cloud business is enormously valuable. Amazon’s dominance of e-commerce remains relatively unchallenged, even with smaller rivals doing well amid the pandemic. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of Simply put, this is one of the world’s best companies, yet AMZN stock is as cheap as it’s been in a while. Recent underperformance – AMZN stock has traded flat since July – isn’t likely to hold. The departure of chief executive officer Jeff Bezos could provide an overhang, but from a long-term perspective this pause in AMZN’s rally seems like a buying opportunity.

2021-03-11,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 114.9%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Adobe’s Big Run: One company that has been a great investment in the past five years is Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE). Adobe has spent the past five years building a dominant market position in the high-growth field of creative software. Key products include Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. In addition, it has generated impressive cash flow from its high-margin software business that it has used to aggressively buy back stock. At the beginning of 2016, Adobe shares were trading at around $92. Soon after, Adobe dropped as low as $71.21 during a broad market sell-off due to concerns about slowing growth in China. Fortunately, that level would mark the stock’s low point of the past five years as Adobe consistently put up impressive growth numbers. The stock broke $100 for the first time in mid-2016 and $200 in early 2018. Adobe peaked at $386.74 in early 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic scare. Related Link: Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Broadcom Stock 5 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today Adobe In 2021, Beyond: Adobe shares dropped as low as $255.13 when the market bottomed in March 2020. However, a rise in remote work during the crisis ended up being a bullish catalyst for Adobe’s business. The stock was back at new all-time highs by mid-2020 and ultimately peaked at $536.88 before pulling back to around $445. Adobe investors who bought five years ago and held on have generated an impressive return on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in Adobe stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $5,209 today. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting Adobe’s momentum to continue in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 23 analysts covering the stock is $571, suggesting just 28.4% upside from current levels.

2021-03-17,"When you see an upward trajectory on a stock like Adobe Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), the natural tendency might be to hang on to this high-quality stock for a while longer. Just take a look at the chart below … InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Adobe is widely known for its software offerings, especially its Acrobat Pro software for creating, editing and sending PDF documents. However, there is much more to this company than just PDFs. Adobe Systems has three business segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. Digital Media encompasses all of Adobe Systems’ popular software, including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver and Acrobat Pro. I first added Adobe Systems to my Growth Investor Buy List back in May 2018, ahead of the company’s second-quarter earnings announcement. At that time, Adobe Systems had double-digit forecasted earnings and sales growth. Over the past three years, the company has not disappointed: It has posted double-digit earnings growth and 10-straight quarterly earnings surprises. For its fourth quarter in fiscal year 2020, Adobe Systems reported 14% year-over-year revenue growth and 22.7% year-over-year earnings growth. Fourth-quarter earnings of $2.81 per share topped analysts’ estimates for $2.66 per share. The company still has solid forecasted earnings and sales growth. For the first quarter, the analyst community is looking for 22.5% year-over-year earnings growth and 21.6% year-over-year sales growth. So it may surprise you that I recommended my Growth Investor subscribers sell the stock yesterday for a roughly 99% gain. Why would I recommend selling a stock that looks like it will continue to post such a strong top and bottom line? The answer goes back to my focus on superior fundamentals. I study data on almost 5,000 stocks every week, focusing on eight “fundamentals.” These various measures of a stock, when taken collectively, can accurately tell you whether a company is doing well. Here are the eight factors I study when selecting my fundamentally superior stocks: Positive Earnings Revisions. I like to see stocks that have had their earnings estimates increased by Wall Street analysts. This usually tips us off to a stock that’s about to “beat earnings.” Positive Earnings Surprises. Speaking of beating earnings, I also look to see if a stock has been able to beat its earnings estimates, and by how much. This is an important number to watch, because it often tells me about a stock that Wall Street isn’t paying much attention to or doesn’t yet “get.” Increasing Sales. I also like to see a company that can consistently grow its sales over time. Why? Because it’s one number that is hard to fake. My background is in accounting, and I’ve always made sure to steer away from companies that use questionable accounting practices. Sales growth is a solid indicator. Expanding Operating Margins. This simply tells me if earnings are growing faster than sales. A company that’s able to expand its operating margins is usually a company that has a dominant position — such as a monopoly — in its industry. This company can raise prices without seeing a drop-off in sales. And that’s a nice place to be. Free Cash Flow. This tells me how much money a company has left over after paying the costs of its business. A strong cash flow is important because it allows a company to invest more resources in growing its business. Earnings Growth. This is the heart of all good financial analysis. As long as any company is able to grow its earnings consistently, its stock will do well. Positive Earnings Momentum. It’s not enough to see a company’s earnings grow — I also want to see it growing rapidly. Return on Equity, or ROE. This is the gold standard. ROE tells me how efficiently a company is managing its resources. I can’t interview every senior manager at a company, so I like to think of ROE as a report card for management. To get a good sense of how any individual stock is doing with regard to the fundamental factors I track, you can use my Portfolio Grader. And here’s what the latest report looks like for Adobe … As you can see, the stock has a Fundamental Grade of “B,” as well as solid Sales and Earnings Growth scores of “B,” and “A,” respectively. But I’m concerned with the overall drop off institutional buying pressure, as evidenced by its “D” Quantitative rating and overall D-rating in Portfolio Grader. The Quantitative Grade rating measures the buying pressure underneath a stock. If a stock receives an A- or B-rating, there is strong buying pressure supporting the stock. And the more relentless the buying pressure, the safer the stock. The reality is that persistent buying pressure reduces volatility. You can think of buying pressure as “following the money.” It signals that money is flooding into a stock and creating more momentum under a stock. So, buying pressure is vital to a stock’s success. Adobe has also seen a significant drop off in institutional buying pressure and its Quantitative Grade slipped to a D-rating over the weekend. It’s why I recommended my subscribers take advantage of yesterday’s market strength to book a high double-digit gain. The reality is buying pressure has started to ebb in some big flagship stocks and a leadership change is now underway in the stock market. As a result, the “Alpha” that I calculate in Portfolio Grader is starting to diminish and Quantitative Grades are falling — and that has led me to exit perfectly good, high-quality stocks in recent weeks. The bottom line is that I let the numbers decide when I choose to buy or sell a stock, not emotions or nostalgia or hope for ongoing performance. Investors who let emotions be their guide can end up holding stocks that will only fail them in the long term. Just because you love a stock doesn’t mean it loves you back.

2021-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- The indictment of a 21-year-old Swiss hacker who claimed credit for exposing the flaws in a surveillance camera company’s system is likely to stir debate about whether attacks by activists for social or political causes are criminal behavior.Tillie Kottmann, who uses they/them pronouns, was indicted Thursday in Seattle and charged with crimes including wire fraud and identity theft. Kottmann made headlines last week when they claimed credit for gaining access to the 150,000 security cameras sold by San Mateo, California-based Verkada Inc. While the charges don’t involve the Verkada incident, Kottmann previously said they hacked Nissan Motor Co., and leaked documents from chipmaker Intel Corp.Kottmann, in a previous interview, said their hacking is inspired by an anti-intellectual property and anti-capitalist world view. For decades, underground hackers have pushed the limits of the law under the banner of “hacktivism,” pursuing a variety of leftist and anti-authoritarian ideals. In some cases, the U.S. government has been overly aggressive in their prosecution of those hackers, said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who has extensively researched hacker culture.“The hammer went down on hackers so heavily from the ’80s to the present, so the hacker community has this in mind,” Coleman said, adding she expects Kottmann to garner even more support in hacker circles following the indictment.Coleman said the Verkada break-in may be viewed differently than the hacks included in the indictment because Kottmann spoke to a journalist to publicly expose the video cameras’ flaws.“Some people would see that they did something in the public interest, and some of the escapades from prior were sort of useful hacking escapades,” Coleman said. “A lot of security researchers working for big name companies can identify with that, because their past was also about exploring these systems, and messing around, and sometimes messing up, as well.”Prosecutors in Seattle, however, sharply rebuked the view that the hacks had any redeeming quality.“Stealing credentials and data, and publishing source code and proprietary and sensitive information on the web is not protected speech -- it is theft and fraud,” Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman said in a statement announcing Kottmann’s indictment. “Wrapping oneself in an allegedly altruistic motive does not remove the criminal stench from such intrusion, theft, and fraud.”The U.S. accused Kottmann of hacking dozens of companies and government agencies, and said Kottmann operated a website, called “git.rip,” that published the internal documents and source code of more than 100 entities. The named victims include the state of Washington and the Washington Department of Transportation, as well as a microchip processor or manufacturer and a maker of tactical equipment.According to an archive of the “git.rip,” website, it included leaks from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Toyota Motor Corp., Adobe Inc., General Electric Co., GitHub and more. The site now displays a message stating it has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Scott Nawrocki, a 21-year FBI veteran who investigated cybercases, said the charges against Kottmann are serious whatever the motivations.“These kinds of individuals have to be held responsible,” said Nawrocki, now managing director of digital investigations and cyber defense at investigations firm Nardello & Co.. “Regardless of ideology, this is not white-hat hacking,” describing those who report computer bugs to companies so they can be fixed. “This is potentially inviting others to conduct hacking operations. To me, that’s criminal activity.”Nawrocki said there probably would be efforts to extradite Kottmann, and the indictment could limit Kottmann’s travel outside Switzerland because U.S. allies would arrest them.Swiss lawyer Roman Kost said it’s unlikely Kottmann will be sent to face criminal charges in the U.S., citing Swiss law that allows its citizens not to be extradited without their consent, but they may be punished inside Switzerland.Swiss hackers “can be tried in Switzerland if there is sufficient suspicion and evidence, and if they are found guilty, they can be punished,” Kost said in an email.Prosecutors allege that Kottmann sold hacking inspired merchandise, and that they sought contact from journalists in order to promote their data leaks and themselves. Kottman’s T-shirts included the phrases: “venture anticapitalist,” “no gender, only crime,” and “I would never do cybercrime.”Kottmann, citing the advice of their lawyer, declined to comment on the indictment. Swiss lawyer Marcel Bosonnet confirmed he represents Kottmann, but declined to comment further. The Justice Department also declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Swiss Hacker’s Indictment Spotlights Ethics of Activist Attacks

2021-03-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s executive in charge of App Store developer relations retired and the role has been taken over by a key marketing executive, according to people familiar with the matter.Ron Okamoto was hired by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2001 as vice president of developer relations after previously serving as an executive at Adobe Inc. At Apple, Okamoto helped oversee the app-review process and policies, distribution of tools to build and sell apps, forums and technical developer support, the annual WWDC conference, awards for developers, and developer communications.Okamoto’s status as a former employee was disclosed Friday in a witness list provided by Apple to the court for its upcoming trial versus Fortnite developer Epic Games Inc. The witness list said a deposition by Okamoto may be used in the trial and that he can testify about the App Store’s policies, business model, developer tools, and agreements between Apple and third-party developers.The App Store has been under scrutiny from antitrust regulators and some developers over fees and complex rules. Apple recently sliced its revenue share from app purchases to 15% from 30% for developers who make less than $1 million in annual revenue.His role has been filled by Susan Prescott, a respected Apple executive who previously oversaw marketing for Apple’s own apps and is now also responsible for education marketing. The App Store itself is overseen by Phil Schiller, the company’s former head of marketing, and Matt Fischer, a company vice president.(Updates with more context on timing in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple’s Longtime App Store Developer Relations Chief Retires

2021-03-22,"As infections continue rising and lockdown measures are being re-instated in Europe, hopes for recovery and growth are diminishing. In a quiet earnings week, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Game Stop Corp. (NYSE: GME) are about to make some noise on Tuesday. Adobe After the market closes on Tuesday, Fact Set expects Adobe to report a net income of $1.3 billion, or $2.79 a share, on revenues of $3.8 billion. The creative software company witnessed strong demand for its Digital Media Solutions in the fiscal fourth quarter and the trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter due to impressive growth in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud segments. New capabilities in Adobe Target are expected to have further enhanced customer recommendation and targeting, as well as boosted revenues. GameStop At the same time on Tuesday, Fact Set expects the poster child for the latest surge in investor interest to report a net income of $88.3 million, or $1.35 a share, on revenues of $2.2 billion. With a market capitalization of approximately $14 billion as of Friday, it has quickly vaulted to become one of the biggest companies in the small-cap Russell 2000 index. In February, it brought on its first-ever technology officer and no other than Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) former AWS engineering leader. General Mills On Wednesday, March 24th, the breakfast and snack good specialist is expected to report net income of $522.9 million, or 84 cents a share, on sales of $4.4 billion before the market opens. Despite the demand surging during the pandemic, the impact is waning. But, the expanded customer base and rising profitability could help General Mills (NYSE: GIS) to continue sailing. Management has suggested that the company's in for a soft landing as they expect demand to remain fundamentally higher for food prepared at home even after the virus threat fades and people are able to return to being mobile. Darden Restaurants Although Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI) is expected to report adjusted net income of $88.5 million, or 71 cents a share, on sales of $1.6 billion before the market opens on Thursday, the company has a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will close the week by releasing its report on February personal consumption expenditures or the change in the value of goods and services purchased by the U.S. consumer.

2021-03-22,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announces its next round of earnings this Tuesday, March 23. Here is Benzinga's look at Adobe's Q1 earnings report. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Adobe EPS is expected to be around $2.78, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $3.76 billion. Adobe EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $2.27. Sales were $3.09 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on ADBE If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, earnings would be up 22.47%. Revenue would be up 21.64% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 2.66 2.41 2.33 2.23 EPS Actual 2.81 2.57 2.45 2.27 Revenue Estimate 3.36 B 3.16 B 3.16 B 3.05 B Revenue Actual 3.42 B 3.23 B 3.13 B 3.09 B Stock Performance Shares of Adobe were trading at $441.5 as of March 19. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 44.9%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Adobe is scheduled to hold the call at 11:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

2021-03-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its annual guidance, a sign that creative software applications continue to drive strong growth.Sales will be about $3.72 billion in the period ending in May, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $3.69 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, will be about $2.81 a share. Analysts projected $2.70.The maker of Photoshop raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has pitched new creative software tools to continue Adobe’s revenue growth. The company in October introduced a version of its popular app, Illustrator, for Apple Inc.’s iPad, as part of an effort to offer its products on more devices being used by professionals and hobbyists. Document Cloud products, including PDF and electronic signature software, have surged with millions working from home. That experience appears to have changed behavior in a lasting way, according to a note from Cowen & Co., allaying concerns that these digital tools would become less popular once people return to the office.“Adobe’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have become mission critical to all customer segments -- from students to individuals to large enterprises -- across the world,” Narayen said in the statement.Shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $460.20 in New York.

2021-03-24,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $457.14 following the option alert. Sentiment: NEUTRAL Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $395.00 Volume: 524 Open Interest: 282 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

The company also generated $1.26 billion in net income for the quarter, or $2.61 per share, compared with net income of $955 million, or $1.98 a share, in the same quarter one year earlier. The company’s adjusted net income was $3.14 per share. Adobe also offered full-year guidance of $15.45 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $11.85 a share. The quarterly earnings report also included the news that John Murphy, Adobe’s chief financial officer, will be retiring this year. Piper Sandler On Adobe: Adobe has “the largest creative cloud and document cloud platform in the world,” Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin said in a note. The analyst praised the company’s strong quarterly results as a triumph of “capitalizing on improving digital tailwinds in the midst of a global pandemic, especially with the Document Cloud business.” Adobe’s recent $1.5-billion acquisition of Workfront, a work management platform for marketers, brought $38 million into the quarterly revenue stream after purchase accounting, he said. Although noting this acquisition and other growth investments “may temper growth relative to 2020,” Bracelin said “another record margin entering the year sets a favorable watermark for FY21 earning growth, which is expected to grow 17% y/y in FY21.” RBC Capital Markets On Adobe: While the company’s overall viability is not back to pre-pandemic levels, it is benefiting from demand across its portfolio from small and medium business customers in the U.S and overseas, Matthew Hedberg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. While expressing surprise that the fiscal year guidance was raised, the analyst said Adobe is “well-positioned to attract a high-quality replacement” for the departing Murphy. View more earnings on ADBE “With digital transformations increasingly becoming a priority for companies, and digital content creation a long-term trend, we increase top and bottom line estimates,” he wrote. Oppenheimer On Adobe: Brian Schwartz, managing director at Oppenheimer, also pointed out Murphy’s retirement and the raised guidance, adding that the guidance is “understated to de-risk the model for the next CFO.” While noting Adobe’s publishing-and-advertising revenue was $13 million below consensus, the analyst said the business is being deemphasized. “Adobe stands out from almost any group as the pioneering trailblazer of digital creative and marketing tools and services, and the company has transitioned and progressed into a verifiable cloud platform success story as it rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale, profits, and growth trajectory,” Schwartz wrote, adding that “Adobe is highly profitable, unlike most of the other names in our SaaS/Applications universe, and this characteristic provides a unique level of valuation support versus company peers.” JMP On Adobe: The “tone of business appears to be good at Adobe,” analyst Patrick Walvarens said in a note. But Walvarens’ praise was somewhat muted compared to his peers. “We like Adobe's monopolistic position within the creative cloud, where it delivers essential solutions to an important demography of creators, but continue to be more circumspect around the Digital Experience segment, which includes a number of different acquisitions ... which Adobe plans to leverage to create a unified marketing system of record and workflow solution that will bring Adobe into more competition with companies like Asana, Smartsheet, and Monday.com,” he wrote. ADBE Ratings, Price Targets: Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe with a $570 price target. RBC maintained an Outperform and $575 price target. Oppenheimer maintained an Overweight and $550 price target. JMP maintained a Market Perform rating. ADOBE Price Action: At last check, Adobe was trading down 1.74% at $452.19.

2021-03-25,"On Tuesday, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) reported higher profit and revenue along with raising its projections for the year. But it seems investors were more concerned about what is coming next for a software company as its CFO is stepping back. Figures Revenue for the quarter ended on March 5th grew to $3.91 billion, up 26.5% from the previous year and ahead of its own projection of $3.76 billion. Net income rose to $1.26 billion during the quarter, up more than 31% compared with the prior-year period. Adjusted profits were $3.14 a share, also ahead of the $2.78 management expected. The revenue of the digital media segment, which includes Photoshop and Illustrator helped fuel the vibrant performance at $2.86 billion, which is a 32% YoY increase. The results reflect both an improving spending environment for digital marketing, and effective execution by the company. The momentum is strong and the primary reason behind the improved full year guidance with accelerating trends in both the Digital Media and Experience Cloud businesses. Outlook Adobe now sees revenue for the full year ending in November is expected to amount $15.45 billion, up from a previous forecast of $15.15 billion, with non-GAAP profits increasing from $11.20 to $11.85 a share. Looking for a new CFO Adobe's Chief Financial Officer John Murphy is retiring to focus on philanthropy. Mr. Murphy plans to educate about preserving mid-century modern architecture, along with helping to provide young people in urban areas access with access to education. However, he will stay on board as needed to help with the transition. The way ahead The creative software maker has the largest creative cloud and document cloud platform in the world. Its latest quarterly results are merely a triumph of capitalizing on improving digital tailwinds during a global pandemic, especially with the Document Cloud business. Although the recent $1.5 billion acquisition of Workfront, a work management platform for marketers and other growth investments may temper growth relative to 2020, Adobe is well-positioned to attract a high-quality CFO who will be worthy of the title. Workfront did bring in $38 million into the quarterly revenue stream after purchase so there's no doubt the company knows what it's doing.

2021-03-26,"In a volatile market environment, with stocks getting buffeted about by a variety of conflicting forces, investors are looking to the expert commentators for some guidance. Covering the macro situation from banking giant JPMorgan, quant strategist Marko Kolanovic believes that we’re in for continued gains in stocks. Kolanovic doesn’t dismiss the recent dips in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ; rather, he sees them as temporary. Kolanovic points out that we’re approaching the end of Q1 and will soon see the first earnings reports of 2021. He expects that to build momentum for stocks going into the summer, boosting the market indexes and keeping inflation at a steady state with bond yields stabilizing. Kolanovic has set a 4,400 year-end price target for the S&P 500, which suggests ~13% growth in the market’s benchmark index. Taking Kolanovic’s outlook to heart, J.P. Morgan analysts are offering up concrete recommendations, pointing to two names that look compelling. As the firm’s analysts are forecasting at least 30% upside potential for each, we used TipRanks’ database to dig a bit deeper. BorgWarner, Inc. (BWA) The first JPM pick we're looking at is BorgWarner, a major manufacturer of drivetrain components, especially transmissions and air management systems, which has long been a stalwart of Detroit’s automotive industry. The company has, in recent years, been a leader in the development of powertrains and motors for electric vehicles, and is committed to accelerating that development. The company announced this week that it intends to expand its EV revenues to 45% of the company total by 2030. The company’s plan, called Charging Forward, would see a focus on developing componentry for electric commercial vehicles while optimizing the combustion portfolio, and scaling the EV business up to deliver the projected higher demand. Management expects to maintain BorgWarner’s high margin performance while generating a strong free cash flow. Current performance gives BorgWarner a solid foundation for its ambitious EV plans. The company saw a strong beat in 4Q20 on several key metrics. BWA reported revenues of $3.93 billion, a 53% gain year-over-year. EPS came in at $1.52, up from $1.06 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to full-year numbers, 2020 ended with BWA showing $10.17 billion at the top line, about equal to last year’s total. 2020 earnings were down, to $2.34 from $3.61 in 2019. Despite the lower earnings, BWA’s cash position improved in 2020. Free cash flow was $743 million for the year, and the company increased its cash and cash equivalent holdings by $818 million year-over-year. Among the bulls is JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman who wrote: “Demand for BWA products is strong, driven by both consumer ‘pull’ and government ‘push’ elements, and we believe will only increase over time as the rising amount of vehicles in emerging markets upwardly pressures fuel prices. BWA already enjoys the second-highest margins in the sector, in part driven by the fact that many of the products it manufactures are of a highly engineered nature, leading to high technical barriers to entry and market concentration. Still, we expect the combination of rapid top-line growth and financial discipline to allow for top-tier operating margin expansion.” To this end, Brinkman rates BWA an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $58 price target implies a potential upside of 33% for the coming year. (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here) Brinkman is not an outlier in his bullish stance, but there is some division on Wall Street regarding BWA. The analyst consensus view is a Moderate Buy, based on 14 recent reviews breaking down to 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $43.70 and their $49.69 average price target suggests a one-year upside of ~14%. (See BWA stock analysis on TipRanks) Adobe, Inc. (ADBE) Shifting gears, we’ll move from automotive to software. Adobe is a name we’re all familiar with, and rightly so. The company created the PDF format, and among its product line-up are Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, among many, many others. In recent years, Adobe has shifted to a subscription SaaS model, offering its products as a bundle on Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe saw gains last year, as its cloud-based model was well suited to 2020’s shift to remote work and telecommuting. The company’s fiscal 2020 revenues hit $12.8 billion, up nearly 14% from 2019, and growth has continued into its first quarter of fiscal 2021. The company reported $3.9 billion in Q1’s top line, a company record and up 26% year-over-year. EPS, at $2.61 per share, was up 33% yoy. That guidance was updated based on the Q1 results. Management sees the company bringing in $15.45 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2021, which would represent a 20% yoy increase from the published 2020 figure. Digital media, a major driver of the 2020 numbers, is expected to deliver 22% yoy growth and show annualized recurring revenue of $1.8 billion. Covering this stock for JPM is 5-star analyst Sterling Auty, who sees a clear path forward for Adobe. “When the economic cycle turns for the better companies tend to invest in solutions that will help drive revenue growth and that is exactly what the Adobe Experience Cloud, with its digital marketing solutions, can help customers achieve,” Auty noted. The analyst added, ""Over the years it is more common for Adobe to reiterate the full-year guidance after reporting the first-quarter earnings, so seeing the raise above just the first quarter upside for the full year numbers is a sign of incremental strength in our opinion. As a reminder, the stock has not done a lot since the start of September and this might be the catalyst to get it moving again."" In line with his bullish comments, Auty rates ADBE shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $595 price target indicates his confidence in a 32% one-year upside. (To watch Auty’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street analysts are pretty well unified in their views on Adobe – the stock has 16 Buy reviews, against a single Hold, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares are priced at $450.99, with an average price target, $559.82, suggesting an upside of ~24% by year’s end.

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Hitachi Ltd. will pay $8.5 billion for U.S. software development company GlobalLogic Inc., a move that could help the Japanese firm expand its technology services business.The size of the deal will increase to $9.6 billion when debt is included, Hitachi said in a statement Wednesday. The acquisition -- targeted for completion by end-July -- will be one of the largest ever for Hitachi, a storied Japanese name that grew out of electronics into a railway to electrical equipment conglomerate that’s begun investing in providing gear for the so-called internet of things. Its shares closed down 7.3% in Tokyo.Hitachi has been helping customers automate and modernize manufacturing through its Lumada IoT platform, and technology and so-called smart life businesses now account for roughly 40% of revenues. Nikkei had reported in January the firm will spend about 350 billion yen ($3.2 billion) on acquisitions to boost its operations in North America.“The acquisition makes sense as the target operates in the IT area Hitachi is aiming to expand,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Takeshi Kitaura said. “The company has a client network, which will help Hitachi grow further.”San Jose, California-based GlobalLogic has helped customers including Panasonic Corp., Adobe Inc. and Ericsson AB design and build software and other digital products, according to its website. It’s privately owned and funded by Canada’s CPP Investment Board and Partners Group.CPPIB said it expects $3.8 billion in net proceeds from selling its 45% interest in the company. “GlobalLogic performed very well and generated exceptional investment returns, including during the Covid-19 pandemic when the need for digital transformation only accelerated,” Hafiz Lalani, managing director and head of Europe for the fund’s direct private equity unity, said in a statement.Hitachi has been acquiring and disposing of assets over the past few years as part of consolidation efforts. It exited a $26 billion U.K. nuclear power project in September, and previously bought out its high-tech unit, while selling its diagnostic-imaging business. The firm is currently weighing bids for its Hitachi Metals Ltd. unit.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysHitachi’s buyout of U.S.-based GlobalLogic, reported by Nikkei, may help bridge the gap to its fiscal 2022 revenue target of 1.6 trillion yen for its Lumada (digital solutions) business, of which it has said 200 billion yen could come from M&A. GlobalLogic, with 130 billion yen of revenue and an Ebitda margin over 20%, carries a reported purchase price of 1.05 trillion yen or about 40x Ebitda -- not cheap, but it could largely be funded by divestiture of Hitachi subsidiaries.-- Takeshi Kitaura and Ian MaClick here for the research(Adds CPPIB proceeds and statement in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Hitachi to Buy Software Firm GlobalLogic for $8.5 Billion

2021-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Verkada Inc.'s security camera customers were livid. Hackers had breached footage from thousands of surveillance devices trained on their operations, including schools, prisons, hospitals and companies around the world. On a webinar with Verkada’s CEO, users wanted answers. Fast.One pointed question came from Sequoia Capital, Verkada's most prominent investor: How, inquired Silas Thomas, information technology manager at the venture capital firm, can we cut off Verkada employees from access to Sequoia’s cameras?Verkada Chief Executive Officer Filip Kaliszan told Thomas that access had already been disabled. In response to another customer’s query, he summed up the mood. “We understand that this definitely kind of made it difficult to trust us.”Once little known outside of Silicon Valley, Verkada gained unwanted notoriety in March after Bloomberg reported that hackers had accessed the internet-connected cameras in facilities of its customers, including the carmaker Tesla Inc. and cybersecurity firm Cloudflare Inc. Although some sales staffers allegedly marketed Verkada as “virtually unhackable,” the breach exposed alarmingly lax safeguards at a company selling powerful surveillance tools that include facial recognition technology and that promised security and privacy protections to go with them. In the weeks since then, current and former employees have told Bloomberg that the inattention to data protection was emblematic of a larger “bro culture” that was sophomoric and sales obsessed, and which tolerated the harassment of women, frequent partying and misleading marketing claims.Video footage of female employees was passed among male colleagues, who offered graphic comments, and in-office parties -- even during the pandemic -- were prone to excessive drinking and occasional drug use, according to the employees.“Verkada gives frat boys a bad name,” one former sales employee said. In a statement, a Verkada spokesperson said, “We acknowledge that early on, our internal policies did not initially keep pace with our rapid growth; however, we have taken several steps to ensure we are creating a supportive and inclusive environment.’’ A party celebrating the company’s first $100 million in sales, during which many employees didn’t wear masks despite the pandemic, was “a lapse in judgement,” the spokesperson said.“Excessive drinking in the office and illicit drug use of any kind — both of which are grounds for termination — have never been commonplace at Verkada,” the spokesperson said. In-office celebrations could include champagne toasts but didn’t mean employees were intoxicated. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV in March, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha praised Verkada for swiftly reacting to the breach. “They’re sending out very frequent updates on a daily basis as they’re investigating, and making sure this is an experience that is not repeated,"" Botha said.During the last year, Verkada has expanded its human resources team, completed a gender pay equity review and made compensation adjustments, implemented new training programs and strengthened mechanisms that employees can use to report abusive behavior with a 24/7 anonymous hotline, the company said. Verkada also has “refocused how we recruit and hire diverse candidates,” according to the spokesperson.“Verkada is committed to creating a workplace that is respectful and inclusive of everyone,” the spokesperson said. “We have clear policies around sexual harassment and workplace behavior and there have been and will continue to be consequences for anyone who violates them.’’The company declined to comment on some of the specific instances outlined in this article, nearly all of which three or more current or former employees confirmed. For this story, Bloomberg interviewed eight current Verkada employees and 15 former employees, all of whom requested anonymity either to protect professional relationships or because they weren't authorized to speak on the company’s behalf. Some praised Verkada’s sense of camaraderie and management, particularly recent efforts to address cultural problems such as hiring more women and cracking down on misbehavior. However, most spoke critically of the company and its work environment.Signs of internal problems emerged last year, after a group of men at Verkada captured images of female employees with internal cameras, without their knowledge, and posted them on a Slack channel, along with sexually graphic comments, several former employees said. The rogue Slack channel was initially reported in October 2020 by the trade publication IPVM . The organizers initially received a light punishment — they had their stock options reduced — but were later fired after news of the Slack channel spread, former employees said. In an October communication to his staff, Kaliszan said the initial discipline wasn’t adequate and apologized. In another episode early this year, Verkada fired a sales manager after he exposed himself to a female colleague at a late-night, out-of-office gathering involving some members of the sales team, according to three people familiar with the incident. The firing, which came swiftly after an internal investigation, was considered a turning point in the company's attitude toward inappropriate behavior, according to the people. The sales manager declined to comment.Verkada isn’t the only Silicon Valley startup in which employees — often young, single and flush with cash — have engaged in questionable behavior, including sexual misconduct and substance abuse. But Verkada sells security cameras that peer into offices, factory floors, intensive care units and other sensitive areas — the kind of product that demands professionalism and discretion. Based in San Mateo, Verkada was founded in 2016 by three computer science graduates from Stanford University — Kaliszan, James Ren and Benjamin Bercovitz — and an experienced technology hand, Hans Robertson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate. He had co-founded the startup Meraki — which sold cloud-managed networking devices — and was acquired by Cisco Systems for $1.2 billion in 2012.Figures provided by Verkada show that the company raised money quickly--$15 million in 2018 led by Next47, $40 million in April 2019 led by Meritech Capital Partners and Sequoia Capital, and $80 million in November 2019 led by Felicis Ventures. By then, the company was valued at $1.6 billion; it now has 550 employees. Its market share had grown rapidly too, from 38 customers in 2017 to more than 5,500 last year, according to the company’s website.But according to former employees and others, Verkada’s sales pitch to customers sometimes included misleading claims.In some instances, sales staffers told customers that Verkada’s system was “virtually unhackable,” and that Verkada had hired the cybersecurity company Okta Inc. to perform a penetration test to gauge the safety of its networks and determined that it couldn’t be breached.An Okta spokesman said the company conducted its own penetration test of Verkada as part of its due diligence as a customer and found some vulnerabilities, which it forwarded to the camera company. Okta said it never conducted a pen test on behalf of Verkada. “It is disingenuous to use the Okta brand in this manner,” the spokesman said.The Verkada spokesperson said, “We expect our sales team to accurately represent our products and answer questions truthfully.”Verkada also marketed itself to potential customers as a “Stanford/MIT company,” according to emails that Bloomberg obtained via public records requests. Stanford said it wasn’t affiliated with Verkada, and MIT said in a statement, “Companies should not refer to themselves as an ‘MIT company’ simply because of a founder’s alumni status.”At the same time, Verkada’s sales team engaged in behavior that went well beyond the norm in a profession that thrives on adrenaline and profits, the employees said. Drinking among the sales staff was allegedly excessive even by the often-casual standards of technology startups, where refrigerators full of beer aren’t uncommon. Two former employees said they saw cocaine use in the office.Impromptu celebrations would break out when a sales representative closed a deal worth more than $20,000, with alcohol flowing and music blaring, according to the employees. The sales team would regularly engage in a chant – “Mo-ney! Mo-ney! Mo-ney!” – that would become a roar, sometimes lasting minutes.A sales team scavenger hunt in 2019 included drunken employees filing into a Casper store in San Francisco, where they bounced on the mattresses, wrestled with each other and posed for pictures. The store manager called Verkada's customer service line to complain, saying their employer was obvious due to the group's logo-emblazoned T-shirts. A Casper spokeswoman confirmed the incident but provided no further details.One employee described being on the phone with a customer, when suddenly some members of the sales team turned on a speaker and began blasting a Cardi B song with sexually explicit lyrics. The employee recalled having to seek a quieter place in the office and apologize to the customer.Management at least acknowledged the disruption caused by the sales teams’ allegedly bawdy antics. They told some of the engineering staff to expense noise-canceling headphones, according to two former employees.Some former employees said they felt left out while working at Verkada, which grew up at a time when Silicon Valley was reckoning with the MeToo movement and companies from Google to Uber were addressing challenges faced by female employees. At Verkada, meetings and events routinely began with Robertson saying, “OK boys” or “Yeah, gentlemen,” seemingly ignoring the women in the room, the former employees said. Two other former staffers described a loud discussion in the open-plan office about a well-qualified job candidate. A Verkada marketing executive said he didn’t want to hire her because she was a mother and wouldn’t be motivated to work on weekends.The marketing executive didn’t respond to a message seeking comment. The Verkada spokesperson said the company rejects that characterization. “Verkada looks for the best people for every role, and we would never discriminate.” Many of its employees are parents, including those on the executive’s team, the company’s spokesperson said. In November 2019, at an all-hands meeting where employees could submit inquiries anonymously via an app, one pointed out that a female director had departed, leaving no women executives, while another questioned Verkada’s “pervasive hyper-masculine culture,” according to screenshots reviewed by Bloomberg. The questions were read aloud and answered by Kaliszan, who said a group of friends who happened to be male founded the company. But he said Verkada needed to make an effort to hire more women. ​​​​In responses on the app, which employees could view in real time, one wrote anonymously, “Some employees are too concerned with a liberal agenda.” Another wrote, “Proud to work at a company that is hiring the best people for the job regardless of their gender.”According to a Verkada spokesperson, the company hired a new head of human resources, Dervilla Lannon, in March 2020, and she was promoted in November, joining the executive team. Of its employees, 21% identify as female, and they make up 23% of management positions, according to the spokesperson, who added the company still has a way to go. The recent hack raised new questions within the company. Two current and three former employees said they believed the aggressive focus on sales and growth, paired with the allegedly boisterous office environment, contributed to a lack of attention on security.Three former engineering employees said they had raised concerns internally between 2018 and 2019 about the widespread use of Super Admin accounts, which gave staffers access to customer cameras. The accounts didn’t always require extra security settings to login, such as two-factor authentication, making them potentially vulnerable to hackers if passwords were leaked or otherwise compromised.Last year, the company began reducing the number of employees with those accounts and tightened settings, ensuring that newly created Super Admin users would have to use two-factor authentication, according to two former employees. However, the employees said, the new settings weren’t applied to some older accounts, and it remained possible for someone with Super Admin credentials to login and view camera footage through a Verkada website that was accessible on the internet.Those oversights would come back to bite the company. In March, Verkada hired Kyle Randolph, an experienced chief information security officer. But Randolph, a former security engineer at Twitter Inc. and Adobe Inc., had little time to patch up the vulnerabilities. In his second week on the job, an international hacker collective gained access to a Super Admin account and breached Verkada, gaining entry to customer cameras and throwing the company into crisis.Randolph didn't respond to messages seeking comment.“I wasn’t shocked by the hack – the way we did some things could be prone to abuse,” said one former Verkada engineer. “We were not mature enough as a company. We were driven too much by numbers.”(Updates with Sequoia comment in ninth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","‘Bro Culture’ at Camera Maker Verkada Pushed Profits, Parties"

2021-04-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. unveiled updated software to help brands target customers with advertising and offers, replacing third-party cookies that are being eliminated in the name of consumer privacy after tracking users across the internet for more than two decades. A new version of Adobe’s Real-time Customer Data Platform is designed to use brands’ own data, rather than insight from third-party cookies, which are already blocked by several web browsers and are soon to be nixed by Google Chrome. The Adobe product introduced Tuesday will let clients ask consumers for permission to use their information, said Amit Ahuja, vice president, experience cloud products and strategy. The cookie has been the foundation of personalized web experiences since the mid-1990s when Netscape first started using the tracking technology in its browser, putting a little piece of data on a user’s computer while they were scanning the internet in order to remember them. Amid privacy regulations, ad-blocking software and the decision by browsers to get rid of them, cookies placed by third-parties that provide advertising and tracking services to websites and brands are disappearing. To reach customers and respect their privacy wishes, Adobe’s customers will have to look for new options, including using data they collect directly, Ahuja said.With the new Adobe software, consumers browsing on a site should expect that it will be much clearer how the site is using their data and why they are being shown certain personalized experiences, he said.“Your expectations for a brand understanding you and knowing you and giving you a personalized experience are really getting higher and at the same time, the counteracting balance is that consumers are correctly placing more value on their privacy,” he said. Another factor in the demise of traditional tracking: companies that collect massive volumes of data in their own services — think Facebook or Google — have been less generous about what they’re sharing with others who want to use that data, said Tina Moffett, principal analyst at Forrester. “It’s really forcing brands, and specifically chief marketing officers, to go back to the basics of marketing and advertising,” she said. “For a long time, marketers got real slap-happy with using cookie-based level data to personalize.” READ MORE: How Apple, Google Are Killing the Advertising CookieGoogle is replacing cookies with another approach, called Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, although it, too, is attracting ire from privacy advocates. Adobe said it’s examining Google’s system, although generally Adobe’s software integrates with all major platforms and services that customers want to use. More than half of the clients that Adobe surveyed aren’t using the full breadth of the data they collect to personalize their approach to customers — often they don’t know what they have and information is stored in disparate systems, Ahuja said. The new Adobe software is being tested by clients such as FedEx Corp., T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. It will bring together all sorts of first-party data and events to get more complete insight on customers and will let the companies combine that data with information from apps and media websites that use browsers. Adobe’s Target software also uses machine learning to provide real-time predictions of what information or offer to show users next as they move through a brand’s website. One new feature allows clients to find new customers who are similar to their existing best-known users. The software will also let brands share non-sensitive data with each other to better personalize what products they pitch — for example an apparel company can combine with a jewelry company, giving them data on what types of dresses a certain group of customers are buying so the second firm can suggest appropriate necklaces or earrings. Using these kinds of technologies in combination will be more complex than just signing up to buy information gleaned from third-party cookies, Moffett said, but it’s good for user privacy and brands don’t have much choice. “The future of data-driven marketing is going to be more fragmented,” she said. “But it’s better than using the third-party cookie.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Adobe Sees Sales Opportunity in the Death of the Browser Cookie

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses ""compatible with a net-zero economy"" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified.

2021-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- MessageBird has agreed to buy U.S. email marketing firm SparkPost for $600 million, marking its fourth deal since October.The Dutch software company raised $800 million from investors to fund the all-cash deal, which will intensify Messagebird’s focus on North America and its competition with U.S. rival Twilio Inc.“We currently have maybe 20 folks in the U.S., but at the close of this transaction we’ll have about 300,” MessageBird Chief Executive Officer Robert Vis said in an interview. “So if there was ever a move we’re making into the U.S., it’s this one.”SparkPost sells software that companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., PayPal Holdings Inc., LinkedIn and Adobe Inc. use to send marketing emails, and analytics tools to measure and improve how many people open and read them. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.“When we made the deal, we didn’t have the money to pay for it, so we actually raised eight hundred million dollars in 21 days,” he said. “It was an exclusive process so there were no bankers. We agreed on a price that made sense for all of us and then we had a time frame to go raise that money to show that we could actually pay for it.”MessageBird, which completed a trio of acquisitions as recently as March, sells tools to companies that let them add a few lines of code to their app or website so customers can text, email, video conference or call in with questions. It also works directly with telecom operators worldwide to deliver SMS and instant message alerts, such as two-factor authentication codes or weather warnings.SparkPost’s technology significantly extends MessageBird’s investment in email, and puts it in more direct competition with companies such as Mailgun and Sendgrid.Participants financing the $800 million fundraise include Eurazeo, Tiger Global, Owl Rock Capital, and BlackRock Inc., according to a statement. Eurazeo’s Nathalie Kornhoff-Bruls will join MessageBird’s board.MessageBird was recently valued at $3 billion by investors and is expected to be ready for an initial public offering as soon as this year. Acquiring SparkPost strengthens its domestic competition with Twilio, now valued at about $67.8 billion four years after it listed at a $1.23 billion market value.Vis said it was still 10-year-old MessageBird’s intention to be ready for an IPO this year, but that it remained an option rather than a goal or necessity. He said the speed and volume of capital his firm was able to raise in just a few weeks showed access to funds was not a roadblock to growth.The SparkPost deal will be a quick turnaround for some of that company’s backers. The Wall Street Journal reported in January the email marketing company had raised $180 million from investors including LLR Partners, NewSpring Capital and PNC Bank, more than half of which the paper said was in the form of equity.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","MessageBird Raises $800 Million, Buys U.S. Startup SparkPost"
