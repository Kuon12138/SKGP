2019-01-30,"Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) dropped sharply at the open despite beating earnings and revenue estimates. The San Jose-based manufacturer of scanners and aligners used in orthodontics reported double-digit revenue and earnings increases. However, Align stock initially fell on weakened pricing for Invisalign.

Still, traders appeared to interpret the drop as a knee-jerk reaction. By the middle of the day, the stock erased all of the losses and had turned positive, closing up about 2.6%. Both the quick recovery and the growth of its popular Invisalign orthodontic product show that Align stock is a buy on any pullback.

### ALGN Stock Is Driven by Robust Growth… And Hesitation

For the fourth quarter, ALGN reported GAAP EPS of $1.20 per share. Wall Street had expected $1.14 per share. The company earned only 13 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Revenues of $534.02 million also came in $19.4 million higher than expectations. They also increased 26.7% from year-ago levels when the company reported quarterly revenue of $421.3 million.

The stock might have experienced a carryover of some of the emotion from the previous earnings report. Like many tech stocks, ALGN stock peaked in early October. It then began to plunge. That culminated in a one-day drop of about 20% following its third-quarter earnings report.

Align stock has remained in a range since. However, the initial drop following Q4 earnings may have served as a catalyst for an upward move.

Given the Q4 numbers, it makes little sense that Align stock plunged at the market open. Yes, the average selling prices on its popular Invisalign clear aligners fell on a year-over-year basis. Invisalign differentiates Align from firms such as Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) -- who focus more on consumables and equipment. For this reason, Invisalign-related news often drives the equity. Still, with overall profit growth much higher, that fact seems less relevant.

### Earnings May Have Become a Catalyst for Align Stock

Traders appear to have come to the same conclusion. Align stock began the trading day by falling almost 7% from the previous close. However, by the middle of the day, the stock was trading above levels of the prior day.

I think the early buyers made the correct call. ALGN's forward P/E ratio stands at around 40.

Diluted earnings also increased by 73.9% for the year to $4.92 per share. The current 2019 earnings forecast of $5.83 per share would take profit growth down to 18.5%. Still, considering those growth levels, the P/E does not appear elevated.

Admittedly, valuations had probably moved ahead of themselves following the increases ALGN saw for most of 2018. Many key patents on Invisalign expired at the end of 2017. When traders saw profit increases continuing without the Invisalign patent protection, they continued to bid up the stock price for 2018. This set up for the fall that began in October. As a result, Align stock has fallen by about 45% from its 52-week high.

However, ALGN stock now trades at a much lower multiple. With its years-long track record of double-digit earnings increases expected to continue, investors should treat any moment of panic as a buying opportunity.

### The Bottom Line on Align Stock

In an ironic twist, signs of softness in pricing may have become the catalyst that Align stock needs to resume growth. ALGN handily beat earnings and revenue expectations in its Q4 report. However, the stock initially sold off as reports of lower pricing for its Invisalign orthodontic product weighed on the equity.

Still, as the trading day went on, buyers erased that loss and bid the ALGN stock price above yesterday's closing levels. Traders likely saw an opportunity as the company growth levels remain on track. If the move higher continues, the bright smiles that Align makes possible will go well beyond the orthodontic practices it serves.

Whether or not you own General Electric stock, to see this once-iconic industrial name fall out of favor and then fight so hard for its survival has been fascinating to watch. It's also turned into an incredible case study of what not to do, only to then become an -- even if not yet definitely successful -- example of a respected turnaround effort.

The challenge for current and would-be owners of General Electric stock is looking past the noise and dust and figuring out what's really going on with the company.

It's still a moving target, with the GE stock price ebbing and flowing thanks to an ever-changing set of valuation criteria. But a handful of these factors are important enough and permanent enough to focus on right now. Here's a look at the top three pros and cons of General Electric stock.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



### 3 Pros of General Electric Stock

1.Improving Investor Sentiment

Just a few months ago, GE could do nothing right. Falling from a 2016 peak near $33 to what finally looked like a bottom near $12 in September of last year, General Electric stock had the rug pulled out from underneath it again in November. In December, it fell below $7.

Since then, GE stock has bounced back to $9. That price is still only a fraction of its former self. But it's the most sustained bullishness towards General Electric stock we've seen from investors in years. That's a start.

2&#92;. New, Outsider CEO

Sometimes a new CEO has to have prior experience in a sector related to the company he or she is leading. Other times, the CEO needs to have worked for years at the company. But occasionally an outsider's point of view is needed to see what others can't (or won't) about a company's implosion.

Larry Culp, the former CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), thus far has been a fresh set of eyes that have sought the truth, good or bad. Truth-seeking can lead to intelligent decision-making. Culp's approach contrasts with that of his predecessor, longtime GE CEO Jeff Immelt, who in retrospect has been criticized for cultivating a &quot;success theater&quot; that failed to solve problems.

3&#92;. Pushing Harder to Divest

He'll only go down as a footnote in GE's history, but between Immelt and Culp, John Flannery was at the helm for roughly a year.

He was brought in largely to repair the damage sustained under Immelt's watch. Flannery sought to accomplish that task primarily by selling some divisions and divesting from others to offset the company's growing debt

Flannery was in charge when General Electric's locomotive unit was sold to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB). He wasn't moving quickly enough to suit most shareholders, though, while Culp seems to have picked up the pace.

### 3 Cons of GE Stock

1.Tons of Debt

It's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. As of the end of the third quarter, General Electric was sitting on $115 billion of debt and another $70 billion worth of insurance and compensation liabilities.

It can't afford to leave those liabilities on the books, but selling revenue-bearing assets may not help enough to matter. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch recently crunched the numbers, concluding &quot;By subtracting asset sale proceeds from total company liabilities of $225bn to $274bn, we derive total company (post sale) liabilities of $144bn to $203bn. After then incorporating the market value of the Industrial assets ($71bn to $78n) and Capital assets ($111bn to $129bn), we impute a value for GE equity between -$2.47 to +$7.11, or just over $2/share at the midpoint.&quot;

2&#92;. The Power Division

GE is a diversified conglomerate that needs all of its divisions to perform well. But the one unit that absolutely has to shine isn't and may not for a long, long while.

That's the Power arm, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of the company's revenue. The unit's sales fell 33% during the third quarter, resulting in a significant loss for the unit. Moreover, the Power division didn't perform much better in Q4..

3&#92;. Analysts Are Still Skeptical About General Electric Stock

While investors may be on board with the turnaround effort thus far, analysts aren't. Any rebound that's going to last will need the support of these pros sooner rather than later. As of the latest look, the analyst community collectively rates General Electric stock closer to a &quot;Hold&quot; than a &quot;Buy&quot; (that's alarming, given analysts' generally bullish bias). And that's after a number of upgrades of General Electric stock that occurred between October and December.

The doubters aren't letting up. JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, right before GE's Q4 earnings were released , reiterated his concerns about its cash flow.

### The Bottom Line on General Electric Stock

There's more working in favor of GE stock than not right now, even if part of that tailwind is rooted in the fact that things literally couldn't get much, if any, worse. All of the company's problems are on the table and priced into General Electric stock.

Nevertheless, sentiment can overwhelm facts, and right now General Electric stock has proven it's vulnerable to mere doubts.

2019-02-08,"Investors have been waiting for over two years now for General Electric (NYSE:GE) to bottom. Since ending 2016 above $30, General Electric stock has been a disaster. GE stock would lose 80% of its value on its way to a nine-year low of $6.66 in December.But for the first time since 2016 (at least), there's real hope that the worst is over for GE. Before a pullback over the past few sessions, General Electric stock had bounced some 58% from those lows. That was its biggest rally since 2013. The company's Q4 earnings missed expectations, but as Larry Ramer detailed, GE's post-earnings commentary sparked optimism about the company's turnaround plans. Source: Shutterstock With GE stock back near $10, however, this looks like a case of too far, too fast. I argued back in May that a reasonable sum-of-the-parts analysis valued General Electric stock in the $9-$11 range. And it seems like investors, after the initial burst of GE stock, are coming to the same conclusion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio Developments since then haven't materially changed the value of GE stock. GE still has a debt problem; it still has a pension issue; and management sill admits that it will take years to fix the company's Power business.And so the optimism about GE stock, particularly after the Q4 report, looks a bit overdone. There are finally signs of hope for General Electric stock. But it will also take GE a long time to fix itself, and there are real questions about how much a fixed GE is worth. GE Stock Rallies After Its EarningsBroadly, I understand why there's optimism about GE stock at the moment. Larry Culp, who had tremendous success at Danaher (NYSE:DHR), took over as CEO in October. After GE struggled (to put it mildly) under Jeffrey Immelt and then John Flannery, that move alone helped restore some confidence in GE stock. (Indeed, GE shares rose on the news.)It's difficult to think of a company more in need of fresh blood in upper management roles. It's also hard to think of a company with more room for improvement.Culp's promise during the Q4 conference call to focus on paying down debt and fixing the Power business added to the turnaround case, as the CEO seemed well-prepared and realistic, but still upbeat about GE's future.So investors believe there's now someone who can fix GE's problems and that there's a path to do so. How General Electric Stock Can RecoverAt this point, GE bulls aren't unaware of the company's problems. Debt is an issue: the company's calculation of net debt (which includes pension and capital leases) totaled $121 billion at the end of 2018. That's greater than the market capitalization of GE stock. And the size of the debt load, plus GE's weakening profitability, led the three major rating agencies to downgrade GE debt late last year.But GE has myriad ways to raise cash. It's going to sell down its stake in Baker Hughes(NYSE:BHGE). Its healthcare IPO will lower its debt by about $18 billion and provide it with some cash in the process. The merger of GE's locomotive business with Wabtec (NYSE:WAB) will bring in a few billion dollars as well.Obviously, GE will lose cash flow as a result of these deals. But CFO Jamie Miller, on the Q4 call, estimated that some $50 billion of capital would be brought in over the next few years. Even after some of those funds are transferred back to GE Capital, the industrial side of the business should be able to cut its debt by over $30 billion.Meanwhile, the businesses that will remain, other than Power, look attractive. The Renewable Energy business is small by GE standards, but it's both profitable and growing. The Aviation business is even better, and investors like that sector, as shown by the performance of stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and RBC Bearings (NASDAQ:ROLL).So GE could conceivably recover. Its asset sales will improve its balance sheet. From there, a smaller, more nimble GE can drive profits from Aviation and Renewable Energy. And if GE can fix the Power division, it can exceed expectations. Reasons for CautionInvestors, then, have bid up GE stock because: a) they see a path to a turnaround; and, b) they believe Culp is the right CEO to lead those efforts. Truthfully, I'm not sure those investors are wrong on either front.But there are two questions after the big, recent rally. The first is GE Capital. A small charge in Q4 almost helped the cause because it suggested that GE was being honest in its accounting (something that hasn't always been the case) and that there were no more major problems left in that business.Just a year ago, the company disclosed a $6 billion-plus charge related to its long-term-care-insurance business. Investors have been worried that another proverbial shoe is likely to drop.Culp, in the Q&A portion of the Q4 call, was asked directly whether there were any more &quot;skeletons in the closet,&quot; and replied that the company was &quot;encouraged&quot; by its &quot;review of the unit.&quot; That said, GE Capital remains an accounting nightmare and it's far from out of the woods. The Valuation of GE StockThe broader issue, however, is valuation. It's tempting to believe that since GE stock went from $32 to under $7, it can rally back to $32 in time. That's unlikely to be the case, however. The valuation of the Power business isn't coming back; even management admitted on the Q4 call that the business has to shrink. GE Capital is much more dangerous than investors realized even 18 months ago.And after the rally, GE stock really isn't that cheap. GE's forward price-earnings multiple of around 11.5 doesn't seem that onerous. But GE's earnings have outpaced its cash flow for some time and will continue to do for several years. Its industrial-free-cash flow was just $4.5 billion in 2018, and GE expects it to decline in 2019.Power will take years to fix. The asset sales will help the balance sheet, but they will undercut its profitability. And GE still is going to have over $80 billion in net debt even after selling many of its better assets (including the Healthcare business).The turnaround of GE stock could succeed. But it's going to take years. If the economy turns in the meantime, or if GE stumbles, it will take even longer. And this is a business that's still generating minimal operating-cash flow and facing significant risks from GE Capital.Again, I argued in May that General Electric stock was worth $9-$11. I don't think that any of GE's recent moves have notably changed that assessment. Meanwhile, Power looks worse than it did nine months ago.Maybe Culp can find a way to make the company more valuable, but with GE stock just shy of $10, and that value still years away from materializing, I'm not sure investors need to rush to buy GE stock. And I understand why some investors, at least, have rushed to sell General Electric stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-02-11,"In the Harvard Business Review's September-October issue, former General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt wrote a piece called &quot;How I Remade GE.&quot; He provided advice like the willingness to pivot, be all in, be disciplined and so on. He then concluded: &quot;It will take years for GE to fully reap the benefits of the transformations. But as I contemplate my departure, I love where the company is positioned.&quot;Yes, this has turned out to be out-of-whack with reality! When he wrote this, General Electric stock was on its way to an epic plunge -- hitting lows in December that had not been seen since the financial crisis. Along the way, there was a slashing of the dividend, large asset write offs and government investigations. Investors were even aggressively buying up derivatives that wagered on potential debt defaults at the company.The situation seemed hopeless.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet the pessimism may have been too extreme. Since the start of the new year, General Electric stock has certainly pulled off an impressive rally, up about 30%. But this move is due more than just to technical factors. General Electric Still Has StrengthsLet's face it, GE still has many core advantages, such as an enormous global infrastructure and a powerful brand. The company also has extensive customer bases in businesses for commercial aircraft engines, turbines and healthcare equipment. In fact, the engine business is likely to remain a long-term growth driver as manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) continue to see robust order pipelines.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months But as for GE stock, perhaps the most important thing has been the hiring of Larry Culp as CEO in October. Even though he is only 55 years old, Culp has had a stellar career. From 2001 to 2014, he was at the helm of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), where he posted standout results for shareholders. He demonstrated adept skills in generating strong cash flows and pulling off smart deals. No doubt, such expertise should be a big help for GE stock.On the latest conference call, Culp set forth the key parts of his turnaround strategy, which involves wiping $50 billion in debt from the balance sheet. This will be done with a combination of cost efficiencies and the unloading of assets, such as the position in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE).Culp also discussed his playbook for management (he even referred to Jim Collins' legendary book, &quot;Good To Great&quot;). He noted that there will be much deeper analysis of the operations of each division, such as looking at materials purchasing, labor productivity, R&D and marketing He also said there will be fewer priorities; instead, the focus will be on higher strategic objectives. And most importantly, the main goal will be &quot;on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the U.S. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.&quot; Bottom Line On GE StockAll in all, Culp has done a fine job.  I also think it's a good bet he will not be wasting his time writing puff pieces for the Harvard Business Review.Yet despite this, there needs to be some realism with General Electric stock. The turnaround is in the early stages and there will likely be some tough challenges. It definitely does not help that the global economy is starting to decelerate. In the meantime, the power business is still in a funk -- and it could easily take a few years to get things back on track.  Then there are the issues of handling the federal investigations and the liabilities of the financial services business.So for the most part then, there is probably no rush to buy GE stock right now, especially since there has already been a big move in a short period of time.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-02-14,"The recent earnings report could mark the beginning of the turnaround for GE (NYSE:GE). The almost 16-year tenure of Jeff Immelt left the company in shambles. Before Immelt rose to the CEO position, GE stock maintained record highs and held the world's largest market cap.  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock However, many of Immelt's decisions brought devastation to GE. When Larry Culp took over after John Flannery's brief tenure, many had questioned GE's ability to survive. However, this outsider with a successful track record has brought new life to the company. Due to the confidence engendered and decisions made by Culp, a speculative buy case for General Electric stock has now appeared.  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks?  A General Electric Stock Turnaround?GE's problems are solvable, assuming we know their true nature. The seemingly endless litany of new issues devastated General Electric stock during Flannery's time as CEO. Now Culp appears to have at least come clean about the problems facing GE.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCulp, the former CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), took the helm in October. Since he took over, he cut the dividend to a token level of four cents per share. He also addressed the issues with GE's Power division, acknowledging its turnaround will take years.On Jan. 31, Culp strongly indicated that the constant drip of unreported problems may have finally come to an end. Earnings fell short of estimates by five cents per share. However, revenues of $33.3 billion beat expectations by $1.07 billion. Better than expected revenues from five of GE's divisions made up for the revenue shortfall at GE Power.This good news led to a relief rally as the stock rose by over 13% following the report. Like most, I see this as an overreaction, but an understandable one. Investors need to remember that GE still holds debt levels in excess of its $87 billion market cap. It also faces the largest known pension liability in corporate America. Moreover, this assumes that GE Capital does not hold toxic assets not yet revealed to the public. General Electric Stock as a Speculative PlayI still see GE Capital assets as a possible issue. For this reason, I would urge conservative investors to avoid General Electric stock. However, I see enough optimism and the potential for recovery to warrant a speculative position. To be sure, it will take years to bring about this resurgence.Investors will also have to get past the temporary cash flow losses that will come when it divests the healthcare division, the jet-leasing division, and the Baker Hughes stake.Still, the sale of divisions should fund the retirement of $26 billion in debt due in the next two years. Moreover, bright spots within GE remain, particularly in its aviation division. Also, even its troubled power division continues to perform well in some respects.Reuters reported that GE GE led the industry in the sale of gas turbines in 2018. Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHY) still holds the lead on new technology in this area. However, it offers hope that this core division can turn itself around. Hopefully, that will help propel a turnaround across the company, one that will reduce debt, push General Electric stock higher, and restore the reputation that bolstered GE for more than a century. Concluding Thoughts on GE StockCulp's honesty and focus on addressing the company's debt and pension problems have helped to build a speculative case for General Electric stock.General Electric still faces serious debt and pension problems. Management also admits that a turnaround at GE Power will take years. However, Culp's leadership has brought the honesty needed to address the company's issues.Now, with a plan to address the most immediate debts and to address the issues in the power division, GE stock has stopped falling. Barring any lingering issues from the former GE Capital, I believe the worst has come to an end for General Electric stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-02-25,"Now up nine weeks in a row, U.S. stocks began Monday with another surge. What could the catalyst be? Of course it's more positive trade talk. However, there are certainly a growing number of traders looking to pare down risk amid this massive rally. Let's look at some top stock trades to see what may be developing. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: S&P 500 ETFThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) has been on an absolute tear, jumping 19% in the past two months. I get it, though. The Fed is back on the &quot;bulls' team&quot; with interest rates on hold, while the trade war is seeing progress. Still, we have to be prepared for an eventually phase of consolidating and/or pulling back.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe SPY gapped right over the $278 area, a triple-top in October, November and December. This was my initial target once we began to rally. Ideally, we would see this level hold as support, but that essentially means that the SPY can't pullback from current levels -- only sideways consolidation would allow for that. However, this level could play a pullback role if we see a further rally in the SPY.  * 5 Big-Yield REITs to Check Out Now Instead, there's a little bit more wiggle room between $275 and $280, along with uptrend support and the 21-day moving average. Anything in or above this range still has me feeling pretty bullish on the SPY. For now, that also means over the 200-day moving average as well.Below the 21-day and my SPY confidence will take a hit. Same with being below the 200-day. Bulls don't want to see that. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: AmazonThis one has been surprisingly sleepy. It doesn't take a genius to realize that the market has been a stud since Christmas and that enterprise software and cloud stocks have been big-time outperformers. That is, except for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Admittedly, shares are up meaningfully from the bottom, climbing just over 20%. But for the year, it's been a mostly sideways affair, with AMZN chopping between $1,600 and $1,700. The 50-day has been support and the 100-day has been resistance.I don't like that the chart is squeezing it lower, but it sets investors up for a great &quot;go with the flow&quot; trade. Below the 50-day/$1,600 level and traders can sell Amazon. Above the 100-day/$1650 level and traders can buy the breakout. On a rally, look to see if AMZN can get above the 200-day and hit $1,750. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: NioJumping after a 60 Minutes showing, Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) is up almost 10% on Monday after closing right at key resistance near $8.15 on Friday. Now I want to see if this name can push through $9, a level that kept NIO from pressing higher back in September.If Nio is able to push through $9 with authority, this becomes investors new stop-loss level and the stock's new support level. If it acts as resistance, let's see if we can snag NIO down near $8.50 or even $8 again. The latter should certainly be support at this point, remember that. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: DanaherDanaher (NYSE:DHR) will buy General Electric's (NYSE:GE) biopharma unit $23.4 billion. The move has both stocks higher by about 8% on Monday, with Danaher exploding over range resistance.So now what?The obvious is to watch for a possible pullback in DHR, but the levels are harder to calculate. In this case, we can extend a couple of Fibonacci lines. Not ironically, Monday's highs come right at the 161.8% Fib extension based on the 2019 trading range. The 138.2% extension near $120 could act act as support over the ensuing days.However, the 2019 range is pretty short, so if we do the same thing vs. the 52 range, we end up with a slightly larger range. In that case, the 138.2% level comes into play near $121.90, while the 161.8% extension is still up near $127. Investors can decide which of these levels to use, if any, based on their risk tolerance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: CiscoThis large cap giant broke out a little more than a week ago on strong earnings and hasn't look back. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is reaching overbought territory though and could use some rest. Short-term bulls may consider using $50 as their stop, the breakout point from last week.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade Above that level and the 8-day moving average though, and it's hard to be too bearish on CSCO stock, however overbought it may be. Let's see how this one trades over the next few days and whether it gains or loses steam.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Still, up more than 50% from its December low, clearly the crowd believes in GE again.Not the whole crowd though.J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa is no stranger to being in the minority. Good thing too. His price target of $6.00 for GE stock is not only well below the stock's current price near $10.70, it's also the lowest target sported by Wall Street's pros.And yet, Tusa's view of General Electric may be the most sound, and least swayed by hollow hope.&quot;At this stage of the game, the math is the math,&quot; says Tusa, who believed GE's free cash flow for the current year will be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. Tusa goes on to explain, however, &quot;I can tell you right now, that $10 per share does not reflect where fundamentals currently stand.&quot;&quot;They are giving a massive amount of benefit to a significant swing in Power, from negative $3.0 billion in free cash to probably about $1.0 billion(+) in free cash over the next three years,&quot; continues Tusa, who adds &quot;and they are also assuming that GE Capital is zero [in free cash flow]&quot; when the company's capital arm is still bleeding cash.&quot;Tusa doesn't think the company's Power arm will flip to profitability that quickly. He also points out &quot;GE Capital is not a zero [in terms of cash burn]. GE Capital is a substantial negative … [with] significant drags over the next couple of years.&quot; Missed OpportunityWhile not intended to be a shot against Culp or his plan (Tusa likes and respects Culp), the analyst's response did resonate with more than a handful of investors that re-read Culp's letter. The goals were compelling.They just weren't accompanied by a plausible plan to meet them. What does &quot;We are investing in high-tech industries where we have large, mission-critical installed bases with high potential for aftermarket services and parts&quot; mean, exactly?It's not a damning indictment of the company or GE stock. A letter from a CEO to shareholders isn't the proper forum to lay out specifics about a plan of action anyway. Those matters are generally dished out in pieces, as they become relevant. They're also often concealed to prevent competitors from disrupting those plans.General Electric isn't an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) though, which would benefit from such top-secret initiatives. GE is an open book. The market knows it's got too much debt, not enough cash flow, and too many lingering liabilities with its Capital arm. Its Renewable Energy division holds promise, but its growth outlook is best measured in years, if not decades. Its Aviation arm is impressive, but that's a crowded field.If there was ever a time to talk about specifics beyond 'fewer, more impactful priorities,' Culp's letter to investors would have been it. Reality Check for GE Stock HoldersOr, perhaps the lack of details is a subtle hint of something else … that there are no details to speak of. It's a premise that typically doesn't fly on neither Wall Street nor Main Street. Investors love certainty and abhor ambiguity.When it comes to GE, however, there is no elegant grand plan investors can readily latch onto.The only plan to speak of right now is selling assets until its debt bomb has been defused, and to hang on for dear life while it figures out how to collect more in revenue than it spends. There's nothing elegant about bailing water out of a boat. Speed is the key; the patch job tends to be ugly.Nevertheless, Larry Culp is still one of the most qualified -- if not the most qualified -- to lead that bailing and patching before GE sinks to the bottom of the ocean. If nothing else, his calmness and coolness provide a glimmer of hope.Let's see if the market is as optimistic about Culp a year from now, when the company has to start improving cash flow with its remaining pieces. By that point, GE stock owners should start demanding the product-based and service-based specifics that are missing thus far. If they don't get them then …As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-06,"For the past several years, industrial conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) has been on a continuous downtrend. Once one of the most important, valuable, and influential companies in the world, GE has turned into a shell of its former self thanks to mismanagement, an unbearable debt load, and a lack of company-wide innovation. This has led to GE stock turning into one of Wall Street's biggest losers for the past several years.Source: Shutterstock But GE stock has surprisingly turned into a big winner in early 2019. Year-to-date, General Electric stock is up 30%, as the technicals, fundamentals, and sentiment of GE stock have all meaningfully improved in 2019. Can this rally last? Is this the beginning of a multi-year rebound by GE stock? Or has the rally already come and gone?  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News That's tough to say. GE is making all the right moves to downsize and simplify its operations. Consequently, the GE of tomorrow will have stable, healthy growth with dramatically lower leverage and significantly higher margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the GE of tomorrow will also be much smaller and potentially have even less growth potential. Indeed, although GE is downsizing its operations and cutting its operational fat, CEO Larry Culp recently said that he expects its industrial-free-cash flow to be negative in 2019.In other words, things are getting better at GE, but not that much better. As a result, after GE stock rallied over the past few months, the risk-reward profile of General Electric stock at this point in time seems neither favorable nor unfavorable. It simply seems balanced. Balanced isn't a good enough reason to buy this stock, considering the lack of clarity of the company's long-term outlook and the recent rally of GE stock. As a result, I think investors should wait before buying into the rally of GE. All the Right MovesGE's management and GE stock are making all the right moves, and that's why GE stock is up 30% in 2019.Importantly, GE stock held the critical technical level of $6.66, which was the stock's long-term level of support that dates all the way back to 2009. Not only did GE stock hold that level, but it bounced off that level in a big way. Indeed, ever since, General Electric stock is up about 40%. That's a big move which implies that GE stock has indeed put in a bottom.More importantly, GE's management is doing everything right as it looks to reduce the company's leverage and improve its operational stability and profitability. Namely, the company is shedding assets rapidly.Among the assets that GE has sold are its transportation unit {to Wabtec (NYSE:WAB),} its biopharma business {to Danaher (NYSE:DHR),} and its Intelligent Platforms business {to Emerson (NYSE:EMR)}. Taken together,  these downsizing moves have simplified the company's operations, improved its long-term profitability outlook, brought cash onto its balance sheet, and reduced its leverage.In other words, things look good for GE stock. Everything that needed to happen is happening. The stock held its long-term level of support. Assets are being sold. Leverage is being reduced. Operations are being simplified.As long as the company's management continues to make these type of strategic and value-adding moves, it's tough to see General Electric stock falling. But it's equally hard to see GE stock resuming its rapid run higher. Balanced Risk-RewardThe biggest concern about GE stock is that the company is &quot;selling its future to try and maintain the present&quot;, as J.P. Morgan's Stephen Tusa pointed out in a recent note.Tusa was referring to the company's decision to sell the more valuable assets of its Aviation Services business. But the statement has broader applications. GE is selling a ton of assets. Many of those assets aren't half-bad. Some are even good, like GE Healthcare.To be sure, spinning off those businesses does provide a large amount of cash inflows, which are necessary to reduce the company's unsustainable debt load. But, while debt reduction is an admirable goal, investors should ask: what's next? What happens after the debt load is reduced, but many of the businesses are gone? Will General Electric stock have a bright future at that point?No one knows the answers to those questions right now. The only tangible insight we do have is that the company's industrial-free-cash-flow is expected to be negative this year, and that isn't good news.So given the enormous lack of clarity regarding what exactly will be left of GE in two to three years and the recent negative news, it's tough to see GE stock rallying in the foreseeable future. The Bottom Line on GE StockThe big rebound of General Electric stock has already happened. The next leg higher will have to be driven by improvements in its fundamental growth outlook. Such improvements can only come via increased clarity with respect to what GE will look like in two to three years. Until GE's long-term outlook is clearer, GE stock will struggle to stay on its winning trajectory.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

With the shares hovering at around $9.50 a piece, what should he do?Source: Shutterstock My first reaction was to scream &quot;sell!&quot;. Then it looked like new CEO Larry Culp had a handle on things, selling GE's biopharma assets to his former employer, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion. The stock rose back to more than $10 per share.Maybe, hold, I thought?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNo. Culp said this week that GE Power will be burning cash for years and with that, GE stock fell back to its March 7 opening bid of $9.09.

The reader's note infuriated me. How could a financial professional keep a client aboard this plane while it crashed?  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble Worrying about GE, predicting either its recovery or imminent demise, has become a cottage industry as John Flannery, then Larry Culp, struggled to come to grips with the value destruction wrought by Jeff Immelt.The problem is GE Power. Immelt bet the company on oil and gas just as renewable energy, especially efficiency, was taking off. Then came production problems. Too Early?Culp, who built Danaher into a cutting-edge technology conglomerate before taking early retirement at the Harvard Business School, a few miles from Immelt's new Boston headquarters, has a different plan.Instead of spinning out GE Health, as Flannery planned, Culp seems determined to keep it. Cutting-edge health technology was at the heart of his success at Danaher.Culp has even talked about restoring the dividend which, if it returned to its original level, 30 cents per share, would yield more than 10% at the stock's current price. If he could fix the cash flow problems at GE Power, the rest of the company -- aviation, health care, and renewable energy -- can succeed.Culp said all the right things and seemed to be doing the right things. Some analysts began coming around. Others counseled patience.Then came the news on industrial cash flow. Even with all its troubles, GE still generated $4.5 billion in industrial free cash flow last year. Now Culp says that will be negative in 2019. The Bottom Line on GE StockCulp seems like an honorable man. Flannery also seemed like an honorable man. Even Immelt, in his heyday, was considered an honorable man. They are all honorable men, yet the body of General Electric remains there, bleeding on the floor, as we approach the ides of March.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Culp admits he can't fix GE Power this year, or even next year. It will continue to drag down results. Meanwhile the company's debt, which now amounts to more than 3.5 times its equity, must be paid, with $26 billion maturing in the next few years. Culp is now thinking of selling part of the renewables business.There are analysts who, even today, pound the table for GE stock. These people are fools.You may get a better price for General Electric stock tomorrow or the next day. Stock prices are volatile. But it won't be much higher, not for years, not until Culp can see the light at the end of the current dark tunnel.Until then your money should be doing something else.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-20,"Everywhere you turn, the fundamental prospects for General Electric (NYSE:GE) remains shrouded in doubt. As new CEO Larry Culp highlighted recently, the embattled organization is currently embarking on a &quot;reset&quot; year. By 2020, investors should see substantive improvements, which naturally bolster the case for General Electric stock.Source: Shutterstock Of course, we have one glaring problem with this forecast. After years of dreadful market performances, the industrial giant simply lacks credibility.Sure, the GE stock price has gained over 42% since the January opener. Under normal circumstances, this would spark much celebration. But try telling that to stakeholders that bought months earlier.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, in 2018, General Electric stock dropped an alarming 56%. To break even, shares would need to jump an additional 61%. That's really where the speculative argument wears thin for most prospective buyers. GE intrigued swing-traders during last December's rock-bottom valuations, but not so much at present levels.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them  Poor Fundamentals and GE StockFor many years, analysts and stakeholders blasted former CEO Jeff Immelt for destroying a once-iconic American institution. You don't have to deep-dive the Google search engine to find a litany of criticisms.But I must give credit to our own Dana Blankenhorn for dressing Immelt down in a blisteringly humorous way. Back in the summer of 2017, Blankenhorn warned readers that he's not interested in General Electric stock unless Immelt leaves. He wrote:Immelt's exit may be the stock's only hope. Everything he touches turns into tin, and what he lets go turns at least into silver.Take Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), the credit card unit spun out to shareholders in 2014. Since then, Synchrony is up 43% and GE 13.5%.If you think that sounds good for GE, the S&P 500 is up almost 19% since then.Of course, Blankenhorn's wish came true, first with John Flannery's short tenure, and later with Culp. The bad news, though, is that the GE stock price has only received a negative impact. Since Culp's hiring, shares are down 12%, inclusive of this year's incredible rally.As many analysts, including our own James Brumley pointed out, Culp is an outsider. Formerly head of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Culp is refreshingly a straight-shooter regarding GE's problems. However, his idea involves a rather predictable and unimaginative tactic: divest like there's no tomorrow.Certainly, getting rid of underperforming assets, particularly when you're neck-deep in debt, offers tremendous value. But it also sacrifices future revenue streams, which General Electric stock can't afford.Therefore, Culp can't &quot;talk up&quot; shares with mere straight-talk. The substance just doesn't exist, which likely limits the GE stock price. General Electric Stock Needs a Higher PowerSo with the stark bearishness against General Electric stock, am I also running for the hills? I don't blame you if that's your mentality. No matter how you look at this company, it's an extraordinarily-risky proposition. That said, I can't shake the feeling that GE has at least one shock rally left in it.First, investor sentiment has shifted very favorably for General Electric stock, but it's difficult to see. It's a shame that Culp took over when he did, right when the broader markets melted down. Personally, I view GE's volatility in the final quarter of 2018 more as a secular breakdown rather than as an individual defect.But the biggest surprise factor for GE could come from arguably its most disappointing segment, power. Last year, I wrote about the inherent inefficiencies of so-called renewable-energy sources. Although platforms like wind and solar appeal from a marketing perspective, they're not panaceas.While renewable energy &quot;works,&quot; it is difficult to scale. If you want more energy, you need more real estate. But most countries aren't like the U.S. blessed with abundant territory. As human populations increase, space comes at a premium.You then have the inevitable question: is clean energy worth sacrificing land that could be used for additional housing? At some point, that answer becomes no. This is where the company's power division saves the day. Simply put, traditional power plants are both space and cost-effective.Of course, I've been very wrong about the direction that General Electric stock ultimately took. But if you've got the patience -- and isn't this what everyone is saying now? -- GE could legitimately surprise you.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-26,"Editor's Note: This article is part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. James Brumley's pick is the Invesco Water Resources ETF (NASDAQ:PHO).Long-term bets on the Powershares Water Resource Portfolio (NASDAQ:PHO) fund are finally starting to pay off. Over the course of the past twelve months, PHO stock has gained around 12%, versus a more modest 8% gain for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).The performance of the water-minded ETF is even better -- relatively and on an absolute basis -- when limiting the look to just the first quarter. Whereas the S&P 500 is up just a little more than 11% since the end of last year, PHO stock has gained almost 19%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is the kind of &quot;aha&quot; moment we've been waiting on since the beginning of 2018, when the Best ETFs Contest ultimately began.The performance of the Powershares Water Resource Portfolio isn't the most compelling aspect of PHO stock here, however. It's that the fund's constituents have been so uniformly bullish of late after a couple clunkers took a big toll on last year's bottom line. PHO ETF Leading the ChargeOwners of the Powershares Water Resource mostly have Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT) to thank for fund's market-beating performance.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend Waters was a bit of a disappointment for the better part of last year, slumping in front of a third-quarter revenue miss that ultimately prompted Goldman Sachs to downgrade WAT stock to a &quot;sell.&quot; The analytical firm feared more of the same kind of weakness lay ahead.In retrospect, though, its Q3 results and the downgrade may have served as a catharsis and capitulation for Waters. Although WAT stock ultimately hit a new 52-week low in December (as most stocks did), shares have rallied more than 40% in the meantime. Fourth-quarter earnings of $2.87 per share not only topped estimates of $2.65, the company offered current-year profit guidance well in excess of expectations.Danaher is another name that has finally come around following a lackluster 2018. The stock's up 35% for the past twelve months, but all of that gain has been logged just since its late-December low. The stock was spurred higher by a solid Q4 print, though was acting bullish before that late-January report, and has continued to push higher in the meantime.  Click to Enlarge All of the fund's constituents, however, have been solid performers in recent weeks, with the need for better water-management slowly but surely becoming evident in solutions-providers' bottom lines.Still, most investors underestimate just how big the problem of potable water -- or lack thereof -- really is. A Thirst for SolutionsIt's a resource most anyone reading this likely takes for granted. Most investors only have to turn a knob at a faucet, open the refrigerator or press a button at work to have instant access to (seemingly) all the water they want.But they may not realize how close demand is to exceeding supply.Yes, it's a third-world problem, but not just a third-world problem. One only has to look at the ongoing disaster in Flint, Michigan to realize just how troubled the United States' aging infrastructure is. The lead contamination is abating, but it took too long to clean up, and any trace of lead is still too much lead.Meanwhile, London (England), El Paso, Atlanta and San Francisco are just some of the major names that may soon, literally, run out of water.Part of the problem is simply a lack of supply. Although desalination works, it has proven prohibitively expensive. Purification of used water also works, but it too can be costly, and the nation's current water-scrubbing infrastructure is quickly becoming inadequate.The trouble doesn't merely lie in processing water, however. The United States, like most other developed or undeveloped nations, struggles just to get clean, potable water from point A to point B. Globally, the world loses an estimated two trillion gallons of drinking water every year simply due to leaky pipes.Patching them won't be cheap or easy though. The American Water Works Association estimates that the U.S. alone will need to spend at least $1 trillion upgrading and overhauling existing water transportation and processing infrastructure. Anything any organization can do to use less water, or recycle their own, in the meantime is a huge step in the right direction… a step that most institutions can take.That's where most of the names that make up the Powershares Water Resource Portfolio are aiming. Bottom Line for PHO StockIt's certainly a different kind of stock pick. It's much more than a trade. Indeed, owning PHO stock is much more than an investment in an undervalued and underappreciated sector. It's an investment in a concept … a concept so big and so philosophical that it's often difficult to see.The rewards are there, though, for the truly patient investor. While PHO was a lackluster performer since the Best ETFs Contest began in early 2018, it's battling for the lead as we near the end of the first quarter of 2019, and is well ahead of the broad market's return for that full fifteen-month stretch just in the past three months.These names are starting to collectively reap their due rewards, even if most investors don't realize the undertow that has taken shape.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29,"Investors seem torn between letting go of shares of General Electric (NYSE: GE) stock or holding it in the hopes of recovering some of their losses.Source: Shutterstock While in the short-term the rebound of GE stock could fade, one thing is certain: the conglomerate is in the midst of a turnaround. More importantly, this rebound will take multiple years. GE's CEO, Larry Culp, will need to first sell off its non-core businesses and lower the company's debt, and then turn his focus towards growing its business.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business  GE's StrengthsCulp always said that the company's biggest strength is its team that is ready to win. It has a valuable customer installed base in a number of businesses that can grow going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGE has 70,000 engines, over 7,000 gas turbines, and over 40,000 wind turbines in the market. To grow its existing businesses , GE must leverage its strong franchises to capture a bigger market share.The big point of emphasis for those who are bearish on General Electric stock is GE's weak balance sheet. Major Challenges AheadGE's debt is putting a strain on its balance sheet. Its cash flow faces headwinds due to the problems of GE Capital. Restructuring is expensive, and GE's pension commitments loom. Its Power division, which sells gas turbines in the 25-30 GW range, faces excess capacity. Turnaround PlanGE has agreed to sell all or parts of its Transportation, Baker Hughes, and BioPharma units. BioPharma will bring in around $20 billion, BHGE $12 billion, and transportation $6 billion. That totals $38 billion in cash that GE can use to pay down debt.GE Capital had $66 billion in debt in 2018. Conversely, the unit had $15 billion in cash.The company's Power unit is often in the news because of its quality issues, so GE must repair this business. At a conference, GE identified three reasons for Power's underperformance. First, the unit was slow to recognize and adapt to market realities. Second, it had non-operational headwinds and debts that it had to pay off. Third, weak management of the unit in the last few years caused its results to be weak.The owners of General Electric stock have hoped the other units will counter Power's weakness. Given the strength in the aviation and aerospace market, the results of GE's aviation unit should continue to be strong. Financial ForecastsGE has a goal of lowering the net debt/EBITDA ratio of its industrial businesses to  under 2.5.  In 2018, GE's industrial units had a net debt of $55 billion. The closing of the BioPharma sale by the end of this year, plus the sale of Baker Hughes, will help GE get to that favorable debt/equity level.GE forecast that the free-cash flow of its industrial units would be positive by next year. Investors, who bid General Electric stock to over $11 after the company announced the $21 billion Biopharma unit sale to Danaher (NYSE:DHR), had hoped the unit's FCF would be positive sooner. Potential Catalysts for General Electric StockWhat are the potential positive drivers of GE stock besides asset sales? Stronger performances from healthcare and aviation could give investors some encouragement. GE management forecast a meaningful improvement in FCF in 2020-2021 due to strength from its renewables, aviation, and healthcare, businesses, along with the positive impact of its restructuring initiatives. The Valuation of General Electric StockGE stock has traded near the $10 mark since February. The trading volume of General Electric stock has declined in recent weeks, even though the company has been more open about its challenges and outlook. Most notably, Culp acknowledged its multiple issues,  but General Electric stock still didn't drop much below $10. The Bottom Line on General Electric StockGE stock is not for everyone. Value investors looking for a quick turnaround play should buy something else. But patient investors with a time frame of at least two or three years may want to start a position in GE stock at its current levels. If  Culp can repeat the success he had in turning around Danaher,  then General Electric stock will be higher in a few years.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-29,"3M (NYSE:MMM) stock plunged in Thursday trading on an earnings miss. MMM stock fell by about 13% as the company's first-quarter results missed analysts' consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The 13% plunge was the largest one-day decline for MMM stock since the 1987 stock-market crash.Source: Shutterstock However, after the drop, the valuation of MMM stock has reached lower-than-average levels. Moreover, the company's extensive record of dividend increases and its continuing innovation should bolster it over the long-term. Given MMM's valuable product lines and its financial stability, the question of whether to buy 3M stock does not come down to if investors should do so, but to when they should buy it  * 7 U.S. Shale Oil Stocks to Buy as Prices Rise  MMM Missed Consensus Estimates by Large AmountsIn the first quarter, 3M earned $2.23 per share of MMM stock. That came in well below analysts'  consensus estimate of $2.50 per share and under the $2.49 per share the company made in the same quarter last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLikewise, MMM's revenue of $7.86 billion came in $160 million below what analysts, on average,  had expected. It also represents a 5.1% decline from the same quarter last year.3M's product lines go well beyond Post-it Notes and the tape found in desk drawers. MMM also sells products for cleaning, personal health care, home improvement, sports, and other items that consumers use every day. Both individuals and businesses utilize 3M 's products.Despite the nominal strength of the economy, the net income of every division of 3M fell in Q1, and the top line of every segment except health care declined.  The health care division's revenue only increased 0.3%. Moreover, the revenue of the company's U.S. and Asia-Pacific regions dropped. In China, growth in Chinese currency, excluding acquisitions, dropped by 3.6%. In the U.S., MMM's growth fell by a more modest 0.4%. MMM Stock Is Cheap and May Become CheaperNonetheless, InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth called MMM an equity to &quot;buy and hold forever.&quot; He may have a point. Despite the company's results, it's still faring much better than GE (NYSE:GE). Also,  the company's 60-year streak of annual dividend increases should remain intact. Even though 3M's profits declined, the company can easily afford to maintain and increase its current annual dividend of $5.76 per share.The question is  whether traders  should buy MMM stock now or wait. Although 3M's profit will probably increase very little this year, analysts, on average, predicts its profits will rise 7% in 2020. Furthermore, even after Thursday's drop, the forward price-earnings ratio of MMM stock come in at about 16.8.That is well below the average of MMM stock over the last five years. It also makes MMM much cheaper than Danaher (NYSE:DHR), another industrial conglomerate. As a result, making an initial purchase of MMM stock might make sense at this point.However,MMM's P/E multiple also remains higher than the low and mid-teen P/E ratios at which 3M stock traded immediately following the financial crisis. It might be a good idea to wait for the stock to reach such valuations again before buying a large amount of MMM. Still, the world has and will continue to benefit from 3M's innovations. Consequently, MMM stock should be bought on the post-earnings  pullback. Final Thoughts on MMM StockAlthough the multiples of MMM stock have been lower in the past, it now trades at levels that will benefit new, long-term investors.However, MMM stock has recovered from more significant downturns. It will more than likely recover from this one too. Investors should also not forget that, despite the fluctuations of MMM stock, the company has increased its annual dividend  for 60 straight years.With the demand for 3M's products poised to continue to grow over the long-term, the question is not whether to buy MMM stock, but when to buy MMM.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-03,"The stock market tends to overreact to both news and trends. Up until 2016, the market assumed that General Electric's (NYSE:GE) modestly improving operating results would continue, ignoring mounting problems under the hood. In late 2018, the market went too far in the other direction.Source: Shutterstock After GE stock tumbled from $30 to as low as $6.66, the pendulum swung too far the other way. This set up a huge buying opportunity, with some astute knife-catchers netting quick 50% gains from General Electric. At this point, however, I have to start to wonder if sentiment is getting a little bit too bullish again. All in all, $10 seems like a reasonable price for GE stock, but don't expect more huge upside moves from General Electric anytime soon.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away  Tusa Rains on the ParadeStephen Tusa has been GE stock owners' worst nightmare over the past few years. The J.P. Morgan analyst famously went negative on GE stock in May 2016, when it was trading for around $30 per share. Over the years, he's kept making prophetic warnings about the state of General Electric's business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven how rare it is for analysts to take a strongly negative position on a stock and stick with it, Tusa has earned a reputation as a credible analyst. He recently further enhanced his standing  with his prescient bearish call on 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock. 3M tumbled more than 10% - its worst one-day plunge in more than a decade - following its miserable earnings report in April. Tusa saw it coming.In any case, Tusa upgraded General Electric from his long-standing &quot;sell&quot; rating up to &quot;neutral&quot; in December. That closely coincided with GE stock's famous $6.66 bottom. While Tusa still had a lot of questions for General Electric, he thought GE could turn itself around, and GE stock consequently rallied.In April, however, Tusa warned that the turnaround was not going according to plan. Not only did he drop General Electric stock back to &quot;underweight,&quot; but he actually trimmed his price target on GE stock from $6 to $5 per share.He wrote: &quot;We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE while overestimating the value of small positives.&quot; And Tusa makes some fair points. In particular, even most General Electric bulls will admit that the company's 2019 is shaping up to be underwhelming. GE Stock Will Only Drop to $5 If This HappensA key point in Tusa's bearish thesis is that GE stock can get pulverized if another recession hits before the company can clean up its balance sheet. Tusa accurately warns that the company's debt load is persistently high, while its cash flow generation remains weak. Given General Electric's considerable leverage to the economy, a recession could deliver a killer blow to GE at this point.But the owners of GE stock should relax.  The U.S. probably won't enter a recession for at least a year. Despite all the fretting and panicking that occurred in late 2018, the economy held firm and is now looking up. The recently released GDP results came in above 3%, easily surpassing analysts' consensus outlook.Meanwhile, consumer figures look reasonably strong as well. Sure, there are some relatively weak spots, like autos and housing. On the whole, however, the economy is robust. Additionally, there's still a ton of stimulus in the system from Trump's tax cuts. Throw in the news this week that there appears to be bipartisan support for two trillion dollars of new infrastructure funding, and General Electric should find plenty of fresh contracts and opportunities to pursue.Tusa's point, however, is correct in isolation. The clock is ticking quickly for GE. General Electric needs to clean up its business, pay down its debt, and get its cash flow to more reliable levels. If a recession arrives in the back half of 2019, that would be awful news for General Electric. But that's not a likely scenario. General Electric Is Making ProgressIt's important to remember when considering Tusa's bearish view that General Electric is getting stuff done. In particular, it sold its biopharma operations to Danahar (NYSE:DHR) for a cool $21.4 billion.  Another meaningful move was the merger of its transportation business. It also sold a portion of its lighting business to private equity firms earlier this year, and GE is working on other deals.There have been advances in other areas as well. Other analysts have pointed to decreasing uncertainty about the company's insurance liabilities. Furthermore, the rising stock market should have a favorable impact on GE's pension funding issues. The Verdict on GE StockGeneral Electric didn't collapse in a day. It cratered during the financial crisis due to aggressive credit deals. Even then, it bounced back enough to hide the rot of its core industrial businesses for another decade. With an organization as huge as GE, things don't break all at once.Similarly, General Electric can't be completely fixed in a day, either. CEO Larry Culp has been on the job barely six months. He's already accomplished a lot during his tenure. Bears such as Tusa are right to say that much more needs to be done.But it seems harsh to be cutting the stock's price target at this point, especially since economic conditions remain favorable. That said, bulls may become overly exuberant. General Electric still has to make a lot of progress before it can become a steady blu- chip stock again. At $10, GE stock is fairly priced and balances General Electric's risks and rewards equally.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

That is good news, but the resurgence in General Electric stock this year does not mean all the controversy is behind the embattled company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Earlier this week, General Electric tempered enthusiasm regarding a recovery in its power-plant business, prompting at least one analyst to speculate the company is not being entirely transparent about the goings on at that unit.&quot;On Wednesday, GE said its power unit will need at least three years to halt its cash hemorrhage and restore its prior cash flow to double-digit cash margins,&quot; reports Reuters. &quot;GE has said it expects to lose up to $2 billion in cash this year, mostly due to the power unit.&quot; Skepticism and GE StockIn a note out Wednesday, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa displayed skepticism about GE's ability to quickly turnaround the power-plant business while noting the company appears more committed to managing headline risk rather than improving the power-plant business.&quot;We see nothing here to change our negative view on Power, more so evidence of a company that appears to manage to headlines rather than on-the-ground fundamentals,&quot; said Tusa in a note to clients.The analyst is a noted GE bear. Last month, Tusa lowered his rating on General Electric stock to Underweight from Neutral while lowering his price target on the shares to $5 from $6. That is well below the average analyst price target of $12.76. GE stock traded just over $10 as of this writing.While there are reasons to be concerned with GE's power-plant business. Data from the company indicates the business is notching some growth. In the first quarter, GE's power-plant business booked six orders for the HA-class turbines, up from zero a year earlier. That means GE landed more orders than rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Siemens AG.On the other hand, there are potential long-term risks in the gas-powered turbine business for any company with exposure to this industry because prices for alternative energy are declining, making cheaper and cleaner solar and wind more attractive to utility providers. The Bottom Line on GE StockThe power-plant unit is not the only potential risk to General Electric stock. GE's effort to sell its biopharma business to rival conglomerate Danaher Corp. (NYSE:DHR) is in jeopardy and that is significant because GE is expecting to land $20 billion in much needed cash for that sale.Weakness in the life sciences market could see the deal price trimmed or scrapped altogether, according to one analyst.Much of GE's efforts to bolster its balance sheet revolve around asset sales, so if the sale to Danaher fails, GE probably spins off the life sciences unit via an initial public offering.With General Electric stock up 41% this, controversy surrounding the power plant and no guarantees on asset sales, a case can be made that a lot of good news is already baked into the shares and near-term upside from current levels could be limited.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-21,"Give credit where credit is due. The new leaders of General Electric (NYSE:GE), most notably CEO Larry Culp, have pledged to be more transparent with investors. That honesty already has boosted GE stock, which has gained some 40% so far this year.Source: Shutterstock As bearish as I've been on GE, the optimism makes some sense. Culp worked wonders at Danaher (NYSE:DHR). GE has some valuable assets. Its problem areas -- notably Power and GE Capital -- have weighed on the stock in part because the bad news never seemed to end. As I wrote a little more than two years ago, GE clearly lost investors' trust. In the interim, Culp, CFO Jamie Miller, and other executives have made regaining that trust a priority.The problem -- as General Electric stock climbed above $10 yesterday before falling back -- is that GE is being honest about real problems with the business at the moment. Meanwhile, GE stock might seem &quot;cheap&quot; given its long fall from $30+, but it still has a market capitalization of $86 billion -- and a larger amount of debt and pension expense.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCulp and Miller have time to fix General Electric and they well might succeed. But there's a long way to go and still some success priced in at $10. GE Gets HonestIt's an interesting argument as to whether management's increased transparency has helped GE stock. Certainly, there have been short-term relief rallies, starting with the 7% pop that came when Culp was named CEO at the beginning of October. In late January, GE missed estimates in fourth quarter earnings -- and the stock still soared after Culp projected improvement in the struggling Power business, albeit not until 2020. Meanwhile, 2019 guidance in March similarly disappointed, and yet GE stock rose again, with Culp calling 2019 a &quot;reset year.&quot;  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market When Culp talks, investors cheer. And he literally has put his money where his mouth is, buying more than $2 million in GE stock last year. He's also laid out a strategy for GE to be slimmer, more nimble and more financially solid. The dividend was cut again, saving cash flow to pay down debt, and assets are up for sale to drive further deleveraging. Importantly, GE has been crystal-clear in detailing those strategies.The latest example of that came last Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa long has been bearish -- and right -- on General Electric stock. In a note released Wednesday morning, Tusa said the company still was managing the headlines in its Power business, seemingly highlighting a big order number cited by Reuters on Tuesday, a report which Tusa said overstated the early success of the turnaround in Power.It hardly seems a coincidence that hours later, CFO Miller told a conference that the company still expected &quot;significantly negative&quot; free cash flow from Power this year, and that Q1 orders didn't signify a change in trend. Indeed, it looks like GE management wants not even the appearance of trying to obscure the real problems facing Power -- and the business as a whole. Will It Help GE Stock?It's a worthwhile strategy. But it's also worth noting that for all the optimism so far, it hasn't actually worked. General Electric stock is down almost 9% from where it traded the day before Culp's hiring was announced. The YTD rally seems due at least in part to the recovering broad market -- and many of the short-term bumps driven by management commentary have soon fizzled.Meanwhile, GE is being honest but it's important to listen to what management actually is saying. Miller said Wednesday that margins in Power won't recover for at least three years. Culp said in March that free cash flow outside GE Capital would be negative this year.The sale of GE Biopharma to Danaher for $21.4 billion will help the balance sheet. But it also sends a key earning asset out the door, and -- again, according to management -- limits the likelihood of a spin-off of GE Healthcare. Even with GE Capital, which has driven several multi-billion dollar charges in recent years, Culp hasn't made any promises that all the problems are solved. General Electric Stock Has a Long Road AheadThe transparency coming from GE is welcome … and a long time coming. Shareholders and potential investors deserve to know what they're getting into. Perhaps more importantly, a turnaround -- for GE or for any other company -- can't happen until or unless management truly understands what needs to be fixed.  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week But the problems here are real. GE stock hasn't collapsed because of negative coverage from Tusa, or pressure from short sellers, or just because former CEOs Jeff Immelt and John Flannery weren't paying attention. The power industry on the whole is shrinking. GE Capital took risks similar to those that hurt big banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) last decade; it simply took this long for some of the costs to come to light.So while it's worth appreciating the newfound honesty at GE, it's also worth listening to that honesty. Cash flow is negative. Power is years away from improving while the market for gas-powered turbines may continue to shrink. (Admittedly, some observers see growth.) GE Capital may still have some issues to iron out.Aviation, Renewable Energy, and Healthcare have value but I argued a year ago that even with that strength, the fair value of GE stock looked to be about $9-$11 per share. Honesty is helpful, but it doesn't change that core problem.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-23,"GE (NYSE:GE) stock held steady following a question and answer session at the Electrical Products Group Conference. Though troubles remain for the Boston-based industrial conglomerate, investors and analysts have begun to believe in the turnaround plan put forth by CEO Larry Culp. GE stock still trades in a range.Source: Shutterstock Also, it did not move significantly even though Culp reaffirmed negative cash flow forecasts for 2019. Nonetheless, if his plan continues to reduce debts, spin off non-core operations, and turn profits, General Electric stock will break much higher in the coming quarters and years.Culp confirmed that the company expected negative free cash flow of $2 billion in this fiscal year. However, he also expects this outflow to end in 2020 and sees a cash flow &quot;acceleration&quot; in 2021. GE's latest earnings report and now this newest affirmation seemed to quiet many of the doubters who had all but left the company for dead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend In previous articles about GE stock, I repeatedly complained about what I called a &quot;constant drip&quot; of new issues. The seemingly endless litany of bad news led GE's board to fire John Flannery in favor of Culp, the former CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), last October. GE Really Might RecoverNow, just seven months into Culp's tenure, the litany of new troubles appears to have come to a stop. Instead, we see signs of an emerging recovery. GE beat both revenue and earnings estimates in the previous quarter.Also, investors remain concerned about GE Power, but they also saw early signs of improvement. Though sales volumes continue to fall, they have declined by lower rates. The division has also seen a turnaround in the value of its orders.Moreover, the long-term debt I mentioned more than three months ago has come down by more than $5 billion in just one quarter. It now stands at $91.57 billion, slightly higher than its market cap of just over $87.5 billion. Short-term debt rose by almost $2.9 billion in the same period. However, both long and short-term debt levels have fallen on a year-over-year basis. GE Has Far to GoTo be sure, GE is not out of the woods yet. On top of the negative free cash flow, the length of the current economic growth cycle far exceeds long-term averages. Though few predict a looming recession, the long economic expansion increases the risk of such an event. Such a downturn would at least delay a GE turnaround.Furthermore, GE Aviation, currently GE's best-performing division, faces uncertainty with its status as the sole supplier of engines for Boeing's (NYSE:BA) troubled 737 MAX.So far, the Aviation division has incurred no impairment charges related to the 737 MAX. Moreover, both orders and backlogs rose for this division on a year-over-year basis. Still, investors should watch for any Boeing-related troubles in future quarters. GE Stock Is RangeboundStill, for all of the remaining challenges, this report has further helped to quiet those who predicted the demise of GE. Moreover, General Electric stock remains in the $10 per share range, about the same levels of three months ago.Today, confidence in the company has increased, yet GE stock has traded in a range since late January. The range adds uncertainty but also gives investors more time to buy.The critical point is the equity's 2019 high of $11.30 per share. If GE can sustain itself past that point, I think the more optimistic $14 to $16 per share price target will become achievable. Concluding Thoughts on GE StockDespite concerns of range-bound trading and deeply negative cash flows in 2019, Mr. Culp's recovery plan has begun to make a recovery in GE stock appear plausible. Yes, GE continues to struggle with cash flows. However, if company forecasts hold, that should turn around by next year.Moreover, the company's divisions continue to show improved performance as revenues increase and debt levels decline. Culp also continues to sell non-core businesses. As this smaller, more-nimble GE begins to emerge, bears continue to pare back their doomsday scenarios, and a long-absent sense of confidence has started to return.GE still has a long way to go. Like any recovery, this one will also face challenges, as well as risks. However, as I stated back in February, a speculative buy case for GE has emerged.The first quarter numbers and even the continued negative cash flows reaffirm this thesis. For those who have the stomach for the risk, I think GE stock can rise much higher once it sustains itself above $11.30 per share.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-23,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock, once among the most boring names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is now facing constant danger.Source: Shutterstock It met earnings guidance for the first quarter but its asset sale to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) may be in trouble. Fears over its pension liability may be overblown but it has a grim future.CEO Larry Culp is &quot;the man for the job&quot; but GE Power may take three years to recover.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Electric is a great name, and Culp did a fine job at his previous post running Danaher. But this turnaround may be a bridge too far, and do you really want your money tied up in it? Forget the Name General ElectricThere is romance attached to the name General Electric, and over 130 years of history. In analyzing the company, you need to forget the history, or you'll get lost.Let's call this company Culp Industries.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Culp Industries is a conglomerate with a market cap of $84 billion. It has $107.5 billion in &quot;borrowings,&quot; $36.8 billion of insurance liabilities and annuity benefits (from a failed effort in long-term-care insurance), and $32.9 billion in &quot;non-current compensation and benefits&quot; (mainly pensions). This leaves $35.2 billion for &quot;shareholder equity&quot; on the books, up from $31 billion a year ago.Culp Industries consists of several businesses, some of which are doing well and some of which are doing poorly. The Aviation, Healthcare and lending businesses are doing well. The oil and gas business made a little money. The problems are in the power and renewable energy units, which make turbines and related equipment.Culp can't sell the problem children because their value is negative. Closing them would take out $7 billion in revenue and do nothing to reduce those liabilities. The Danaher deal trims the size of the healthcare unit but brings in about $21 billion. Apply that $20 billion to the balance sheet and it takes just one-fifth of the debt. Questions for GE StockIt's the power unit that's taking the whole company down. Respected JPMorgan Chase analyst Stephen Tusa says Culp &quot;appears to be stopping short of telling the whole story&quot; about the unit,  which is losing market share. Cash flow for the unit is now seen as &quot;significantly negative.&quot; There are more negative data points. General Electric continues to lay off workers, quietly moving jobs to India. The healthcare unit's activities in Brazil could draw fines under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Culp is doing everything he can, short of changing his company's name to Culp Industries, to make investors forget about the old General Electric. He's turning over the board and has dumped plans to build a glorious new headquarters in Boston. Instead, the company will rent space.I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with the hand he has been dealt than Larry Culp. He has moved decisively to reduce cash flow drain, focused on operations that are making money, and created a new attitude for GE stock.If the oil and gas unit, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE), has a winner in its &quot;electric fracking&quot; equipment, more good news could be on the way. BHGE stock is doing better than rivals Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), but its value is still down by more than one-third in the last year. The Bottom LineI wouldn't buy Culp Industries here. There are green shoots, the CEO is doing what he can, but an economic downturn could sink the company's big plans at any time -- even at $10 per share.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-28,"Back in December, General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock looked to be in a dire situation. There was even buzz that the company could go bankrupt. But of course, the fears proved to be overblown. General Electric stock staged an impressive rally, going from $6.74 to $9.90.Source: Shutterstock It's true that GE stock is still far away from the $30 it reached back in 2016. Along the way, the company slashed its dividend to 4 cents per share and GE stock was booted from the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. There was also the sudden departure of two of its CEOs.  * 5 Large-Cap Stocks Getting Crushed in the Trade War But as of now, it does appear that General Electric stock has stabilized. In fact, since January the shares have been in a relatively tight range of $9.50 to $10 and change.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far, GE's new CEO, Larry Culp, has made the right strategic moves. Then again, he has an impeccable resume as a CEO. While at the helm of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), he posted standout returns for shareholders. He showed a knack not only for striking M&A deals at the right time, but also for ensuring that the company's  core businesses remained disciplined and focused.So could General Electric stock break out soon? Will Culp's magic continue? Well, unfortunately, I think the current price of GE stock is more of a resistance level.After all, GE is facing three major headwinds. Perhaps the most serious is the weakness of the company's Power business, which represents about a fifth of its total revenues. The turbine business is fiercely competitive and is facing demand pressures. Another problem is the continuing difficulties stemming from the company's ill-fated acquisition of France's Alstom SA in 2015. GE has been cutting Power's costs, but the unit will probably have to undergo more intensive restructuring going forward.JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa put out a stinging report on the Power unit, writing: &quot;We see nothing here to change our negative view on Power, more so evidence of a company that appears to manage to headlines rather than on-the-ground fundamentals.&quot;Ouch! And he also has a price target of $5 on GE stock.In the meantime, GE Capital continues to weigh on General Electric stock. Unlike other financial institutions like JP Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that made major changes after the financial crisis, this division has not been proactive. One of its big issues is its outstanding debt, which stood at $66 billion as of the end of 2018.Finally, there are some nagging wild cards facing GE stock. For example, what if the U.S. economy goes into recession? That would definitely make the turnaround of the Power business and GE Capital much more challenging.Then there is the impact from Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max grounded fleet, which uses GE's engines and leasing services. When GE released its first-quarter earnings report, the company said that the Max issue posed a &quot;new risk&quot; to its 2019 earnings. The Bottom Line on GE StockWhen it comes to fixing complex businesses like Power and GE Capital, the owners of GE stock will need to be very patient. That is why Culp has indicated that 2019 will be a &quot;reset year.&quot; In other words, it's a good bet that there will not be many positive catalysts for General Electric stock this year.Besides, the valuation of GE stock is already pricey, with its forward price-earnings multiple at 24.   That's not far from what Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) are trading at.In light of all this, there is really no urgency to buy GE stock for now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-28,"I don't need to tell you that General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of the most disappointing companies in recent memory. Only a few short years ago, GE stock was trading at just under $30. Then, the troubles began, careening shares off a cliff from which it has yet to recover.Source: Shutterstock General Electric stock also hits home to me on a somewhat personal level. This is one company that I vividly remember playing both sides of the field. In September 2017, I stated unambiguously that GE shares were spiraling out of control. But starting from 2018 onward, I gambled that the selloff was over.Needless to say, I received a painful lesson in knife-catching. GE stock, despite some attractive businesses, has consistently failed both speculators and long-embattled stakeholders. As a result, it's hard to take any good news surrounding the organization seriously, even if that comes in the form of a solid earnings report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Nevertheless, I think it's worthwhile to acknowledge the positives on General Electric stock. In the first quarter of 2019, GE reported earnings per share of 14 cents, a nickel above consensus estimates. Revenue of $27.29 billion also exceeded analysts' forecasts calling for $27.05 billion.Is this enough for GE stock for the long haul? I don't like to make big predictions based on a single financial disclosure. That said, the industrial firm levers three tailwinds that could make it a surprise hit later this year. Aviation Remains the Bright Spot for GE StockOne of the underappreciated aspects of the General Electric stock narrative is the underlying company's revenue allocation. While management was forced to make painful divestments, GE places its hopes on its core moneymakers. Fortunately, they're mostly in viable and relevant industries.Take aviation as an example. This segment represents the top revenue-generator for GE stock at $30.6 billion. During the time when management was dumping businesses to clean up GE's balance sheet, they held onto aviation. Longer term, I think this was a very wise decision.Although we have occasional grumblings such as now, the global economy is generally improving. That's especially true from a percentage-basis for developing and frontier markets. Thanks to lowered costs in technology and connectivity, more people have access to substantive and growing wealth. As a result, we'll see increased demand for travel, which naturally bodes well for General Electric stock.Also, the nature of air travel has changed. Today, we no longer enjoy the dominance of massive jumbo jets. Instead, we have smaller planes with more fuel-efficient engines. That's still a positive for GE stock because the manufacturing firm has more opportunities to serve on volume.Should additional air-travel routes open up, General Electric stands to benefit. Don't Overlook Power!At first glance, GE's Power division seems like a relic. Increasingly (and politically), the world is focusing on renewable energy sources. Of course, one of the biggest debates right now is climate change, and how we respond.President Trump's camp generally believes that climate change is a conspiracy theory. On the other hand, Democrats seems to care more about the environment than humans. One thing is clear: if we can find a practical source of renewable energy, that's far superior to burning a limited commodity.We have plenty of renewable-energy sources so that's not the problem. The issue is that they're not very practical. In prior years, these platforms were prohibitively expensive to implement and as a result, lost their utility.But recently, wind and especially solar costs have nose-dived. Does that mean renewables will upset traditional forms of energy? I don't think so.First, wind and solar require expansive space. We're lucky we live in the U.S. However, many developed countries don't have the territorial space necessary to implement them.Second, while costs have gone down, consumption has skyrocketed, and will continue to do so. Even if renewables became ultra-efficient, it's impossible for them to feed global demand. Therefore, multiple countries will still require traditional power sources, which is an underappreciated plus for GE stock. Dumping Health to Regain HealthGeneral Electric stock made headlines earlier this year when CEO Larry Culp sold off its biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR), his former employer.The early spring cleaning wasn't surprising. Management made it clear that they wanted to streamline their financials in order to better stage a longer-term recovery. But its health component has done well for General Electric. Plus, the biopharma unit was a particularly compelling business.But looking back at things, I think management made the right move. Pharmaceuticals have come under significant pressure politically for price gouging and medicinal ineffectiveness. Thus, the broader industry faces risks from both Democrats and the cannabis-legalization movement.I mean, who doesn't want cheaper prices and natural therapies that won't lead to a nationwide addiction crisis?Importantly, GE still kept its other health-related divisions, which include medical equipment and technologies.

2019-06-03,"Shares of beaten-up industrial conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) staged their long overdue turnaround in early 2019. GE stock bottomed at $6.40 in early December 2018, and through late February 2019, General Electric stock nearly doubled, climbing to $11.Source: Shutterstock But that big GE turnaround has come and gone. In March, GE stock traded near $10. In April, General Electric  stock  was around $9. And, in the month of May, GE ranged between $9 and $10.In other words, after staging a huge rally through the first two months of 2019, GE stock has been stuck in neutral for the past three months. GE stock has been rangebound in recent weeks because there are simply too many unanswered questions surrounding the future of GE.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA handful of those questions were answered favorably through the first two months of 2019. That's why General Electric  stock rallied. But those answers have stopped coming in, and as they have, GE stock has stopped heading higher.For the foreseeable future, GE will remain plagued by a lack of clarity regarding its long-term growth prospects.There is a scenario in which GE stock could rally tremendously. But that scenario lacks clarity and tangibility at the current moment, so General Electric stock will likely remain stuck in neutral for the foreseeable future. Too Many QuestionsWhen it comes to GE, there are a thousand questions with respect to what &quot;new GE&quot; will look like in five years, and while management is taking the right steps to craft a better future for this company, there are simply too many questions and too little clarity today for GE stock to move much higher in the foreseeable future.There are a few things GE needs to do in order to become a better, more sustainable, more focused, less indebted, and more profitable company. Those things include shedding both unprofitable and non-core assets, using the proceeds from those asset sales to reduce its debt load, focusing on maximizing the growth of its healthy Aviation business, and investing in next-generation growth businesses like industrial Internet of Things.Management is executing on these initiatives. In late 2018 and early 2019, GE did shed both unprofitable and non-core assets and businesses. It reduced its debt load and talked about focusing on its growing businesses. Because of all those positive developments, GE stock soared from $6 to $11.But the upward momentum of General Electric stock stopped once its long-term outlook stopped becoming clearer. Specifically, GE was supposed to spin off its healthcare business, but after teasing the idea in early 2019, management has been quiet on that front for the past few months. Rumors surrounding a spin off of its Power unit haven't been confirmed or denied. Meanwhile, the company's deal to sell its Biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) could be in jeopardy after pharma equipment makers reported weak early 2019 numbers. GE Stock Could Pop Sometime in the FutureThere is a pathway for GE stock to head way higher.Let's look at the company's Aviation business, which is growing at a healthy rate, operates in a stable sector,, and has solid, stable profit margins. Last year, the Aviation business produced about $6.5 billion of profits before interest and taxes. Assuming $2 billion in interest expense and a 20% tax rate, that implies a standalone GE Aviation business could generate about $3.6 billion in net profits. Competitor Boeing (NYSE:BA) normally trades around 20 times analysts' average forward earnings estimate. Based on that multiple, GE's Aviation business alone could be worth more than $70 billion.GE stock has a market cap of $80 billion today.Thus, if GE successfully lowers its debt load, reduces its interest payments, and boosts the profitability of its core businesses, &quot;new GE&quot; could be worth substantially more than $80 billion.But, in order to believe in that scenario, you have to believe that GE can and will reduce its debt load and boost its core profitability. At this point in time, there's no reason to believe that will happen anytime soon.So while GE stock could eventually rally tremendously, it won't pop anytime soon. The Bottom Line on GE StockThe big turnaround of GE has already come and gone. Right now, lack of clarity is once again the theme dominating the outlook of  the company. As long as this remains true - and it looks poised to remain the case for the foreseeable future - General Electric stock will be stuck in neutral.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-06,"One-third of the way into 2019, the U.S. stock market looked more resilient than ever with the bull snapping back from a devastating correction like a bovine half its age. Stocks hit a new high on April 30, delivering an early 2019 return of 18.3%, including dividends--nearly two years' worth of the long-term average gain for stocks in just four months. Assuaging worries of a looming recession, the economy grew at a robust 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Instead of earnings dipping into negative territory, as analysts had expected, corporate America ended the first quarter slightly in the black. And perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve Board pivoted from telegraphing as many as three rate hikes in 2019 to zero rate hikes. Then President Trump tweeted about trade. Stocks have been volatile since, and the downdraft served as a swift reminder that substantial risks are building in this aged bull market and in an economic expansion that in July becomes the longest one ever.With the easy gains behind us this year, we think you'll do best by scouting stocks that can eke out reliable earnings growth in a low-growth economy and looking to dividends to bolster returns. We favor large-company stocks over small, and we think investors can find good candidates in a number of market sectors and in overseas markets--but you'll have to be discerning and selective within each category. In the second half of 2019, investors will have to stay defensive, while also taking advantage of tactical opportunities as they arise.Here are five stocks we believe fit the bill and are worth considering for your portfolio: SEE ALSO: 2019 Midyear Investing Outlook: Where to Put Your Money Now",5 Stocks to Buy Now for the Rest of 2019

2019-06-13,"With all due respect to the analyst community, please stop handicapping General Electric (NYSE:GE) as if it's possible to know where the company will be a year from now. Likewise to investors, be wary of treating GE stock as if it reasonably compares to peers such as Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) or Danaher (NYSE:DHR).Source: Shutterstock GE is, more than anything else right now, an enigma… an idea. Choosing not to acknowledge it as such could prove frustrating.That's not intended as an insult to parties on either side of the capital-markets table, to be clear. The aforementioned pitfalls are easy to stumble into; I've stumbled into both traps more than once myself.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 But, as a guy who's been in the investing business for 20 years now (with the gray and thinning hair to prove it) I can say I've seen, heard, and done it all, most of it twice.That includes the current General Electric story and all of its nuances; same story, different name. And, the fact of the matter is, nobody has a clue General Electric is really going. They're all guessing. We're all guessing.There is one thing I am confident of though. That is, if GE stock can clear one key technical hurdle, all that rhetoric is going to turn bullish in a hurry, driving what could be a decent bullish swing trade that may well flag the long-awaited, bigger turnaround. A Closer Look at GEIt's not a reality too many in the financial media and investment-advice business care to concede, but sometimes, our best guesses still aren't all that good.It's a rarity, to be fair. People paid to pontificate tend to have a rather firm grip on things that are taking shape with the economy, the market and with individual companies.This isn't one of those times though. General Electric has thrown a lot of people for a loop.But, at least the professionals at this dance have to chime in with something on the company.Reality: The sale of General Electric's assets like its locomotive arm to WabTec (NYSE:WAB) and the rumored liquidation of its aviation finance arm are seemingly steps in the right direction. GE needs cash to shore up liquidity problems, and selling assets is the quickest way to raise liability-free cash. Bear in mind, however, the company is selling revenue-bearing and in many cases profit-driving assets.Some say there's more upside to paring itself down, but others are less convinced divestitures are the right move given the company's cash-flow challenges.Its Power arm is in trouble too. Let's not pretend like that's not at least partially the result of persistently tepid oil and gas prices though, admittedly underscored by a lack of product development.The former remains entirely out of the company's control, no matter how well General Electric regroups its power business from the inside.The biggest X factor of all though is the unknowable. Right now, there are simply an overwhelming number of unknowables muddling up a clear view of the company's fiscal strength.Perhaps more so than any other outfit seen in the modern market era, General Electric is a moving target… multiple moving targets, in fact. Nobody really knows what lies ahead, even if their thesis seem rock-solid and well-polished. Looking Ahead for GE StockThat's not to suggest GE stock has to be avoided. Indeed, General Electric has the potential to be very rewarding for the right kind of trader.The key is simply understanding that the chart of GE stock right now is driving opinions of the stock as much as it's being driven by them.To that end, we're all lucky in the sense that investors have collectively, unconsciously drawn their line in the sand. It's $10.48, where GE stock has peaked a couple of times since March.It's working on another test of that technical ceiling right now, but is starting that effort with the benefit of its first streak of higher lows since 2016.Notice GE shares have also crossed back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, and this time seem a little more willing to stay here.Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see this week's strength presses against the line that's capped all the key highs going back to May of last year.Clearly there's more work to be done. But, if General Electric shares can move above its recent ceilings, it becomes much easier to justify buying.It also becomes much easier to justify upgrades; don't think for a minute analysts' handling of the turnaround story aren't being scrutinized more than they normally might for other names.Just wait and watch. The Final WordI'm all too aware that penning these kinds of ideas is maddening to a whole slew of people… professionals as well as amateurs. The notion that a chart can lead to opinion changes rather than the other way around is often dismissed. And, there was a point in time, years ago, when such an idea should have been dismissed.The market's changed though. Fundamentals don't matter nearly as much as stories do, assuming that fundamentals mean anything anymore. In the case of General Electric right now, they may not.Whatever the case, don't kid yourself about what GE stock is here. You're not making a bet on the company by buying it now, or after any cross above $10.48.You're making a bet on how the masses are going to feel about GE at some point in the foreseeable future. Indirectly, you're betting on how analysts are going to change their opinions when they absolutely have to.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20,"What a difference strong leadership can make for a company, as shown by General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock. Larry Culp, who came on board as CEO in October 2018, had the unenviable task of leading the company's turnaround.But his moves has been decisive and strategic. More importantly, he has brought realism to the company. Then again, Culp demonstrated those abilities while he was the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), which generated standout results for shareholders during his tenure.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal Source: Shutterstock GE stock has done great during Culp's brief time with the company. Since December, the shares have gained 55%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut turnarounds often take a long time.  And that will certainly be the case with GE's efforts.  There is still lots of heavy lifting to be done, and GE is facing some tough headwinds.  In other words, investors should be cautious, as the easy gains of GE stock may be over.In fact, there are already signs of that. Keep in mind that GE stock has been in a persistent range of $9 to $11 since February.So what issues is GE facing? Let's take a look at three risks of investing in General Electric stock. Risk Facing GE Stock: GE's FinancialsOne of the biggest changes at GE has been Culp's transparency with Wall Street.  To this end, he says that 2019 will be a &quot;reset&quot; year. But the fact is that GE has a tremendous amount of debt and contingent liabilities. Cumulatively, GE owes a staggering $107.5 billion. So for quite some time, Culp will be mostly focused on finding ways to generate cash. To help accomplish that goal,  he's already agreed to sell GE's  biopharma business to Danaher and divest its locomotive segment, which was acquired by  WabTec (NYSE:WAB).But given that GE is cyclical and that the global economy appears to be slowing, GE could easily report negative earnings surprises in the months ahead. Risk Facing GE Stock: GE's Aviation BusinessThe aviation business has been positive for General Electric stock for some time. As seen at this week's Paris Air Show, the unit is snagging plenty of orders. Note that it recently signed its biggest deal ever, agreeing to sell $20 billion of engines to an India-based airline.But unfortunately, the aviation business is still facing headwinds. For example, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 777X widebody jet will not meet its deadline because of a problem caused by GE's engines. The problem is likely temporary, but it's still worrisome and will cause a meaningful amount of GE's revenue to be delayed.It's far from clear what will happen with the 737 MAX, which has been grounded because of two crashes. But again, this means loss of momentum for GE's engine business. Risk Facing GE Stock: GE's Power BusinessThe Power Business, which accounts for roughly 20% of GE's  overall revenues, continues to be a problem for the company. The competitive environment of the sector is intense, demand for Power's products has been sluggish for some time, and it's been accused of being less than 100% forthright about its results. There are also signs that Chinese companies may make inroads in this industry.Here's what JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa has said about the situation: &quot;We believe a full accounting of the situation with a closer look at the data, even a rudimentary review, supports our view that GE is indeed losing market share…&quot;Keep in mind that Tusa was able to predict the implosion of GE stock. Consider that he currently has a $5 price target on the shares, implying a drop of more than 50% from their current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-03,"In breaking down General Electric (NYSE:GE) into its most profitable segments, CEO Larry Culp has lost the scale needed to retire its debt. Since becoming CEO last October, Culp has turned around operations. Unfortunately for investors, there's been no turnaround in GE stock, which is down almost 9% under the new CEO.Source: Shutterstock Regarding those operations, in GE's first quarter report the only unit not showing a profit was renewable energy, where a new conservative government in Ontario canceled hundreds of wind power contracts.The problem is that a company running at $110 billion in annual revenue is going to have a hard time ever retiring $105 billion of borrowings, and almost $74 billion more in &quot;other liabilities&quot; -- mainly pensions and long-term care costs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce upon a time, GE Capital could have dealt with these issues. But previous CEO Jeff Immelt sold off assets to cover up what he was doing elsewhere. Now the numbers don't add up. Victim of Clean EnergyImmelt made two contradictory bets.He bet on renewable energy, including efficiency, and he bet on fossil fuel energy, in the form of oilfield services and turbines. He doubled down on that bet by buying Alstom in 2015, calling it the &quot;best deal in a century&quot; because, at the time, the French turbine maker had a $50 billion order backlog.  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 Then efficiency cut demand, the costs of wind and solar energy plummeted, and the backlog for turbines running off natural gas disappeared. But GE is still in the fossil fuels business, a business even JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa says is in &quot;secular decline.&quot;Renewable energy is a capital goods business. Once a turbine or solar panel is in place and paid for, further energy from it is practically free. The only revenue coming from it is service revenue or replacement, at a much lower cost (because technology creates efficiency). Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are burned and must be continually replaced. The business models are as different as the proverbial night and day. Impossible DreamsGE stock is somehow up 46% so far in 2019, closing trading on July 2 at $10.62 per share, giving it a market cap of $92.6 billion. That may be because GE publicists have been spinning Culp as a heroic genius with an &quot;inner Jack Welch,&quot; referring to the man who built GE as a finance and entertainment powerhouse in the 1990s.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer But even Jack Welch couldn't spin GE's straw into gold. A deal to sell GE's biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion -- where Culp was once CEO -- buys time, but that's selling the family silver to keep up maintenance on a mansion that's become a money pit. Worse, that deal is now threatened by the trade war. If Danaher tries to negotiate a discount, it's in a strong position. But what would that do to investor sentiment in GE?Culp has ended a long-standing patent fight with Vestas, its wind turbine rival, and is closing a natural gas plant in California, which will become a battery storage warehouse. JPM's Tusa worries that the end of renewable energy tax credits next year will now cause the wind power unit to decline.  Bottom Line on GE StockJust when Culp -- and GE stock investors -- need his successes to keep succeeding and his losers to turn around, the opposite is happening. The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-Max mess is hitting results at GE Aviation. The unit may now be worth as little as $30 billion, Tusa thinks. Brazil is taking GE transformers off-line because they have a habit of blowing up.Culp is beginning to remind me of a loyal henchman given command of the evil genius' lair after James Bond has set the auto-destruct. Saving GE may be a hopeless task.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-10,"For General Electric (NYSE:GE), it has been a dreadful few years. GE stock, which reliably traded around $30 in 2016, sells for just a third of that value today. The company had to slash the dividend to nearly zero, and even that hasn't totally resolved concerns about the company's balance sheet and fiscal health going forward.Source: Shutterstock If you're a trader, you might be pleased with GE stock. It is up from $7 earlier this year to $10 now, which is a big move off the lows. But don't forget that a year ago, GE stock price was still $14. The move back to $10 has hardly repaired the colossal damage that shareholders have suffered over the past three years. With the stock market now at fresh all-time highs, the stock has continued to disappoint by comparison.GE's dismal stock performance is in the past, however. Is the recent move up from the low the start of a new recovery phase for General Electric? Or is this simply another little bounce before General Electric stock resumes its slump?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Company In TransitionNine months ago, GE got a new star CEO, Larry Culp. This wasn't GE's first attempt at fixing the executive suite. In 2017, General Electric elevated John Flannery to the top post to try to reverse the firm's sliding fortunes. But Flannery barely lasted a year. The company missed guidance quarter after quarter under his watch. The GE Board wasted no time in bringing yet another new chief executive. And in Larry Culp, it looks like they got a most capable leader.Culp previously served as CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) from 2001 to 2014. During his time there, Danaher stock produced a total return of almost 500% for shareholders. Culp is the first outsider CEO to take the reins in GE's history and shows the company's willingness to do a total reboot to try to get back on track. For a company of GE's pedigree, it's quite a statement that they were willing to hire from outside the firm.Culp has shown plenty of willingness to make big moves in his young tenure. Already, General Electric spun off and then merged its transportation business, which has become Wabtec (NYSE:WAB). Culp made a huge sale in healthcare, unloading the biopharma operations for a huge payday. GE raised a few billion from selling part of its stake in GE Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE). And the list goes on.But there's plenty more left to do. As the GE stock price shows, the market isn't convinced that Culp has found the right formula to revive General Electric just yet. Let's take a deep look at GE stock's pluses and minuses as we are almost a year into Culp's turnaround efforts with the industrial giant. A Good Deal With DanaherIf General Electric is to return to its past glory, the first order of business is staying in business. The company needs to make it through this horrid stretch without selling or mortgaging away all its best assets. However, given the company's difficult financial situation, investors have rightly worried about what all GE will have to sell to make it through this down period.  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: The Race for 1 Intensifies On that note, General Electric should be commended for its recent biopharma sale. It managed to unload its biopharma division to Danaher for $21 billion. That appeared to be fully valued. Danaher shareholders weren't particularly ecstatic when they announced the deal, indicating that GE got a solid price. Don't forget that Culp used to be the head executive at Danaher, which likely gave him some flexibility while negotiating the deal.The $21 billion is in and of itself great news, giving the company the funds to tackle more than a third of its net industrial debt position. And, of arguably equal importance, by selling biopharma, it allowed GE to stay in healthcare. Previously, analysts had worried that GE would have to exit healthcare altogether in order to raise enough funds to right the balance sheet. GECAS: A Big Test Going ForwardOne of General Electric's most valuable assets is its jet engine leasing business. Returns in aircraft and engine leasing have historically been very attractive.Airlines tend to be hard-up for cash. And given the history of vast numbers of bankruptcies in the airline industry, banks tend to be cautious in their lending to airlines. Thus, for airlines to get capital at reasonable prices, they often have to engage with non-traditional lenders.GE is ideally suited for this. As the manufacturer of jet engines, it knows its industry about as well as anyone. It directly influences supply in the market, and has excellent information about the demand picture as well. Also, in the event of an airline default or bankruptcy, GE is ideally positioned to get its engines back into use at another airline. By contrast, a bank would be clueless about how to monetize an asset like that.Put all that together, and GE has built a fantastic business in engine leasing. However, many analysts have suggested that General Electric will have to sell it to raise funds. Also, leasing is a rather capital intensive business; it'd likely do a lot to boost GE's credit rating if they got out of the market.Thus, leasing is an interesting test of management. Larry Culp has said repeatedly that the leasing business is not for sale. If GE can make it through the cash crunch without selling leasing, it'd be a sign of strength. If they end up selling it over Culp's protestations, however, it'd be somber news for General Electric stock. Negative Free Cash FlowIn March, GE stunned investors when it warned that the company's free cash flow would turn negative for 2019. Even in a year as dour as 2018, GE still managed to bring in more than $4 billion of FCF. So going negative altogether was truly a huge surprise.With more reflection, however, it makes sense. The company's negative free cash flow is a culmination of many issues. These include the lost revenue related to Boeing's (NYSE:BA) plane crashes, the plunge in renewable power demand and the fall of GE Power's prospects, among other matters.GE expects its cash flow picture to look better in 2020 and especially in 2021 and beyond. But that may not be soon enough to salvage things for GE stock. As discussed below, GE is starting to run into issues in the credit market. The company's balance sheet has been questioned, ratings agencies have downgraded the stock, and funding costs are going up. Running negative free cash flow is a very bad look for General Electric as it tries to reassure its investors and creditors.However, the cash flow crunch may not be as bad as people fear. At least one analyst thinks so. Nicholas Heymann of William Blair came out with an analyst note this week that made the case for GE stock. Among Heymann's points, he expects GE's cash flow to surprise to the upside this quarter. Overall, Heymann sees the GE stock price as being worth between $14 and $16 per share. That'd be roughly 50% upside from today's prices. GE's Fiscal DifficultiesIn October 2018, Moody's downgraded GE debt by two notches to Baa1 from A2. That was a big blow for both the firm's reputation and access to capital going forward. And that downgrade came less than a month after S&P's own ratings action against GE.The next month, GE reacted by abandoning its use of the commercial paper market. Large companies with good credit can borrow short-term in commercial paper at attractive rates to fund temporary liquidity needs. When GE stopped using commercial paper, it made the market reassess the company's overall credit-worthiness.Since that point, the yields on GE Capital's various longer-term bonds have moved higher. That's in sharp contrast to the overall fall in interest rate yields as the Fed sets up to cut interest rates. This suggests that GE's credit worthiness continues to decline, even after the blockbuster sale of biopharma to Danaher.It also puts GE in a difficult place going forward with its capital division. A finance operation can't generate good sound profits if it doesn't have consistent reliable access to cheap funds. If GE can't reassure the market that it is a money good creditor, the capital division's value will be sharply impaired. The Shrinking GE PowerOne of the key building blocks of the new leaner General Electric was supposed to be GE Power. But these efforts have quickly run into trouble. That's because the demand from utilities for GE's products has slumped far more than folks had expected.Utility companies are now looking for just 25-30 gigawatts of capacity. That's way down from estimates of nearly 50 gigawatts as recently as 2016. The global economic slowdown and trade war worries have done little to help reverse this slump in sentiment. Plus, it turns out, electricity use simply isn't growing as fast as models had predicted years ago. More efficient appliances combined with slowing population growth has really cut into future electricity demand.As a result, GE has taken aggressive action to shrink GE Power down to size. It reduced the division's work force by 10,000 employees. In a related move, it has cut almost $1 billion a year in costs from GE Power. This will all help make GE Power more profitable -- or at least stem the losses from shrinking end demand. The division remains stuck with lawsuits, cost overruns and other headaches from previous management regimes, however. If GE stock is going to rebound sharply, GE Power has to perform better in the future. GE Power Faces An Explosive IssueFacing these difficulties, GE Power ran into a poorly timed public relations issue. After a large number of explosions, Brazil's grid operator suggested that GE's equipment was defective. Reuters reported that:&quot;There are close to 700 pieces of that equipment in Brazil's grid, each costing up to 100,000 reais ($26,000). Power transmission companies have already launched tenders to buy replacement transformers while they discuss the costs and a schedule for the changes with GE and regulators.&quot;GE continues to claim that its equipment is not at fault. However, Brazil doesn't seem convinced of GE's innocence in the matter. China's State Grid corporation has expanded significantly in Brazil in recent years and could take a share of GE's business in that large country. Notably, Brazil is part of Mercosur -- a South American economic union -- that just reached a historic free trade agreement with the EU. This could bring in yet more competition for GE in that market. In any case, with GE Power already struggling, this Brazilian issue comes at a most unfortunate time. Don't Expect A Healthy Dividend Anytime SoonLast year, GE slashed its dividend to a mere penny per quarter. That move came on top of another previous dividend cut. You might be asking, why didn't GE get rid of the dividend altogether, as so many struggling companies do? For one thing, General Electric used to be a storied blue chip dividend payer. The company was viewed as a stable secure source of income for retirees and other risk averse folks. General Electric has a history of paying dividends continuously for decades, and by keeping a payment -- even a meager one -- it can keep at least some semblance of its past history going.Also, importantly, many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have strict rules about what sorts of stocks they own. Many growth and income funds, for example, can't buy stocks that have no dividend. Many income-focused ETFs would also have to dump GE stock if the company eliminates the dividend entirely. So, in a weird way, even a tiny dividend is useful for keeping GE stock from slumping even farther.That said, don't look for GE to bring back a more robust dividend within the next few years. It is largely keeping the dividend for mechanical and sentimental reasons. It's not sticking with the dividend because it's a good use of capital. At this point, GE needs all the money it can muster to survive this horrid stretch of business that it is suffering through. Paying out a fatter dividend to shareholders would be irresponsible given the state of GE's balance sheet. If you want an industrial stock that provides a solid and steady stream of income, the 2019 version of General Electric stock is a bad choice. Forget Sunk Costs: Would You Buy GE Stock Now?In investing, it's always useful to think about what you'd do if you had no position already. If you were a neutral observer of General Electric, and had the option of buying it or rival industrial companies, what would you do? Most likely, you wouldn't buy General Electric stock right now.So if you hold GE, you should really pause and consider that. Do you believe GE stock is fundamentally a solid choice for your portfolio today? Or are you hoping that it recovers to its past glories, and that you are able to sell it for a profit?  * 7 of The Best Schwab ETFs for Low Fees The stock market doesn't care what price we buy an investment at -- there's nothing magical about the cost basis for a position. Holding stocks simply to try to get back to break-even is a classic investor error that leads to massive opportunity cost and sometimes results in holding stocks all the way until they go bust.You get no extra reward for holding a losing stock for many years before it (hopefully) turns around. In the meantime, you suffer a large opportunity cost. With the stock market zooming higher, there are so many better investments that the average person could own instead of General Electric stock. Bottom Line on General Electric StockIf you believe in General Electric's turnaround story, $10 might still be a compelling price to buy at. It's not a fire sale, like it was at $7, but there's still a clear path to $15 or higher if management is able to execute and the economy remains strong. But I don't see the risk/reward for GE stock being particularly compelling at this price. If you're on the sidelines, there's no reason to get involved here.And if you do own GE stock, you should think about whether you are holding it because it has strong prospects, or if you own it hoping to recover losses or some other emotional reason. The General Electric that exists today is far different from the firm that existed in 2007, let alone back in Jack Welch's glory days.While Immelt, Flannery and Culp haven't totally broken up the old GE, the firm has lost so many pieces that had formerly made it great. GE's financials and banking business in particular was a huge boost to earnings. That's largely gone now, with small pieces left here and there. Even if General Electric recovers, it's unlikely to regain its former glory.As a much more pure-play industrial firm, there's simply not the sort of upside that you had when GE was an industry-spanning conglomerate. And with this economic recovery already so well-advanced in years, it's worth asking: What will happen when industrial-heavy GE stock faces the next recession? For now, General Electric doesn't offer enough reward to justify the risk.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-12,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) shareholders have so far had a good year in 2019. Year-to-date, GE stock is up over 34%.Source: Shutterstock Most of the yearly gains came in the first two months of the year as investors seemed to believe that management would be able to create shareholder value in the long run.Between March and so far in July, GE stock has been trading in a range. Therefore investors are now wondering whether the bulls or the bears will have the upper hand in Q3.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGE stock is expected to report earnings on July 31. Let us take a look at what may be in store for General Electric stock as we approach the earnings season.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  GE's Q1 Earnings and Long-Term CatalystsOn April 30, General Electric reported Q1 2019 earnings, when the group beat earnings and revenue forecasts on orders up 9%. EPS came at 14 cents vs. expected 9 cents a share.At present, the company reports revenue in six business segments: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Oil and Gas, Healthcare, and Capital.General Electric's Aviation, Oil & Gas, and Healthcare businesses delivered steady revenue and earnings growth.GE Aviation business, which is the company's largest segment by revenue, primarily builds and services aircraft engines. Earlier in June, Wall Street welcomed the news that the conglomerate signed lucrative contracts at the Paris Air Show.The segment took significant orders for LEAP engines as well as long-term service agreements (LTSAs). Wall Street pay close importance to service agreements as over close to half of the revenues come from from after-market services.Our readers may be interested to know that several analysts believe that the GE Aviation, which serves both commercial and military aircraft markets, may be worth about $100 billion when GE's own market cap is only 89 billion. Therefore, long-term investors may want to pay attention to the growth trajectory of the Aviation segment.The Oil & Gas Division, which is a cyclical business, has now returned to profitability.In Healthcare, GE has robust exposure to the hospital and lab equipment market. Several analysts see the possibility of an IPO for Healthcare.Within a few quarters, the company is aiming to have a much smaller GE Capital operation.  The unit reduced its liabilities as it completed $1.1 billion in asset reductions in the quarter.GE's industrial free cash flow is a key metric for many analysts and shareholders.  For the quarter, it showed a loss of $1.2 billion. Shareholders cheered General Electric in general, but especially the Power segment, burned less cash than feared. A Year in Progress for GE StockIn March, CEO Larry Culp called 2019 a &quot;reset year&quot; and urged patience during what has been portrayed as a multiyear turnaround. Following a rotation of CEOs, Culp took over from John Flannery in October. And has had a busy nine months so far.Under new leadership, General Electric has been taking several strategic steps to slim the group down to a few core units and raise cash by divesting from several businesses that no longer serve the group.These moves to clean up the balance sheet include the recent sales of the biopharma segment of the company's healthcare operation to Danaher (NYSE:DHR), a smaller industrial player, for $21 billion and the merger of its transportation business with Wabtec (NYSE:WAB).As a side note, before joining GE,  Culp had successfully headed and turned around Danaher, so industry watchers were generally supportive of the sale of the biopharma operation to the group.It has recently been reported that management would also like to sell GE Ventures, a diverse collection of over 100 startup companies.Long-term GE investors know that its Power division has had significant problems an sharp revenue declines in recent years. GE's core power product is the gas turbine.Wall Street is expecting the company to break up the Power segment in the coming quarters, a move that may benefit the GE share price.In other words through asset sales and spinoffs, GE is aiming to generate enough cash to reduce its $121 billion debt load and become more manageable.Last year, Culp took over a company with significant debt and unfunded pension liabilities and investors are understandably still nervous.Yet, overall, Wall Street approves the directional shift which seems to put the company on a stronger ground. And investors are reacting positively to these strategic moves that Culp has been taking.Turnarounds in industrial giants such as General Electric take a long time and never occur in a straight path. In the next earnings report, GE investors are likely to pay attention to improvements in individual segment margins and free cash flow trends. The GE Stock Price NowMany long-term shareholders know that General Electric stock price is a shadow of its former self. Let us go a bit back in history.In August 2000, GE stock hit an all-time high of $60.75. In October 2007, it was hovering around $40. By March 2009, at the heights of the great recession, General Electric's risky balance had sheet pushed the shares down to $5.73.In 2016, GE stock saw a decade-high of $33. But troubles for the General Electric share price began once again with 2017. Losses in the GE Capital unit and plummeting sales and profitability in General Electric's Power business put pressure on the stock.The market decline of 2018 pushed the shares once again to the single digits and in December of last year, the price saw a decade-low of $6.66.As of this writing, GE stock is hovering around $10.2. So Should Long-Term Investors Buy GE Stock?After years of continuous price volatility and decline, it is still proving hard for GE to regain investor trust for the long term.If you follow technical analysis, the long-term GE stock chart has been improving. In other words, bears are not in control of the stock price at this point as the worst has likely already been priced into General Electric stock.From a longer-term technical analysis perspective, I'd expect the stock to move up another 15-20% from the current levels within a year. Shorter-term, the stock will possibly continue to trade in a range, hovering around $10.I am also encouraged by the fact that GE stock's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is over 0.73x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services.  Analysts prefer a low P/S ratio, ideally below 1. However, a P/S number between 1 and 2 is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.Another way to analyze the P/S ratio is to compare companies in similar industries or segments. Our readers may be interested to know that the P/S ratio for Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 2x. For Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stock, the P/S ratio stands at 3.2x. And for 3M (NYSE:MMM) the P/S is almost 4x.Investors who do not yet have a position may want to wait until GE's earnings report in late July to have a better view on the developments within individual segments. Analysts will pay special attention to the sales figures in different units as well as the level of free cash flow.Those investors who already own GE shares, may either consider taking some money off the table or hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with Aug. 16 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility. Then, you may reevaluate your long position after General Electric reports earnings. The Bottom Line on GE StockOver the past few months, the narrative for General Electric stock has changed for the better and GE is not making regular negative headlines any more.I believe that many long-term investors are ready to give GE management, which has started dealing with the pressing issues, the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, I'd see any dip in GE stock price an opportunity to go long.The author has GE covered calls (July 12 expiry).

2019-07-18,"Long-beleaguered shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) would have to climb less than one dollar for nearly everything, including the rhetoric surrounding GE stock, to change for the better. But, in football parlance, that last few inches to a first down may as well be forty yards. Falling short is falling short.  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock And analysts aren't helping.On the verge of a breakout, UBS analyst Damian Karas lowered his stance on General Electric stock this week, from a &quot;Buy&quot; to &quot;Neutral.&quot; Karas believes the 40% rebound from the late-2018 low is about as much as GE stock is capable of rallying right now, without more progress on the cash flow front. The analyst is also suspicious of the company's power arm, which has proven to be dead weight for years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHe may be right. But, the right nudge could readily change not just how the market interprets information about General Electric, but change the criteria being used to judge GE.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now  GE Stock and the Failing ComebackIt's an idea that's been posed before, but merits repeating. General Electric shares aren't a typical equity at this time. They're a psychological chess match.Players are aiming to figure out how other players will feel about the most plausible headlines anywhere from six weeks to six months from now, including the potential sale of assets like last year's sale of its locomotive business to Wabtec (NYSE:WAB), or this year's planned sale of its life sciences division to Danaher (NYSE:DHR).Everyone's playing the game too, including the media, and including analysts. Most don't know they're playing the game, but 'being right' about General Electric would be a nice feather in someone's career cap.To that end, the chart's been largely leading the rhetoric, rather than the other way around. It's arguable that UBS' Karas would have remained bullish and raised his target had GE stock started July as bullishly as it ended June. The downgrade didn't take shape until General Electric shares had decidedly stalled.That chart, however, is still oh-so-close to the technical breakout that could serve as a paradigm shift.There are actually two lines in the sand to watch. One of them, $10.53, where GE shares peaked several times since February. It's plotted in red on the daily chart.The other is $10.73, marked as a blue dashed line on the image. That's where General Electric shares peaked a couple of times late last month. GE stock actually traded above levels in late February, but the two aforementioned lines have been highs multiple times.Though unable to clear either ceiling yet, that's the direction things are moving. GE has made a string of higher lows since the end of last year, and that effort is relatively well organized. That is, the key lows are lined up, creating a technical floor that's likely to halt any pullback. That floor is marked as a yellow dashed line.The shape of the chart itself, however, is bullish.The converging support and resistance lines are squeezing GE stock into the tip of a wedge pattern bullishly, building up pressure the entire time. If-and-when General Electric is finally forced out of the confines of the wedge, traders could make up for lost time.If that break is pointed upward, look for a slew of upgrades. Look for the headlines to suddenly change their tone and timbre. Look for cash flow to matter just a little less. Looking Ahead for GE stockDespite a handful of respectable efforts, General Electric are having trouble with a tough ceiling.Still, it's noteworthy that Karas' newest ho-hum opinion of GE came with a clear escape plan:&quot;We expect new management to make the right decisions, which will take time…Much of the risk is now priced in and we think the stock will take a breather on a relative basis until we get more clarity on individual assets. In particular, we flag Power, which hardly contributes to GE's equity value today but we think could dominate sentiment into 2020.&quot;He's absolutely right in that regard -- sentiment remains the key.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-18,"After a big rally, General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has stalled out. General Electric stock has traded sideways for about a four and half months now, staying mostly in a range between $9 and $10.25.Source: Shutterstock It's not terribly difficult to see why that is. After a long decline over the last few years - including two dividend cuts - investors and analysts don't entirely trust General Electric stock. To some, including InvestorPlace columnist Dana Blankenhorn, GE's debt and pension liabilities suggest years of pain ahead. To others, the long-awaited turnaround is at hand.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Increasingly, it seems like it will be GE Aviation that determines whether the bulls or bears will prove correct. That's not terribly surprising, of course: Aviation is GE's most profitable, and likely its most valuable, business. It generated roughly 60% of the company's segment-level profit last year, according to General Electric's 10-K filing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the gap between bulls' and bears' views of what Aviation truly is worth appears to be widening.  The issues at Boeing (NYSE:BA) add a dose of uncertainty to the debate. Skeptics and believers see the unit's performance at the recent Paris Air Show very differently. Indeed, they see the future of the unit very differently.Heading into the second half of 2019, with GE's Q2 earnings two weeks away, it seems likely that the continuing argument over GE stock is going to come down to GE Aviation. A Big Win for GE AviationOn its face, the Paris Air Show last month - the industry's biggest event - seems like a win for General Electric. GE Aviation and its joint venture booked a record combined $55 billion in orders, per a company press release. That was up from $31 billion the year before.Obviously, that $55 billion isn't turning into revenue in 2020  or even necessarily by 2025. But with commercial aircraft demand still strong, it suggests that GE Aviation at worst is keeping pace with competing engine builders. That notably includes United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney, which has taken market share in recent years.Meanwhile, the merger of UTX and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) potentially creates a more formidable competitor on the defense/military side as well. And the delays of GE's new GE9x turbine engine hampered Boeing's launch of its 777x. After that news, and with its competition improving, GE Aviation needed a strong showing - and got it.Right? General Electric Stock Stays StuckPerhaps. But GE stock bears weren't so sure  and apparently, neither were investors. Even as stock markets raced to all-time highs, the lid stayed on GE stock.And two noted skeptics cast doubt on the headline. Stephen Tusa, who has been a prescient bear on GE stock for years now, went as far as to call the order figure &quot;a smoke screen.&quot; He argued that new engines - including the GE9x and the LEAP, the latter of which is manufactured in a joint venture with Safran SA (OTCMKTS:SAFRY) - might not be as profitable as GE's past models.John Inch of Gordon Haskett seemed to agree. Both analysts argued that the unit's 2018 earnings - and remember, 2018 was a disastrous year for GE as a whole - were likely above its long-term averages. As a result, Tusa argued that GE Aviation was worth potentially less than $40 billion, with Inch citing a $50 billion ceiling.Of course, as Barron's noted, other analysts saw it differently. Both Citigroup  and Barclays  saw the order growth as impressive. Those analysts are among the bulls who value GE Aviation in the range of $80 billion -$100 billion.Those differing valuations have an enormous impact on GE stock. What Aviation Means for GE StockWhat seems to be a $30 billion-$60 billion discrepancy on Aviation's valuation leads to very different views on GE stock. On its own, that range suggests a $3.40-$6.80 per share impact to a &quot;sum of the parts&quot; model.But that's not the only impact. Again, GE has a huge amount of debt. A stronger Aviation business will produce more cash flow that can be used to pay down that debt. It also gives GE more ways to raise money; a spin-off or partial sale of the unit can be used to raise capital, for instance.A weaker Aviation business, however, leaves GE in something close to trouble. The Power business still is a mess. GE Healthcare's profits are coming down after the company sold GE Biopharma to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21 billion. Aviation matters not just in terms of paper valuation; it has to drive much of the growth and cash flow that GE needs to create.The importance of Aviation can be seen in the relative price targets of the four analysts, as Barron's pointed out. Tusa and Inch value General Electric stock at $5 and $7, respectively. Barclays sees GE stock getting to $13, and Citigroup  estimates that GE stock is worth $14 per share. On the SidelinesA weaker Aviation business would be bad news for GE stock. I argued last year in a detailed analysis that GE, in a breakup, likely was worth at most $14-$16 per share. Including the costs of a breakup, its value is something closer to $9-$11. That was based on an estimated valuation of Aviation, using its 2017 results, of nearly $100 billion.Not all that much has changed since then, though the arrival of new CEO Larry Culp has sparked optimism towards the company's future. But if Aviation &quot;really&quot; is a $50 billion or a $70 billion business, it gets tougher to argue that GE stock can rise. And given that I'm skeptical that the 737 MAX issues - which already are expected to hit GE's cash flow by $200-$300 million - will be resolved soon, I'm not expecting investors' sentiment towards the unit to improve much as the year goes on.As I've written before, I'm rooting for GE stock. It's an iconic American company, and I'd love for long-suffering shareholders to see a rebound.But its problems are real. Its current collection of businesses isn't all that attractive anymore. General Electric stock needs Aviation to be a big winner - and if there are any signs at all that it won't be, it gets very difficult to pound the table for GE stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-23,"Until February, General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock was fairly volatile and fell more often than not. Yet the shares have stabilized in recent months. In fact, General Electric stock has been in a tight range, trading  between $9 and $10.50 or so.Source: Shutterstock On July 31, when GE reports its second-quarter results, there's a good chance General Electric stock will break out of its range.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Keep in mind that the expectations of Wall Street analysts are muted. Analysts, on average, expect GE's Q2 revenue to come in at $28.57 billion, down from $30.1 billion in the same period a year ago. The consensus outlook calls for earnings per share of 12 cents, down from 19 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the owners of GE stock will want to get more color on the progress of the turnaround efforts of GE under its new  CEO, Larry Culp. For the most part, it looks like he has a realistic plan, which is focused on asset sales and spin-offs. No doubt, GE really needs a much more focused organization. The Issues Facing General Electric StockGE  has lots of moving parts, and it continues to suffer from major challenges and headwinds. For example, UBS analyst Damian Karas recently downgraded GE stock to &quot;neutral&quot; with a price target of $11.50, down from $13.Part of his concern is the fall in interest rates. He expects the drop of  interest rates to reduce the valuation of GE stock by $1 per share. But the company is facing a host of other swirling issues, which are tough to quantify.For example, the company has litigation exposure as well as an enormous debt load, which stands at $105 billion. Note that GE also has $75 billion of so-called &quot;other liabilities,&quot; such as pensions and long-term-care obligations. In other words, the company's total liabilities are close to two times the current market cap of GE stock.Another one of its major problems is its Power business, which accounts for about 20% of its overall revenues. Unfortunately, there is intense competition in the sector, and demand for power-plant components has continued to lag. Consider that Chinese operators are also gearing up to make an aggressive play for the business.Stephen Tusa, who is an analyst at JPMorgan, has noted: &quot;We believe a full accounting of the situation with a closer look at the data, even a rudimentary review, supports our view that (the Power unit of) GE is indeed losing market share…&quot;In 2017 and 2018, Tusa's bear call on GE stock was accurate. What's more, he remains dour, with his price target on General Electric stock standing at a mere $5 per share.Interestingly enough, even GE's Aviation business is looking dicey right now, despite its traction at the Paris Air Show recently.  Boeing's (NYSE:BA) grounding of its 737 Max could last a while. BA, a GE customer, also will likely miss the deadline on its 777X widebody plane.If GE's Aviation business, which accounts for about 60% of GE's segment-level profits, slows, GE's  turnaround could be derailed. Tusa believes that such a slowdown is already occurring. The Bottom Line on General Electric StockCulp seems to be making the right moves. He certainly is a proven leader, as shown by his standout performance while he was CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), which was also a sprawling and complex organization.But for GE, Culp has indicated that 2019 will be a &quot;reset&quot; year. This means that the owners of GE stock should expect choppiness and probably some negative surprises. For instance, Culp has already said that the 737 Max's situation is a &quot;new risk.&quot;Thus, for the meantime, GE stock may continue to languish, and investors should  probably be in no rush to buy it.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-25,"If you're looking for a speculative bet on a well-known company, few names fit that bill more so than General Electric (NYSE:GE). Over the past few years, I have twice been dazzled and disgusted with GE stock. In other words, I've had some success with calling shares correctly, but I'll freely admit to some failures as well.Source: Shutterstock In my last article about General Electric stock, I gave a fairly comprehensive look at the bull and bear case. Ultimately, I concluded that shares presented a risky but compelling opportunity. With a healthy mix of both tailwinds and headwinds, GE comes down to market sentiment. For the last several months, the trajectory has been mostly flat. Thus, the bad news might be baked in.But here's the worrisome part from a technical perspective. GE stock is up 44% year-to-date. However, since late February, shares haven't moved much. Thus, a very real possibility exists that the bears will punish this pensive price action. We have already witnessed hefty losses in 2017 and 2018. No one would be surprised if the equity dropped further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season That said, General Electric stock is roughly only a third of its January 2017 market value. It's hard for me to imagine a repeat bout of such intense volatility without some fresh, persuasively bearish news.As such, I think the bullish argument has some merit, but only if you're willing to accept the risks. Here are three reasons why GE stock could stage a comeback: GE Is Under New ManagementI realize it's an overly-covered topic. For almost two decades, General Electric languished under former CEO Jeff Immelt's leadership. Naturally, GE stock also eroded, but not necessarily in a linear fashion.And this latter point represents a supporting argument for Immelt. After all, General Electric stock experienced two major shocks: one following the tech bubble and the other following the 2008 financial crisis. Neither event is Immelt's doing.That said, the optics ultimately derail the former exec's case. When Jack Welch gave the keys to Immelt, General Electric was a vibrant, robust organization. Today, it's a sad shell of its former self.Nevertheless, part of the American capitalist ethos involves coming back from the ropes. And if anyone can bring back GE stock from the grave, it's current CEO Larry Culp. During his time at Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Culp turned around a confused, convoluted organization into a lean fiscal machine.What I didn't know is that Danaher utilized an operational system called lean manufacturing, which emphasizes &quot;continuous quality improvement and low working capital.&quot; Toyota (NYSE:TM) and other Japanese firms pioneered this process following World War II.Surely, if war-torn nations can spark a comprehensive recovery, then a resurgent General Electric stock isn't completely irrational. It will take patience. However, those willing to exercise it might enjoy a profit windfall. Power Isn't DeadSeveral hours prior to writing this article, I experienced a sudden blackout. Immediately, I blamed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the rise of electric vehicles. EVs must get their power from somewhere, and that somewhere is our already-strained electrical grid.But what does this have to do with GE stock? Simply, the underlying company has two core businesses: aviation and power. Regarding the former unit, most recognize that this is General Electric's money-maker. While Culp has happily divested several businesses to drum up much-needed cash, he didn't abandon aviation.Last fiscal year, this unit rang up $30.6 billion in revenue. Take this away and you start having some serious problems. Fortunately, the overall narrative behind aviation is largely bullish, even considering Boeing's (NYSE:BA) grounding of their 737 Max jetliners.But the second-biggest revenue source is power. Last year, it brought in $27.3 billion in sales. That's great, but according to critics, the world is rapidly shifting toward clean and renewable energy sources.I agree about the shift, but I disagree with the implication. While we're headed toward a renewable future, that future won't come soon. I'll step out on a limb and say this: even if you're a young Generation-Z member, the transition won't happen in your lifetime.That's because our entire infrastructure is based on fossil fuels. Actually, this is one of my major criticisms about EVs. The tech is wonderful but if everyone jumped on board, it will cripple our electrical grid.Plus, fossil fuels are now plentiful and thus, incredibly cheap. Even MIT and the University of Chicago admit that &quot;market forces alone won't reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels for energy.&quot;Stated differently, fossil fuels are here to stay, and that directly benefits General Electric stock. GE Stock Has Found a BottomFinally, I arrive at my technical argument for General Electric stock: I believe shares have found a bottom.As I mentioned earlier, the bears will counter my point by emphasizing GE's flat trajectory. And I won't dismiss that reasoning. However, in most cases, people don't trade the markets just to watch a stock move sideways. Eventually, it will move decisively in one direction or another.I concede that the bullish arguments aren't that strong to skyrocket GE stock right now. This will require patience and tolerance to turbulence. At the same time, the bearish narrative isn't convincing enough to drop shares more than they have. Otherwise, we would have seen that decline.If I haven't already mentioned it, General Electric is incredibly risky. However, with a proven management team and an under-appreciated business unit, this is a name worth gambling on.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-26,"It's not good when even Warren Buffett loses patience with a company, but that's what's happened to IBM (NYSE:IBM) and IBM stock. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough IBM stock was up 35% this year through July 24, including dividends, IBM has become the poster child for lack of innovation. No matter what it does to alter its course and get with the times, the investing public doesn't regain faith in its leadership.   * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Investors' lack of faith in IBM stock is clear because its five-year annualized return is -1.8%, significantly worse than the 13.7% total return for the Morningstar U.S. Market  fund over the same period. But even better evidence was provided by a comment on a recent Yahoo Finance article about IBM.    &quot;IBM is Microsoft under (former MSFT CEO Steve) Ballmer. They need new leadership to reinvigorate the company's culture and direction. Right now, it doesn't matter who they buy or what they develop; the culture is one of stagnation vs. innovation,&quot; wrote B, a Yahoo Finance reader. Well, at least Ballmer's NBA team, the Los Angeles Clippers, got Kawhi Leonard. All is forgiven, Steve. But seriously, comments just like that one are very revealing. There is no love lost for IBM CEO Ginni Rometty.I recommended that IBM move on from Rometty at the beginning of 2018. The company's acquisition of Red Hat did little to change my mind. It's never paid anywhere close to $34 billion for any of its acquisitions.  The deal was a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; by Rometty. She's a big part of the reason for the company's stagnation, in my opinion. But I digress. Approximately 24 comments in, someone with the screen name Willie Fistergash  suggested that IBM should merge with General Electric (NYSE:GE).Crazy, right? Maybe so, but it does have some merit. Here's why.  Larry Culp's a Better BetGE stock is another name I've had very little use for, but now that Larry Culp's taken the helm, I've become a little more curious about GE stock.After all, Culp ran Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for 14 years from May 2001 to March 2015 before taking some time off from being a CEO. During Culp's 14-year reign at Danaher, the company's stock gained 514% or nearly 20% on a compounded annual basis. That's pretty darn good.  The owners of GE stock would obviously be quite pleased if he could repeat that performance. I suppose it's one reason GE's board is willing to pay him up to $300 million, in an effort to boost GE stockI recently wrote that the owners of GE stock should take profits -- it's up 44% in 2019 -- rather than continue to hold their shares in the hope that Culp can reignite GE's cash flow machine. I was basing a good deal of my negative sentiment on the analysis of analyst Stephen Tusa, who was the first analyst to become bearish on GE stock back in May 2016 and continues to be skeptical about the company, despite all of the moves Culp has made to slim it down to a few healthy operating segments. The $21-billion sale of GE's biopharma business to Culp's old company  is a textbook example of a company using insider knowledge to extract premium dollars for a business that's no longer useful to it.  What Does This Have to Do With IBM?Larry Culp is 55 years old. Ginni Rometty is 61.Larry Culp is a proven winner. Ginni Rometty has done nothing in her 7.5 years as IBM's CEO to demonstrate that she has the technology chops or the leadership qualities necessary to reignite the company's former penchant for innovation. I'm not saying IBM hadn't already lost its innovation spark before Rometty became CEO in January 2012, but she's been at Big Blue for most of her career. If she was going to make IBM great again, she would have already done it. The odds, however, of IBM and GE merging are extremely minuscule; I have a better chance of becoming the president of the United States, even though I was born in Canada and still live there.But, for long-time shareholders or employees of IBM, the idea of someone like Larry Culp taking charge is an exciting one. Unfortunately for IBM, Culp's already got his hands full with his efforts to boost GE stock further. Should IBM merge with GE?It's not the worst idea in the world.

2019-07-29,General Electric (GE) is slated to report its Q2 results on Wednesday. Let’s look at what analysts expect from the company in the second quarter.,Could GE’s Q2 Results Surprise Investors Again?
2019-07-29,"Heading into General Electric's (NYSE:GE) second-quarter results, due to be reported on Wednesday before the market opens, there's a good chance that its quarterly results will not beat expectations. But for longer-term investors, the risk-reward ratio of GE stock is extremely positive, as GE has multiple, powerful, long-term catalysts, and the company's valuation is attractive.Source: Shutterstock A few near-term headwinds will probably prevent GE's Q2 results from coming in above analysts' average estimates.Specifically, Boeing (NYSE:BA) may temporarily suspend production of its 737 Max plane and warned that its new 777X plane could be delayed because of problems that GE is having with its new GE9X engine. Those moves by Boeing may have stymied the results of GE's Aviation unit last quarter, preventing its overall Q2 results from beating expectations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, General Electric's Renewable unit is being hurt by the looming reduction of the federal investment tax credit for wind energy projects in 2020 to 26% from 30% this year. Finally, GE's healthcare business is suffering from  &quot;separation costs,  supply chain finance transition and compensation timing.&quot;   Given all of those headwinds, GE's overall Q2 results may even come in slightly below analysts' average estimates. And in the short run, mediocre Q2 results could cause GE stock to retreat meaningfully. GE Stock Has Long-Term TailwindsBut over the longer term, General Electric stock has multiple, powerful tailwinds. Many analysts and pundits have suggested that General Electric is poised to go bankrupt or disappear. But the company is very unlikely to collapse, as its CEO, Larry Culp, has said that it's &quot; 'making a lot of progress' on meeting its goals relative to reducing debt.&quot;  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold In another article, published in January, I noted that $26 billion of GE's debt is slated to mature this year in 2020. I estimated that the company could raise $25 billion of cash from selling assets. The company now looks poised to exceed that estimate, as it agreed to sell its biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion, while it's reportedly in talks about selling its air-leasing unit for $4 billion and it has agreed to unload a small part of its stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE) for another $4 billion.In June, another InvestorPlace columnist, Luke Lango, pointed out that &quot;GE's Aviation business alone could be worth more than $70 billion.&quot; But the market cap of GE stock now is only $91 billion, indicating that investors still have doubts about the long-term viability of GE. As those doubts continue to dissipate, the GE stock price will likely rise much further.The company's huge Power and Aviation businesses are showing tremendous signs of improvement and have powerful, upcoming catalysts.  As I pointed out in a previous column, in Q1:&quot;[T]he value of (Power's) organic orders, i.e. its orders excluding acquisitions and divestments of units, rose 14% year-over-year, while its sales fell only 4% YoY. That compares with a 19% YoY decline in orders in Q4 and a 25% YoY plunge in revenue.&quot;Meanwhile, in-line with my previous predictions, natural gas usage in the U.S. is actually increasing significantly, meaning GE stock bears' prediction of continuing decline in its use has been inaccurate. And, interestingly, Los Angeles, one of the nation's most left-wing cities in one of its most left-wing states, is looking to stop using three natural gas plants, but plans to use a new, $865 million gas plant.So natural gas is quite alive and well in the U.S., and GE's Power unit, which sells gas turbines and other equipment for natural gas plants, is poised to benefit from that fact. And as I've pointed out in the past, increased production of electric cars, data centers and marijuana will meaningfully boost electricity usage in the U.S. and other nations, significantly improving Power's results.Add to that the fact that Culp, who's universally admired for his management acumen, has said that he's working to improve the responsiveness of Power to its customers.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Save You Money Aviation, meanwhile, is benefiting from non-cyclical increases in the demand for airplanes from emerging economies. Its free cash flow its expected to be flat at around $4.2 billion this year and next year, before rising in 2021. In-line with that forecast, the unit received $55 billion of new orders at June's Paris Air Show, up from $31 billion in 2017. The Bottom Line on General Electric StockGeneral Electric stock is facing some short-term problems that will probably prevent the company's Q2 results from beating expectations. Still, the company's longer-term positive catalysts, along with the favorable valuation of General Electric stock, make the risk/reward ratio of GE very favorable. As a result of these upbeat catalysts, the company could also raise its longer-term guidance on Wednesday.As of this writing, Larry Ramer did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-08,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock is reeling after an earnings disappointment. Shares in the conglomerate have fallen more than 10% since announcing earnings July 31. The GE stock price opened at $10.76 on July 31, and has since slid to a close of $9.57 on August 6.Source: Shutterstock With quarterly sales down 1%, and total orders down 4%, the turnaround led by CEO Lawrence Culp remains a work in progress. Since 2018, investors have tried to call a bottom in GE stock. Some said the bottom would be $10 a share, only to see the stock fall as low as $6.51 a share in December. While shares have appreciated since the start of 2019, this recent earnings disappointment calls into the question the rebound of General Electric stock.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates So what is the verdict on GE stock? Is the company's turnaround plan still in motion, or will the company experience additional headwinds? Let's take a closer look, and see whether investors can expect upside in the GE stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Closer Look at General Electric StockAs mentioned above, GE's second quarter 2019 earnings failed to meet expectations. The year-over-year revenue declines were largely attributable to issues in the Power segment. The unit saw sales drop 25% from the prior year's quarter. Segment profits were down 71%. But GE's other units had performance issues of their own. The company's Renewable Energy segment saw significant revenue growth (26% year-over-year), but posted a segment loss of $184 million. Aviation saw sales bump up 5%, but segment profits were down 6% from the prior year's quarter.Healthcare was the only segment that saw an improvement in operating earnings, with quarterly segment profit up 3% from the second quarter of 2018. The Oil & Gas unit saw a 7% revenue increase, but a 2% decline in segment profit. GE Capital, the company's most complex and troubled segment, was able to trim losses from continued operations. Combined with gains from discontinued operations, GE Capital earned $148 million in the second quarter.But despite this tepid performance, the company has improved their outlook for 2019. In March, the company projected revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits for the year. Now, the company believes sales will grow in the mid-single digits. The adjusted EPS (earnings-per-share) forecast has improved from a range of 50 cents to 60 cents, up to a range of 55 cents to 65 cents. GE even reduced their projected restructuring costs from $2.4-$2.7 billion, down to $1.7-$2 billion.In the short-term, GE stock faces headwinds. Long-term, the Culp-led turnaround is still in play. Does this make General Electric stock a buy today? Let's take a look at valuation and see if investors should buy at the current GE stock price. GE Stock Valuation: In Line With PeersGeneral Electric stock currently trades at a forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) ratio of 21.7. The company's trailing twelve month Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 13.5.

GE's EV/EBITDA number may be skewed by the GE Capital unit, which utilizes a great deal of leverage. Nevertheless, investors are not paying a premium for General Electric stock. On the other hand, they are not getting a tremendous bargain. But with the company in the midst of a turnaround, operating earnings could materially improve, helping to boost the GE stock price.But with recent stumbles, can Lawrence Culp successfully pull off a turnaround? As the former CEO of Danaher, investors have high expectations for his skills as an operator. Danaher saw significant long-term stock appreciation thanks to its ability to generate high operating margins from mature industrial businesses. Can Culp do the same for GE? Bottom Line: GE Stock Has PotentialGeneral Electric stock has potential. But many stocks have &quot;potential.&quot; The question is whether the company can pull off a turnaround, remaking itself as a high-margin industrial conglomerate. If Culp can do for GE what he did at Danaher, the company could see not only improvements in earnings, but an enhanced stock valuation. This means significant upside in the GE stock price.For investors entering the stock today, do not expect things to turn around by next quarter. In fact, I would not be surprised if GE stock took another tumble. But for long-term investors looking to make a contrarian bet, GE is a strong opportunity.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-16,"My long-time friend Martin Bayne had Parkinson's disease for decades, forcing him into nursing care in his middle-age years. The cost of his care over 20 years was enormous, unbearable by either him, his family or (more important) any of the long-term care policies he had previously been in the business of selling, evaluating and recommending as &quot;Mr. Long-Term Care.&quot;Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com What Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos is calling a &quot;fraud&quot; by General Electric (NYSE:GE) of just over $38 billion, enough to sink the company, is mostly the natural consequence of forcing an unlimited draw on a limited pool of funds. The Cost of Long-Term CareThat's what long-term care represents. It's not just waiting to bankrupt GE, but you and your family -- even if you think you're comfortable. It can hit at any moment, from an accident, disease, or just natural aging.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNursing home care costs an average of $245 per day. That's $1,715 per week and almost $90,000 per year. This doesn't include the costs of doctors, drugs and the occasional hospitalization.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now The companies that sell long-term care policies are aware of these costs when they quote premiums. But they haven't always been, and many carriers have gone bankrupt. So have senior care centers and hospitals. So did my friend Martin Bayne. What Immelt Did Not DoAccording to Markopolos' report, GE should have been accounting for its unsustainable obligations with reserve funds back in 2012. The whistleblower claims General Electric didn't acknowledge them until new management came in. This created a $15 billion hit that had to be spread out over seven years.This was during the time when then-CEO Jeff Immelt was transforming GE from the banking-and-entertainment giant that predecessor Jack Welch had built into an industrial enterprise. This was highlighted by the $10 billion acquisition of French power and grid business Alstom in 2015. Analysts called the Alstom deal &quot;brilliant&quot;  but it eventually became a disaster. General Electric's GE Power has been dragging the rest of the company down ever since.But the company's refusal to account for policy costs is worse, Markopolos writes. GE is stuck with reinsurance on policies written in the twentieth century, long before the real costs were known. They have just $1,133 of premium, on average, 70% of which cover lifetime benefits for customers whose average age is now 75.Markopolos also claims that GE is hiding $9.1 billion in losses on its acquisition of what is now Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE), which the company closed on in June 2017. This was just four months before Immelt's sudden retirement that October. Markopolos estimates GE stock's current ratio of assets to liabilities at 0.67, once Baker Hughes' numbers are taken out of the balance sheet. The Bottom Line on General Electric StockNeither John Flannery, who succeeded Immelt as CEO, nor current General Electric CEO Larry Culp, who once headed Danaher (NYSE:DHR), caused GE's problems.Culp, who was brought in from the Harvard Business School, responded to Markopolos' accusation by buying $2 million in GE stock and calling the report &quot;market manipulation.&quot;But I have 20 years of second-hand experience in the horrors of long-term care, of how it bankrupts everyone it touches -- those who need care, who provide care, and those who try to insure against the un-insurable costs of care.I can't speak to Baker Hughes but, to me, the long-term care section of Markopolos' report adds up. Reinsurance costs have always hung like a Sword of Damocles over GE stock's books, perhaps even before Immelt became CEO in 2001.If you want to get to the bottom of this, ask Jack Welch when GE wrote that reinsurance. Meanwhile, get out of General Electric stock if you can.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-28,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) continues to reel from fraud accusations. General Electric stock plunged earlier this month after Harry Markopolos announced that GE has hidden an accounting fraud &quot;bigger than Enron and Worldcom combined.&quot; His revelation of the Bernie Madoff scandal has bought him some credibility. However, he also belongs to a hedge fund that would profit from the demise of GE.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com This connection has inspired a backlash against this report. GE also issued a firm rebuttal, one made more credible by GE CEO Larry Culp buying $2 million worth of shares.Whether Markopolos made a credible argument, investors received a reminder of the toxic assets GE once held and could still hold. Although GE stock looks poised to recover in the long run, the possibility of fraud means investors should stick to speculative positions only.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips General Electric Stock Should Eventually RecoverI've long referred to General Electric stock as a &quot;speculative buy.&quot; I have stated this on the belief that aviation and healthcare remain strong. However, I also stated that toxic assets not revealed to the public could remain on GE's balance sheet. Also, to the report's point, one cannot discount possible accounting fraud.On the surface, the condition of GE's balance sheet looks poised to improve dramatically. The company held $87.45 billion in debt as of the last quarter. Numerous asset sales will help pay down that debt. Its remaining portion of Wabtec just sold, and it plans to unload more of GE Capital's assets. It should also complete its divestiture of Baker Hughes, the sale where Markopolos calls into question some of the accounting. GE will also sell its biopharma assets to Danaher (NYSE:DHR), the current CEO's former company. All of these sales should eliminate more than $40 billion in long-term debt. Possible Fraud and Toxic Assets Priced Into GEHowever, the problem with GE stems from what we do not know. Investors should notice that General Electric stock has not recovered from the allegation. As of the time of this writing, the GE stock price stands at about $8 per share as it flirts with 2019 lows. Whether true or not, the report serves as a reminder of the possible toxic assets remaining on the balance sheet.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Under the short tenure of previous CEO John Flannery, both investors and the company board became frustrated by the &quot;constant drip&quot; of new issues. That appeared to have ended under Larry Culp's leadership. That showed when the recent revelation of issues at GE Aviation due to Boeing's (NYSE:BA) delays related to the 737MAX came quickly.However, the Markopolos report has possibly brought back that feeling. If that accusation proves true, investors will not feel a drip, but a deluge. Investors can then consider General Electric stock finished. Should You Buy GE Stock?Due to the accusations, the speculative part of the buy case for General Electric stock has moved to the forefront. The company and its CEO vigorously defended GE following the report. However, the lower stock price shows that investors remain wary.Investors still have good reasons to put money they can afford to lose in General Electric stock. At least from outside of the company, GE now appears forthcoming about its past and present issues. The &quot;constant drip&quot; of new problems has gone away. Also, the firm has downsized itself and begun to apply cash from asset sales to its massive debt. Assuming we know everything, this recovery should send General Electric stock much higher in the coming months and years.  * 7 of Worst ETFs -- Boot These From Your Portfolio Right Now However, the inner workings of a company happen away from the eyes of the average investor, and, for that matter, columnists at InvestorPlace. We all know that toxic assets on GE Capital's balance sheet played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis. As some might recall, the company needed a $12 billion loan from Warren Buffett and later, a $139 billion loan from the government to save itself. Before the crisis, GE Capital accounted for the majority of company profits. Today, it does not make up a large part of GE. However, the parts that remain seem to still concern investors.General Electric stock could eventually bring investors massive returns. However, with the company unable to totally discount the possible existence of toxic assets or fraudulent accounting, investors should consider GE a higher-risk equity.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-30,"Once upon a time, General Electric (NYSE:GE) was among the bluest of the blue-chip companies. The company's light bulbs and appliances were fixtures in American homes. General Electric stock was treasured by investors as the company was a Dividend Aristocrat -- a company that had increased its dividend for over 25 years. Today, GE stock is struggling to find direction.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com The company may be a phoenix getting ready to rise from the ashes. Or, if a recent report is true, the GE stock price could fall into the penny stock range as the company attempts to stave off bankruptcy.So which GE should investors put their trust in? And more importantly have they completely lost patience with more rumors of trouble at this once-iconic company?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE Stock Cannot Afford More Bad NewsOn July 31, GE posted second-quarter earnings that easily beat analysts' expectations. The results came in at 17 cents a share on revenue of $28.83 billion. Both EPS and revenue were lower on a year-over-year basis, but the news sent GE's stock price climbing to $10.45 per share. This is right in a range that has provided some resistance for the stock in 2019.Then on August 16, forensic accountant Harry Markopolos issued a scathing report that accused GE of $38 billion in accounting fraud. In his report he compared the violations at GE to be &quot;on par with those of Enron and WorldCom.&quot; According to Markopolos, the company has huge, hidden losses in its long-term care (LTC) insurance business. which is part of its GE Capital unit.  * 7 'Boring' Stocks With Exciting Prospects GE's stock price, which was already losing momentum, fell below $9 per share on the news - - a price that had been serving as support for the stock. As of this writing, GE stock was trading at $8.11 per share, putting it down for about 14% in the past three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average -- which once upon a time included GE shares -- is up 4.7% in the same period.  GE's New Sheriff is Plugging the LeaksI hold to the belief that the unknown is worse than the known. The problem for GE investors in the recent past is there have been far too many surprises that gave investors the feeling that General Electric has something to hide.However, it seems the steady drip of bad news that preceded new CEO Larry Culp has come to an end. In a recent article, my InvestorPlace colleague Will Healey pointed out that investors appreciated how quickly GE revealed issues at GE Aviation due to the delays from Boeing (NYSE:BA) related to their grounded 737MAX. But if GE wants to restore investor confidence, it will need Culp to be more than a competent plumber. Cautionary Tale for InvestorsThe industrial giant spent much of the late 1980s and 1990s expanding into ancillary business units including buying the NBC television network and expanding its GE Capital division into the consumer segment. However, even as the &quot;the house that Jack built&quot; (a reference to long-time CEO Jack Welsh) saw its market cap exceed $600 billion and its stock approach a record high near $60 per share, there were some analysts speculating that General Electric had strayed beyond the bounds of its core industrial competencies, particularly with GE Capital, which then accounted for the bulk of the company's profits.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income When the financial crisis hit, those investors were proved right. When liquidity dried up, GE needed an infusion of capital from Warren Buffett to calm investors. Perhaps the real reckoning arrived in 2009 when the company cut its dividend for the first time in 70 years. To its credit, GE has taken the right steps to divest toxic assets and is moving forward as a &quot;digital industrial&quot; corporation. But as the Markopolos report shows, the journey is taking two steps back for every one step forward. What's Next for GE Stock?Unless the claims of accounting fraud are true, I believe GE weathers that storm. What really seems to concern investors is cash flow. On the conference call following the earnings report, Culp said that GE has a better-than-expected outlook for its industrial cash flow. Since 2013, GE's operating cash flow has been shrinking. The main culprit was a decline in the cash it was booking from its core four businesses. Their Cash Operating Return on Assets (COROA) -- a metric that measures how much cash a company generates each year from all of the assets invested in the business -- is 2.7%.Prior to becoming CEO at GE, Culp held the same position at Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) from 2001 to 2014. In his last two years, Danaher's COROA was 11.3%. That track record provides optimism. However, Culp is selling investors on the idea that while the troubled insurance unit is a mess, the rest of GE's industrial business is solid. To some investors it remains to be seen if that story has a happy ending.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-09,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of America's oldest and best-known companies. As one of the original 12 members of  the Dow Jones Industrial Average, General Electric stock was viewed by generations of Americans as a solid investment.However, the company has grown in complexity and is involved in a lot more than power and lighting these days, as investors know all too well. A whistleblower report alleging accounting fraud at GE in general, and in particular in the company's long-term care insurance unit, resulted in an 11% one-day crash by General Electric stock on Aug. 15. Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com There's been a tentative recovery in the GE stock price since  it tanked on Aug. 15. General Electric stock is now up 20% in 2019, although it has given up the gains it made from January through August. With its new CEO approaching his first-year anniversary at the helm and after reporting better than expected Q2 earnings and guidance, is GE worth a look? Or does the current risks facing General Electric stock outweigh any potential gains? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Next Enron?Up until mid-August, GE was having a pretty good year; or, at least General Electric stock was doing well for investors. There were a few rocky periods, but by the end of July, GE stock price was sitting at $10.45 which represented a 38% gain on the year. However, just two weeks later, a shocking report torpedoed GE stock and raised serious questions about the company's future.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy On August 15, Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos, an accountant,  released a 175-page report detailing alleged fraud at General Electric, going back decades. Markopolos claims that after more than a year of investigation, he uncovered $38 billion of accounting fraud at GE, including an alleged cover-up of massive losses in the company's long-term care insurance unit (GE had to boost that unit's reserve funds by $15 billion last year). Markopolos launched the GEFraud website to host the report and provide details on what he describes as &quot;a bigger fraud than Enron.&quot;Markopolos pulled no punches when he told CNBC: &quot;It's going to make this company probably file for bankruptcy&quot;The market's reaction to the blockbuster report was swift. General Electric stock plunged 11% in its biggest one-day drop in a decade. Can Larry Culp Turn Around General Electric Stock?Larry Culp took the reins as GE's 12th CEO last October. There were high hopes for his tenure. Holding a Harvard MBA, Culp became the first outsider to run GE. He made a name for himself by boosting  Danaher's (NYSE:DHR) top line from $4 billion to $20 billion during his 14 years as its CEO. Despite initial hopes that he could &quot;fix&quot; GE, investors' confidence in its turnaround has waned. General Electric stock dropped from $12.69 in the days after his run at CEO began to as low as $6.71 in December, before staging a partial recovery over the summer.  Less than a year into his tenure, the jury is out on whether Culp will be able to return General Electric to its former glory. However, he has received praise for his reaction to the whistleblower report. Culp went on the attack, calling the report &quot;market manipulation&quot; that contains false statements. In addition, Culp put his money where his mouth is, buying nearly $2 million worth of GE stock immediately after the report went public. The Bottom Line on GE StockShould investors buy General Electric stock? Even after crawling out of the hole created by the Markopolos report, the current GE stock price remains well below its 2019 highs.  The shares are off nearly 70% from their fall 2016 levels. Morgan Stanley recently put a $10 price target on GE stock, but remains cautious. InvestorPlace contributor Tom Taulli recommends that investors hold off on adding General Electric to their portfolios, noting the company's high debt load, the risk of slowing global economic growth and the challenge that CEO Larry Culp faces in turning around a company as big and complex as GE. In other words, at this point, the risks facing GE stock probably outweigh its potential rewards.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-09,"On Oct. 1, 2018, the General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock price closed at $11.62. In the 11-plus months since then, General Electric stock has struggled, falling by 25%.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Why is Oct. 1 meaningful? It's the day that Larry Culp, the celebrated former CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), was named the new CEO of General Electric. Investors loved the move: the GE stock price closed 7% higher on the news. The hope was that Culp, who had presided over significant operating improvements at one industrial conglomerate, could work his magic at another.That hope seemed to fade quickly. Amid a plunging broad market, General Electric stock kept falling. In December, it briefly dipped below its financial crisis low of $6.66, touching a 25-year low in the process. A better broad market sparked an early 2019 rally, but accusations of accounting fraud last month sent shares tumbling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September For all the volatility and news, the irony is that not all that much seems to have changed in the last 11 months -- other than the GE stock price. Even the most bullish GE investor knew that Culp's turnaround efforts were going to take years to pay off. I've long been a GE bear, but even I have to admit: investors buying the turnaround last year should be absolutely loving General Electric stock below $9. A Busy Year for General Electric StockFrom one standpoint, GE stock looks very different now than it did last October. The company has aggressively sold assets to reduce its debt. Last month, GE Capital agreed to sell its aircraft leasing business for an estimated $4 billion to Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH). That follows a roughly $1 billion sale of energy investments to Apollo last year.In February, GE merged its transportation unit with Wabtec (NYSE:WAB), picking up cash in the process. It amended its agreements with Baker Hughes, a GE Company (NYSE:BHGE), and raised a few billion more in an offering of BHGE shares. Most notably, it agreed to sell its GE BioPharma business to Danaher for $21 billion.There have been concerns about the exposure of GE Aviation to the 737 MAX debacle at Boeing (NYSE:BA). As noted above, the company was accused of accounting fraud in GE Capital's long-term healthcare business. GE Power showed signs of life in the second quarter.Simply put, there has been a ton of news when it comes to General Electric stock. And yet, from another perspective, not all that much has changed. Has the Story Changed?As far as the asset sales and spin-offs go, it's not entirely clear that they created -- or destroyed -- all that much value for GE stock. General Electric obviously is giving up profit streams in exchange for near-term cash. That improves the balance sheet -- a key reason why General Electric bonds have outperformed General Electric stock - but doesn't necessarily change the total value of General Electric's business.Even the big sale to Danaher, which seemed like a logical step, wound up ending hopes for a spinoff of GE Healthcare. GE sold its Baker Hughes shares at $23; BHGE closed Friday at $23.53. The Alstom acquisition remains a weight around the neck of GE Power. The 737 MAX issues at Boeing could be good news - more spare parts sales for existing aircraft - while engine issues with that manufacturer's 777X add to the sense that Aviation truly is the hinge when it comes to GE stock.Even at GE Capital, it's not as if investors didn't know there were problems in the long-term healthcare business. The company took a $6 billion charge in January 2018 related to the unit. An analyst argued last October that reserves still weren't high enough.From a broad standpoint, this is a company still in year one of a multi-year turnaround. Power still needs to get fixed. Healthcare is a good business. Aviation likely is as well. And GE Capital seems like a black hole.None of that is news. Despite $30 billion-plus in asset sale proceeds, none of that really has changed. GE bulls bet a year ago that Culp could turn around a business that still had real value. Bears -- myself included -- argued that there simply wasn't that much underlying value anyhow. That argument still holds, and it still hasn't been resolved. A Lower GE Stock Price MattersIndeed, I argued in May of 2018 that, even in a breakup, GE stock probably was worth at most between $11 and $13. And so the price offered in October hardly seemed all that attractive.Truthfully, $9 doesn't quite, either. A ~30% decline in BHGE shares takes at least $1 off those targets. The news surrounding GE Capital, even putting the recent report aside, seems modestly worse than it appeared at that point.  * 7 of the Worst IPO Stocks in 2019 But other investors can, and have, come to a different conclusion. There were investors happy to pay almost $12 for General Electric stock less than a year ago. Those who bought the stock then should see the trading of the past eleven months as an opportunity, not a problem.GE stock remains a bet that Culp can get value out of the &quot;good&quot; businesses -- Healthcare and Aviation -- while minimizing the damage from Capital and Power. That bet hasn't been proven right yet, of course. But bulls can at least point the fact that it hasn't been proven wrong yet, either.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) finally looked to be out of the woods. GE stock bounced nicely earlier this year, and the company appeared to be turning things around. But a short seller has put GE stock back in the center of controversy once again. Harry Markopolos, famous for helping expose Bernie Madoff down, has sought out his next big target: General Electric.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Markopolos dropped a 175-page report alleging all sorts of fraud and misrepresentations at GE. As a result, traders immediately dumped GE stock, though it quickly recovered much of its losses. Various analysts, including other short sellers, pointed out errors and hasty thinking in Markopolos' report. Still, many traders are operating under the thinking that where there's smoke there may be fire. GE stock has yet to reclaim the $10 per share mark following Markopolos' negative analysis of the firm.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season  Reasons For SkepticismAs InvestorPlace's James Brumley noted, there are many reasons to question the Markopolos report. For one, various folks ranging from bank analysts to fellow short sellers and even an ex-SEC chairman have suggested there were &quot;suspicious&quot; things about his work. Bronte Capital's fund manager John Hempton slammed the report as &quot;utterly misleading&quot; and &quot;flat-out silly&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile Markopolos deservedly earned his reputation with the Bernie Madoff investigation, it's far different going after a public company. It's one thing to expose a total ponzi scheme. But with GE, Markopolos is going after nuanced accounting things such as assumptions on long-term insurance policies where accountants can disagree.Look at something like Brighthouse Financial (NYSE:BHF) where the famed David Einhorn is long, short sellers are on the other side, and they are having a healthy debate around the value of its long-term insurance policies.Markopolos, by contrast, is running around screaming fraud while discussing complicated details.Why is Markopolos taking such a direct approach? He seems to be going for a financial reward. Markopolos is angling to earn money from an SEC whistleblower program along with working with a hedge fund that profits if the GE stock price goes down. These reasons would give Markopolos motivation to play up the incendiary language in his allegations. There Are Valid ConcernsWhile I'm skeptical about the Markopolos report and its intentions, there are some points the bears have latched onto that are worthy of further consideration. For example, GE has negative working capital -- and a lot of it. The figure pencils out around $10 to $20 billion depending on what all you count.What's this mean? General Electric owes more in short-term liabilities than it has in short-term assets. This can be a good thing. For example, think of a subscription business, where people pay you before you deliver a service to them. In the case of an industrial firm like GE, however, a large negative working capital position could mean the company is in weaker financial position than you'd think from a quick glance at its credit rating.In addition to the negative working capital point, analysts concede that Markopolos has some valid concerns on other things such as valuation marks on some divisions and how the value of long-term insurance contracts are calculated. But there's little evidence of anything close to outright fraud. It's Dangerous to Bet Against Larry CulpOne of the weirder things about calling GE a massive fraud is its management team. General Electric already cleaned the deck of its old team and brought in Larry Culp. For those unfamiliar, Culp was the longtime head of industrial powerhouse Danaher (NYSE:DHR). During Culp's tenure, Danaher stock appreciated roughly 500%. Culp is clearly a skilled leader, and there was no evidence of any wrongdoing in his previous highly-successful company.Once Markopolos leveled his charges against GE, Culp stepped in and bought GE stock aggressively. Culp said the allegations are baseless and defended the company with the strongest currency possible, his own money. In fact, Culp invested more in GE stock following the fraud claims than he invested in Danaher during his triumphant run at that firm. That's how much conviction Culp has that Markopolos is shooting blanks.Does a great leader guarantee that GE will succeed? Of course not. Sometimes even the greatest management teams face insurmountable challenges. And General Electric is admittedly in a pretty difficult situation. But in Culp, you have an honest and proven leader. GE Stock VerdictIf you're looking for a safe industrial stock to buy, don't pick GE. GE just announced its measly one cent quarterly dividend payment last week. That's a stark reminder of how far GE has fallen from when it was one of America's most respected blue chip holdings. If you want a safe reliable holding, something like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is a better bet.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But if you are willing to speculate on a turnaround with a decent shot at success, GE is interesting. This Markopolos report could be a blessing in disguise, as it has aired some pointed questions about GE's accounting and offered investors a lot more transparency into the firm. As folks get more comfortable with Culp's vision for an improved General Electric, shares could rally nicely in coming quarters.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned UTX and BHF stock.

2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been a busy week for General Electric Co. On Tuesday, the company announced it would sell another chunk of its stake in its Baker Hughes oil and gas venture, ultimately raising about $3 billion. Two day later, it said it would buy back up to $5 billion of bonds. This activity gave CEO Larry Culp something concrete to point to on Thursday when he took the podium at a Morgan Stanley conference to update analysts and investors on the industrial conglomerate’s turnaround progress. “We’re doing what we said we would do,&quot; Culp said. That means &quot;tending to the balance sheet, making sure that we’re strengthening our overall financial position, and making sure that we’re in a position to run the businesses better.&quot;GE’s efforts to reduce its bloated debt load are a positive; that’s what it’s supposed to be doing. Culp’s ability and willingness to be proactive is undoubtedly an improvement over former CEO John Flannery’s long stretches of paralysis. But the timing of this flurry of deleveraging steps strikes me as slightly curious.Most companies wouldn’t go around buying back bonds when rates are so low; they would swap them out for new bonds at better terms. GE, however, has pledged not to add any new debt through 2021, and appears to be trying to signal its liquidity is such that it doesn’t need to. Yet Culp has also talked about running the company with a higher cash balance in order to reduce its reliance on commercial paper. And the $21.4 billion divestiture of GE’s biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp. – the linchpin in Culp’s debt reduction plan – hasn’t closed yet.Perhaps the Baker Hughes stake sale and the bond buyback were planned well in advance; perhaps GE is just being opportunistic and taking advantage of recent trading conditions. I can’t help but notice, though, that GE’s actions this week appeared to hit at the heart of criticisms made by Bernie Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos last month in a lengthy, explosive report.Markopolos has an agreement with an undisclosed hedge fund that will give him a share of the profits from bets that GE shares will decline. GE has called his allegations “meritless.” His report claimed GE needed to immediately funnel $18.5 billion in cash into its troubled long-term care insurance business and accused the company of avoiding a writedown on its Baker Hughes stake. One way to read the debt buyback is that GE must not be too worried about a fresh cash shortfall at the insurance unit if it’s willing to plop down $5 billion to repurchase bonds on a voluntary basis. And GE’s stake sale this week will bring its holdings in Baker Hughes below 50%, which will prompt a charge that could be in the ballpark of $8 billion to $9 billion but also allow management to put one more inevitable writedown behind them.(1)There were a number of flaws in the Markopolos report, not least his liberal use of hyperbole, but it struck a nerve with investors who were already wary of more negative surprises at GE and the opaqueness of its underlying financials. Whether or not there’s any truth to his allegations, being on the hot seat like that appears to have shaken GE executives as well.What’s most telling is the one Markopolos criticism that GE hasn’t yet moved to address, and that is the lack of detailed transparency in its financial statements and the seeming differences in its aviation unit’s accounting relative to engine partner Safran SA. Culp missed an opportunity when he became CEO to move away from GE’s historical tendency to rely on a myriad of adjustments and a micromanaging of Wall Street expectations to bolster the appearance of the company’s results. This week’s actions and Culp’s presentation were in a way a reminder that of all of Markopolos’s claims, questionable as the others may be, that one has the potential to stick.Otherwise, the key takeaways from Culp’s Thursday presentation were that he expects the drop in interest rates to result in a “somewhere south” of $1.5 billion hit to its GAAP reserve assumptions for the long-term care insurance business, before accounting for any other adjustments as part of a third-quarter test. GE's projected pension benefit obligations, meanwhile, will also increase because of the drop in interest rates. Offsetting that is an improvement in returns, but GE is still looking at an impact in the $7 billion range, Culp said. Neither of those figures are disastrous, but serve as a reminder that it’s not just regular old debt that’s looming over GE. There are many other demands on its cash.Culp gave no update to GE’s expectation for roughly zero dollars in industrial free cash flow this year. Interestingly, he did allude to the idea that the company’s forecasts for 25 to 30 gigawatts of gas turbine demand this year may prove overly dire; still, I remain skeptical of GE’s ability to drive a huge surge in free cash flow at the power unit over the next few years. Other challenges at the company include persistent questions about the true underlying free cash flow of the aviation unit, the loss of cash-flow contributions from divested assets and the need to backstop its huge underfunded pension balance with more cash. Culp didn't rule out additional contributions to the pension over the next few years.Progress on the debt reduction front is good, but without a significant increase in free cash flow, it will be a while before GE can shift investors’ focus elsewhere. (1) GE said in July that deconsolidating Baker Hughes's results from its own would prompt a $7.4 billion writedown, based on the company's stock price at the time of $24.84. This week, it said every $1 change in Baker Hughes's stock price would increase or decrease that number by about $500 million. GE's share offering was priced at $21.50 and the stock was trading on Thursday for about $22.50.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-09-12,"Larry Culp has been CEO of General Electric (NYSE:GE) for a year now and has made impressive strides against one of its biggest problems: the huge debts incurred by predecessor Jeff Immelt.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Long-term debt was down to $90 billion in June, and Culp has set plans to reduce it by about $30 billion more. These plans include the sale of GE Healthcare's biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and a slow exit from Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE).But some of the biggest overhangs from the Immelt era, like GE Power, remain. So does one from the era of Jack Welch -- the reinsurance of long-term care policies highlighted by whistleblower Harry Markopolos.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Where's the Beef?What's worse is that the asset sales leave GE with few avenues to growth -- and these growth avenues are why investors buy stocks.GE reported a small loss of 1 cent per share for the June quarter. Its $28.8 billion of revenue was down over $1 billion from the previous June. Losing the biopharma unit and, eventually, taking Baker Hughes' revenue off the balance sheet, will reduce revenue further.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now Culp seems to be two-thirds of the way to a turnaround. He has stopped the bleeding and created a new, more transparent corporate culture. Growth is the next step.In December 2018, GE filed to spinoff its most promising growth avenue, GE Healthcare, through a mid-2019 IPO. But Culp hasn't talked about it in months. In February, Culp told CNBC that a 2019 IPO looks &quot;unlikely.&quot; Many investors are waiting for an update.GE Healthcare accounts for one-sixth of the company's sales and nearly half its profit during good times. It  seems to be the perfect platform on which Culp could work the magic he worked at Danaher. There he bought smaller healthcare companies, built their value and sold judiciously.GE Aviation, the other big profit driver, faces a $400 million per quarter hit to cash flow from the Boeing 737-MAX scandal. But the unit continues to perform, generating military contracts even as foreign nationals get hauled into court for stealing GE's trade secrets. Analysts are Pounding the Table for GE StockDespite a lack of growth catalysts, analysts keep pounding the table for GE stock. A Citi analyst has a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the stock. Others have dismissed Markopolos' charges, which I detailed in July, as overwrought.The argument is that with less debt and business prospects improving, the company is trading at barely two-thirds its sales.Any kind of profit would thus be a catalyst for the shares, initially as a defensive play but later, based on Culp's acquisition wizardry. This is especially true if, as some analysts now believe, it has enough reserves to handle the long-term care losses. The Bottom Line on General Electric StockIt's hard for me to buy the optimism yet, but there's an argument to be made.I think analysts still underestimate the damage Welch's long-term care time bomb could do. Given the high cost of nursing care, and the average age of those insured, this will remain a problem for years to come.But by the end of this year Culp may have cut GE's debt nearly in half through asset sales. If GE Power really is on a &quot;positive trajectory,&quot; as one analyst recently claimed, it would take care of the last big downside risk.The question then becomes how Culp can create growth. The June quarter showed GE with over $71 billion in cash and short-term investments on its books. Some of that is committed to the remains of GE Capital, which Immelt used as a cash cow to build his power and energy conglomerate.But there may be enough there for Culp to shop for a healthcare acquisition. If he makes one, the stock will rise.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-10-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Has it only been a year?Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of General Electric Co.’s ouster of CEO John Flannery in favor of board member Larry Culp, an outsider respected for his operational prowess and dealmaking as the former head of Danaher Corp. It was an abrupt change for a company that usually moves at a glacial pace, but the prospect of a steep quarterly operating loss in GE’s struggling power unit and a $22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous acquisition of Alstom SA’s energy assets convinced the board that Flannery wasn’t moving nearly fast enough to save the company.  It feels like much more time has passed since that fateful management switch, and that’s partly to Culp’s credit: He’s been much more aggressive and decisive than his predecessor about divesting assets to shore up GE’s financial position, and he has worked systematically to refashion the board and instill a new operating ethos in the industrial businesses. Culp cut GE’s dividend, started unwinding its stake in the Baker Hughes energy business and agreed to sell its biopharma operations to Danaher for $21.4 billion. Thus far, he’s managed to avoid the kind of massive surprise writedowns that marred Flannery’s tenure.Culp’s furious pace of activity has helped stabilize GE, which is no small feat when you think back on the mess he inherited. But the stock is still lower than when he started and has stalled out at about $9 or $10. And at this point, most of the big, obvious buttons for change have been pushed. The company could sell its remaining health-care assets, although the fact that it’s scheduled an investor day focused on the business for December suggests it wants to keep that in the fold for now. A divestiture of its aircraft-lessor arm Gecas has been bandied about but is highly difficult to execute in practice. And GE’s biggest demons – including weak underlying cash-flow capabilities and risky black holes at GE Capital that despite Culp’s best efforts have at best turned a shade of mud-brown – have no quick fix.There’s not much for Culp to do now other than grind it out on cost cuts and operational rigor, and cross his fingers that the industrial weakness that's emerged around the globe won’t get any worse. GE's pension and insurance liabilities are at risk of ballooning from the slump in interest rates. As such, Culp’s second year seems likely to be lighter on big announcements and highly dependent on the whims of the broader marketplace. A stock rally from here depends on investors taking the long view.So far, they’ve been willing to accept any scrap of marginal good news as a sign of changing tides. Culp has somehow even managed to make the prospect of zero free cash flow from the industrial businesses this year feel like a win. But the path to a significant improvement in cash flow in 2020 and 2021 remains highly murky in the best of times, and an outright fantasy in a recession environment. One of the more fascinating aspects of GE’s challenges is that they emerged at a time when other manufacturers were doing well. That’s changing: The Institute for Supply Management's gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity fell deeper into a contraction in the month of September in the weakest reading since 2009. Meanwhile, a slowdown in the Chinese economy risks threatening even GE’s crown-jewel aviation unit.One thing that Culp does have control over is the company’s messaging. The biggest mistake of his tenure so far, in my opinion, has been his failure to do away with the myriad of opaque adjustments that have cluttered GE’s financial statements and presentations. For all Culp’s talk about 2019 being a “reset year,” this is the one thing he hasn’t been willing to reset and it has cost the company some credibility. Culp hasn’t ignored investors’ calls for more transparency: The company hosted a so-called “teach-in” to educate investors on the vagaries of its long-term-care insurance business, for example, and gave cash-flow numbers for its operating units on an annual basis. But the disclosures tend to be piecemeal, and when they do come are presented in a way that flatters the company or relies on overly optimistic assumptions. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Matt Levine recently flagged a paper that concluded at least some investors are misled by non-GAAP expense exclusions. He finds this theory frustrating for reasons you can read here, but in the case of GE, it’s not hard for me to believe that it’s true.GE is now on the hunt for a new chief financial officer, having announced in July that Jamie Miller would be stepping down from the job. Investors are focused on who the new hire could be and the prevailing thought is that Culp has to get someone with a big name and a respected background. Perhaps. But what he really needs someone who’s willing to reverse GE’s culture of carefully engineered earnings guidance and tell it straight to investors. A candidate concerned about guarding his or her hard-earned reputation might not be willing to do that, but it’s the kind of reckoning GE still needs. To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- General Electric Co.’s path to recovery is a long one, but the company no longer seems lost in the woods.  In releasing its third-quarter results on Wednesday, GE also raised its guidance for 2019 free cash flow and now anticipates its industrial businesses could bring in as much as $2 billion this year. That’s a $4 billion swing from GE’s worst-case scenario in its initial March forecast. There’s a fine line between setting a low bar and sandbagging the numbers, but GE’s rosier outlook is supported by signs of stabilization in its beleaguered power unit and there being less of a drag than anticipated from the transition of a supply-chain financing program to a third party. The aviation business was also able to largely offset the negative impact of the continued grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max. Those were key worry points that ended up not being as worrisome.It wasn’t a perfect quarter and there are some notable footnotes to that guidance increase. Still, a lack of nasty surprises and minimal signs to date of macroeconomic weakness in GE’s aviation and health-care businesses make this a victory for CEO Larry Culp. A flurry of deleveraging activities in the last two months had raised concerns that GE was trying to give itself some good news to talk about if the actual quarterly numbers were disappointments, particularly amid growing concerns that a manufacturing slowdown was deepening. That fear appears unfounded, at least as far as the last three months are concerned for GE’s businesses.Shares of GE rallied as much as 14% on the report, essentially erasing a slide since its last earnings update in July that in part reflected concerns over the impact of slumping interest rates. The decline in rates forced GE to reassess its expectations for the returns it will get on assets supporting the company’s long-term-care insurance business. While this contributed to a $1 billion pre-tax charge in the latest quarter as the company bolstered its GAAP reserves, it’s better than the “ somewhere south” of $1.5 billion adjustment – before other offsets – that Culp had flagged in September. And it’s certainly nowhere in the ballpark of what’s implied in the $29 billion reserve shortfall Bernie Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos claimed existed.Operating profit for the power segment turned negative again after a few quarters of positive numbers. But margins did improve in that business – to negative 3.7% from negative 14.8% a year earlier – which GE says reflects better pricing discipline. The company now expects the cash burn at the power unit to be no worse than the $2.3 billion outflow last year (adjusted for a reorganization of that business), versus an initial prediction of a substantial year-over-year weakening. The health-care division saw a nice lift in profit margins and a 5% jump in sales, even as its imaging business struggled in China and some larger U.S&gt; projects got pushed out. And aviation rebounded from an uncharacteristically weak second quarter. These are all positive data points that speak to Culp’s push for operational improvements.What hasn’t changed is that even at $2 billion, GE’s free cash flow will be very weak this year. The current forecast compares to $4.5 billion last year and $5.6 billion in 2017. While a stronger starting point in 2019 certainly helps, GE will have to overcome a number of challenges to get back to even those depressed levels. Already, GE will lose about $1 billion in free cash flow in 2020 from the sale of its biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp., per analysts’ estimates. Despite an improved performance in 2019, there’s no update at this time for GE’s expectation for the power unit to continue burning cash next year. And GE has to keep spending on restructuring. It again lowered its estimate for the cost of these cutbacks this year (which was a boon to its free-cash-flow outlook) in part because of the “timing” of politically fraught conversations in Europe over facilities and employees absorbed as part of its disastrous acquisition of Alstom SA’s power business. Keeping economic headwinds at bay will also be key.  Meanwhile, GE will get lower contributions from Baker Hughes as it continues to wind down its stake; a divestiture in September pushed that holding below 50%, forcing the company to take an $8.7 billion pre-tax charge in the quarter.Culp is doing what he needs to do to stop the bleeding at GE. Now the conversation shifts to what kind of company this is going to look like when he’s done and how far this turnaround can go.    To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-11-25,"Analysts had been looking for GE to hire a “rock star” CFO, and the Street is weighing in now that a selection has been made. CEO Larry Culp has some thoughts on the choice too.",GE Named a New CFO. Why CEO Larry Culp Says It Hired the Right Woman for the Job.
2019-11-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- General Electric Co.’s choice for its next chief financial officer lacks a “wow” factor but checks the right boxes.  The industrial giant announced on Monday that it had hired Carolina Dybeck Happe – currently the CFO at Copenhagen-based shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S – to help CEO Larry Culp carry out a turnaround that’s finally starting to yield some results. Jamie Miller announced her intention to step down as GE’s CFO in July, and the company’s been looking for a replacement ever since. Miller will officially hand over the reins to Dybeck Happe in early 2020.Dybeck Happe previously spent more than 15 years at Stockholm-based lock maker Assa Abloy AB, but she has little name recognition in the U.S. Certainly, this isn’t the kind of blockbuster hire that some investors had been hoping to see. Many had their eye on Daniel Comas, Culp’s previous right-hand man at Danaher Corp.  A hire like that would have gotten more reaction out of the stock. Instead, shares of GE traded up about 1% Monday amid a broader rally. Still, amid ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission into GE’s accounting practices, the value of simply announcing a hire and putting this matter to bed shouldn’t be discounted. And frankly, there is enough of a cult of personality already baked in to the current price. Most investors would tell you the stock could easily be 50% lower if it weren’t for Culp and the reputation for operational excellency he earned in his Danaher years.Culp has managed to so far avoid fresh nasty surprises in the long-term care insurance business and elsewhere at GE Capital, while the troubled power business no longer appears to be in free fall. There’s still a long way to go in this turnaround story, though. Remaining headaches for GE include a competitive market for what little demand remains for gas turbines in a world increasingly turning to renewable energy; the impact from divestitures; a fierce debate about the sustainability of its aviation unit’s free cash flow; and a continuing need to restructure, particularly in Europe where cost-cutting discussions can be notoriously difficult. Culp needs someone to help him execute on further operational changes, of course. He also could use the perspective of another outsider to continue to root out the cultural problems that led the company into this mess. Miller did a stint at insurance company WellPoint Inc., but she’s been with GE since 2008 and was likely too much of an insider to execute the kind of overhaul the company really needs. This includes finally breaking with its tendency to over-engineer its financial statements and prioritize optics over reality.There’s no reason why Dybeck Happe can’t be that person. Shares in Assa Abloy returned more than 150% to investors over the course of Dybeck Happe’s tenure as CFO there amid a spike in earnings, fueled in part by prudent cost control and in part by a steady stream of M&A. She’s only been at Moller-Maersk since January, but also sits on the board of Schneider Electric SE. Dybeck Happe’s European background could prove particularly helpful to GE on the cost-cutting dilemmas tied to its ill-fated acquisition of Alstom SA’s energy arm. And it’s nice to see a female executive replaced by another female executive for a change. Dybeck Happe was the first female CFO in Moller-Maersk’s 115-year history and was appointed there after at least one investor asked for more diversity, so her departure will be felt at the male-heavy company. Moller-Maersk’s loss may just be GE’s gain.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

But it's all a matter of timing. If you bought the day Culp joined, you're still down 14%.The glory days of Jeff Immelt, when this was a $30 stock and a dividend aristocrat, are gone forever. Culp has frozen pensions, leading to talk of a general &quot;pension crisis&quot; sweeping the world.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut Culp has also remade his executive team, made hard decisions on what to keep and let new hires make forward-looking statements.From here, everything depends on execution. Hard DecisionsCulp's hardest decision may have been to let General Electric's biopharma unit go to his former employer, Danaher (NYSE:DHR). The cash is desperately needed to firm up the balance sheet, which still had $76 billion of debt on it, against a market capitalization of $94 billion, in September.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Dominated Thanksgiving Shopping As I wrote in July, those numbers understate the case. The company also has $74 billion of &quot;other liabilities&quot; -- pensions and risks from old long-term care policies -- to deal with.The pension freeze helps with the former. The latter is a 25-year old legacy from former CEO Jack Welch, who took on re-insurance for long-term care policies before the cost of nursing care became apparent. Activists want Welch to turn in his retirement payout, as well as Immelt, whom I consider the greatest destroyer of shareholder value the world has ever known. It ain't happening. The New ToneThese moves have created a new tone around the company. Product rollouts are now called victories and buzzwords like &quot;citizen developer&quot; are gaining traction.Some analysts are coming around. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) co-founder Ken Langone says he likes General Electric again, saying Culp &quot;is doing a hell of a job.&quot;But this is only tone. General Electric under Culp remains much as it was under Immelt and his successor, John Flannery, an industrial machine company. GE Power remains a drag on results, although the company now makes more from renewable energy equipment like wind turbines. Healthcare is mostly big machines. Boeing (NYSE:BA) remains a drag on GE Aviation, and GE Capital can no longer soften the blows.For the third quarter, General Electric reported a loss of nearly $6 billion, 69 cents per share, on revenues of $23.4 billion. Culp emphasized that losses from continuing operations were just 8 cents per share. He showed $650 million in industrial free cash flow. He also pointed to a backlog of orders that now totals $386 billion, mostly for jet engines and industrial turbines. Since then the shares are up 9%, against a 2.5% gain for the average S&P 500 stock.Not everyone is convinced. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa, who saw the Immelt disaster coming and may wear the label &quot;GE Bear&quot; to his grave, says General Electric is still missing targets set only in March. He believes numbers look good only because of restructured spending. The Bottom Line on General ElectricGeneral Electric remains an industrial goods company. Industrial goods are not a great business to be in. The company continues to struggle with enormous debt. The amount it will owe on those long-term care policies remains uncertain.I continue to wish Culp well, but from the sidelines. General Electric is, at best, a speculation. If you buy shares today, you're betting it can generate big profits from industrial revenue, and that it can grow. Hope is still not a plan.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

But General Electric does have long-term potential, which could make it a good buy for the right investor. Consider the following four factors before investing in General Electric stock.1&#92;. GE still has a heavy debt loadInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the biggest issues General Electric has to address is its heavy debt load. In 2017, the company's total debt topped $135 billion. GE has pared down on this number since, but the company still has more than $115 billion in outstanding debt, far exceeding the company's yearly earnings.2&#92;. General Electric's healthcare business is growingGeneral Electric is currently in the process of selling its biopharma business to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21 billion. Once that's done, the company will be re-evaluating what's left of its healthcare business.  * 10 Best-Performing Growth Stocks of the 2010s Simply put, GE Healthcare is a medical device company that brings in $17 billion in revenue and has strong free cash flow conversion. It's not the most profitable business segment, but it is growing at a stable rate.3&#92;. Aviation could help GE stock take offOne of General Electric's most-valuable assets is its aviation segment. The company produces engines that power commercial airplanes, military planes, and helicopters. This segment alone generated $55 billion in new sales at June's Paris Air Show. The strength of GE's aviation business alone may make it worth holding onto the stock.4&#92;. Wall Street is lukewarm on GE stock On Wall Street, General Electric is considered somewhat of a controversial topic. Most analysts are supportive of the company's not-so-new CEO, Larry Culp, and agree he's the right person for the job.Culp was able to pay down a substantial amount of GE's debt by selling off many of the company's assets. He's also been working to improve the company's operations.  * 7 Energy Stocks That Are Still Worth Buying In 2020 But it's still up for debate whether Culp alone will be enough to propel GE stock forward. The stock is considered a moderate buy on Wall Street, and most analysts see very little upside in General Electric stock's future. Bottom Line on GE StockAll in all, most people are divided when it comes to GE stock. The company has acknowledged that 2019 is a rebuilding year, and GE has made a number of promising steps forward.The company has many promising business segments, but there are still many headwinds in its future.

2019-12-13,"After a relatively muted year in 2018, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) has turned in a remarkable performance in the markets this year. Specifically, shares of DHR are up nearly 50% year-to-date. Just as importantly, the life sciences specialist has found robust momentum late into the year under very impressive volume.Source: Shutterstock Of course, most of these gains are associated with Danaher's acquisition of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) life sciences business. As The Motley Fool's Lee Samaha argues, the deal, while mutually beneficial for both organizations, substantially favors DHR stock. For GE, they get to divest in an asset to make their organization leaner and help reduce debt.But for Danaher, the acquisition is a real shot in the arm for its own finances. In 2012, Danaher's revenue jumped to nearly $18.3 billion. However, in the trailing 12-month period, the company is looking at $20.4 billion in top-line sales. That's not exactly an impressive growth rate when the time to get there is accounted for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, with General Electric's biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical diagnostics businesses under DHR's belt, the acquisition promises to revitalize the organization. Over the last several quarters, GE's life sciences unit has witnessed strong growth. On the other hand, GE's healthcare systems unit has started to go flat.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Following the details of the DHR-GE deal in General Electric's most recent third-quarter earnings report, shares of Danaher jumped higher. In fact, since the close of Nov. 14, DHR stock has gained 11%. Further, volume almost hit the 74 million shares mark. Throughout most of the year, volume was in the low-millions level.With all the enthusiasm toward DHR stock, should you buy in? Danaher Must Prove Itself Beyond the DealDepending on your time frame and overall investment strategy, DHR will either appeal to you or it won't. On one hand, not much is going wrong for the company. Aside from the slow revenue trend, Danaher consistently generates per-share profitability. Also, it generates strongly positive free cash flow, a metric that should improve even more with the GE unit acquisition.Notwithstanding this deal, is there much to be excited about?According to Deloitte's outlook on the global life sciences industry, this year and the next several years represent transition. With technological advances becoming especially pronounced in this sector, this dynamic has opened doors for disruption. Smaller organizations are able to forward transformative technologies, forcing the old guard to respond.Using Deloitte's language, &quot;Data is now the currency of life sciences.&quot; In this regard, Danaher is taking the message of its core industry very seriously. For instance, GE's life sciences unit has pioneered several innovations in molecular imaging. Further, many of these innovations are backed by data points collected over several years.And as sector technologies improve, so will expectations for new and effective therapies. After all, the life sciences business isn't just about compelling research; at some point, people need to see tangible results.From the operational perspective, DHR's deal with GE makes perfect sense. But from the investor's point of view, this is a single albeit important catalyst. When the acquisition finalizes in 2020, the honeymoon phase will presumably end. Then, Danaher must start bringing home meaningful results.Given how much DHR stock has jumped this year, though, it's hard for me to imagine that shares will again have a banner year in 2020. DHR Appropriate for Very Patient InvestorsDon't read the above wrong: I'm not suggesting that Danaher is a sell. Far from it. Merely, I'm addressing the point that while the buyout of GE's life sciences unit is a net positive, when the deal closes, it will become very old news.And while Danaher is getting a great deal on paper - perhaps a bargain - there's a reason why GE sold: life sciences is a competitive field. Theoretically, DHR is better equipped to carry the inherent innovations forward, but it's no guarantee.As Deloitte pointed out, the industry is experiencing transformation and transition. Increasingly, next-generation technologies such as cognitive intelligence and blockchain have allowed smaller players to disrupt bigger ones.Bottom line: Danaher must stay on its toes while delivering substantive results. With DHR shares having jumped so strongly in 2019, from a tactical perspective, I think waiting is the right move.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-20,"Up almost 52% year-to-date, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is undoubtedly one of 2019's most impressive redemption stories among domestic equities. That's quite the performance considering it wasn't that long ago that once-beloved GE stock was left for dead.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com There's still plenty of work to be done after its two-year slump spanning 2017 and 2018. Time will tell whether or not CEO Larry Culp and team can successfully author more chapters to the comeback story. Over the near-term, however, it's clear that the Wall Street consensus price target of $11.45 on GE stock may need to be revised higher given the stock's recent price action. It closed just below that number on Friday, Dec. 13.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Even with all the good work Culp and team have done this year, Wall Street remains highly divided on GE stock with price targets ranging from $5 to $14. That's one of the widest gaps investors are going to find on an $11 name. UBS analyst Markus Mittermaier is one of the analysts in the bull camp, having recently upped his General Electric price forecast to $14 from $11.50.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMittermaier &quot;sees GE earning about $1 a share by 2022 and Culp's turnaround efforts take hold. That means shares could hit about $17 in 2021 based on comparable valuation multiples other industrial conglomerates,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Don't forget the market is forward looking and stocks tend to trade on future earnings. Paying $11 today for something which could be $17 in a couple of years works out to an average annual return of about 24%.&quot; General Electric's To Do ListOne area where GE could really foster some goodwill with investors is to continue whittling down debt. When Culp took over two years ago, the conglomerate was burdened with $135 billion in debt. That number has declined to $115 billion, still 15% above the company's market value and well above earnings.The trick for General Electric is finding a way to pare liabilities without giving up too much in the way of solid businesses. GE is in the process of selling its biopharma business to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21 billion and it's reducing its stake in an oil services partnership with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI). Although oil prices have dithered this year, analysts are growing bullish in Baker Hughes, which is good news for GE investors because the company still owns $8 billion worth of the oil services firm.Recently, Goldman Sachs added Baker Hughes to its conviction buy list while Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) put the stock on a comparable list.&quot;In a sector lacking near-term fundamental reasons to be enthusiastic, we see a structural bull case building for Baker Hughes,&quot; according to BAML. &quot;Especially as the energy sector enters a transitional period that focuses on (1) cleaner energy and lower emissions; and (2) digital transformation across all energy value chains.&quot;Last week, GE's troubled GE Capital business completed the sale of its aviation lending business, PK AirFinance, to Apollo Global Management, Inc. That's an incremental positive because as the company is currently structured, GE Capital is one of its biggest burdens. If asset sales of $10 billion in that unit are met this year and perhaps exceeded next year, that would be a boon for GE stock. It would get some risky assets off the books and the cash from the divestments can be used to pare debt. Bottom LineAs noted above, Wall Street is divided on GE stock and that's not going to change before 2020 rolls around. That doesn't mean the stock is a &quot;sell&quot; right now, but it does imply removal of the division into a bullish consensus (no guarantees of that happening) would be a big catalyst for the shares next year.On a more practical level, GE stock would benefit from further efforts to reduce leverage and to reduce the scope of GE Capital. In the latter case, investors may have to deal with the company selling pieces at seemingly unfair prices just to improve the health of that business and the overall company.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-23,"Danaher (NYSE:DHR) stock is up nearly 48% in 2019. Even in a year in which just owning the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) made investors a solid gain of 28%, Danaher has vastly outperformed the market.But can Danaher continue its success in 2020? The past performance of Danaher indicates that the shares are a solid buy, but does that indicate they are a great investment today? Source: Shutterstock Danaher stock is one of Wall Street's greatest conglomerate stories. Its success is due to Danaher's management philosophy (the &quot;Danaher Business System&quot;, or DBS). Always on the prowl for &quot;bolt-on&quot; acquisitions, Danaher acquires companies in its target industries and uses DBS to make them more profitable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis playbook has paid off big time for Danaher stock. But after its recent purchase of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) Biopharma division, can Danaher repeat its magic?Despite its high valuation,  Danaher stock may be a great defensive play if the runaway bull market starts to taper off. Let's dive in and see what's in store for DHR in 2020.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020  The Secret of DHR's SuccessDanaher stock has a strong track record. While not as well-known as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A BRK-B), Danaher has outperformed Berkshire in the past five years. Danaher's five-year cumulative return (excluding dividends) is 130%, versus 48.1% for Berkshire.In contrast to Berkshire's &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, Danaher has won big by actively improving the performance of its subsidiaries. After its success in more old-line industrial businesses, Danaher in recent years has pivoted towards high-tech industries. It is now focused on diagnostics, environmental, and life sciences companies.Furthermore, Danaher has begun making big acquisitions as opposed to smaller transactions. In recent years, DHR has acquired Beckman Coulter, Pall, and other large enterprises. The $21.4 billion purchase of GE's Biopharma unit is a continuation of that trend. Will GE's Biopharma Unit Move The Needle?As InvestorPlace columnist Josh Enomoto pointed out in his Dec. 13 article, DHR's acquisition of GE's Biopharma unit has been the key driver of Danaher stock this year. Since 2018, DHR has had so-so top-line and bottom line growth. But in the wake of this deal, Danaher could deliver stronger earnings growth in 2020.For next year, analysts, on average,  expect the company's earnings per share to climb 16.7% to $5.50.However, this growth could already be priced into Danaher stock. Danaher trades at 27 times the average 2020 earnings estimate and has an enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 23.7. Its peer, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), trades for a similar EBITDA multiple  of 22.6. But TMO's forward P/E ratio of 23.7 is cheaper than that of Danaher stock.The high valuation of Danaher stock is no accident. The company's movement towards Life Sciences has raised the multiple of Danaher stock. If DHR had stayed a purely industrial conglomerate like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), Danaher's shares would probably be trading closer to ITW's 16.3 times EBITDA and forward P/E ratio of 22.4.As a result of Danaher's high valuation, I don't anticipate the shares making another big move in 2020. But I do think Danaher stock will stay steady,  as long as DHR meets analysts' average expectations. But the company is also facing some risks. Danaher Stock Could Be a Defensive PlayDHR stock is just a few dollars off its all-time high of $154.98 per share. Investors remain highly confident in the stock market, and Wall Street is bullish that this decade's economic strength will spill into 2020.However, things can look rosy before they turn bad. Things can always turn on a dime. In the midst of a frothy market, paying high multiples for stocks doesn't look like a smart call.Danaher stock trades at a high multiple. But its shares are fairly priced. And the stock could continue to perform well in tough times, since Danaher primarily owns companies in defensive industries. That means those businesses could perform well  in a recession.DHR stock won't necessarily skyrocket during a recession. But during a correction, its shares should show greater stability  than more speculative high-fliers.The only wild card is the recent Biopharma acquisition. If Danaher faces headwinds applying DBS to its newest unit, expect Danaher stock to move lower as investors lose confidence in Danaher's magic. Wait for a Pullback Before Buying Danaher StockDriven by the Biopharma deal, DHR stock has been on fire in 2019. But at the shares' current valuation, the opportunity from the deal appears to be priced into the stock. Yet, thanks to the company's exposure to defensive industries, I don't expect the shares to dive during a stock-market correction.The best move may be to wait for such a correction. If DHR drops, investors can buy Danaher stock at a very affordable price. Barring material changes, DHR should rise meaningfully over the long-term. But waiting for a lower entry point could maximize investors' long-term returns.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-09,"As with many other stocks in 2019, General Electric (NYSE:GE) ended with a nice bullish move. Starting in early October, shares of GE stock went from $8.28 to around $12 per share. This put the year-long return for 2019 at about 53%, which exceeded the gain on the S&P 500.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com This performance, though, is more than just about general optimism in the overall markets. CEO Larry Culp has done a standout job at the helm since coming on board in October 2018.Although, this should not be a surprise. When he was the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) -- from 2000 to 2014 -- there was a five-fold jump in both the revenues and market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHe showed that he can effectively manage the strategic vision, as well as the nuanced details of a complex organization. He also demonstrated a great ability to apply process methodologies, like lean manufacturing -- which strives for continuous improvement. This approach was initially innovated at Toyota (NYSE:TM).  * 8 of the Strangest Stocks Worth Your Time When Culp became CEO of GE, the situation was dire. The company had gone through two CEOs, the shares were delisted from the Dow, the dividend was slashed and the losses were piling up. From 2016 to 2018, the General Electric stock went from $32 to under $7.However, Culp put together a smart playbook to right the ship. Of course, a key part of this was an aggressive focus on reducing the bloated cost structure. He also was swift in unloading assets, like the biotech business and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR).Yet, this was mostly about the low-hanging fruit. Going forward, it will likely be more difficult to find ways to improve the organization. Many Problems RemainOne of the biggest issues for GE stock is the GE engine segment, which accounts for a hefty 60% of the industrial profits. The problem, of course, is Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which has been sidelined due to two traffic airline crashes. It is still far from clear when production and deliveries will resume. But in the meantime, GE is feeling the impact, with a quarterly loss of $400 million in cash flows. This is likely to put lots of pressure on the company given the enormous debt load of $93.2 billion.Furthermore, the other company segments are also lagging. For example, even though the Power business has shown improvement, revenues were still off by 14% in the latest quarter. What's more, the Healthcare Systems unit has been mostly lackluster, with a meager 5% increase on the top line. There has continued to be weakness in China and the Middle East.Then there is GE Capital, which is suffering from the liabilities of its long-term care business. In the quarter, there was a loss of $645 million. Bottom Line on the GE Stock PriceFor the most part, Culp has stabilized operations, which is definitely crucial. Not long ago, there were serious concerns about the viability of GE; The situation had gotten that bad.But despite all this, it does look like that much of the good news has already been factored into GE stock. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 18x, which is rich for a company that still has a host of problems. By comparison, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) trades at 20X and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is at 18X. No doubt, both of these companies are on much more solid footing.So, at least in the near-term, it's probably best to be cautious with GE stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2020-01-17,"Once an iconic industrial giant, few companies have suffered as ignominious a loss as General Electric (NYSE:GE). In fact, the GE stock price peaked in the 2000s era dot-com bubble, never threatening to regain its former glory. But with shares turning in a tremendous performance in 2019, can this beleaguered organization do the impossible and recover?Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Obviously, I can appreciate the healthy skepticism that abounds with this name. Not only did GE stock peak roughly 20 years ago, it plummeted following a sizable rally leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Shares again crashed in 2017 after the company's fiscal situation became untenable.Plus, there's the adage: if shares are cheap, there's usually a reason for it. With GE stock, you're taking a big risk that management can pull off a perhaps unprecedented recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be fair, the business leader that has the potential to do this is current CEO Larry Culp. An executive with a long history of accomplishments, he grew the market capitalization of his previous employer Danaher (NYSE:DHR) to $50 billion from $9.7 billion during his 14-year tenure.  * 9 Up-and-Coming Small-Cap Stocks to Watch That said, Culp transformed a solid company to a great one in Danaher. But with General Electric, the wall that he must climb is in a different dimension. To draw a comparison, GE stock is the Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) of the industrial sector in that excellent leadership is not enough: GE requires other factors to shift favorably to see the recovery through.Can it happen? It's not an opportunity for risk-averse investors. However, if you want to take a small, measured gamble, here are three elements to consider: GE Stock May Enjoy a Geopolitical TailwindGeneral Electric's long-term stakeholders are undoubtedly familiar with the saying, &quot;when it rains, it pours.&quot; That was evident when Boeing (NYSE:BA) suffered a serious crisis with its 737 Max 8 jetliner. Due to a faulty stabilization mechanism, government agencies throughout the world grounded the plane until Boeing got their act together.As luck would have it, General Electric is the manufacturer of the Max 8's engine. Moreover, the company's aviation division was one of the few bright spots. Without it, the nearly impossible becomes simply the impossible. Naturally, then, investors avoided GE stock like the plague.However, the 737 Max 8 crisis won't last forever. Once Boeing earns back its customers' trust, General Electric can then get back to business.Also, GE's fortune may have finally turned regarding outside tailwinds. Presently, the headlines are not focused on Boeing, but rather, tensions between the U.S. and Iran. With the possibility that the conflict could eventually turn hot, GE's military aviation unit may enjoy a sizable lift. Power Is Still RelevantOne of the conspicuous societal shifts that we've witnessed over the years is environmentalism. Concerns about sustainability have dominated the headlines last year. And one of the forwarded solutions is to promote clean energy initiatives.Last month, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced their intention to convert one of their power plants to 100% hydrogen by 2045. To do this, the utility firm will integrate a variety of renewable energy platforms to produce hydrogen via electrolysis. Currently, technological barriers prevent meeting the 100% hydrogen goal earlier.But according to Harvard researchers Lee M. Miller and David Keith, that might not come to fruition. Based on their analysis, the U.S. is grossly underestimating the land requirements for going fully green. As an example, if the entire country were to be powered via renewable energy sources, &quot;it could require one-third of the country be covered by renewable solar and wind energy facilities.&quot;In other words, General Electric's power unit is still relevant. It's just taking some time for influential people and organizations to realize this. Technicals Are CompellingWe all know that GE stock is cheap. And as I mentioned above, such discounts exist for typically unpleasant reasons.However, the opposite angle is that shares have jumped substantially from its late 2018 lows. While hiccups have presented themselves along the way, the equity has marched steadily higher. Thus, there's a reason for that too.At time of writing, GE stock is trading just under $12. That places shares at the support line just prior to its October 2018 crash. To put it another way, GE is at a crossroads.For conservative investors, it's safer to assume that shares have again hit a peak. Culp can work wonders but General Electric requires a miracle. But for speculators, there might be enough momentum (at least in the nearer term) to spark a significant lift.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-21,"Investors are starting to believe in General Electric (NYSE:GE) again. GE stock has rallied some 54% from August lows. And there's a case that the rally can continue.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com After all, the bull case for General Electric stock rests on a turnaround engineered by chief executive officer Larry Culp. Culp transformed Danaher (NYSE:DHR) into a technology powerhouse; Danaher stock rose some 530% during his 14-year tenure.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Culp's appointment as General Electric's CEO on Oct. 1, 2018 was greeted with hopes that Culp could work similar magic: GE stock rose 7.1% on the news. But that enthusiasm has dimmed over time. Even with the rally over the past five months, General Electric shares are up less than 2% in the fifteen-plus months since Culp's hiring was announced.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe lack of upside so far suggests that more upside could be on the way if General Electric can drive the hoped-for turnaround. That's still a huge 'if,' however. Fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 29 will be huge in establishing how much progress GE is making -- and how much confidence investors can have in its future. Why Q4 Earnings Won't Change the CaseThe fourth quarter numbers themselves may not be all that important. Analyst estimates are soft, with the Street looking for earnings per share to climb a penny year-over-year on revenue down 23.5%.The top line pressure isn't necessarily the sign of a declining business. GE Aviation likely will see short-term pressure from the 737 MAX issues at key customer Boeing (NYSE:BA). And a reduction in the company's stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) means that business no longer will be part of GE's consolidated financials.Q4 almost certainly isn't going to be impressive. Of course, that won't surprise anyone who's been paying attention. These two short-term factors will hit the reported numbers. And from a long-term standpoint, even Culp himself has emphasized more than once that the turnaround here will take time.The one number that will be closely watched is free cash flow. General Electric already has raised its outlook twice this year, and needs to hit its target. The gap between earnings and cash flow long has been a problem for GE stock. It was a key part of the (admittedly questionable) short seller report that sent shares tumbling briefly last year. And disappointing cash flow generation contributed to the two dividend cuts seen in recent years.Reaching the current forecast of roughly $2 billion in industrial cash flow (which excludes contributions from GE Capital) would be a step toward restoring GE's credibility. That aside, Q4 numbers, barring a huge surprise, seem highly unlikely to change sentiment toward General Electric.But that doesn't mean the fourth quarter release doesn't matter. It does. Why the Q4 Earnings Release Might Change the CaseThe focus won't be on the backward-looking numbers for a quarter affected by external factors. It's going to be on 2020 guidance.Again, General Electric has a long road ahead. Success is not guaranteed. As Dirk Hackbarth, Professor of Finance at the Boston University Questrom School of Business, told InvestorPlace:&quot;Given its rebound, GE's future seems to be less of a &quot;continued turnaround&quot; and more one of a &quot;strategic disinvestment&quot; of its non-core pieces for the best prices it can get…Moreover, the proceeds from asset sales and spin-offs should be used to gradually de-lever GE to a level that is more in line with its profitability (e.g. return on assets) going forward.&quot;The bull case is that this will become a &quot;leaner and meaner&quot; General Electric. And so it would do wonders for GE stock if the company can show some progress this year. Right now, analysts aren't sure it will. Wall Street estimates for 2020 earnings per share currently have a wide range: the low estimate, according to Yahoo! Finance, is 49 cents, while the most bullish projection sits at 77 cents.That range isn't surprising given that analyst price targets too have a large split, as Hackbarth pointed out and Barron's noted last year. At the moment, the most bearish analyst (which I believe is Morgan Stanley's Stephen Tusa, long a GE skeptic) values GE stock at $5. The high target is $14.In that context, the 2020 outlook becomes exceedingly important. Full-year 2019 adjusted EPS should come in around 61 cents. If GE guides toward the low end of Street estimates, GE stock quickly looks overvalued. Investors are paying something close to 20x earnings -- and a higher multiple to free cash flow -- for a business still in decline.If GE supports more bullish expectations, however, this story gets much more interesting in a hurry. Guidance for, say, 70 cents would imply double-digit profit growth in 2020. Yet GE stock would be trading at roughly 17x that guidance. Rival Honeywell (NYSE:HON) trades at 21x 2020 consensus earnings with single-digit growth expected. A Big Stretch for GE StockAgain, next week's release won't prove that GE is destined for a turnaround -- or that it's doomed to further declines. But 2020 guidance, in particular, well may establish the direction of General Electric stock for several months, if not the rest of this year.It could go either way. GE stock could look very different depending on the trajectory established by 2020 results. Hackbarth forecast that the stock &quot;more likely stabilizes in the current price range&quot; this year. If 2020 performance in line with current expectations, that forecast is probably correct.But if GE can surprise to the upside, the story improves. GE has &quot;many attractive parts,&quot; as Hackbarth put it. Aviation should benefit from long-term air travel demand. Healthcare has real potential, as I detailed last month. GE Power has substantial room for improvement. Those three units underpin the bull case here.That bull case, however, exists mostly on paper for now. It's up to Culp and GE to turn that theoretical potential into practical returns and cash flow. A confident outlook for 2020 can drive more confidence on that front, and thus more confidence in GE stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- General Electric Co.’s shares have traded more on hope than hard math over the past year, but it looks like CEO Larry Culp’s turnaround efforts are starting to yield real results.Free cash flow is the key number to watch when the company reports earnings, and GE said Wednesday that it generated $2.3 billion from its industrial businesses over the course of 2019. That exceeded the high end of GE’s guidance range, which was updated twice over the course of the year from an initial call in March for free cash flow to be at best zero. Was Culp sandbagging expectations, or setting a low bar to start with and artfully managing to a positive surprise? (1) It’s a fine line, but either way, the strategy worked. GE shares climbed more than 50% in 2019 and shareholders were still wowed enough by Wednesday’s results to send the stock up an additional 10%.A lot of that optimism has to do with GE’s forecast for 2020.  The company is projecting free cash flow will at least roughly match 2019’s performance and potentially rise to as high as $4 billion. That would still fall below what GE generated in 2018 amid depressed results, but would represent significant progress nonetheless, and exceeds most analysts’ estimates. The company plans to hold a meeting with investors this coming March to lay out its outlook in more detail. On the earnings call, however, Culp let a few details slip.The beleaguered power and renewables units will likely continue to burn cash in 2020, with power improving from the negative $1.5 billion in cash flow in 2019 and renewables seeing a deterioration from the negative $1 billion the unit saw last year. Aviation will be flat to up from the $4.4 billion level of 2019, with the return of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max the biggest source of variability. That leaves health care as the one question mark. We already know the unit will be losing cash flow from the biopharma business that’s being sold to Danaher Corp. Without biopharma, the health-care division would have generated about $1.2 billion in cash flow in 2019 and GE had previously guided for an increase in 2020. Taking all of that together, GE should be able to fall well within its guidance range, but the potential to rack up a similar string of outsize positive surprises is arguably more limited this year.Boeing’s Max is the biggest source of volatility for GE’s guidance, Culp said on the earnings call, and the company is currently modeling for a mid-2020 return of the jet, in line with Boeing’s most recent “best estimate.” Boeing also reported earnings today and, based on that timeline, announced a fresh $5.2 billion in charges tied to compensation for airlines and additional production costs. The company also said it anticipates $4 billion in “abnormal costs” for restarting production of the jet. That brings the total bill for the Max crisis to more than $18 billion, before accounting for any fines or legal penalties from numerous lawsuits and government investigations.GE makes the engines for the Max through its CFM International joint venture with Safran SA and expects to see its shipment rate cut in half in 2020 amid the production halt. Asked about the $1.4 billion drag on free cash flow from the Max grounding in 2019, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller implied free cash flow would have been that much higher without that impact. In that case, arguably 2020 results could also be higher, but there are a lot of moving pieces here and it feels like GE is being more prudent than deliberately conservative.The shift from optics to fundamentals is a welcome one. Culp’s task now is to keep the momentum going. In contrast to this time last year — when expectations could hardly have been much lower for GE — there’s now a fair amount of optimism reflected in the shares. After the stock pop on Wednesday, the company is currently valued at about 28 times its expected 2020 industrial free cash flow of at most $4 billion. That compares with about 20 times at Honeywell International Inc. and about 18 times for Emerson Electric Co. Put another way, much of GE’s anticipated progress in this multi-year turnaround is already priced in to the stock. But so far, Culp has proved the skeptics wrong and the optimists justified. So maybe there’s more room yet for hope.(1) To put that in perspective, consider that about a month before GE gave its initial comments on 2019, uber-bear JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa was forecasting $2.5 billion in industrial free cash flow for 2019 -- meaning the actual results are actually weaker than what even he had expected heading into the year.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-03-20,"After the last few weeks, trading Thursday seemed almost normal. Following eight straight sessions in which the S&P 500 had moved at least 4.9%, U.S. stocks moved gently higher.Source: Shutterstock To be sure, there were intraday fireworks, as early losses reversed and midday gains faded. Overnight futures presage potential declines on Friday. The VIX, often referred to as the 'fear gauge' for the market, remains at an enormously elevated 72. Any investors who believes the worst is over probably is being too optimistic.Still, it does seem like U.S. authorities are getting their arms around the potential impact of the coronavirus. That raises hopes that investors will do the same.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, one key question remains: are U.S. stocks actually cheap? Yes, the S&P 500 declined 29% in a month. But there was no shortage of investors who believed valuations were questionable heading into 2020. Recession risk almost certainly has risen, and the short-term effects of the coronavirus-driven shutdown will add up to be material. There's a case that most, and maybe all, of that decline is justified.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Friday's big stock charts focus on three large-cap names for which investors are debating that very question. As they show, the question has not been answered. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Provided by Finviz Like the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found a bit of a bottom. And the first of Friday's big stock charts does suggest the bottom might hold:  * Most notably, NVDA has managed to find support basically right at the 200-day moving average. That comes after a bearish inverted cup-and-handle pattern played out, and on reasonably solid volume. This does look a chart where selling is starting to peter out. Simply put, Nvidia is starting to consolidate.  * That's almost certainly good news for the market, because Nvidia stock largely is a valuation play. To be sure, investors can debate how much market share the company might take from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in data center, or the pace and value of revenue growth in the automotive business. Still, from a broad standpoint, most investors would agree that the business is attractive; the question is what it is worth.  * There's still work left to do and NVDA is going to need market sentiment to at least hold up from here. At 23x forward earnings, the stock is expensive enough that it can continue to decline if selling pressure returns to the broad market. But the fact that Nvidia has found temporary support does provide a small bit of optimism that the market itself can do so more permanently. Danaher (DHR)Source: Provided by Finviz On the industrial side of the market, however, the news isn't quite as good. Danaher (NYSE:DHR) has been considered one of the world's best companies, but as the second of our big stock charts shows, that hasn't triggered a bottom yet:  * One key reason for concern is that during this decline support barely held. DHR stock fell through the 20-day moving average, blew through the 50DMA, and briefly paused around the 200DMA before continuing its descent. 2019 support around $135 didn't hold, either. There's really little evidence right now that buyers are on the way.  * One possible reason why is that DHR stock is not cheap. This is an industrial company that still trades at 20x 2021 earnings per share estimates (estimates which haven't yet moved, and thus don't appear to incorporate any impact from the recent economic disruption). That's not cheap by any historical fundamental standard.  * That fact colors the recent decline as well. As steep as the sell-off has been, the current price doesn't on its face seem like a multi-year buying opportunity. The stock is down just 8% from where it traded in November. Even with these declines, it's rallied 43% over the past three years, and 88% over the past five. This is not a 2009-style sell-off. It's not even necessarily a late 2018-type opportunity.  * DHR highlights the key fundamental worry here: that the huge decline in the market isn't coming solely because investors are panicking now, but also because the market was far too optimistic in January and February. In other words, this is a correction more than an opportunity. At least for now, that seems to be the tack investors are taking with Danaher stock. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: Provided by Finviz The case for cellular tower operator Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) somewhat splits the middle between Nvidia and DHR. CCI hasn't seen quite the same rally -- or the same valuation. But as the third of Friday's big stock charts shows, it is looking to find support:  * Buyers have stepped in around $130 in the past, most recently in November and December. They will need to do so again. Thursday's decline, on reasonably steep volume, isn't necessarily comforting, even though shares did manage to close above the lows.  * To be sure, support may hold. This is not a business whose prospects should be materially impacted by a recession. Wireless operators like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are close to utilities at this point. Consumers are not going to give up their smartphone plans right now.  * Still, it might be that stocks as a whole have to re-rate. And if that's the case, the decline in Crown Castle stock may have further to go. This simply might be a 'new normal' for stocks as the bull market ends. And that in turn means that investors expecting a return to bull market valuations are going to be disappointed.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

And since then, shares have gone from $12 to $6.7, for a loss of 44%.Source: Carsten Reisinger / Shutterstock.com None of my analysis had to do with the coronavirus from China, which was just emerging. But of course, the world is much different now -- and unfortunately, I still think investors should continue to stay away from GE stock. Strong Leadership Isn't EnoughIt's true that CEO Larry Culp has done a standout job since he took the helm in Oct. 2018.  He is a proven leader who knows how to run complex organizations.  Keep in mind that from 2000 to 2014 he was the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), which saw a five-fold increase in stock value during his tenure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCulp's leadership combines the right mix of strategic vision and understanding of the details. He also is a big believer in process methodologies, like lean, which allow for continuous improvement. Such strategies have their roots to the early days of Toyota (NYSE:TM).  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw While all this will be helpful, the fact is that it will not be enough. There are just too many serious issues facing GE stock right now.After all, before Culp came on board, the company was in dire straights. GE posted major losses on the bottom line and there was a slashing of the dividend. In fact, the shares had to be delisted from the prestigious Dow. Note that all of this happened while the economy was doing quite well.Now, Culp has certainly taken swift actions. He has continued to cut costs and unload various assets, such as from the medical business, to reduce the debt load. But this will probably not matter much either. If anything, Culp will need to take deeper actions -- and fast. GE is particularly vulnerable as most of its businesses are cyclical, except for the healthcare segment. So as the world plunges into recession, the company's cash flows will come under extreme pressure.Granted, GE is expected to get $21 billion from DHR for the sale of its biopharma division. There is also about $35 billion in credit lines. In other words, GE should have sufficient liquidity. But there will still likely be losses across most of its businesses. The aviation engine business is certainly in jeopardy as world travel comes to a grinding halt. Boeing (NYSE:BA), of course, has already requested a $60 billion bailout for itself and numerous suppliers.What's more, even though GE has been shedding its energy assets, there is still exposure to this market. The company still has a 37% stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR). Since early January, the shares have gone from $25 to $9.84. And the Power unit, which has been recovering lately, will also like deteriorate. Consider that the business has been cash-flow negative. The Bottom Line On GE StockBack on March 4th, GE put out guidance for its 2020 cash flows, which are expected to come in at $3 billion, compared to $2.3 billion last year. But this didn't factor in the coronavirus impact. And in light of the wide-scale closures of businesses across the US and parts of Europe, it's hard to see how this forecast could hold up.  It's also important to note that GE's aviation engine business accounts for about 60% of industrial profits. Thus, the next couple quarterly reports could be fairly bad.  So right now -- with all the uncertainty and the high exposure to economically sensitive parts of the global economy -- there's really no reason to buy into GE stock.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-04-02,"General Electric Co. (GE) has finalized the $21.4 billion sale of its biopharma business to Danaher Corp. (DHR).The sale to Danaher Corp gives GE net proceeds of $20 billion, after accounting for taxes, fees and factored receivable balances, GE said in a statement.“Completing the sale of BioPharma represents a critical milestone on our multi-year transformation, fortifying our considerable sources to de-risk our balance sheet and continue to solidify our financial position,” GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. commented.The shares dropped 11% to $7.04 at the close of trading in New York on Wednesday.

2020-04-03,"The closure of a recent deal will give General Electric (NYSE:GE) the liquidity it needs to ride out the coronavirus crisis without selling additional shares of GE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Meanwhile, its Aviation unit will struggle in the short-term but rebound over the longer term, and its Power and Renewables units should also perform very well in 2021 and beyond.On March 31, GE closed the sale of its biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR). GE is expected to obtain net proceeds of $20 billion from the deal. That's a lot of money, even for a huge conglomerate like GE.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGE CEO Larry Culp hinted that the deal would likely enable the company to weather the storm.""With regard to our financial position, our company is sound,"" he said, adding that the duration of the crisis was unknown.  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look But he subsequently added that the Biopharma deal would help the company sure up its financial position. He called the advancement of the deal ""crucial.""Reading between the lines, I think Culp was saying that, as long as the deal goes through, the company does not have to worry too much about its liquidity. The Aviation Unit Will Recover Over the Longer TermThe government's top experts are now acknowledging a hypothesis I've long held: that the coronavirus is seasonal, while its spread is likely to ease tremendously as the weather warms.Experts now expect the country's fatalities from the virus to number 80,000-200,000, way down from a previous estimate, even with mass closures, of 475,000. Antibody tests that will identify those who are less likely to catch coronavirus are expected to be released soon and the disease's spread in the U.S. is expected to peak in the second week of April.Taken together, I believe air travel will begin to rebound meaningfully at some point in May before accelerating greatly in June.A similar scenario will likely play out across most of the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, the vast majority of the world's wealth is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere.So as plane travel rebounds in the hemisphere, most of the world's largest airlines will likely gain enough confidence to resume buying planes in bulk, enabling GE's Aviation unit to resume its status as a meaningful profit generator and the company's crown jewel.And although coronavirus could rear its ugly head again in the fall, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top disease expert, recently said that multiple factors, including an expedited vaccine, will leave us much better equipped to deal with the virus then than we were at the beginning of this year. Consequently, I don't expect the virus to reduce air travel very much again. The Power and Renewables Units Still Look StrongAfter the coronavirus crisis is over, the trends lifting electricity demand are likely to remain very much intact. Specifically, the proliferation of electric cars and data centers will probably continue to greatly increase electricity demand.Meanwhile, even if oil prices remain extremely low, oil is unlikely to replace natural gas as a generator of electricity on a large scale. That's because oil prices have historically been very volatile, and it has typically not been used to generate a great deal of electricity. Further, natural gas is also extremely cheap, and it's much cleaner and has a significantly lower carbon footprint than oil.Speaking of carbon footprints, lowering carbon outputs is likely to become a high priority for much of the world again after the coronavirus subsides. That, along with the extension of the tax credit for wind energy in the U.S., should be very positive for GE's Renewables unit.Within the next couple of years, GE's Power and Renewables businesses, which together burned $2,5 billion of cash in 2019, will start generating positive free cash flow, a Seeking Alpha columnist contended recently. The Bottom Line on GE StockThe Biopharma deal will give GE enough cash to ride out the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, the rejuvenation of its Aviation, Power, and Renewables business will boost its results in the longer term, meaningfully lifting GE stock and making it a buy for long term investors.As of this writing, Larry Ramer owned shares of GE stock.

2020-04-17,"After developing a novel coronavirus test in lightning speed, Co-Diagnostics' (NASDAQ:CODX) stock soared to the stratosphere. The shares of the previously little-known company surged from less than $1 at the end of 2019 to a high of nearly $22 at the beginning of March.Source: Shutterstock But since then, for good reason, the stock has lost over 50% of its value. It looks like some investors have become aware of the many red flags that the company is presenting.Specifically, the company is facing clearly superior competition, and there's a chance that its tests could be defective. Further, Co-Diagnostics has not partnered with a major company on the test and seems to have only one major American customer for it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Superior Competition and Potential DefectsAt least two coronavirus tests are much faster than Co-Diagnostics' offering, which reportedly yields results in &quot;less than two hours.&quot; Specifically, Cepheid, a unit of the conglomerate Danaher (NYSE:DHR), unveiled a test that renders a verdict in 45 minutes. Another test developed by medical device giant Abbott  Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) provides results &quot;in as little as five minutes.&quot;And from a convenience and health standpoint, a test recently developed by Rutgers University and two companies appears to take the cake. Specifically, the university's test uses saliva to determine whether patients have the virus. That is more comfortable than the mechanism used by other tests, which typically involve inserting swab into the noses or throats of the people being tested.More importantly, Rutgers' test minimizes contact between healthcare professionals and those being tested, reducing the chances that the professionals will become infected. In fact, it appears that, with Rutgers' tool, people can self-administer the test without any assistance from healthcare professionals.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy For Portfolio Strength In Uncertain Times Co-Diagnostics' test is reportedly less expensive than competing tests. And according to the company, it can be administered more quickly than other diagnostic tools.But in this case, I think the speed at which results can be reported and the safety of healthcare professionals are much more important than the cost of the test. Further, since the test developed by Rutgers eliminates the need for healthcare professionals to be involved with the testing process, it is probably cheaper overall than Co-Diagnostics' offering.Co-Diagnostics developed its test in just one week. Further, the company said that it bypassed the &quot;trial-and-error&quot; process that's usually incorporated into the development of such tests. And before this year, the company's revenue was meaningfully below $100,000 per year, indicating that its previous products were neither widely deployed nor highly reputable.It's true that the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency approval to the company's test. But after the CDC used a faulty test for weeks at the outset of the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., I wouldn't bet a lot of money on the American government's ability to quickly and accurately evaluate tests for the virus. Cumulatively, these points make me think that those who believe that the test may not be accurate could be correct. Other Red FlagsCo-Diagnostics hired a private company called Promega to manufacture the test. Promega is an American company that has been in existence for over 40 years, and it reportedly had nearly $450 million of revenue last year, so it does not appear to be a fly-by-night firm. Still, I would have felt better about Co-Diagnostics if it had partnered with a Fortune 1000 company on the test.Finally, although the company stated on March 5 that &quot;numerous requests have been received from US clinical laboratories for the Company's reagents,&quot; as far as I can tell, it has not named any customers in the U.S. outside of its home state of Utah. The Bottom Line on CODX StockDespite its recent pullback, the stock is still up about 1,000% in 2020 solely on the basis of its coronavirus test. But the company is facing a great deal of tough competition in that area, and it has multiple red flags. As a consequence, I recommend that investors take their profits on the stock at this point.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

2020-05-01,"Coming into 2020, it was clear that General Electric (NYSE:GE) had a lot of work to do. But investors were optimistic. GE stock started rallying after third quarter earnings in late October, and reached a 16-month high in February.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus has undercut that optimism. As I write this, GE stock has been halved from February highs. That includes a 3.2% decline on Wednesday after the company's first quarter earnings report.The falling stock price, unfortunately, makes some sense. General Electric's challenges were significant even before the current crisis. Its outlook is downright grim now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades The good news is that GE management at least is aware of those challenges. And the balance sheet gives General Electric some flexibility to respond. But Wednesday's earnings report highlights the core problem with GE stock: even in a best-case scenario, it's going to take a long time for this industrial titan to bounce back. Not That Bad?On its face, the Q1 release doesn't look that bad, particularly in the context of a worldwide shutdown in March.Total revenue declined 8%, but in the industrial business the top line was down just 5%. Orders, on an organic basis, fell only 3%.Adjusted earnings per share did fall sharply on a percentage basis. But EPS of 5 cents doesn't seem that weak against 13 cents in the year-prior quarter.This doesn't look like a great quarter. But it hardly appears disastrous, either. Many other companies have released far worse results -- many more still will as earnings season rolls on.Looking closer, there's some good news as well, particularly on the order front. Healthcare orders rose 9%. The long-struggling Power segment drove 14% growth.This seems like a decent report in the context of the broader environment. But investors clearly didn't think so and I'm inclined to agree. Fundamental WorriesThe fact is that GE's turnaround is going to take much longer than hoped (by management's own admission).In Power, even with solid order numbers, the business faces &quot;a longer road to normalization,&quot; as chief executive officer Larry Culp put it on the first quarter conference call. GE already has laid off 700 employees in the business, and is looking to take out more costs there.In Renewable Energy, GE faced unspecified &quot;execution&quot; orders. Pressure on government budgets and plunging oil prices may push projects out.And, of course, GE Aviation is facing collapsing demand as global air travel has come to a halt. Key customer Boeing (NYSE:BA) has seen its order book shrink dramatically as a result, and those lost orders impact the long-term outlook for GE Aviation as well.As Culp noted, GE's only real strategy is to try and limit the impact of lower revenue on margins as best it can. Meanwhile, GECAS (GE Capital Aviation Services) also is taking a hit.GE Healthcare should rebound, particularly as elective procedures return once the focus on COVID-19 begins to recede. But that business is smaller after the company sold GE Biopharma to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) in a deal that closed last quarter.Three out of four businesses are facing significant short-term problems. But those problems don't end immediately when the global economy returns to some sense of normalcy. Aviation demand won't snap back. Crude prices may well stay low, which would pressure both Power and Renewable Energy. If crude rallies, investors have many better options to play that commodity.What Q1 shows is that the road has gotten even longer for General Electric. On the Sidelines with GE StockIt's likely that sense to which investors reacted in selling GE stock on Wednesday. But there's a broader issue at play as well, which becomes particularly clear when listening to the earnings call.General Electric is reacting rather than leading. Obviously, the external environment has something to do with that from a short-term perspective.It's not just a short-term problem, however. GE's answer to this crisis is the same as it's been to everything else in recent years: to shrink. Its workforce fell 28% last year alone. Biopharma is just the latest in a series of asset sales. GE Capital has been -- you guessed it -- shrinking its balance sheet.That's a problem similar to that of Alcoa (NYSE:AA), another former Dow Jones Industrial Average component. But it's not the only strategy a former titan can take. IBM (NYSE:IBM) looked to ramp its turnaround by acquiring Red Hat. It was a bold move that better positioned the company in the growing cloud space.At this point, what markets are growing for GE? There are pockets in Power. Renewable Energy probably has a solid long-term outlook. So does most of the Healthcare business.But even the 'good' markets aren't that good. The more challenged businesses are under real threat. That's been the core problem with GE stock for some time. First quarter results didn't create that problem. They illuminated it.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-29,"I've been a skeptic toward General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock for some time now. Truthfully, I'm not too happy about it.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com After all, General Electric once was one of America's greatest and most innovative companies. It provided thousands of employees with stable jobs and generous retirement plans. GE stock was a core holding of pension funds and individual investors.Sadly, that's no longer the case. General Electric offers many fewer jobs: its workforce shrunk 28% worldwide in 2019. And GE stock, almost incredibly, touched a 29-year low this month. Its dividend has been cut -- twice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe reality is sad. But it's still the reality. Investors need to react accordingly.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure While I still hold out hope for General Electric, I can't yet recommend that investors put their own hard-earned money behind the company's turnaround plans. Two pieces of news this week show why. GE Exits the Lighting BusinessOn Wednesday, General Electric announced that it had sold off its Lighting business. It is the end of era. After all, General Electric traces its history back to Thomas Edison and the light bulb he invented. That link has now been severed.Perhaps more importantly, as Bloomberg noted, GE is no longer a consumer company at all. Many of us remember the company's iconic &quot;we bring good things to life&quot; ad campaigns of the late 20th century. But GE Appliances now is owned by Germany's Haier (OTCMKTS:HRELF). The lighting business was sold to privately held Savant Systems.There's more than symbolism to the deal, however. According to the Wall Street Journal, GE Lighting sold for just $250 million. Over half of that was assumed liabilities. And it came after GE spent years trying to exit the business, during which time it sold off its Current LED business and some overseas operations as well.What the deal, and the process leading up to it, provides is another example that GE simply isn't what it used to be. Older investors, in particular, may have a sense of General Electric that simply isn't accurate anymore.As I've written before, General Electric's response to everything for years now has been to shrink. That process continues.GE stock did rally 8% on the news, but that gain seems driven more by bottom-fishing on a green day for the market than the transaction itself. $250 million simply isn't that material against a market capitalization still in the range of $60 billion. It's obviously not enough to offset the concerns that are keeping GE stock well into the single digits. Culp Speaks and GE Stock FallsTo be fair to GE, the decision to continually shrink the business isn't necessarily the wrong move. Chief executive officer Larry Culp is widely respected after his enormously successful tenure at Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and with good reason.But that's precisely the point. If GE could grow, Culp would be trying to drive growth. But with the company beset by a still-troublesome balance sheet and significant pension obligations, the focus has to be on getting the company back on solid footing first.The coronavirus has upended those plans. It has hammered GE's Aviation business, which counts Boeing (NYSE:BA) as a key customer.That in turn is testing investor patience. Culp said at a conference Thursday that GE would burn $4.5 billion in cash in the second quarter alone. GE stock fell 7% in response.The issue isn't just Aviation, but GE Capital. That unit finances aircraft, and as Culp put it &quot;is seeing a good bit of pressure&quot; from customer deferrals.The weakness from aircraft isn't ending in the second quarter. It's likely not ending in 2020, or even 2021. An investor need only look at the share prices of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) or Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) to see what the market is pricing into those stocks.There's simply not that much slack in GE's free cash flow profile right now to manage that kind of multi-year pressure. Even before the coronavirus hit, GE was guiding for industrial free cash flow (i.e., excluding GE Capital) of just $2 billion to $4 billion. If Aviation is down for the count, free cash flow stays flattish at best. And that leaves GE with little in the way of options. A Tough SpotThe problem for GE stock at this point is that the company has to fix its balance sheet through free cash flow. It's pulled all of the other levers.Again, it's sold businesses, including the $21 billion sale of GE Biopharma to Danaher that closed earlier this year. There's really nothing left. GE Power is in the midst of a turnaround, Aviation is in trouble, Renewable Energy is small (and providing some growth), and Healthcare is the profit center.Simply put, GE has to start making money. It's not doing so. And, again, I don't think that's necessarily the fault of Culp. It's largely the result of past decisions, among them the disastrous acquisition of Alstom that closed in 2015.Whatever the cause, GE simply isn't a leader anymore. It's not a giant. It's not an innovator. GE is not what it was. What the news from this week reinforces is that General Electric simply is a cash-burning company trying to turn itself around. And even in a best-case scenario, it likely has years left of work to do.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-06-19,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Larry Culp announced May 28 that it doesn't expect the industrial conglomerate to generate positive free cash flow until 2021. Despite the lack of cash flow, there appears to be significant optimism permeating among those following GE stock. Source: testing / Shutterstock.com That's good news for long-time owners of GE stock who are hoping the good times from days gone by will soon return.But will they? Here's a look at both sides of the coin. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Cash Flow Concerns Are RealCulp, speaking at an industry conference, said that its second-quarter cash burn would be greater than expected because of the issues its aviation business is facing due to the novel coronavirus and limited air travel. GE expects to use between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, much higher than analyst estimates of $2.5 billion for the quarter. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch suggested the extent of the company's cash outflow in the second quarter will be much higher than the rest of its industry peers.  Assuming it comes in at the high end of the range for free cash flow usage, the company will have burned through $6.7 billion in free cash flow in the first two quarters of fiscal 2020. The turnaround has definitely hit a major bump in the road.   * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting EdgeIn fact, Culp has admitted that things have gotten so far off track in 2020, free cash flow is going to be negative in 2020. InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel recently discussed the company's aviation business. He referenced a quote from the division's CEO, David Joyce, which provided shareholders with very little in the way of good news in 2020. The companies that GE sells engines to have reduced production schedules for 2021 and beyond. Cost reductions might reduce the free cash flow outflows, but they can't eliminate them. As Moadel suggests, GE stock is not a great bet at the moment. He wrote on June 16:&quot;Given the currently unfavorable aviation-market conditions, General Electric stock is primarily only a reasonable investment for patient long-term investors. In the short and medium terms, it's best to stay on the ground and wish the shareholders a safe trip on their unsteady and somewhat risky flight.&quot;Oh, and one more thing. Joyce, who ran the aviation division for 12 years, announced his retirement on June 15. While the company has a replacement already selected, this isn't a great time for bringing in a new executive.  GE Stock Won't Be Hurt By Cash Flow DownturnThe one thing GE shareholders have going for it is that Culp is a well-respected CEO. If he says the company will have negative free cash flow in 2020, turning positive in 2021, his years in the top job at Danaher (NYSE:DHR) suggests he knows what's what. He's given the benefit of the doubt. Since Culp's words of May 28, GE stock has moved sideways, which isn't a bad thing given the big black cloud hanging over most of the company's operating units. InvestorPlace's Chris Tyler recently suggested that the bears have it wrong with GE stock.&quot;This week Bank of America reiterated its buy rating and above-the-market price $11 target on GE,&quot; Tyler wrote June 17. &quot;Analyst Andrew Obin noted that aviation-related write-downs for the company's Capital Aviation Services unit look manageable and the business should continue to be cash flow positive. Specifically, the firm expects impairments of $800 million to $2.2 billion from the business and average free cash flow of $1.5 billion through 2022.&quot;At least in the eyes of the research staff at BofA, this cash flow situation is a solution in search of a problem. In other words, it's not a big deal. Tyler believes that if you give GE stock a chance, it could deliver in spades. I don't agree. In my last article in May about GE, I argued that the company doesn't stand a chance in this type of economy, no matter how many strings Culp pulls. He isn't going to be able to pull a rabbit out of his hat. Until we are virus-free, GE is not the kind of stock you want to own. It's a multi-year turnaround. It's pretty hard to fix a business when the economy's in the dumpster. The risks of owning GE stock in the short-term outweigh the potential benefits over the long haul. I do not recommend it.

2020-09-02,"After a disappointing summer, General Electric (NYSE:GE) finally looks set to recover. As air travel starts to return, the numbers paint a clear post-pandemic picture: that GE stock is no longer a value trap.Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Value investors have been waiting for a very long time. GE stock has lagged the S&P 500 by over 20% since June, adding to almost two decades of underperformance since CEO Jack Welch's retirement in 2001.Finally, the wait seems to be over. Since joining in late 2018, turnaround CEO Larry Culp has quietly sold off GE's less profitable businesses. And despite the coronavirus pandemic, here's why GE has become the most attractive aviation company in my Quantitative Stock Ranker (QSR) list.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE Stock: An Aviation PowerhouseJack Welch would barely recognize the slimmed-down GE of today. In March, the company shed its BioPharma segment to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion. Then in a stunning move just two months later, the company said &quot;goodbye&quot; to its 129-year-old light bulb business in a sale to Savant Systems, a maker of home automation technology. These moves follow years of dismantling within the former conglomerate.  * 10 Long-Term Stocks to Buy to Profit From Secular Trends Today, GE dominates the lucrative jet-engine servicing business (as well as medical imaging devices). And unlike the fractured airline industry, the consolidated jet-engine business earns stunningly high margins: GE's aviation segment controls 59% of the world's market and makes a 20% operating margin. That's because cost-conscious airlines are willing to spend more on fuel-efficient engines, even if they come with pricey service contracts.Source: Data courtesy of StatistaThese profits haven't gone unnoticed in my QSR scoring system. GE now gets an &quot;A&quot; in its &quot;quality-for-growth&quot; score, putting it in the top 10% of all U.S. large-cap companies. GE's Return to Pre-Pandemic GrowthIt's not, however, all good news. To create these fortress margins, GE sacrificed one crucial item: growth.Since peaking in 2007, GE's EBITDA has shrunk by 81% as it spun off assets. Profits in aviation, its crown jewel, sank 89% in H1 2020 as aircraft usage tumbled. Today, GE's QSR Growth score sits at an anemic &quot;C+,&quot; pulling down its overall QSR grade to a &quot;B.&quot;Source: Data courtesy of GurufocusSo, what would raise GE's scores? A return to growth.While the International Air Transport Association (IATA), an international airline trade association, estimates that airline demand won't return to normal until 2024, July and August have seen some improvements. By the end of August, domestic air travel in China reportedly returned to 98% of last year's levels, while the U.S. returned to 42%.Source: Data courtesy of TSAThese numbers come as welcome news to GE's bottom line. Analysts now estimate GE's EBITDA to rise from $4.15 billion in 2020 to $13.7 billion by 2024 as jet engines reenter service. Such an increase (after years of falling EBITDA) would raise GE's QSR Growth score to a &quot;B+,&quot; pushing its overall score to an &quot;A.&quot;That makes GE the top-scoring company in the U.S. aviation industry.  * Southwest: D-  * American: F  * Delta: F  * United: F  * Boeing: F What Can Go Wrong? GE CapitalGE's balance sheet might remain a cause for concern. The company receives a &quot;C&quot; grade for financial strength, despite having $41.4 billion in liquidity.Why? That's because GE Capital, GE's financing arm, remains a dark horse.GE has long struggled with its legacy capital business, despite spinning off its long-term care and mortgage insurance segments in 2004. In 2018, Bank of America claimed GE Capital had &quot;zero equity value.&quot; It warned that the company could lose billions in lawsuits.GE's management has moved to shore up the company's balance sheet. In 2018, GE Capital had a 5.7:1 D/E ratio. By 2020, that figure had shrunk to a more manageable 4.2:1.It's still far from perfect; AerCap Holdings, the largest aircraft leasing company globally, has an even lower 3.7:1 ratio. And last Thursday, rival Rolls Royce (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) reported a record 5.4 billion pound loss and warned of potential bankruptcy (signaling possible turbulence in the jet engine industry). But these moves should be enough to help GE survive until air travel returns. In April, Moody's, a bond rating service, reaffirmed its investment-grade Baa1 rating.Source: Data courtesy of Gurufocus Will GE Stock Rocket Back?The QSR scores have been quick to spot GE's comeback. Over 60% of the firm's revenues now come from its high-margin aviation and medical businesses. Its loss-making renewable energy segment has recently scored some notable contract wins.Analysts estimate that GE will generate over $99 billion revenue and $13.7 billion EBITDA by 2024. Putting these numbers into a two-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model shows GE has a fair value of $16.5, a 152% upside to current prices.Source: Data courtesy of Finbox.comThere's a good chance GE will finally meet these expectations as years of turnaround start to pay off.As we head into 2021, investors looking to play into the airline recovery story should strongly consider GE stock, an undervalued diamond in the rough.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.

2020-10-21,"On Thursday, October 22, Danaher (NYSE: DHR) will release its latest earnings report. Benzinga's outlook for Danaher is included in the following report.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings, also known as net income, is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Danaher reporting earnings of $1.36 per share on sales of $5.51 billion. Danaher EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $1.16. Sales were $5.04 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on DHRIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be up 17.24%. Revenue would be up 9.39% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 1.08 1.01 1.25 1.15  EPS Actual 1.44 1.05 1.28 1.16  Revenue Estimate 4.94 B 4.29 B 4.79 B 5.02 B  Revenue Actual 5.30 B 4.34 B 4.87 B 5.04 B  Stock Performance Shares of Danaher were trading at $227.095 as of October 20.

2020-11-06,"The year is winding down, and most of us would say ‘good riddance.’ Is there evidence that the markets are getting back onto an upward track? The summer saw big gains on Wall Street, perhaps a bubble, but definitely a bull market. September saw it slip off track, October has seen a partial recovery, while November started with a bang — or to be more precise, a boom.Some of Wall Street’s analysts see the remaining time for some smart stock plays in a volatile environment, and they are tagging their top picks to start the new year on a high note. Let's take a closer look.SVB Financial Group (SIVB)The first stock on the list is Silicon Valley’s largest deposit holding bank. SVB Financial Group is the holding company owning Silicon Valley Bank, a commercial bank specializing in high-tech venture capital. Since its founding in the 1980s, SVB has provided funding for more than 30,000 start-ups, and has also become a major financial services provider for Napa Valley’s vineyards.Working in the high-wealth areas of the San Francisco Bay region, and maintaining offices in other financial centers around the world – London, Hong Kong, and Toronto, among others – Silicon Valley Bank was well-positioned to weather the corona crisis. The bank’s revenue has been rising through 2020, from $807 million in Q1, to $860 million in Q2, to $1.08 billion in Q3. Earnings, after a sequential slip entering Q1, have also been on an upward track; the Q3 EPS came in at $8.47, beating the forecast by 55%.The bank’s shares have reflected the strong financial performance. SVB is up 27% year-to-date, having bounced back from the mid-winter market crash.Covering SIVB for Maxim, analyst Michael Diana writes, “SIVB remains our top bank pick due to: 1) its unique, non-replicable franchise; and 2) the growth implications of that franchise… The environment for VC-backed companies has improved, in our view, especially for the technology and life sciences companies that are SIVB's focus… we expect that SIVB's deposits, loan volumes, and investment/warrant gains should all benefit in 2021.”Diana rates SIVB as a Buy, and his $335 price target implies another 10% gain for the year ahead. (To watch Diana’s track record, click here)Overall, SVB Holdings has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 13 recent reviews, including 10 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. (See SIVB stock analysis on TipRanks)Danaher Corporation (DHR)The second stock on the list is a conglomerate, a globally diversified company based in Washington, DC. Danaher works in the science and technology field, bringing together a range of companies through acquisitions and partnerships. Danaher operates three business segments, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental & Applied Solutions.Danaher has performed well through 2020, repeating its normal pattern of rising earnings from Q1 – but on steroids. The first quarter EPS was low, at $1.05, but quickly rose to $1.44 in Q2 and then $1.72 in Q3. The third quarter result was 25% higher than expectations. Revenues followed a similar path, gaining from $4.3 billion in Q1 to $5.9 billion in Q3.DHR shares have heavily outperformed the overall markets this year, rising nearly 60%.Doug Schenkel, 5-star analyst from Cowen, sees Danaher benefitting directly from the current pandemic situation and, as a result, moves the stock to a Top Pick.“We believe DHR has one of the best product portfolios among the Tools group to address the current COVID-19 challenges (bioprocessing, Dx). Over the next several quarters, a double-digit pro forma core revenue growth rate appears attainable, in part driven by these COVID-19 solutions. Looking beyond the current pandemic, we believe management commentary on the evolution of the business portfolio, strategy to extract durable revenue from near-term COVID-19 driven demand, and M&A capacity (we estimate ~$15B+ over the next 12 months) should help build confidence that DHR is now plausibly built to generate sustainable HSD core revenue growth. This would be an impressive growth profile for a nearly ~$200B market cap Tools company and is well above current consensus estimates.” Schenkel opined. Schenkel, who is rated 56 of more than 7,000 analysts in the TipRanks database, rates DHR shares as an Outperform (i.e. Buy). His price target of $275 indicates an upside of 12% in the next 12 months. (To watch Schenkel’s track record, click here)Overall, Danaher boasts a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, and it is unanimous – the stock has received 6 Buys in recent weeks. (See DHR stock analysis on TipRanks)Boston Beer (SAM)The last stock on the list today is one you may be familiar with. Boston Beer is the owner of Sam Adams, the popular brew named after the Colonial-era patriot. Boston Beer is the fourth largest brewery in the US, boasted $1.33 billion in revenue for 2019.So far, 2020 has been a good year for Boston Beer. To put it bluntly, the social lockdown policies keeping people at home caused many of them to turn to beer for comfort, and Boston Beer has a well-liked flagship brand. The company’s earnings have risen steadily this year, from $1.32 in Q1 to $6.10 in Q3. At the top line, revenues have moved from $330 million in the first quarter, to $492 million in the third.Of the stocks on this list, Boston Beer has shown the strongest year-to-date share appreciation. The stock has almost tripled, gaining 183% despite all the vicissitudes of 2020.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, who holds 5 stars with TipRanks, has reviewed the company's latest Q3 results and was duly impressed. As a result, Azer reiterated SAM as her Top Pick.“SAM handily beat our above-consensus est. for 3Q (historically their biggest EPS quarter, at 40% of 2019)… the company expects *all* of their brands to grow in 2021… Despite the reality of COVID uncertainty, select nuances inform the company's ahead-of-expectation outlook: 1) delayed shelf sets… 2) line of sight in terms of in-house and outsourced capacity and 3) an outlook for a doubling of hard seltzer,” Azer wrote.In line with her upbeat outlook, Azer rates the stock as a Buy along with a $1,250 price target. Her target suggests an upside of 17% over the coming year. (To watch Azer’s track record, click here)Overall, SAM shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus on Wall Street. The stock has 9 recent reviews, breaking down to 6 Buys and 3 Holds.

2020-11-23,"Over the past three months, shares of Danaher (NYSE: DHR) moved higher by 11.30%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Danaher has.Danaher's Debt According to the Danaher's most recent financial statement as reported on October 22, 2020, total debt is at $21.83 billion, with $21.81 billion in long-term debt and $19.70 million in current debt. Adjusting for $5.69 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $16.14 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Danaher has $72.89 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-25,"Science and technology company Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) boasts a high-quality and defensive portfolio that has become ""less compelling to own"" ahead of a cyclical recovery into 2021, according to RBC Capital Markets.The Analyst: Deane Dray downgraded Danaher from Outperform to Sector Perform with a price target lowered from $273 to $234.The Thesis: The bullish case for Danaher's stock was justified during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the company's life sciences products ""would be in the spotlight,"" Dray said in the downgrade note.The thesis played out, as Danaher's COVID-19 diagnostic testing devices made it part of the ""flight-to-quality trade,"" the analyst said. Months later, a ""soft downgrade"" of Danaher's stock is warranted, as investors priced in Danaher's COVID-19 testing success story and the role it can play within the global vaccine initiative, he said. Related Link: Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For November 25, 2020Looking forward, expectations for a rebound in the economy are a bigger catalyst for lower-quality and higher-beta stocks versus higher-quality and lower-beta names like Danaher, Dray said. A separation of Danaher's business isn't a strong enough catalyst for the stock, since 80% of its total revenue comes from the Life Sciences and Diagnostics units, the analyst said. This means the separation of the company's noncore Water Quality and Product ID platforms is unlikely to materially drive the stock higher at this point, according to RBC.

2020-12-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I have questions about Larry Culp’s $47 million payday at General Electric Co. GE last week hit the share performance threshold that triggers the first tier of a one-time equity grant for Culp that could ultimately amount to as much as $230 million, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. The bonus was originally set up when Culp was named chief executive officer in 2018. It was meant to reward the former Danaher Corp. CEO for taking on the stewardship of a company whose best days looked to be behind it and to incentivize him to follow through on a turnaround job that at times has seemed impossible. One of those times was earlier this year, when the pandemic engulfed the crown jewel aviation unit that had been the company’s salvation through years of woes in the gas turbine and insurance businesses. With this unprecedented and unpredictable event upending the first tangible signs of stabilization at GE, it felt fair to give Culp some more time to steer the company into a better direction. So in August, the company rejiggered the terms of the pay package.GE’s board extended Culp’s contract through at least 2024 with an option for a one-year extension, giving him a few extra years for his turnaround efforts to yield results; fine. But it made the curious decision to also lower the stock performance thresholds. The trigger for the lowest tier of Culp’s pay package dropped to about $10 from nearly $19. As long as Culp could keep GE’s stock price in the $10 range for a month, he would lock in a payout of at least $47 million. In August, GE’s stock price was hovering around $6, so getting to $10 required a significant rally. But as I wrote at the time, considering Culp had five years to hit that target and the stock traded higher than that when he took over, it hardly felt aspirational enough to warrant a $47 million payday. It turns out Culp only needed four months, not five years, to hit the target after a furious fourth-quarter rally on vaccine optimism and an improving outlook for free cash flow. GE’s August decision to lower the bar for Culp felt like an admission that the company’s long-term prospects had dulled because of its near-term challenges. That's why it was so surprising when just one month later Culp told a Morgan Stanley conference that GE would generate positive free cash flow in the second half of 2020 — a prediction the CEO had been hesitant to make on the company’s earnings call in July despite repeated questions from analysts on this front. It was even more surprising when GE said in October that it had managed to generate positive free cash flow in the third quarter, compared with the average analyst expectation that it would burn through nearly $1 billion. The company has forecast “at least” $2.5 billion in cash flow for the fourth quarter and a positive number in 2021. Why again did Culp need a lower bar? After bouncing around the $6 to $7 range for several months, GE’s rally took off in late September. With a week and a half left in 2020, GE shares are down only about 5% in a year that’s brought incredible disruption not just to the company but the world. It’s a serious feat, and there's no denying that Culp’s progress has been impressive. Through a combination of asset sales, cost cuts and internal overhauls, GE is a healthier and more transparent company than it was when he started. But while many (including me) have had their doubts at times, Culp has always been one of GE’s most prominent believers. It’s curious that this optimism didn’t extend into negotiations around his pay package. To get the full $230 million, Culp has to push GE’s stock price to around $17, down from an initial goal of about $31. Again, this is a significant jump — but he’s still got until 2025, and if the recent trajectory of the company’s cash flow reboot is anything to go by, that feels doable. Meanwhile, back in the present, the company has eliminated 13,000 jobs in its aviation unit to adjust for the drop in demand amid the pandemic, and division chief John Slattery warned last month that more cuts are coming. Culp has indicated the bulk of these job reductions will be permanent, leading to a leaner and more profitable aviation division once travel recovers but an uncertain future for many former employees. Certainly less certain than Culp’s own future. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2021-01-13,"Over the past three months, shares of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) rose by 7.53%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Danaher has.Danaher's Debt Based on Danaher's financial statement as of October 22, 2020, long-term debt is at $21.81 billion and current debt is at $19.70 million, amounting to $21.83 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $5.69 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $16.14 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Danaher has $72.89 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 119.25 in the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry, Danaher Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 53.4. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

2021-03-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Renishaw Plc jumped the most in more than three weeks, after people familiar with the matter said the British engineering firm is attracting potential interest from Danaher Corp. and Swedish rival Hexagon AB.Shares of Renishaw, which announced earlier this month it’s exploring a sale, rose as much as 6.7% in London trading Monday. They were up 5.7% at 11:02 a.m., giving the company a market value of 4.6 billion pounds ($6.4 billion).Danaher, the $161 billion medical equipment maker, is considering teaming up with Fortive Corp., the industrial company it spun off in 2016, to bid for Renishaw and then split up the business, the people said. Renishaw may also approach rival engineering and precision measurement companies such as Ametek Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Japan’s Keyence Corp. and France’s Schneider Electric SE, the people said.A small number of private equity firms have separately shown interest, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Gloucestershire-based Renishaw is working with adviser UBS Group AG on the process.Renishaw said in early March it’s putting itself up for sale after the two founders of the almost 50-year-old firm decided to sell their holdings. Executive Chairman David McMurtry and Deputy Chairman John Deer, who together own about 53% of the company, told the board they prefer to shed their stakes entirely.The company trades at nearly 57 times this financial year’s estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The need to offer a premium to that already-high valuation could discourage some potential bidders, the people said.Renishaw’s main business is selling precision measurement products that help manufacturers produce and inspect components and keep machinery and industrial automation systems running. It also specializes in 3D printing parts from metal powder and sells products to a diverse set of industries including health care.The sale process is still in early stages and potential suitors could decide against bidding or Renishaw could opt to remain independent, the people said.Representatives for Fortive, Hexagon, Mettler-Toledo, Renishaw and Schneider declined to comment. Spokespeople for Ametek, Danaher and Keyence didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Renishaw Attracts Interest From Danaher, Hexagon"
