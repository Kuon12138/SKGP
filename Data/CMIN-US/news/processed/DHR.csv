2025-04-03,today launched its Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay that measures a patient's relative level of antibodies in response to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The new capabilities of this assay enable clinicians to establish a baseline to evaluate an individual's immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on a numerical value and assess relative changes of an individual's immune response to the virus over time. The assay may also help researchers as they begin to understand the levels of IgG antibodies needed to be considered protective.2	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beckman-coulter-launches-semi-quantitative-130000841.html?.tsrc=rss,today launched its Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay that measures a patient's relative level of antibodies in response to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
