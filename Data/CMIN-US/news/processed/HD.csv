While many investors may immediately write this hire off, since JC Penney is running neck and neck with Sears (SHLD) for least favorite retail stock, this is actually a very good hire for Lowe’s, because before Mr. Ellison decided to try and save JC Penney from late 2014 until now, he worked for Home Depot Inc. (HD) for 12 years from 2002 to 2014.  Frankly, I am not sure anyone could have saved JC Penney.  The highest position Mr. Ellison held at Home Depot was Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores, and he was one of the frontrunners to take over as CEO following Frank Blake’s retirement, but Craig Menear ended up getting the job.  So we view this as a positive for Lowe’s, despite the negative reaction in the stock (down 1% after being up).","Lowe’s Makes a Good CEO Hire, Ignore the JC Penney Years"

With four months left in the year, you&apos;re sitting pretty. Passive investors? Not so much. The problem is, as of mid-July, the four aforementioned S&P 500 stocks (according to research by S&P Dow Jones Indices) accounted for half the return of the index. At the time of the research, the index had gained about 6%, which means those four stocks accounted for 3 percentage points, and 496 companies accounted for the other 3.

2018-10-12,"Investors seeking out growth stocks often discard dividends as unimportant, but they really shouldn&apos;t. After all, there&apos;s no greater sign of a company&apos;s health than the regular, consistent payment of dividends. When the board of directors approves the payment of the quarterly dividend, it sends the unmistakable message that more cash is expected down the road. Thus, a focus on dividends can help you improve the quality of your growth portfolio. &quot;We consider a reliable and growing dividend to be a major sign of a company&apos;s health,&quot; says Chase Robertson, principal of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management. &quot;Limiting your pool of available stocks to dividend payers immediately improves the quality of the portfolio.&quot; Today, we will look at seven solid dividend-paying growth stocks. It&apos;s not unusual for growth stocks to return 20% or more per year when they&apos;re on a good run, so the dividends paid will be a small part of the total return. It&apos;s exceptionally rare for a true growth stock to sport a high dividend yield. Still, it&apos;s nice getting paid something in cold, hard cash. If anything, the dividend allows you to realize a small portion of your gains along the way without having to sell your shares.

2019-01-07,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and hallowed stock market indices in the world. Created in 1896, the Dow consists of 30 large-cap American companies, many of which pay dividends.

While many companies in the Dow are considered blue chips, they certainly aren't created equal, nor are all the industrial average's dividend stocks necessarily safe bets for dependable income. In June 2018, for example, General Electric (GE) was booted from the index after having been a member for more than a century.

GE's share price had slumped more than 50% in the year leading up to the firm's removal from the Dow, and management also had cut the dividend for just the second time since the Great Depression.

To help identify the best dividend growth stocks in the Dow and avoid the GEs of the world, research firm Simply Safe Dividends utilizes a Dividend Safety Score system that has caught more than 98% of dividend cuts in advance.

We'll use that system to take a closer look at nine Dow dividend growth stocks that appear positioned to reward shareholders with safe and solid payout expansion in the years ahead.

2019-01-09,"It's been a tough stretch for shares of home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD). In early September 2018, Home Depot stock was touching all-time highs around $215 and everything was going right for the company. Then, the U.S. economy started to cool, the Fed kept hiking interest rates and trade relations between the U.S. and China got worse.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



This created a triple headwind for Home Depot stock. By Christmas Eve, Home Depot stock had dropped 25% to below $160.

That was a dip worth buying. Since Christmas Eve, Home Depot stock has rallied nearly 15% to almost $180 as the macroeconomic outlook has improved. Namely, a strong December jobs report put to rest recession fears, the Fed has backed off its &quot;must hike rates at all costs&quot; mantra and there's optimism regarding how trade talks between the U.S. and China will play out in the new year.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

This recovery rally in Home Depot stock could still be in its early innings. At its core, so long as U.S. economic fundamentals remain healthy, the U.S. housing market will remain healthy too. As long as that's true, Home Depot will continue to report solid revenue and profit growth -- and Home Depot stock will rise.

More than that, Home Depot continues to innovate in order to grow the company's addressable market. Most recently, this expansion includes a dive into premium home remodeling through a beta Design Center in San Diego. At scale, these Design Centers could constitute a huge growth opportunity for Home Depot.

All in all, Home Depot stock looks good here. The growth trajectory remains healthy, innovation continues to drive addressable market expansion and the valuation is reasonable. As a result, this bounce back in Home Depot stock should persist for the foreseeable future.

### The Economy Remains Healthy

As goes the economy, so goes the housing sector and so goes Home Depot stock. That is simply the nature of being America's largest home improvement retailer.

In late 2018, there were concerns regarding a rapid slowdown in the U.S. economy which, coupled with a hawkish Fed, had the potential to spark a recession in 2019 or 2020. Home Depot stock dropped sharply on these fears. After all, in a recession, no one is spending on home improvements. Home Depot's revenues drop. Profits dry up. The stock falls. (See 2008-09, when the stock lost more than half of its value.)

But such fears seem premature, at worst, and overstated at best. The December jobs report was a blowout one. The U.S. economy added more than 300,000 jobs in the last month of 2018, while wages rose in excess of 3%. The unemployment rate remained below 4% and the participation rate rose to its highest level in recent memory. Housing starts remain on a long term uptrend, while permits rose to a 7-month high in November. Consumer confidence remains robust and so does business confidence.

Overall, the economy is still growing at a healthy rate. Granted, it's not the red-hot growth that we saw in 2017-18, and rising rates will continue to provide a headwind to the housing market, but, in the big picture, the economy is still doing just fine. A &quot;just fine&quot; economy is good enough for Home Depot to continue to report solid revenue and profit growth.

### Design Center Innovation Drives TAM Expansion

An exciting element of Home Depot stock is that management continues to innovate. Such innovation drives addressable market expansion, grows the company's revenue potential and elongates the growth runway.

A recent example of this innovation is the company's plunge into the high-end home remodeling market. Home Depot had a presence in this market in the 1990's and early 2000's through Expo Design Centers, which were essentially home remodeling showrooms and services that catered to an upper-income demographic. These design centers were a sharp departure from Home Depot's traditional warehouse style, and they worked well enough… until 2008. That's when the housing market crashed and Home Depot was forced to shutter its Expo unit.

Now, Home Depot is jumping back in.

In late 2017, Home Depot acquired high-end linen e-retailer The Company Store. A few months later, in mid-2018, Home Depot sent out an e-mail to customers, which stated the following: &quot;Your favorite home improvement retailer is about to become your new favorite decor destination.&quot; Around the same time, Home Depot launched its first Home Depot Design Center in San Diego, and it essentially looks like an upgraded version of the Expo Design Centers from the early 2000's.

Broadly speaking, over the past twelve months, Home Depot has laid the groundwork to bring back the Expo business from the dead, and re-enter what has become a very large high-end home remodeling market.

Depending on who you ask, the home remodeling market is anywhere from a $100 billion market in the U.S. to a several-hundred-billion-dollar market globally. But the specifics here aren't important. The important thing is that, through innovation, Home Depot is jumping into new markets, expanding its addressable revenue pool, growing the company's long-term profit potential and elongating its growth narrative. These are all positive things that will contribute to Home Depot stock heading higher in the long run.

### Bottom Line on HD Stock

Home Depot stock is a long term winner with a favorable near- to medium-term growth outlook, thanks to continued strength in the U.S. economy.

  * 5 Top Stocks to Trade Wednesday: Where to Buy Amazon, Tilray 



At 24 times forward earnings (versus a five-year average forward multiple of 25), the valuation is sensible and arguably discounted. As such, this stock's recovery rally has legs, and won't stall out at $180.

While the largest retailer has plenty going for it, including seventeen straight quarters of rising comp sales and a rapidly growing U.S. e-commerce business, which gained 42% in the most recent quarter, there are just as many reasons to be cautious when it comes to WMT stock. 

For instance, selling, general and administrative expenses rose more than 12% between 2015 and 2018 ($93.4 billion to $104.7 billion), while revenue gained 3% ($485.6 billion to $500 billion) during that same time. Rising wages and pricey acquisitions such as its $16 billion deal for Flipkart will hurt WMT's profits for the foreseeable future.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



The average 52-week price target for the Walmart stock price is $107, which implies a 13% upside to current levels. I am not sure what the analysts are smoking given their consensus forecasts are calling for 2019 revenue growth of 2.9%. This matches last year's 2.9% sales gain ($485.6 billion to $500 billion) exactly. Notably, Walmart stock slumped nearly 6% in 2018 after going on a 43% tear a year earlier. They appear to be running on fumes. I realize that the law of large numbers applies to the Walmart stock price but there are plenty of other retail stocks that are a better choice.

### Better Bets Than Walmart Stock

WMT stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 20 which isn't particularly compelling given that peers such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Target (NYSE:TGT) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) are valued cheaper, offer more potential upside and are growing at a faster rate than the Bentonville, Ark.-based company. They are all worth buying despite their recent challenges.  


HD currently trades at roughly a 15% discount to its average 52-week price target of $204. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 17.3 and analysts are expecting 2019 revenue growth of 7.3% for the top home improvement chain. As the real estate market cools, the chain stands to benefit since homeowners may be willing to spend more on improving their homes as opposed to buying a new home. HD is also one of the best-run companies in the sector.

To be sure, TGT took plenty of lumps in 2018. CEO Brian Cornell spooked Wall Street during the most recent quarter when he reported disappointing results as increased spending on e-commerce and higher wages eroded profit margins. The company, though, is doing fine as evidenced by comp sales, which were up 5.7% for the most recent quarter. Even with its problems, TGT is a better stock than WMT stock.

  * 7 Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown 



Analysts are expecting TGT 2019 sales growth of 4.8%. The chain's forward P/E is 12.4 and TGT stock is currently trading at a discount of about 20% to its average 52-week price target of $84.

Finally, there's TJX. The off-price retailer got hammered last year after posting disappointing third-quarter earnings as rising freight and labor costs eroded its profit margins. TJX, which sells top brands such as Tommy Hilfiger at rock bottom prices, continues to buck industry trends and open stores. But, thanks to its mastery of the &quot;treasure hunt&quot; format, TJX probably had a jolly holiday season and should fare well in an increasingly competitive retail sector

TJX carries a forward P/E multiple of 18.25. Its stock trades at a discount of about 15% to its average 52-week price target of $54.40. Wall Street analysts are expecting TJX's 2019 sales to rise by 8.2%.  

As of this writing, Jonathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

  * 10 Companies That Could Post Decelerating Profits 



As a result, a number of iconic Dow Jones stocks look vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Here are five such stocks to sell now:

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares look vulnerable to a reversal as CAT contends with resistance from four-months of overhead resistance. As such, CAT stock has set up a test of the recent lows near $117, which would be worth a decline of 10% from here as the U.S.-China trade talks go nowhere fast. This is poor timing for Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, who recently upgraded the stock to Buy.

The company will next report results on Jan. 28 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.98 per share on revenues of $14.3 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 23 earnings of $2.86 beat estimates by a penny on an 18.4% rise in revenues.

### Disney (DIS)

Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares are suffering a sharp reversal lower, falling back below its 50-day moving average to form a &quot;bearish engulfing&quot; candlestick that presages more weakness ahead. Not exactly the behavior investors were looking for ahead of the opening of the eagerly awaited Star Wars theme park areas in Disneyland and Disney World.

DIS will next report results on Feb. 5 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.6 per share on revenues of $15.4 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 8, earnings of $1.48 per shear beat estimates by 13 cents on an 11.9% rise in revenues.

### Goldman Sachs (GS)

Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have stalled out near resistance at the $180-a-share level, setting up a likely reversal that tests the lows set in late December. Financial stocks overall are showing weakness this morning after earnings results from WFC and JPM revealed problems in mortgage loan activity and fixed income trading.

The company will next report results on Jan. 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.4 per share on revenues of $7.9 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 16, earnings of $6.28 per share beat estimates by 94 cents on a 3.8% rise in revenues.

### Home Depot (HD)

Shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are rolling lower after testing highs previously set in November and December. HD stock is remaining below its 200-day moving average as the one-time momentum favorite succumbs to the realization that the U.S. housing market is in trouble -- plagued by a combination of higher mortgage rates, absurd pricing and impacted affordability.

### JPMorgan (JPM)

Shares of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are struggling to stay above the $100-a-share level and remain well below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The company reported results before the bell. Earnings of $1.98 per share missed estimates by 21 cents on an 8.1% rise in revenues. Management cited a decline in fixed income trading revenue, which dropped 16% from last year.

When the company last reported on Oct. 12, earnings of $2.34 per share beat estimates by 8 cents on a 7.8% rise in revenues. Watch for a test of the late December low as shareholders realize that loan growth and credit quality is vulnerable, setting up a 10% drop from here.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-18,"Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is the largest home improvement retailer in North America. And it's likely to stay that way for a long time. Since 1978, the HD model has moved across North America and now represents over 2,200 stores across the continent. With nearly 35,000 products available in stores and 1 million online, it certainly is looking to fill the void of local hardware stores, and then some.

Over the years, big box retailers, whether we're talking about department stores or in this case hardware stores, were quite popular for decades. But like the shopping mall concept, it was over produced and the proliferation of the concept threatened its very existence.

Some companies went niche and remained local or regional players. But to contend on the national scale took a different kind of mentality to succeed. And HD is only one of a few that could make it work at its size and scale.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Part of the challenge in recent years has been the lingering effects of the Great Recession that crashed the real estate market and made it very difficult for regular people to finance houses.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



What's more, the significant weight of student debt that millennials and Gen Xers are strapped with also dampened the market. Some studies suggest that demand in the real estate sector has dropped about 20% simply due to the debt levels younger generations are carrying in student loans.

There's no doubt that makes for a difficult market to operate in, much less grow, if you're a home improvement store.

What's more, in HD's model, a lion's share of its profits come from its professional contractors' side of the business, not from the average homeowner. That makes HD's continued success even more impressive.

### Bottom Line on HD Stock

But the new challenge is that now that the economy is improving, the Federal Reserve is unwinding the trillions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities it has been squirreling away since the financial crisis.

That weighs on lending. And rising interest also weighs heavily on lending. So, on the one hand, when the economy was weak, rates were great but it was tough to buy a house. And now that the economy is improving, rates are rising and the Fed is unwinding all its positions, so it's getting more expensive to buy a house.

  * 7 Companies Apple Should Consider Buying 



Add to that the fact that younger generations aren't as motivated to buy a house, and all of this is why HD stock is off about 13% in the past 12 months. But that's better than most home building stocks.

You see, HD stock is a rock-solid company that has not only survived through a lot of economic expansions and contractions, but it has expanded its business through them all.

HD always finds a way to make money. It's a classic long-term growth stock that is more reliable than it is flashy. Its 2.4% dividend is a great example. It's not huge but it's solid and shows that the company appreciates its shareholders, especially those that stick around.

2019-01-24,"If I had to summarize the current market environment, it would be uncertainty. Sure, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average is off to a hot start this year. However, we could say the same thing last year. As it stands, the best stocks to invest in are often recession-resistant.

Obviously, the biggest concern that most Americans have is the government shutdown. Due to an extremely frustrating Washington gridlock, the impasse has no end in sight. At the moment, it appears the State of the Union address will be postponed after President Donald Trump threatened to host an &quot;alternative&quot; event.

No matter where you stand on the political issue, we can agree on this much: it's a treacherous time to invest in the markets. Even the best stocks will suffer should the shutdown last two months or longer. It's not just about the gridlock. Heading towards the 2020 election, our nation will likely become dangerously divided.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In other words, we should expect many more government shutdowns in the future.

Given the immediate controversy, we forget that we have geopolitical concerns. The China trade war weighs heavily on our economy. So too do rising tensions in the Middle East and a militarily aggressive Russia.

Still, one trader's bear is another one's bull. Although difficult to navigate, the best stocks to invest in may potentially advantage the current negativity. Moreover, the broader selloff that transpired since last October presents us with discounted opportunities.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



To be sure, investors should proceed with caution. But if you have a steady hand, here are 10 of the best stocks to buy in February:

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Last year, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) represented an easy choice. When investors get jittery over deteriorating economic conditions, go secular. As such, few options are better than PG stock. The underlying company produces essential home goods that you can't put off indefinitely.

Turns out, the same thesis that worked in 2018 is moving the needle in 2019. On a year-to-date basis, PG stock is up 3%. This is mostly due to a favorable result for the company's second-quarter earnings report.

Procter & Gamble delivered a convincing beat on both the top and bottom line. Particularly impressive was how the iconic firm got there. Raising prices due to higher commodity and transportation costs had no net-negative impact. Instead, multiple segments, such as its healthcare division, experienced strong organic growth.

When in doubt, PG usually represents one of the best stocks to invest in. But it's good to know that current fundamentals justify the enthusiasm.

### Home Depot (HD)

Like Procter & Gamble, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) typically is one of the best stocks to buy during periods of uncertainty. While HD stock does its best work when everyone is working, certain functions, like renovations and repairs, cannot be avoided.

The company also has another, unexpected benefit: the implosion of a key competitor. As you are undoubtedly aware, Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) has suffered an ignominious fall from grace. While the bankrupt retailer is barely clinging onto life, the majority of analysts believe it's too little, too late.

However, this sorry situation favors Home Depot, and by logical deduction, HD stock. The primary reason why shoppers tolerated Sears' existence was their appliances, parts and repairs business. Outside their automobile centers, Home Depot can pick up the additional revenue opportunities.

Plus, the October selloff has made HD stock much more attractive.

### Tyson Foods (TSN)

While this may sound cynical, I want to speak honestly but respectfully: the ongoing government shutdown highlights the importance of having secular companies in your portfolio. No matter how you look at it, names like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) are sheltered from the gridlock's most devastating blows.

Obviously, people need to eat. When push comes to shove, food expenditures become a top priority. We've heard heartbreaking stories about essential government workers picking up odd jobs to make ends meet. Also, local food pantries face a significant supply constraint. This partially explains why TSN stock has gained significant steam over the trailing month.

But the overriding catalyst is that Tyson Foods is a fundamentally sound organization. It has a stable balance sheet, consistently-positive free cash flow, and rising net margins. In addition, its top-line sales are picking back up after recent disappointments.

Currently trading at only 10 times forward earnings, TSN stock is undervalued.

### VF Corporation (VFC)

Usually under a bear market, you don't fish for the best stocks to invest in within the retail sector. This is especially true during a dubious, record-breaking government shutdown, when personal funds logically shift towards the essentials.

That said, I must give VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) its proper dues. Known for its brands such as Vans and North Face, VF stock jumped on a surprisingly strong Q3 earnings report. Along with a resounding beat on profitability, the company came up big in top-line sales, ringing up $3.91 billion against a $3.75 billion consensus target.

Against January's opener, VFC stock is up over 18%. Understandably, cautious investors may be hesitant about buying into such strength. However, it's important to note that international sales have performed well despite the China trade war.

With such rabid enthusiasm during a tough period, VFC clearly belongs among the best stocks to buy in February.

### National Grid (NGG)

If you're looking strictly for safety, you can either put money in the bank or stuff it under the mattress. However, if you're seeking some growth while enjoying reasonable protections, utility companies are among the best stocks to invest in.

While several options exist in this sector, National Grid (NYSE:NGG) stands out for a number of reasons. Primarily, we've got to talk about that dividend yield. At nearly 6%, NGG stock deserves consideration merely for that payout.

Another positive factor is its technical stability. After suffering a tough loss last year, NGG stock is making amends this year. Since the beginning of January, shares are up over 8%.

Looking ahead to the rest of 2019, I expect National Grid to build on its momentum. For one thing, people expect the lights to turn on when they flip the switch. Further, NGG, despite its name, features some international exposure with its U.K. business.

### NextEra Energy Partners (NEP)

Despite utility companies representing the best stocks for protection during downturns, they're not entirely risk-free. Commodity and energy prices have fluctuated significantly over the past several years. Moving forward, they're vulnerable to sudden changes, which makes investing in &quot;traditional&quot; utility firms sometimes adventurous.

For those who want an ideal balance between passive income and future stability, you should consider NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP). An offshoot of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), NEP stock represents the corporate umbrella's clean-energy expansion strategies. NEP specializes in wind and solar energy, as well as natural-gas pipelines.

While I personally am skeptical about the renewable platform's economic viability, so far, NEP stock has proven me wrong. Shares managed to return a small profit despite taking a big hit in the last half of 2018. Moreover, NEP's energy diversity may present a tailwind if oil prices move unfavorably.

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)

To my surprise, defense firms were not among the best stocks to invest in last year. In fact, they were among the worst performers. Unfortunately, this was a situation where the headlines levered a substantial disadvantage to companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

After all, why risk your money in the defense industry when President Trump has seemingly forged peace with North Korea? Even more damning for LMT stock, the POTUS and &quot;Dear Leader&quot; will meet again for further talk. Given the right circumstances, we could have a landmark peace deal on our hands.

Surely, that would hurt the demand picture for LMT stock. But I believe Wall Street is reading this situation incorrectly. Historically, North Korea has broken multiple promises. I'm sorry but appeasement didn't work to sate Adolf Hitler. It's not going to work with Kim Jong-un, either.

Source:  Steve Pomeroy via Flickr (Modified)

### Raytheon (RTN)

Similar to Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) failed to impress anybody last year. Any hope of salvaging something positive from 2018 fell apart during the October market selloff.

That aside, I believe RTN stock has a chance to become one of the best stocks to buy this year. Political insiders believe that due to Trump's domestic troubles, he will eagerly seek a landmark deal with North Korea. If so, that's bad news for Raytheon. Fortunately for shareholders, that's not going to happen.

Consider the optics: the president will cut a deal with a murderer, but not with the American people? Even if the shutdown ended right now, the pain that many Americans already endured -- particularly the U.S. Coast Guard -- makes such negotiations unfathomable.

But if the unthinkable happened, RTN stock has a viable revenue story in Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe worries that his country will be left in the dark during the upcoming talks. With U.S. foreign policy appearing strangely acquiescent lately, Japanese defense forces will eagerly seek the latest military technologies.

### Royal Gold (RGLD)

If you ever considered having some exposure to gold bullion, now seems like an appropriate time. With deep political divisions made worse from the government shutdown, people have rightfully sought stability. Unlike our elected officials, you can always depend on gold to be worth something.

But if you'd rather not deal with the cumbersome nature of precious metals, I'd look into Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD). While the sector is undoubtedly risky, RGLD stock has a few intriguing factors working in its favor.

First, I expect the business to improve with rising gold prices. Because we're still walking on shaky ground with the markets, the idea of precious metals appeals to shrewd investors. Second, many other sector players have witnessed a resurgence in demand.

Finally, RGLD stock benefits from comparatively solid financials. After suffering devastating losses in 2015, management has focused on shoring up its books. In recent years, we've seen improvements in the balance sheet, free cash flow, and sales growth.

Much work remains, but RGLD stock could surprise.

### North American Palladium (PALDF)

As I typically like to do near the end of my galleries, I want to conclude with a speculative name. Mining company North American Palladium (OTCMKTS:PALDF) certainly fits the description. Still, under the right conditions, PALDF stock could surprise market observers.

Like the name suggests, North American Palladium specializes in mining palladium, one of the platinum-group metals. Due to its unique composition, palladium enjoys robust industrial demand. In addition, the metal doesn't have many alternatives. Platinum has similar characteristics but it's also very expensive.

But what makes PALDF one of the best stocks in the high-risk, high-reward segment is rarity. Very few miners in North America focus on palladium. Currently, only two countries feed most of the world's demand for the metal: Russia and South Africa.

Both countries are politically corrupt, which makes dealing with them difficult. Further, our foreign policy has increasingly butted heads with the Kremlin. This supply-demand dynamic makes an intriguing speculative case for PALDF stock. As an alternative, you can also buy palladium bars or rounds.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold, platinum and palladium bullion.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the biggie, of course, and it was mostly good news. The consumer-tech giant saw its stock lose ground headed into the close, but was up in after-hours action after topping last quarter's sales and earnings expectations. The biggest movers on Tuesday, however, weren't the market's most-watched names. PG&E (NYSE:PCG) jumped 16.5% after officially filing for bankruptcy protection. The terms of the petition suggest the company will survive. Meanwhile, GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares plunged to the tune of 27.2% after the struggling company announced it wasn't putting itself up for sale after all.

Between the extreme volatility at both ends of the spectrum and the hesitation to do much of anything until Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) posts its numbers (and the FOMC makes its interest rate decision -- both slated for today), stocks weren't prepared to go much of anywhere on Tuesday. And, they didn't. The S&P 500 fell, but only by 0.15%.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As Wednesday's action kicks off what's hopefully a more fruitful trading session, the stock charts of Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) are in focus. All three have sidestepped the recent extreme volatility, and are setting up what could be some great moves.

### Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP)

Molson Coors Brewing shares have been sliding lower since the middle of 2016. Just when it looks like they may finally turn the ship around, the stock finds a way of moving to lower lows. The company's modest earnings growth hasn't been able to overcome investor pessimism.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



That may be on the verge of changing though. Thanks to yesterday's gain, TAP has cleared a major hurdle and is knocking on the door of another huge resistance line. There's still a little work that needs to be done, but there's a potential, major recovery effort brewing that few people even think might be coming.

  
Click to Enlarge • Tuesday's big clue was the cross of the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. This is the first time TAP stock has been above its 200-day average since early 2017.

• Simultaneously, Molson Coors shares are now testing straight-line resistance, plotted with a yellow dashed line on the weekly chart, that has capped the stock since early 2017.

• A move above these two technical ceilings will be more of a process than an event. So, even if TAP breaks out and then falls back below those lines, don't count it out. Watch how it reacts when firmly tested.

### A.O. Smith (AOS)

Like most other stocks, A.O. Smith lost ground yesterday. Unlike most other stocks, however, the stall here is actually unsurprising, and even a little constructive. The pause better defined where a big line in the sand is, and more than that, it confirmed the bulls aren't going to be intimidated. They're trying to stage a breakout move.

  
Click to Enlarge • Tuesday's high of $48.70 is essentially in line with the peaks from the latter part of last year, marked with a yellow dashed line. And, the prior couple of days confirm that the gray 100-day moving average line is going to be a tough ceiling as well.

• Though it closed at a loss, yesterday's close was still well above the open and well above the blue 200-day moving average line, which rekindled the rally effort when tested. The fact that the buyers continue to swing suggests the wall the bears have built may not hold much longer.

• Given how well defined the ceiling at $48.70 is, don't dismiss the possibility that even a modest move above it could incite a major thrust that blasts right past the white 200-day average line around $54.70. There's a lot of pent-up bullishness that can be unleashed here.

### Home Depot (HD)

Finally, Home Depot has been anything but immune to recent trouble for the broad market. Not only is it vulnerable to economic stagnation stemming from a tariff war with China, it's even more vulnerable to the slowdown that some say is already impacting the housing construction market.

Slowly but surely, though, clues are piling up that say HD is ready and able to unwind the rout it suffered during the fourth quarter of last year. One more good day could do the trick, though it would take a few great days in a row to seal the deal.

• The near-term hurdle is the $180.80 mark, plotted in yellow on the daily chart. That's where Home Depot has topped for the past three weeks.

• More than that, however, the recent push up and off of support provided by the blue 20-day moving average line has completed a decent (albeit not perfect) upside-down head-and-shoulders pattern. Once the neckline around $181 is broken, would-be buyers could start to flood in.

• Beyond that, the 100-day and 200-day moving average lines at $188.66 and $184.26, respectively, stand as potential roadblocks. There's more underlying bullish momentum brewing up than it currently seems though.

2019-01-30,"Wayfair (NYSE:W) stock has a secret, and Wall Street is trying to guess what it is.

The secret is: How much business did Wayfair do during the holiday-shopping season? The answer won't be revealed until Feb, 22, but analysts' current consensus estimates are $1.96 billion, with a loss of about $100 million or $1.70 per share.of Wayfair stock. 

Wayfair bet big on Christmas, perhaps bigger than any other online retailer. The company blanketed the airwaves with commercials, trying to lure women into its virtual store to buy furniture and other home products.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Many women did log onto Wayfair.com, and many of them bought Wayfair's products. But how many customers did Wayfair have? Were they happy afterward, like the women in the commercials? Will they come back?

Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju says most of Wayfair's customers were pleased with their purchases, and he recently upgraded Wayfair stock, saying it could rise 30%. Other analysts are also upbeat on Wayfair stock. Wayfair stock price has risen from $80 to $104 so far in 2019.

### Wayfair's Tough 2018

Before Christmas, Wayfair had a tough 2018. One of its problems was the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in South Dakota vs. Wayfair that, when substantial purchases are made from an online store, a &quot;nexus&quot; exists, and sales tax must be paid. Previously, online merchants didn't have to pay sales taxes on purchases within a state if they did not have a physical store, warehouse, or office in that state. Now, if online businesses sell as little as $100,000 to customers in a state, with as few as 200 transactions, they may owe as much as $10,000 of tax.

That has created a mess for online merchants because sales taxes aren't uniform. States, counties and cities may impose separate sales taxes. Some charge tax on gross sales, others on gross revenues, still others on retail sales, gross receipts, or taxable sales.

After Wayfair stock fell starting in September, from a high of almost $150 to a December low of about $80, owners of Wayfair stock began suing the company. They allege that Wayfair misstated its third- quarter earnings, which ended up featuring a large loss, so that insiders could sell their shares

### The Bigger Questions About W Stock

Owners of Wayfair stock should be worrying about Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which now generates $4 billion of revenue per year from selling home furniture, against $6.5 billion for Wayfair. AMZN also now has its own home-furniture brands.

Investors should also be asking where the furniture business is going. The investment roadside is littered with companies that have tried to sell furniture and found that many Americans will make-do with what amounts to garage-sale merchandise. (I'm guilty as charged.)

Companies like Heritage Home, Gump's, Breuner's, and Mattress Firm have all been frog-marched to bankruptcy recently. And do I have to mention Sears (OTC:SHLDQ)?

Home furnishings are a tough business to be in. Young consumers rush to privately-held Ikea, middle-aged consumers inherit pieces from their parents, and once families are established they focus more on goods that can be found at Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW).

### The Bottom Line on Wayfair Stock

Right now, as Wayfair totals sales from its spectacular &quot;four day clearance&quot; sale, when some goods were marked down as much as 75%, more analysts have &quot;hold&quot; ratings on Wayfair stock than have &quot;buy&quot; ratings on it.

Wayfair was among the first big online merchants to utilize TV ads, and its ad budget has risen to about $550 million, against that $6.5 billion in sales.

This is a company that is racing hard to stay in place. I would rather relax on an old couch.

2019-02-01,"One of the perks of living in Southern California is that you don't occupy the same reality as most Americans. Lately, a winter chill has brought on record-breaking temperatures throughout the midwest and the east coast. From my angle? All I can think about is cold weather stocks to buy.

Well, that's not true. Over the past few days, I've noticed that the temperature has started to rise, necessitating my car's air-conditioning system. Therefore, it's also time for me to start thinking about upgrading my wardrobe to something more appropriate for February: T-shirts, board shorts and flip-flops.

For the rest of you, I can only shrug my shoulders and say that life isn't fair. But that doesn't mean you have to take Mother Nature -- or the polar vortex -- lying down. Amid this deep freeze, cold weather stocks provide an opportunity to advantage this otherwise miserable condition.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Moreover, this category is broader than you might think. For instance, several retail stocks perform better in colder temperatures, and I'm not just referring to the holiday season. In addition, some food stocks have an inverse correlation to the thermometer. Apparently, humans adopt hibernation strategies from bears in adverse conditions.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 



So pull up an easy chair -- if you can thaw it from your floor -- and let's discuss some of the best cold weather stocks!

### Compass Minerals International (CMP)

  
Click to Enlarge For most folks, Compass Minerals International (NYSE:CMP) is hardly what you call a household name. But when the weather turns wintry, you'd be completely lost without this Compass. As one of the largest producers of highway salts, CMP stock represents an indispensable investment for the thermally challenged.

Better yet, Compass is quantifiably one of the best industrial stocks to buy during a morbid chill. On average, CMP stock generates annual returns of 1.3%. However, in the typically cold months of the year (December through February), CMP averages nearly 2.3%.

As you might expect, shares noticeably dip as the seasons turn warmer. Therefore, keep Compass Minerals in mind for the next winter chill.

### Toro (TTC)

  
Click to EnlargeAnother component within industrial stocks, Toro (NYSE:TTC), is a second obvious choice for inclement weather. Specializing in turf-maintenance equipment, Toro offers a fleet of snow-removal equipment. While we have no use for that stuff in my neck of the woods, TTC stock is a lifesaver for most other Americans.

Again, what I love about Toro is the same attribute that I love for Compass Minerals: the company truly lives up to its status as one of the best cold weather stocks to buy. From December through February, TTC stock averages returns of 4.6%. For the entire year, it drops to 2.9%.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



If this record-breaking chill lasts longer, you can expect Toro to at least warm up your portfolio.

### Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG)

  
Click to Enlarge Aside from companies that directly benefit from cold weather, your next best bet is utility stocks. When the thermometer displays ungodly numbers, folks can't do anything but turn on the heat. Not only that, they're willing to pay the price.

With such a captive audience, you really need to check out Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG). Yes, it's a cynical play among cold weather stocks, but it's also an effective one. Throughout the year, PEG stock averages 1.5%. However, in December and January, that average jumps to 2.8%.

Given that the current weather trends appear incessant and international, keep a close eye on PEG stock.

### Home Depot (HD)

  
Click to Enlarge Among temperate-region dwellers, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) doesn't strike us as belonging to a list of cold weather stocks. However, when conditions turn brutally inclement, people must stock up on supplies. Fundamentally, that should drive HD stock higher.

Sure enough, the technical data seems to support the thesis. On average, HD stock jumps noticeably higher in November and December as compared to the rest of the year. Plus, February's haul of 3.4% is notably better than the annual average return of 2.5%.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



As a word of caution, I wouldn't chase Home Depot based on individual natural disasters. However, as a general inclement-weather opportunity among retail stocks, HD simply delivers.

### Netflix (NFLX)

  
Click to Enlarge Bad weather and freezing temperatures aren't usually what you associate with tech stocks. However, content-streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is simply gold during brutal winter seasons. After all, what better way to wait out the storm than binge-watching your favorite programs?

On average, NFLX stock generates annual returns of around 4.4%. However, the company generates a wild 20.1% in January.

Of course, we must caveat this unusual dynamic. Due to timing issues, Netflix has largely avoided bad news at the beginning of the year. In addition, the company has limited historical data.

That said, the cold weather months generally do better for NFLX stock, so don't ignore the potential here.

### AutoZone (AZO)

  
Click to Enlarge For drivers who live in sun-drenched locales, our maintenance requirements are straightforward. So long as we don't drive like idiots, oil changes and tire replacements will last us quite a while. But during extreme weather, specialized retail stocks like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) provide a critical service.

Usually, AZO stock generates stronger returns in colder months. For example, November and December average returns of 4.5%. In contrast, the rest of the year averages 1.8%. The anomaly here is January, which loses 2.4%. However, February picks up the slack at 3.1%.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



I must say that I'm not the biggest fan of AZO stock at this price point. However, as an opportunity among cold weather stocks, AutoZone offers a fundamentally intriguing case.

### Domino's Pizza (DPZ)

  
Click to Enlarge In my opinion, Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is a feel-good story among cold weather stocks. Most folks recognize DPZ stock as the comeback kid. Certainly, they've revamped their entire organization from top to bottom. And with the weather like it is right now, DPZ is sure to fly.

After all, what could be a better during a frigid winter than a piping-hot pepperoni pizza straight from the oven? Indeed, it's not just my anecdotal offering. Apparently, DPZ stock has a strong inverse correlation with the thermometer. From December through February, shares average 5.7%. For the rest of the year, it's 2.9%.

Should the winter chill last longer than expected, keep close tabs on Domino's Pizza. If nothing else, keep their phone number handy should you need to order a pie yourself.

### McDonald's (MCD)

  
Click to Enlarge Similar to Domino's, you want to think about food stocks when the thermometer goes negative. According to scientific research, we often get hungrier during the winter season. That's great news for fast-food giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).

In fact, the reinvigorated McDonald's brand has all the right menu items during a cold spell: various burgers, delectable French fries, and of course, one of the most familiar house coffees in the business. Plus, MCD stock generates significantly higher returns during the cooler half of the year.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



If that wasn't enough, McDonald's also offers a decent dividend yield at 2.6%.

### VF Corp (VFC)

  
Click to Enlarge Last month, I featured VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) in my list of shares to buy in February. Contrary to many other retail stocks, VF Corp enjoyed strong international sales despite the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. I must give serious props to VFC stock for pulling that trick off.

But as a potential high-flyer among cold weather stocks, VF has plenty to offer. Thanks to its North Face brand, the company will likely report huge sales in the upcoming quarter. In addition, VFC stock historically performs well in bad weather. January and February returns average 4.8%, while the rest of the year sees 2.7%.

And like McDonald's, VF Corp offers a nice 2.5% dividend to give weary investors some confidence.

### Vail Resorts (MTN)

  
Click to Enlarge Rounding out our list of cold weather stocks is Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN). As the company's name suggests, MTN stock thrives on winter sports. However, Vail Resorts is an incredibly-risky trade due to last year's meltdown.

That said, opportunistic folks may want to pay attention here. Unlike the other companies on this list, MTN stock doesn't usually perform well during the typical cold months. Instead, it sees a huge rise in March and April.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 



Because Vail has been beaten down so much over the past few months, a substantive turnaround might materialize. That gamble becomes even more tantalizing when you realize that its &quot;sweet spot&quot; is just around the corner.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-08,"After a disappointing final quarter in 2018, investors have looked to the new year for a fresh start. So far, we've witnessed robust movements, with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 9% since the beginning of January. Yet slow trades following the State of the Union Address proves one thing: dividend stocks are still relevant.As someone who appreciates the speculative components of the markets, I know exactly what you're thinking. Over the past few years and prior to the October meltdown, equities represented tremendous growth potential. At the height of the bull market, even the vanilla exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) enticed onlookers.But right now, I can confidently state that the best stocks are dividend stocks. True, the Dow has clawed back most of its October losses. However, it has so far alarmingly failed to eclipse prior highs. In other words, the index is charting a bearish trend channel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, I'm not sure how economic and geopolitical events will play out. As I write this, Washington hosts furious debates about border security. Without an agreement, the nation could suffer another embarrassing and painful government shutdown.Also, President Trump has high-stake talks or negotiations coming up with China and North Korea. Both have significant implications for our economy, foreign policy and national interests. A victory here is absolutely crucial for the administration.Given this framework, I'm placing my bets on dividend stocks. Below, I've listed out top companies to consider based on their risk/reward structure: three of each of reliable, reasonable and risky names. To top it off, I've added a super-risky dividend stock to invest in.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Without further hesitation, here are my picks for the ten best dividend stocks to buy for the next ten months:Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Hormel Foods (HRL)Several religions endorse fasting as a means to grow spiritually as a person. This is accomplished through the denial of the self. Being somewhat of the adventurous type, I decided to give it a go. Upon completing my journey, I discovered something: I love food.It's not that I didn't receive benefits from fasting, which I did. However, a man has got to eat, which brings me to Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL). The best dividend stocks are typically no-brainers, featuring industries that benefit from indispensable demand. It doesn't get more indispensable than nutrition.That said, the key drawback for HRL is that its 2% dividend doesn't draw the &quot;wow&quot; factor. But if you're looking for steady-as-she-goes gains, Hormel is one of the best stocks to buy.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified) Lowe's (LOW)A good friend of mine from the trade business told me that most people under 40 don't own basic tools. A recent survey suggested that indeed, millennials exaggerate their practical know-how around the house. Theoretically, this bodes poorly for an organization like Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Yet the survey also goes on to demonstrate that millennials are more likely to attempt their own home repairs than older generations. This naturally lifts growth potential for Lowe's and rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD). And even if other young folks call a repair person, someone has to buy the tools and equipment.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss The bottom line is that LOW stock benefits from perpetual demand. In addition, the company has a long history of dividend payouts. Of course, with a 2% yield, LOW won't make you rich. But if you're seeking protection, you can't go wrong here.Source: Shutterstock  Walmart (WMT)With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) largely sparking the e-commerce revolution, the concept of brick-and-mortar stores appears obsolete. Indeed, we've seen more than a few companies implode from the broader pressure, with Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) coming immediately to mind.Despite this enormous challenge, big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has learned to thrive in the Amazon era. Because WMT places an emphasis on massive selection, convenient checkouts and everyday-low pricing, it has stayed relevant against overwhelming odds. Not even the comfort of home purchases can beat receiving a product right away, especially for essential goods.Better yet, Wall Street has witnessed several quarters of impressive growth in Walmart's e-commerce channels. Essentially, the disrupted is becoming the disruptor. And while its 2.2% dividend yield won't raise your pulse, it's still something substantive to bank on.Source: Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO)If you're looking for one of the best dividend stocks with a reasonable mix between passive growth and capital gains, put Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on your radar. An iconic, global brand, management has for years depended on consumer familiarity. When that didn't work, KO ramped up its product and marketing game.Last November, I declared that you can trust Coca-Cola. In an awfully volatile year, I'm glad I was right about this one. In the final quarter of 2018, KO was actually one of the best stocks in the markets, gaining over 3%. That doesn't sound like much until you consider that several high-flyers lost double digits over the same period.  * 7 Cloud Stocks To Buy Now In the beverage sector, millennials usually gravitate toward healthier options. Therefore, I'm impressed that sugary-soda specialist KO managed to convert folks. Finally, the company's 3.2% dividend yield should give wary investors plenty to think about.Source: GothamNurse Via Flickr Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Armed with nearly a 3.4% dividend yield, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) initially appears qualified as one of the best dividend stocks available. However, ADM represents a direct play on the farming and agriculture business. Thanks to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, ADM is risky.But here too, initial appearances may be deceiving. While I'm not dismissing the risks -- Archer Daniels recently reported disappointing earnings results -- opportunities also exist. Specifically, I'm citing the age-old aphorism of buying into weakness and selling into strength. It's a gamble, but because the trade war has gone on for quite some time, we may see a resolution.Certainly, I'm not alone in this thinking process. According to The Wall Street Journal, Archer Daniels CEO Juan Luciano also sees light at the end of the tunnel.Source: Shutterstock  Consolidated Edison (ED)Where I am, we don't usually suffer electrical blackouts. But when we do, it's like the apocalypse. I still distinctly remember the 2011 power outage that impacted millions across California and Arizona. Transitioning toward a fully digitalized society, we all received a rude awakening that technology doesn't occur in a vacuum.This fundamental reality makes Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) one of the best dividend stocks around. People go crazy when they can't turn on the lights: I've witnessed this dynamic firsthand. Also, ED stock benefits from the nature of the utility business. Without much competition, current players essentially have a free moat.  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio In this capital-gains challenged environment, Consolidated Edison's 3.8% dividend yield entices. Like the other best stocks on this list, you can't go wrong with ED. However, the company's slow growth means you're sacrificing upside potential for relative certainty.Source: Shutterstock  Exxon Mobil (XOM)Ever since the energy markets collapsed back in 2014 and 2015, oil companies presented both contrarian opportunities and incredible risk. For instance, the international benchmark Brent Crude Oil enjoyed a solid year in 2017. &quot;Black gold&quot; was also on pace for strong returns in 2018 until October happened.However, some experts believe that we might see a rebound in the new year. If so, that benefits big oil firms like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). In years past, analysts frequently added XOM to their list of best dividend stocks due to broad oil market exposure. Particularly, rising prices boost the company's upstream efforts.At a time when investors struggle for profits, Exxon Mobil's 4.4% dividend yield tempts almost everyone. That said, oil is a nasty mother, so watch out for potential geopolitical rumblings.Source: Shutterstock  Philip Morris International (PM)If you really want to dial up your passive-income potential, check out Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Historically, big tobacco has offered some of the best dividend stocks, and it's not hard to see why. Thanks to the highly addictive nicotine, Philip Morris customers often can't say no.&quot;Better&quot; yet, PM has shifted its focus for future revenues on its e-cigarette or vaporizer division. Known as IQOS, this product allows users many of the benefits of traditional smoking, but without the harsh residuals -- such as carbon monoxide -- associated with the practice.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss Levering a 5.9% dividend yield, indeed, it's hard to say no to PM stock. But before you make the leap, you should know that smoking trends have fallen off a cliff. While vaporizers have soared in popularity, anti-tobacco advocates are increasingly eyeballing e-cigarette manufacturers.Source: Shutterstock  AT&T (T)Just recently, I wrote extensively about one of the best stocks for dividend investors: telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T). Due in part to some awful volatility in the markets, T stock now offers a 6.9% dividend yield. It's simply outrageous, which is why I personally took the dive.In my write-up, I discussed the many positives that AT&T offers. Primarily, the company features a massive network, which is simply too big to overcome. On top of that, this incredible resource allows AT&T to fully harness the power and potential of the 5G rollout. As well, management could possibly advantage its newfound content umbrella.But at the end of the day, what really mattered for me was something much more basic. AT&T is simply a powerhouse. Even with its unsightly debt load and other business challenges, the company is not going anywhere. You're probably not going to find an outfit this reputable giving a payout this high.Source: Shutterstock  GameStop (GME)At first glance, the notion of investing in GameStop (NYSE:GME) appears amazingly foolish. With the push toward digital deliveries and cloud gaming, GME is on the path to becoming the next Blockbuster. While admittedly worrisome, this comparison isn't accurate.For one thing, this is a very old argument. But more importantly, this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Streaming movies and TV programs isn't exactly network-intensive because the data is predetermined. Such content doesn't change based on user inputs.However, you cannot say the same about video games. The user constantly transmits data through his/her controller, directly impacting the game's narrative. That requires intense data streams that I've argued are not practically feasible.I appreciate that game developers are pushing the boundaries of the cloud. But neither Sony (NYSE:SNE) nor Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will give up their console businesses. Why? It's all about science.With 5G, you could potentially have a cloud-gaming platform with little to no latency, and the same graphical capacities as a current-generation PlayStation. But with a physical console, you can have superior performance and capacity metrics on all fronts.  * 7 of the Best Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy In other words, it's much easier to upgrade a console than it is to upgrade a network. That being the case, physical games will still be around, and perhaps, so will GME.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock and SNE stock.

2019-02-22,"The Container Store (NYSE:TCS), which is the pioneer of storage and organization products, went public in November 2013. And it turned out to be a red-hot offering. On the debut, the TCS stock doubled to $36. The company looked more like a tech startup - not a traditional retailer.Source: Shutterstock Then again, at the time TCS was growing at a fast clip. Consider that it had reported 13 consecutive increase in comparable store sales. It certainly helped that the company had loyal fans like Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. But the good times would soon fizzle. Fast forward to today: TCS stock is now trading at a lowly $6.50.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns So what now? Can TCS stock regain its former glory? Or should investors be cautious? To see, let's take a look at the pros and cons:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Container Store Stock ProsRestructuring: TCS is in the midst of making major changes to the organization. One of the main strategic initiatives is to put much more focus on Custom Closets, which have shown lots of traction with customers. Expect TCS to invest more marketing dollars in the category and add more items. What's more, TCS plans to focus more on private label offerings. This should help boost margins and differentiate itself from the competition.Next, the company is experimenting with new store formats, better layouts of the merchandise and value-based pricing. So far, there have been encouraging results from the Dallas flagship store.Oh, and TCS has revamped its marketing message. The new tag line: &quot;&quot;Where Space Comes From.&quot;According to TCS vice president of marketing Felipe Avila: &quot;This campaign is designed to speak to consumers going through different life stages - whether that's buying a new home, growing their families or downsizing. We want to connect with them through stories they can relate to and identify with.&quot;Buzz: A hit show can move the needle for an industry. And this perhaps could be the situation with TCS.  Nettflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a show called Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.In case you do not now who she is, Kondo is one of the world's foremost experts in dealing with clutter. Note that she is the author of the best seller, &quot;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.&quot;No doubt, this is spot on for TCS. Actually, based on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts, the show may be leading to jumps in store visits.Valuation: The Container Store Stock has definitely gotten more affordable. Since August, the shares have lost more than 40% of their value, with the market cap at only $320 million (this is despite a 37% increase this year!)Now the forward price-to-earnings ratio at a reasonable 14X. Container Store Stock also trades at a mere 0.37 times sales. Container Store Stock ConsExecution: The execution of TCS's management has been wanting. Just look at the fiscal third quarter. Despite the overall demand from the holiday spending season, the company had a terrible performance. As a result, TCS stock plunged.In the quarter, revenues dropped by 0.6% to $221.6 million and comparable sales were off by 0.8%. In fact, the holiday departments posted a grueling 15.8% drop on the top-line.Profits were also light. Earnings per share came to 7 cents a share, down from 11 cents in the same period a year ago.Niche: Even though TCS has been around since 1978, the company is still relatively small. It currently operates 92 stores. To put things into perspective, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has 2,200 locations.In other words, TCS may ultimately be in a niche industry - which means that growth is limited. If anything, the company may have already reached the peak position. During the past five years, revenue growth has averaged 3.9%.And there are few signs that things will perk up any time soon.Competition: Nowadays consumers have more options to purchase TCS-style products. Some of the large rivals in the space include Ikea, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).True, their offerings may not be at premium quality levels. But then again, many consumers may not really care, especially if the prices are at affordable levels. How important is it to have a top-of-the-line item? Well, based on the sluggish sales of TCS, maybe not much. Bottom Line on Container Store StockThe restructuring efforts for TCS look to be on the right track. But it will probably take time for the changes to take hold. In the meantime, TCS faces tough challenges. The competitive environment is intense and the company continues to have issues with merchandising.So weighing the pros and cons, it's probably best to hold off on buying The Container Store stock for now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-02-25,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) isn't headed into its Tuesday morning earnings report on the firmest of footings. Although HD stock is now up nearly 20% from its late-December low -- regaining roughly half of what was lost during the fourth quarter of last year -- a slowdown in U.S. home purchases and a projected slowdown in remodeling spending both continue chip away at the recent bullish sentiment surrounding the stock.Source: Shutterstock It's possible that slowdown is only temporary, setting the stage for a solid 2019 regardless of how the home improvement retailer fared last quarter.Even so, oddly high expectations for the recently completed quarter could readily upend Home Depot stock before home purchase and redecorating spending growth are decidedly rekindled.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Home Depot Earnings PreviewBlame the government shutdown, mostly, along with the weather, higher interest rates, tariffs and a relatively (compared to 2017) tame hurricane season. For that matter, blame the calendar too. Like its rival Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), Home Depot's quarter ended in late January, meaning it suffered the entirety of the record-breaking government shutdown in one single quarter.All of these are factors that impact the industry's top and bottom line to be sure. And, some analysts believe that's what happened.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade &quot;Home Depot and Lowe's face tough year-over-year comparisons in Q4 that included hurricane-related sales and a strong year ago December that was negatively impacted by weather in 2018,&quot; explained Wells Fargo in front of the fourth quarter print adding &quot;January (which is a smaller month) could also see impacts from the lengthy government shutdown (and associated lower consumer confidence), and less favorable weather that may have resulted in traffic/sales shifting to Q1.&quot;And yet, the analyst community hasn't exactly dialed back its collective outlook. As of the most recent look, the pros are calling for revenue growth of 11.3% to push its top line up to $26.6 billion, driving per-share profits up from a year-ago figure of $1.69 to $2.16 per share of HD stock for the recently-completed quarter.Same-store sales should be up on the order of 5%, in line with the past couple of quarters.Perhaps factors like the weather and the government shutdown aren't as hard-hitting as presumed. Indeed, despite demonstrable headwinds, Stifel believes &quot;There was some softness in late 2018 with the stock market decline, higher rates, tariff talks,&quot; but still acknowledges &quot;overall demand appears intact&quot; for Home Depot's goods. Rebound in the Works?The mixed, confusing message isn't a new one.Even before the government shutdown stopped official reports of new home sale activity from being posted, their growth pace was slowing, and by some measures shrinking. The slowdown has persisted too. In January of this year, according to data from Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), sales of new houses fell 8% year-over-year. Sales of existing homes, which isn't published by the federal government and continued to be tracked through the shutdown, fell 1.2% last month to also extend a period of lethargic interest.Housing starts are also leveling off, suggesting waning demand, and crimping supply even if demand had remained firm.The flipside: A recent report jointly pieced together by Wells Fargo and L.E.K. Consulting suggested &quot;Concerns of a 2019 downturn in housing screen as overblown, with housing starts likely to show steady growth in the intermediate term.&quot; The Joint Center of Housing Studies at Harvard University also recently opined that remodeling spending would grow to the tune of 5.1% in 2019.As for the potential impact of higher interest rates, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers recently penned &quot;Given the importance of rates to housing, this policy change [less hawkishness, more dovishness] certainly cannot be dismissed. Indeed, mortgage rates are 50 basis points off highs, which could lead to housing turnover and pricing better than previously feared and let the category grow longer.&quot;Another noteworthy development that bodes well for HD stock is January's stunning 25% increase in lumber prices, largely erasing last year's tumble.On balance, the data points to a turnaround. The brewing turnaround, however, will do little to help Home Depot's pressured fourth quarter. Investors, however, will likely struggle to rectify all the disparate ideas. Looking Ahead for HD StockIt's possible, and even likely, that investors have already conceded Home Depot's fourth quarter numbers are a coin toss at best, and will be a relative disappointment at worst. They've been buying HD stock anyway, looking at what lies ahead for the full year.To that end, analysts are calling for full-year sales of $108.4 billion, up 7.4% from 2018's projected sales, and per-share profits of $9.80, up from 2018's anticipated $7.46. Tuesday's full-year report should also be accompanied by its first 2019 outlook.Guidance that comes up short of current estimates could do more damage to the recent rally from HD stock than missing Q4 estimates might.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average stayed pat at 0.59.Options traders zeroed in on earnings reports in Macy's (NYSE:M) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Elsewhere, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) options were popular during a breakout attempt.Let's take a closer look: Macy's (M)Macy's reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday morning and beat the Street's estimates. The retail giant, whose stock has struggled recently, earned $2.73 per share on revenue of $8.46 billion. Earnings were down 3.5% from the same quarter last year but still arrived higher than analysts' estimates of $2.53 per share.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 M stock initially rallied as much as 5.1% before profit taking trimmed the gains to 1.44%.The price bump did nothing to change the long-term trajectory of Macy's share price. It remains submerged beneath a falling 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving average. With the broader market hot as a pistol, M stock looks particularly grim on a relative basis. Watch for a break below the $24 support zone to signal the next down-leg has begun.The earnings release lit a fire under options trading. Calls led the way as total activity ramped to 517% of the average daily volume, with 133,193 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 57% of the sum.Ahead of the event, the expected move based on options pricing was $2.14, or 8.8%. And that makes the measly 1.44% gain a real dud. Chalk this earnings season up to a big win for volatility sellers. Yesterday's volatility crush drove the reading down to 37%, or the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Home Depot (HD)Home Depot saw a volatile session yesterday after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that left investors dissatisfied. The home improvement retailer raked in $2.09 per share on revenue of $26.5 billion. Guidance for 2019 earnings was underwhelming at $10.03.Despite the initial plunge, HD stock fought back to end down just shy of 1%. Ahead of the event, HD shares had been improving from its fourth quarter beatdown. Since bottoming before Christmas at $158.09, they were up 20% heading into Tuesday's report.With the bullish response to the down gap, traders now have a precise level to trade against. If HD can remain above yesterday's low or $182.80, then the path of least resistance remains higher.The earnings excitement infected options trading yesterday, with puts outpacing calls by a slight margin. Activity swelled to 452% of the average daily volume, with 100,658 total contracts traded. 52% of the total originated with puts.With the sharp rebound in prices after the morning plunge, volatility sellers came out big winners. The expected move was $6.13, or 3.2%, so the 0.9% drop was well within expectations. Moving forward, premiums are pricing in daily moves of $2.26, or 1.2%. Bank of America (BAC)Despite a light day on the news front, Bank of America landed in the most-active options list. Calls led the way accounting for 59% of the day's take. Total activity ticked higher to 111% of the average daily volume, with 257,113 total contracts traded.Since gapping higher on earnings last month, BAC stock has built a sideways base with easy-to-spot support and resistance zones. We've seen multiple tests of the $29.70 ceiling, and I suspect it's only a matter of time until buyers break through. That's the level to trade against if you're looking to buy.Implied volatility remains subdued at 23%, or the 21st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 42 cents, or roughly 1.4%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

For some investors, it was the first they'd ever heard of the company, driving a sudden wave of interest. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) fared even better though, up 16.3% following a fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat. There was just more bearish volume than bullish volume on Tuesday, and more advancers than decliners.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Wednesday's action gets going, it's the stock charts of Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) that offer the most trading potential. Here's why, and what to look for. Sempra Energy (SRE)At first glance Sempra Energy is little more than a volatile mess. But, a closer inspection reveals there's actually a relatively organized effort underway.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market One more good shove and months worth of consolidation could readily turn into a nice breakout thrust.  Click to Enlarge • Though apparent on the daily chart, it's better appreciated on the weekly chart that SRE shares are being ushered higher by a set of parallel support and resistance lines, plotted in blue. Sempra shares just pushed off the lower edge of the range near the end of last year.• In the meantime, clear resistance has formed around $120, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.• While we've seen bullish thrusts fail before, this one is different. This time, the pullback seen earlier this month was halted and reversed at a convergence of several key moving average lines. It's a sign that the bulls have finally drawn a line in the sand. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)If Cabot Oil & Gas rings a bell, there's a reason. It was one of the stock charts featured back on Feb. 20, after several weeks' worth of volatility finally began to make discernible progress. While more up and down was in the cards, the undertow had turned bullish.COG shares promptly pulled back the very next day, calling the thesis into question. But since then, the uptrend has been rekindled after COG found support right where it needed to.  Click to Enlarge • Last week's pullback stopped at the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, and was firmly reversed.• While still volatile, notice the 200-day moving average as well as the gray 100-day moving average line are both sloped upward now, confirming the overall trend is bullish.• Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the slow, U-shaped reversal that has been taking shape since the middle of last year, aided by a long-standing support line.• Though the tide is bullish here, Cabot Oil & Gas still faces minor resistance at $25.20 and major resistance right around $26. Incyte (INCY)Finally, Incyte has been featured several times since the middle of last year as a breakout candidate. It didn't happen in earnest until January though, and it ultimately took a bearish headfake to set the move up. And even then, there was doubt.The breakout thrust has really firmed up over the course of the past month, however, and is worth a refreshed look. While some profit-taking is likely to be in the cards, the recent gain has developed enough cushion to make a small setback not only palatable, but productive.  Click to Enlarge • The big line in the sand was at $74.90, plotted in red on both stock charts. Shares punched through that ceiling in early January, and have put some distance between them and it in the meantime.• While the divergence sends a statement, it's also clear that even just the move since early January has brought INCY to the brink of being overbought. A dip that burns off that froth would actually be bullish, in the bigger picture.• Any pullback would ideally (and probably would be) stopped and reversed either the purple 50-day moving average line or the gray 100-day average.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-28,"Last year, homebuilder ETFs and stocks were stymied by rising interest rates -- among other factors. The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times, leading to higher mortgage rates, which chased some would-be homebuyers from the market.Housing affordability concerns in some of the marquee U.S. real estate markets, including California and New York, also plagued homebuilder ETFs in 2018. While the housing affordability issue is far from being reconciled, the good news for investors considering homebuilder ETFs is that the Federal Reserve is likely to slow its pace of rate hikes or not even raise rates at all this year.The Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, one of the most widely followed gauges of homebuilder and home improvement equities, is higher by nearly 18% this year. Recent housing data has been encouraging, but analysts are advising a cautious approach.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndustry analysts are &quot;arguing that the Fed's recent pivot toward dovish interest-rate policy, the tempered pace of the housing recovery since the financial crisis, and demographic factors would combine to help support the housing market in the long term,&quot; reports MarketWatch.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism In other words, investing mulling homebuilder ETFs have a lot to consider. Here are some of the top homebuilder ETFs that could extend their already sizable gains this year. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) Expense ratio: 0.43% per year, or $43 on a $10,000 investment.The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (CBOE:ITB) is the largest homebuilder ETF and tracks the aforementioned Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. As such, the $1.18 billion ITB is one of the purest plays among homebuilder ETFs.This is a cap-weighted homebuilder ETF, so it is dominated by the largest stocks in this group. For instance, Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI) combine for over 27% of ITB's weight. The fund's top 10 holdings combine for over 61% of its weight. ITB has some exposure to the retail side of residential real estate, but just to the tune of 13%.Remembering that homebuilder ETFs and stocks notched their worst annual performances in 2018 since 2008 could be interpreted as a sign that the group has more room to run. While ITB is up 17.74% this year, it is still more than 15% below its 52-week high. Invesco Dynamic Building & Construction ETF (PKB)Expense ratio: 0.58% per year, or $58 on a $10,000 investment.The Invesco Dynamic Building & Construction ETF (NYSEARCA:PKB) is an example of a homebuilder ETF with a unique weighting methodology that offers investors the potential to generate returns above those offered by more traditional homebuilder funds.PKB, which is more than 13 years old, follows the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index. That index &quot;thoroughly evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value,&quot; according to Invesco.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 In general, homebuilder ETFs tilt toward the lower end of the large-cap spectrum and/or include plenty of mid-cap stocks. PKB's 30 holdings have an average market value of $19.76 billion and just 15.44% of the fund's holdings are classified as large caps. Growth investors will like this homebuilder ETF because almost 40% of its holdings are considered growth stocks. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH)Expense ratio: 0.35% per year, or $35 on a $10,000 investment.As it name implies, the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:RTH) is a retail fund, not a dedicated homebuilder ETF, but this product does have ample exposure to the retail side of residential real estate. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD), the largest home improvement retailer, is the second-largest holding in RTH at nearly 11%.Of the 220 ETFs with exposure to Home Depot, RTH has the largest weight to that stock. Home Depot rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is also a top 10 RTH holding at a weight of 4.63%. Of the 190 ETFs with exposure to Lowe's, RTH has the second-largest weight to that home improvement retailer.Several of RTH's other holdings also sell home improvement products and the ETF is a fine way of getting exposure to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as that stock represents over 20% of RTH's weight. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB)Expense ratio: 0.35% per year, or $35 on a $10,000 investment.Next to ITB, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB) is the most widely followed homebuilder ETF, although the SPDR offering is not as pure as its iShares rival.XHB's equal-weight index provides exposure to the following groups: Building Products, Home Furnishings, Home Improvement Retail, Homefurnishing Retail and Household Appliances, according to State Street.  * 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years Pure homebuilders represent 31.64% of XHB's weight, the fund's second-largest industry weight. This homebuilder ETF also has significant consumer discretionary exposure as household appliances manufacturers, home improvement retailers and home furnishings retailers combine for over 26% of the fund's roster. Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares (NAIL)Expense ratio: 1.12% per year, of $112 on a $10,000 investment.The Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares (NYSEARCA:NAIL) is the only leveraged homebuilder ETF on the market and this fund looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the aforementioned Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.As is the case with any leveraged ETF, NAIL should be used with care by risk-tolerant, short-term traders, not buy-and-hold investors. Good times to consider NAIL include days when housing data is released and earnings days for stocks such as D.R. Horton, Lennar and other marquee homebuilders.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-01,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock dropped 4% after missing analysts' consensus estimates, leading some to wonder whether Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) stock might now be a better investment than HD stock.Home Depot's earnings per share of $2.09 on $26.5 billion of sales, against analysts' average EPS outlook of $2.16, and its same-store sales growth of only 3.2%, against the consunsus outlook of 4.5%, was enough to get tongues wagging.After all, the bears growled, Lowe's now has a hot new leader in Marvin Ellison, and Home Depot's management couldn't be picked out of a lineup. Ellison is a &quot;superstar,&quot; as one TV pundit put it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance  The Case for Lowe's StockPersonally, I'm a fan of Marvin Ellison.  I thought he could save JC Penney (NYSE:JCP). He couldn't. Maybe no one can. His knowledge of store logistics is a better fit for Lowe's, but does that make the stock better than the long-time category leader, HD stock?HD stock and LOW stock tends to move in tandem. Home Depot stock and LOW stock have doubled in value over the last five years. Neither stock has been a bad investment.Over five years, HD stock has only done slightly better than LOW stock. Over the last year, and especially since Ellison was recruited, HD stock has underperformed LOW stock.In Q4, Lowe's EPS came in at 80 cents excluding certain charges,  The adjusted EPS of 80 cents met the consensus outlook. But its revenue of $15.6 billion (about 70% that of Home Depot's) came up short of the $15.7 billion consensus outlook. Lowe's Q4 loss per share, including the charges, was $1.03. The company's annual EPS of $2.84 per share, however, justified a hike in the quarterly dividend, from 41 cents to 48 cents. The point here being, there's still cleanup to do on aisle three. Ellison admitted as much in his earnings call, saying the company's computer infrastructure still needs to be transformed, and it needs to do a better job of selling to contractors. The Case for HD StockHome Depot's miss was a miss only when compared with expectations.Home Depot's sales have been steadily increasing 7%-9% for years, and the growth of its net income accelerated in fiscal 2019, compared with the year before. Its earnings miss was the result of cold weather and a slowing real estate market. Smart investment groups seeking long-term returns are stepping in on the stock's weakness, and they're bragging about it. Home Depot's balance sheet is still stronger than that of Lowe's, its cash flow is more robust, and HD hiked the dividend on HD stock 32% to a fat $1.36 per share. Thus, today's yield on Home Depot stock is 2.96%, despite the  continuing rise of HD stock. To an aging income investor, this is music to the ears.Contractors are the secret to Home Depot's success. Contractors get discounts and their own entrance at my Home Depot store. Small contractors, the folks who might put an addition on your house or replace your kitchen, are especially prized by Home Depot, one reason it's backing an outsourced delivery start-up called Roadie, which can make same-day deliveries to job sites for the same prices that HD charges.Ellison can narrow the gap betwee LOW and HD, in other words, but there's still a gap between them. The Bottom Line on HD Stock and LOW StockWhether you choose to buy HD stock or LOW stock depends on your time horizon.If you're looking for a quick return on your investment, Lowe's stock might indeed be better because Marvin Ellison is a good manager and there's still room for improvement. at LOW But if you're looking for a long-term holding, and/or if you're an income investor, HD stock is a better call. Just remember, however, that both HD stock and LOW stock are so strong that you can't really go wrong.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-01,"It's official. After years of falling behind rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) on several fronts, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) is finally starting to close the gap. By some measures it's even outperforming its bigger competitor, including the one most important to investors; Lowe's stock is leading Home Depot stock by leaps and bounds for the past year.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)There's still more work to be done, to be sure. And despite the usual post-earnings optimism the company was sporting following Wednesday morning's Q4 report, the housing market is undeniably facing a headwind. The question is one of degrees.Regardless, it's increasingly difficult to not replace HD with LOW stock as the go-to name within the home improvement arena.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance  New CEO and Lowe's StockThe credit largely goes to CEO Marvin Ellison. After only seven months on the job, the former Home Depot executive has Lowe's humming again. Its stores have the right and adequate inventory to meet the needs of contractors as well as DIYers. Meanwhile, his renewed focus on customer service has made a trip to its stores a pleasant experience again.Much of Ellison's work, though, has been largely out of sight of customers, even if they've been a beneficiary of those improvements.One of Ellison's first missions after taking the helm in July of last year was a top-down overhaul of Lowe's technologies. This included a rethinking of inventory management solutions, but most of all it was a means of connecting with more shoppers on the web. While only about 5% of the company's sales are done online, that figure is growing fast.Also noteworthy is that 60% of online orders are retrieved in its stores, setting up another opportunity to make an add-on sale. Lowe's Stock and Q4The fruits of Ellison's labor are starting to bloom. Last quarter's same-store sales growth of 1.7% may have fallen short of the 2.1% improvement analysts were modeling, but income of 80 cents per share of Lowe's stock was better than the 79 cents the pros had estimated, and up 8.1 year-over-year despite flat revenues.The wider margins are the result of shedding poor businesses. Ellison has been closing unprofitable stores in North America, and has completely shuttered its struggling Orchard Supply unit.Last quarter's same-store sales growth of 2.4% in the U.S. still doesn't match up with Home Depot's 3.7% comparable sales growth for the quarter ending in January. But, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel notes that the 1.3 percentage point difference is &quot;the narrowest it has been in a while.&quot;The difference may even be narrower for the quarter currently underway. In January alone, Lowe's same-store sales growth of 5.8% outpaced Home Depot's figure of 4.1%.It was enough to prompt Joe Feldman, senior managing director at Telsey Advisory Group, to say that &quot;Lowe's has an opportunity to close that gap. We don't expect them to completely close it, but we expect them to narrow it. And if they can narrow it and bring up their profitability over the next year or two, that will certainly help the stock.&quot; Looking Ahead for Lowe's StockIf Lowe's is to close that gap though, it's going to need continued growth from an uncertain housing market.Ellison feels good about the foreseeable future on that front, commenting: &quot;U.S. macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound for 2019, and we will continue to implement process and technology improvements to capitalize on the immediate opportunity to improve results.&quot;Ellison added during the conference call &quot;As home prices are increasing, consumers are staying in their homes longer and because of their improved financial position, they are investing in their homes.&quot;The data more or less jibes with Ellison's feel for the home improvement and remodel market. The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University expects spending on remodels to grow 5.1% this year.As for new construction, however, the jury is still out. January's new home sales in the United States fell 8% year-over-year, and December's housing starts fell 10.2% year-over-year to a two-year low rate of 1.08 million.Still, the company is optimistic, offering 2019 profit guidance of between $6.00 and $6.10 per share of Lowe's stock, versus analyst estimates of $6.04. Lowe's is looking for total revenue growth of 2% on same-store sales growth of 3%.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-01,"Shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) dropped sharply on Tuesday after the home improvements retailer reported fourth quarter numbers that came in largely shy of expectations, and included a full-year 2019 guide that was unimpressive. The broad implication was that a long-slowing housing market had finally caught up to Home Depot. Investors freaked out. HD stock dropped a few percentage points.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)In the big picture, however, slowing growth isn't a red flag for Home Depot stock. Instead, so long as this slowing growth can stabilize at a still-healthy long-term rate, HD stock actually has room to move higher from here.That's exactly what will happen. The headwinds which dropped the housing market in late 2018 -- namely, rising rates and stock market turmoil -- have eased in 2019, and project to remain relatively muted as the year progresses. The housing market should bounce back. As it does, Home Depot's growth rates will normalize. As that happens, HD stock will bounce back, too, given its presently discounted valuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Thus, in the big picture, recent weakness in HD stock is an opportunity. By the end of the year, fundamentals imply that these shares will be trading at prices close to $200. Recent Headwinds Are Reversing CourseLooking at fourth quarter numbers, the current trends underlying HD stock aren't pretty. Comparable sales growth is slowing, and hit a multi-quarter low of 3.2% in Q4. For perspective, comparable sales growth has been largely north of 5% for the past several years. Also, ticket growth is slowing to a multi-quarter low of just above 2%, while traffic growth was just 0.9% in the fourth quarter.This slowing growth data at Home Depot shouldn't be surprising when considering the housing market backdrop. Recent housing data has been really bad. Housing starts fell by over 11% in December 2018, and reached their lowest level since September 2016. Meanwhile, home prices in December rose at their slowest rate since August 2015.Overall, housing market growth rates are slowing to multi-year lows, as are Home Depot's growth rates. But, this is all backward looking. If you look forward, it becomes apparent that recent weakness isn't here to stay.The housing market dropped big in late 2018 for two reasons. One, inflation was creeping up, the Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and mortgage rates were on a rapid run higher. Two, Wall Street became obsessed with a coming recession, and that created enormous stock market volatility, the likes of which spilled over into Main Street and sapped consumer confidence.Both of those headwinds are now reversing course. Inflation is under control. The Fed isn't hiking anymore. In fact, they are now considering even ending their balance sheet run-off. Consequently, mortgage rates have been on a steady downtrend for the past several months. Also, the stock market has bounced back with relatively muted volatility. As it has, the consumer has regained confidence.Thus, the housing market is set to bounce back over the next several months with rates on the move lower and consumer confidence on the move higher. Home Depot management knows this. That's why they are guiding for 5% comparable sales growth in fiscal 2019, better than the fourth quarter's 3.2% comp. If Home Depot can hit that 5% comp figure -- which seems entirely doable given secular trends -- then HD stock will ultimately rally toward $200 in 2019. Fundamentals Imply Upside to $200Home Depot is coming off several consecutive years of red-hot growth. Now, that growth is naturally cooling. But, it isn't dying, and a reversal of housing market headwinds in 2019 will stabilize growth in a more long-term sustainable range.That range will include low to mid-single comparable sales growth, gradual margin expansion, and a healthy rate of buybacks. Putting all that together, Home Depot should easily be able to hit about $135 billion in sales by fiscal 2025, with EPS of roughly $14.50.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Over the past five years, HD stock has normally traded around 20 times forward earnings. Based on that historically average 20x forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for HD stock is $290. Discounted back by 8% per year (2 points below my normal 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of just under $200. Bottom Line on HD StockInvestors are concerned that a weak housing market has finally caught up to Home Depot stock. It has. But, today's weak housing market is set to improve over the next few months as rates head lower and consumer confidence heads higher. So, recent weakness at Home Depot isn't here to stay. Instead, it will be replaced by improving growth rates later in the year, the likes of which will power a rally in HD stock towards $200 by the end of 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long HD.

2019-03-07,"Earlier this week, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) enjoyed a surge in momentum, leaping over 9% on Tuesday's session. But without any fresh fundamental drivers, it was easy to pinpoint why Aurora Cannabis stock took off.Source: Shutterstock Cowen & Co analyst Vivien Azer initiated coverage of the company with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating. Moreover, she set a $14 price target for ACB stock, representing a 77% premium against current levels. Since shares are already up over 61%, such resounding bullishness raised eyebrows.However, Azer wasn't just spitting out numbers for the fun of it. Backing her thesis is Aurora's &quot;large cultivation footprint.&quot; Key acquisitions, such as January's Whistler Medical Marijuana buyout, will enable ACB to grow its domestic and international presence. Already, the company has 20% market share in its native Canada.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith continued advancements, Azer believes that ACB will deliver positive earnings by its fiscal fourth quarter in June. If so, Aurora Cannabis stock easily outshines rivals like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aphria (NYSE:APHA).Given a prominent voice in the legal-marijuana space advocating for Aurora, it seems a no-brainer. However, ACB stock, like any other name in the industry, has suffered wild swings in market value. As a result, conservative investors have avoided marijuana stocks, especially with the major indices performing poorly in recent sessions.  * 7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy In addition, rapid-fire growth has a dilutive effect. For instance, Aurora's $175 million Whistler buyout was an all-equity one. When you look at the company's other acquisitions, you'll notice a similar trend. While such decisions save vital cash funds, they also negatively impact Aurora Cannabis stock.If that wasn't enough of a concern, shares fell a sizable 2.6% on Wednesday. Is this a warning to avoid ACB stock? The Long Game Benefits Aurora Cannabis StockGiven this contrasting perspective, Aurora has the appearance of a classic bull-trap: shares attract investors on superficial information, but the fine print ultimately upends them.Indeed, when you drill into the granularity, Aurora Cannabis stock has &quot;bad deal&quot; written all over it. For example, Whistler has a production capacity of a little over 5,000 kilograms annually. That's nothing when you compare it to ICC Labs, another Aurora buyout. ICC churns out a whopping 450,000 kilograms annually.Aurora paid $290 million (in ACB stock) for ICC, while it paid $175 million for Whistler. Yes, the Whistler buyout is cheaper, but it's yielding 1% of ICC's production capacity. Has management started smoking their botanical inventory?Actually, the Whistler deal is one of the smartest moves the company has made. It just requires a longer-term approach to appreciate it.Here's the situation with the legal-marijuana industry: we're in the second leg of a multi-phase race. The first leg was the introductory period. This is where investments like Aurora Cannabis stock jumped higher simply because it exists in the cannabis space. Like I mentioned in prior stories, a previously illegal market found legality, naturally boosting investor sentiment.But now that everyone and their dog competes in the cannabis space, pure production stats no longer provides differentiation. Don't get me wrong: ACB stock clearly benefits from expansionary efforts. However, in the second leg, it's not just about quantity, but rather quality.What makes Whistler special? According to its PR profile, the company &quot;commercialized more than 30 flower varieties and strain-specific oil products, from an extensive genetics bank of over 150 strains.&quot;This fact should actually be at the top of Aurora's marketing campaign. Patience Is Key for ACB StockLet's consider what happens several years down the line. Based on shifting political sentiment towards progressivism, the federal government will likely de-schedule marijuana. When that happens, anybody that shops at Home Depot (NYSE:HD) can theoretically grow their own weed.Under this environment, what incentivizes a pothead or a patient to fork over their money to a weed company? Surely, it's not quantity nor accessibility, since growing marijuana isn't brain surgery. What matters are strains and compounds that address specific symptoms, or induce a particular experience.Through the Whistler acquisition, Aurora wins on the quality department. With its other capacity-friendly buyouts, ACB ensures that it can supply that demand.Rather than being dilutive, the company's shopping spree is actually accretive. You just have to extend your timeframe.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Activity remained lofty at 549% of the average daily volume, with 474,436 total contracts traded.The rocket-like rise in implied volatility continued for a second day, driving the reading to 44%. That places it at the 79th percent of its one-year range signaling premiums have expanded to their highest levels since mid-December. Short option trades like bull puts and iron condors are becoming an increasingly attractive way to play BA. Home Depot (HD)Home Depot's trading on Tuesday was uneventful on the surface. Buyers won the contest, if only slightly, with a 0.7% gain on the session. However, the looming dividend payout lit a fire in call trading.The price trend for HD stock has improved this year, especially compared to the beatdown suffered in the fourth quarter. Falling interest rates and the housing sector returning to health were two likely culprits, not to mention the improving backdrop of the broader stock market.Though last month's earnings release caused the stock to stumble, this week's successful test of the 50-day moving average should embolden bulls. Home Depot is scheduled to trade ex-dividend on Wednesday which means those that don't own the stock beforehand will not receive the quarterly payment of $1.36. Based on yesterday's close, the dividend yield is around 3%.As is usually the case ahead of a dividend, calls dominated the options scene. Activity ballooned to 293% of the average daily volume, with 87,209 total contracts traded. 88% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility remains subdued at 18% placing it at the 12th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $2.06 or 1.1%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)This week's market rebound is breathing new life into semiconductor stocks. And that has traders once again flocking to AMD shares.Volatility has receded over the past six weeks, allowing the stock to build a sideways base or consolidation zone. Friday's upside reversal marked a successful test of the zone's lower end and reaffirms that buyers are in control.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a modest margin. Activity inched higher to 102% of the average daily volume, with 204,377 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 62% of the day's take.As the excitement for AMD shares has died down, so too has the implied volatility. At 42%, the metric used by traders to identify if options are cheap or expensive is now sitting at the 7th percentile of its one-year range. Options are officially inexpensive. The daily expected moves are now 62 cents, or 2.6%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-15,"After reporting a less-than-stellar quarter on Feb. 26, investors began selling shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It hasn't been catastrophic for Home Depot stock, but shares have been under pressure since the report.Source: Shutterstock The numbers of Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) are likely having an effect too. After initially rallying on the report, the stock fell for seven straight sessions. That's caused a lot of investors to ask whether these stocks are worth owning at this point. Spring SeasonInvestors are seemingly overlooking the spring season. When the holidays roll around, of course Home Depot, Lowe's and others do well in sales. Every family's handyman or DIY member is eligible for a home improvement gift, right? Right.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs But that hardly compares to the numbers that HD stock will put up in the second quarter as homeowners and contractors get to work fixing up houses, cleaning up yards and renovating kitchens and bathrooms. As such, Home Depot will bring on 80,000 new workers to account for the increase in demand.The downside to all this? These results show up in Q2, not Q1, which HD is in right now. That said, the silver lining here is that investors have an opportunity to buy or accumulate Home Depot stock while it's under pressure. That's better than buying a stock red-hot into its best numbers. Valuing Home Depot StockHome Depot is a high-quality company, but it's seen better years when it comes to growth. For the current year, estimates call for earnings growth of just 2.2%, despite expectations for 3.2% revenue growth.Estimates for next year improve, where analysts expect 9.3% earnings growth on 4.6% sales growth. Although, it's hard to put too much weight into next fiscal year when we've only just begun this one.So where does that leave HD stock? Shares trade at about 18 times this year's earnings, which isn't necessarily cheap but is also far from expensive. Investors also need to consider the Home Depot's 3% dividend yield down near these levels.Over the last six years, Home Depot has traded with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20 on the low end and 25 on the high end. So below this mark now, it's technically undervalued vs. its recent five-year history.Further, assuming one overlooks the December selloff, they'd have to go all the way back to 2011 to find HD stock paying out a higher dividend yield. That's following the company's 32% boost last month.Home Depot is making the investments necessary to makes its online game stand tall against companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has a below-average valuation vs. its historical range and is paying out a 3% dividend yield. I'll admit that the growth is somewhat stagnant for the year, but there's a lot to like about HD stock for the patient investor. Trading HD Stock  Click to EnlargeHome Depot has fallen about $10 from its pre-earnings levels, but that ~5% loss isn't too hard for most investors to stomach. For now, the 50-day moving average is propping up HD, while the 61.8% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracements are keeping it range bound.A break of either one of those Fib levels will likely send that stock in the continued direction. Meaning, a break below the 38.2% Fib will likely send HD stock lower and a breakout over the 61.8% Fib will likely send Home Depot higher.At this point though, with the lack of a real catalyst, the risk is to the downside. Should Home Depot stock lose the 50-day and subsequently Fib support, the stock could see $170 again.In that sense, investors who want to trade HD stock can go long near current levels, with a stop-loss on a close below this key area. Long-term investors though may consider this an advantageous spot to add to their position.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-17,"Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) jumped 5% trading following the warehouse retailer's positive earnings news on March 7. But broader market pressure put a damper on COST stock despite strong results. But it's because of those good results that this action caught our eye. After the big move, Costco stock continued to climb, leaving many investors to wonder what to do now.Is there still time to get long?Costco stock is setting up as a solid long for several reasons. Let's discuss three of them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco Stock EarningsFor the fiscal second quarter, Costco stock reported earning per share of $2.01, 31 cents ahead of expectations. That 18% earnings surprise pushed the performance up more than 40% year-over-year (YoY). However, revenue of $35.65 billion came up short by more than $250 million, despite growing more than 7.2% YoY. A bottom-line beat and top-line miss can spell trouble for a stock, particularly on a bad market day like the one we had on Friday.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash But that wasn't the case for COST stock and I think it's due to the strength in the business once we dig past the headline results. Forex and gas deflation weighed on revenue, as did the weather in some cases. Given the winter we've had, it's hard to deny that as a factor. If these issues caused the miss, investors were apparently fine with overlooking the sales shortfall. Further, U.S. comp-store sales jumped 7.2% YoY, but online sales were even more impressive. E-commerce comps jumped 25.5% YoY, showing just how well Costco is adjusting its business model for its customers.To be sure, the results could have been stronger, but it was still a pretty good showing for one of the market's premier retailers. Coupled with some of the catalysts below, the report is enough to help, not hinder COST stock. Trading Costco Stock  Click to EnlargeAfter a solid rally on Friday, March 8, COST stock followed up with an explosive move higher on the following Monday and Tuesday. All told, shares are now up around 8% since reporting earnings. However, according to the relative strength index, the stock price was overbought in the short-term. As shown in the chart above, over the past 12 months this type of condition has tended to put pressure on Costco stock in the short term.If we get that here, I would love to see a few days of sideways action and/or a slight pullback. It would be a very healthy way for Costco stock to digest the big rally. On a pullback, it would be bullish to see the $230 level hold as support and give its 20-day moving average a chance to catch up to the move.If COST stock starts to move higher again, $240 could be a reasonable upside target, with former highs near $245 as the second target. On the downside, I'm watching $230. If it doesn't hold, I want to see the 20-day or uptrend support hold. Below $225 and Costco stock will be concerning from the long side over the short-term.Overall though, it's hard to be too bearish after a rally like this. Analysts Are Boosting EstimatesWe're halfway through Costco's fiscal year and full-year estimates are impressive. Analysts now expect the company to earn $7.92 per share, up 11.7% from last year, with 7.7% sales growth. For next year, consensus expectations call for a deceleration in growth as analysts expect earnings and revenue to grow 7.4% and 6.9%, respectively.It's worth pointing out that current-year estimates of $7.92 per share are up from $7.76 just a week ago. Still, Costco stock trades at a premium, at 29 times this year's earnings. That's in-line with its five-year average, while its forward price-to-earnings ratio of ~27 is roughly in-line as well. However, COST stock is trading at a premium to some of its other metrics.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs Is that premium deserved? Like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and other premier companies, Costco knows it won't dominate Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Because it collects an annual fee from its 52 million members and retains a high percentage of those members (with a retention rate above 90% last quarter), Costco has flexibility. Its online and same-day delivery show strong growth and Costco will be one of the companies that not only survives but thrives from e-commerce growth.When it comes to dividend yield, Costco is no Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), as it pays out just 1%. However, last April the company bumped this payout by 14%, which is roughly in-line with its five-year average of 14.5% annual dividend growth. That's a solid raise to receive each year, particularly considering how well COST stock has done in that span as well, up 105%.Costco stock isn't cheap, but it deserves its premium valuation as a blue-chip retailer.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-18,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD), like so many other stocks that rely on a healthy real estate market, has had a tough go of it over the past year.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)While it has still managed to score a nearly 3% gain in the past 12 months (and another nearly 3% in its dividend), it hasn't been the wild ride that tech stocks have had. Granted, it is still off its September 2108 highs, but it has been more a controlled slide than a precipitous drop.And ironically, the thing that looks like HD's great hope moving forward is a slowing economy, not one that is heating up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Looking Forward in HD StockAs we saw last year, when there were signs that the U.S. economy was starting to roar back to life, the Federal Reserve was ready with its counter measures to hold runaway inflation at bay -- interest rate hikes.Also, selling off the massive mortgage-backed securities (MBS) portfolio it has purchased over the past decade is something that analysts say also can act like a de facto interest rate rise.  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs This rate rise saw mortgages go up and potential homeowners, as well as refinancing and home equity loan activity, stall. And that meant HD stock was out of luck. That's especially true on the homebuilding side, because a lion's share of its revenue comes from contractors rather than individual consumers.Once the market started to absorb the implications, it started to lower its expectations of HD stock. Fortunately Home Depot wasn't ever overbought like some of the homebuilders, so while it was painted with the same brush, it didn't get as many coats.But once the market adjusted to a slower economy in 2019 and the massive adjustment in the broad market took place in December, we're back in a good space moving forward.HD stock is up 6% year to date. The Federal Reserve has backed off on its inflation-phobic policies and is planning on giving the economy space to grow. And it's slowing down the sale of is MBS portfolio.All this is very good news for Home Depot stock moving forward.What's more, the Mortgage Bankers Association announced Wednesday that mortgage applications were up last week by 2.3%. That's a sign lower mortgage rates are starting to have an effect in the marketplace.It's always a challenge to be a market leader. While you have the size and money to weather economic storms, you're also the first company hit when the sector is challenged. You're usually expected to grow faster in good times but suffer less in bad times. Yet your stock is usually hit first when things start headed south.In a market as big as the housing market, these moves take a while to work themselves out. Looking at these trends on a quarterly basis doesn't really do the whole sector justice.For example, according to a recent study released by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, for  just the home renovation business alone is worth $450 billion annually in the U.S.That's a big ship to turn.My Portfolio Grader gives HD stock a C rating right now, but it's cheap and reliable, so if you want to step and take its dividend on a down payment for future growth, it may well be worth it.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-03-21,"Retail stocks were hammered in late 2018 amid concerns that the global economy was slowing and that the global consumer was consequently losing confidence. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) dropped 30% from early September 2018, to late December.Then, the post-Christmas rally happened. Retail stocks, and the market in general, staged a huge turnaround the day after Christmas. They have stayed on a solid uptrend ever since because global economic fundamentals have started to stabilize and improve, while the global consumer has regained confidence in 2019.All in all, the S&P Retail ETF is up 15% since Christmas Eve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the most part, this rebound in retail stocks should continue because the fundamentals continue to improve. Trade and FX headwinds are becoming less severe. The rate hiking headwind has turned into a accommodating monetary policy tailwind. Consumer confidence metrics across the globe, and in particular the U.S., are bouncing back. Job markets globally remain healthy. Wages globally are heading higher.Overall, the economic fundamentals today continue to support a strong retail environment for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the early 2019 rebound in retail stocks should continue over the next several months.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Which retail stocks will lead this continued rebound? Let's take a deeper look. Nike (NKE)Source:  rodrigofranca via Flickr  Category: Athletic Apparel % Gain Since Dec. 24: 28%Shares of global athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) have been on a tear in 2019. Since bottoming out in late 2018, Nike stock is up nearly 30%, and now trades at fresh all-time highs.Why the big rally? Nike has continued to expand its dominance in the athletic-apparel category using faster-than-peer product innovation -- an enhanced direct retail strategy -- and unique marketing campaigns that have energized the core customer base. As Nike has done this, North America sales growth has come back into solidly positive territory. International growth has remained hot. Margins have recovered. And the whole company is back to firing on all cylinders.This rally in Nike stock will continue because this dominance is nothing new. Nike has dominated the athletic-apparel scene for over twenty years now. Time and time again, competitors arise and threaten Nike's dominance. Time and time again, Nike responds effectively, crushes the competition and only expands its dominance. This will continue to happen for the foreseeable future, and it will keep Nike stock on a long-term upward path. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock  Category: Home Improvement % Gain Since Dec. 24: 17%Shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) dropped big in late 2018 amid concerns that the U.S. housing market was finally cooling after years of red-hot growth. But as financial markets have rebounded in 2019, so has Home Depot stock. It's up nearly 20% since late 2018.Why the big turnaround? U.S. housing market fundamentals have stabilized and improved in 2019. Specifically, the Fed went from hawkish to dovish, and stopped hiking rates. That caused mortgage rates, which had been on a sharp run up in late 2018, to fall big in early 2019. Also, consumer confidence has bounced back, wages have continued to rise, the unemployment rate remains low, housing starts have come roaring back and home-improvement-related retail sales rose over 8% year-over-year in January 2019.  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees All these improvements will continue so long as U.S. economic fundamentals remain solid, which they should. Americans will keep buying and remodeling homes. And Home Depot's sales and profits will continue to rise. As such, so long as the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, the rebound in Home Depot stock should persist. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)  Category: Home Improvement % Gain Since Dec. 24: 20%The story at Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) parallels the story at Home Depot. The stock was killed in late 2018 on slowing U.S. housing market concerns. It's rebounded in a big way in 2019 as housing market fundamentals have stabilized and improved.Importantly, though, Lowe's appears to finally be gaining share against Home Depot for the first time in a long time. For the past several years, Home Depot has consistently out-comped Lowe's in a sign that Home Depot was gaining market share and Lowe's was losing market share. But to end 2018, the gap between Lowe's and Home Depot's comparable sales growth was the narrowest it's been in two years. In January 2019, Lowe's actually out-comped Home Depot.The implication? For the first time in a long time, Lowe's is leveling the playing field with Home Depot and actually gaining share in the home improvement market. Lowe's stock is still materially cheaper than Home Depot stock. As such, as home improvement stocks continue to rebound, Lowe's stock could be the big winner. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)  Category: General Merchandise % Gain Since Dec. 24: 26%In late 2018, shares of Target (NYSE:TGT) fell off a cliff as investors were spooked by slowing comparable sales growth and compressing margins against the backdrop of a slowing U.S. economy. Target stock dropped big. But it's also rebounded big since then, staging a 26% rally since Christmas Eve.The turnaround in Target stock was powered by a few things. First, the U.S. economy stopped slowing and started stabilizing. Second, the U.S. consumer regained confidence in early 2019 and general merchandise retail sales rose 2.2% in January 2019. Third, Target reported solid holiday-quarter numbers that underscored that Target remains a healthy growth company with a red-hot digital business and stable margins.  * 3 Out-of-Favor Consumer Stocks to Buy This turnaround in Target stock will continue because the fundamentals remain favorable and the stock remains cheap. Given stable U.S. economic fundamentals and Target's newly developed omni-channel retail presence, this company projects as a stable low single-digit revenue grower and high single-digit profit grower over the next several years. Yet, Target stock trades at just 13x forward earnings. That's too cheap for that level of growth, meaning this rally in Target stock will persist. Ulta (ULTA)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr  Category: Health & Personal Care % Gain Since Dec. 24: 46%Shares of Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) have been on a roller coaster ride over the past several months. In late 2018, Ulta stock dropped nearly 30% in just over a month. In 2019, however, Ulta stock has rebounded by nearly 50% in just over two months.The big selloff in late 2018 was the result of a below-consensus holiday-quarter guide converging on a rich valuation. The big rebound has been the result of the company blowing the lid off that below-consensus guide and reporting very strong holiday-quarter numbers. It also helps that comparable sales growth accelerated, margins expanded and the forward guide was strong -- all against the backdrop of a resurgent U.S. consumer. Now, Ulta stock is now making new highs.Ulta stock will continue to make new highs for the foreseeable future because this company is getting its groove back. New product launches in late 2018 helped reinvigorate comparable sales growth back to the near 10% range. These new product launches will continue to drive healthy customer enthusiasm and traffic gains through 2019. As they do, Ulta's revenues and profits will continue to impress, and Ulta stock will stay on an uptrend. Foot Locker (FL)Source: Shutterstock  Category: Athletic Apparel % Gain Since Dec. 24: 22%Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) stock dropped big in late 2018 amid slowing U.S. economy concerns. But as the U.S. economy has stabilized, Foot Locker stock has rebounded.The rebound in Foot Locker stock has been especially large (over 20% since Christmas Eve) because of a strong holiday-quarter earnings report that underscored healthy operating fundamentals for the company. Comps rose 10%. Margins expanded in a big way. Inventories fell. The guide was healthy. Investors cheered. Foot Locker stock popped.  * 3 Bank Stocks Whacked Down by the Fed In the big picture, Foot Locker's numbers have been getting better for a long time now. Now, they are finally good again, and this tells me that the worst is in the rearview mirror for FL. Going forward, Foot Locker will remain an important and stable player in the athletic-apparel retail landscape. FL's growth profile, coupled with the current 11x forward earnings multiple, should be enough to keep Foot Locker stock on a winning path. Best Buy (BBY)Source: Best Buy  Category: Electronics % Gain Since Dec. 24: 43%In late 2018, there was a rumor flying around that the consumer electronics space was rapidly slowing. Consequently, shares of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) dropped nearly 50% in a matter of three months.That rumor was a bunch of hot air. In early 2019, Best Buy reported strong holiday-quarter numbers that included positive comparable sales growth, big digital sales growth, margin expansion and an above-consensus full-year guide. Those numbers were proof that Best Buy remains the leader in the still-growing consumer electronics space. Consequently, Best Buy stock rallied.Still, Best Buy stock is pretty cheap at just 12x forward earnings. That's too cheap for Best Buy, a company which should report positive comps and healthy margins for the foreseeable future thanks to secular tailwinds (the widespread emergence of IoT and AI technologies). As such, a cheap valuation and favorable growth fundamentals should keep BBY stock on an upward trend for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NKE, HD, TGT, FL, and BBY.

2019-03-25,"After significant hype from the mainstream media, Special Counsel Robert Mueller seemingly appeared on the verge of delivering an indictment on President Donald Trump. Instead, Mueller's report found no evidence tying Trump with Russian conspirators. That news disappointed many on the left, while simultaneously lifting prospects for Dow Jones Industrial Average and its component stocks.Although the Russia investigation, which has long dogged the Trump administration, has no direct impact on the markets, the latest news frees them from unnecessary shackles. With the president now able to concentrate on important matters, he can theoretically resume making America great again.This has positive implications for thorny issues like the U.S.-China trade war. If the White House achieves a breakthrough, we could see several Dow Jones stocks on the rise move even higher. With China harnessing the world's second-biggest economy, Wall Street will appreciate any hint of progress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn addition, Mueller tacitly signed off on two more years of Trump. Again, the majority of Americans probably felt like they got punched in the gut. Still, we do have one bit of universal good news: we know exactly what to expect until November 2020.From a political standpoint, this is huge. Barring unusual circumstances, Trump's contentious policies such as tax or healthcare reform won't be immediately reversed. This continuity is great for the markets as it represents one less variable.  * 7 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy Now So with that in mind, here are five Dow Jones stocks to track on your radar: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: Shutterstock Earlier this year, banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was one of the Dow Jones stocks on the rise. However, that quickly changed this month. Since mid-March, JPM stock has dropped more than 6%. Geopolitical concerns such as icy U.S.-China relations, as well as possible trading-revenue declines have hurt prospects.But despite the troubles, JPM stock has a genuine chance of a Mueller-fueled rally. For one thing, JPMorgan is an economic bellwether: what's good for the nation is usually good for its share price. Moreover, as a banking firm, JPM receives the most benefit from a stable platform.As I alluded to earlier, it's probably not the kind of stability most people sought. Nevertheless, we generally know what to expect: strange tweets, conservative policies, and the constant push to build the wall. This predictability will at least make it easier for management to chart a path forward. Intel (INTC)Source: Shutterstock Most technology firms took a beating in the final quarter of last year, but not Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).No, INTC stock absorbed most of its pain earlier in 2018. Although usually a safe bet, Intel faced many questions regarding production delays over its next-generation chips. Amid fierce competition, many stakeholders simply gave up.Further compounding the issue, the U.S.-China trade war acted as a massive headwind. As our own Dana Blankenhorn noted last year, Intel invested substantially in Chinese infrastructure. Any hit to that region will eventually translate to volatility in INTC stock.  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees But this year, Intel is one of the top Dow Jones stocks on the move. Shares are already up 17% since the January opener. And with Trump no longer dealing with the Mueller investigation, he has time to wheel and deal. Although not a guarantee, INTC suddenly looks like a much-healthier prospect. Merck (MRK)Source: Shutterstock If you're looking for stocks on the rise in the Dow, you really can't go wrong with Merck (NYSE:MRK). Although the company's future is heavily tied to its cancer-fighting drug Keytruda, that hasn't stopped speculators. Indeed, if you bought MRK stock during last year's doldrums, you're living large right now.Better yet, Merck continues to ride its wave of momentum. On a year-to-date basis, MRK stock crossed into double-digit territory. For bullish traders, they don't find this status surprising. Merck maintains an enviable drug pipeline, which includes Januvia and Gardasil. Last year, they rang up $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion in sales, respectively.Plus, President Trump's rants against former President Barack Obama's healthcare policies have previously shaken the Street. Now that the Mueller investigation is out of the way, Trump has less distractions. Hopefully, he'll use this unshackling to promote positive changes for all Americans.And if not, at least we know what we're getting. Home Depot (HD)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Out of all the Dow Jones stocks on the rise, my current favorite is Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Admittedly, HD stock is a bit of a cop-out. As a largely secular company -- a leaking pipe doesn't stop based on economic conditions -- HD is an &quot;everyman&quot; investment. No matter what, you can count on it.But that doesn't mean that Home Depot is immune to good news. Again, while most Americans may have been disappointed with the build-up to the Mueller non-announcement, it's a positive for HD. Primarily, shares do well with a robust housing market. If Trump were indicted, that would create all kinds of havoc on our economy.  * 7 Reasons Why Apple Streaming Won't Move the Needle for Apple Stock At the same time, I like the fact that HD stock is a boring investment. Ultimately, it's very difficult to tell how the Street will respond to the Mueller investigation results. Therefore, sitting on HD and collecting its 2.9% dividend yield isn't a bad approach! Boeing (BA)Source: Shutterstock If you want some spice out of your Dow Jones stocks, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is it. Already under pressure from the Lion Air Flight 610 crash that killed all onboard, Boeing suffered another devastating blow: Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 also went down under similar circumstances. Logically, BA stock tumbled badly in response.Moreover, the pain is far from over. By the looks of it, Boeing will incur significant legal costs. In both crashes, the same airplane -- the 737 Max 8 -- was involved. Additionally, the company's anti-stalling system called MCAS apparently malfunctioned on the doomed flights. If you're heavily vested in BA stock, you may want to protect yourself.But with a newly-energized President, Boeing could get its wings back. That's because Trump is still Trump, and that means more saber-rattling. Such circumstances would lift the company's military and defense divisions, an obvious welcome change.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-26,"The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF  fell 0.5% in afternoon trade Tuesday, in the wake of disappointing housing data, ironically on the same day that a bullish &quot;golden cross&quot; chart pattern is set to appear. Of the ETF&apos;s 35 equity components, 25 were trading lower.

2019-03-27,"Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Vince Martin's pick for the contest is the iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF (BATS:ITB).Heading into 2019, the case for the iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF (BATS:ITB) was reasonably simple. Housing and construction stocks were hammered in 2018. In fact, ITB stock dropped some 31%. While there were concerns -- slowing new construction spending, labor shortages, rising input costs -- the steepness of the decline seemed to be an overreaction.That case is why I chose ITB as my pick for the Best ETF of 2019. So far, the call is working out. ITB stock has gained 16% so far this year -- and risen 25% from late December lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet even with those gains, the core bull case here still holds. Many housing stocks still are cheap. The sector on the whole doesn't seem to be getting enough credit. While the rest of the market signals continuing economic strength, ITB stock still discounts quite a bit of risk. Particularly for investors who believe the market, and the economy, will stay healthy going forward, ITB remains an attractive choice. The iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF in 2019Again, ITB has performed well so far this year. But in context, the 16% gains so far this year perhaps aren't that impressive. The S&P 500 index has gained almost 12%, meaning housing and construction stocks have only modestly beaten the market so far in 2019.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend That gap actually is narrower than a housing bull might have expected. After all, the divergence in 2018 was much sharper: ITB dropped a whopping 31% against just a 6% decline in the index. Going back to the beginning of 2018, ITB has declined 13%, and the S&P 500 has risen nearly 5%.The question at the moment is whether that gap should persist or narrow. Skeptics might point to slower new home sales, in particular, as a reason for caution. Whether it's demand for rentals among younger customers or a literal lack of land in popular markets like Denver and Seattle, housing simply is a tougher industry than most right now. ITB's five largest holdings are homebuilders, with Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) alone comprising 27.3% of the fund.But homebuilder stocks actually have done quite well this year: LEN has gained 25% and DHI 21%. And yet the group remains cheap, with those stocks generally trading at a single-digit multiple to earnings. The rest of the fund, meanwhile, has a potential catalyst as 2019 rolls on. Will Smaller Positions Boost ITB Stock?Even with homebuilders doing better, building suppliers and retailers are performing mostly in line with the market. Home Depot (NYSE:HD), for instance, has modestly underperformed the market. So has The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), the fund's eighth-largest holding.The case for ITB was that even if new home sales stayed soft, a strong economy would lift renovation and remodeling spending. Yet it has been ITB's exposure to new construction, not R&R, that has driven a majority of its gains so far.Over the rest of 2019, then, there's a clear path for ITB to continue to rise. Economic strength should increase confidence toward renovation and remodeling, providing another driver for the fund's holdings.In that context, the bull case here seems largely intact. Even with a strong start to the year, construction stocks still are lagging the market over a broader timeframe. That leaves room for ITB to continue to outperform in coming quarters. And if new home sales numbers can strengthen, the ETF could skyrocket.ITB does require the U.S. economy to stay strong, and any macro weakness is the biggest risk to the thesis. But for investors projecting that strength will continue, ITB remains a solid choice for market-beating returns.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-28,"Shares of consumer discretionary stocks and home builder (and related) stocks have done well so far this year and are increasingly acting as if more upside is to come. What do those two groups of stocks have in common you ask? A stock like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is both in the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 but also closely tied to home building stocks when it comes to many ETFs. I like HD stock higher here.Most things in finance worth paying attention to happen at the margin and in relative terms. As it relates to the stock market what makes me sit up and take notice is when a sector, group of stocks or even an individual stock flashes notable relative and absolute strength or weakness.

While ultimately this up-trend could change, from a trading perspective through the lens of a few weeks to a couple or months or so, I want to still respect it.  Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 dayOn the daily chart, we see that HD stock's sharp January-February rally took a much needed breather in March. During that consolidation phase, the stock pulled back to a confluence support area made up of the blue 100 day simple moving average as well as the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the December 2018 lows up to the February highs.Over the past few trading sessions HD stock along with a slew of home builder stocks began to lift again. HD stock for its part is now fighting with its red 200 day moving average, which currently roughly lines up with the stock's February highs.In my eyes, HD stock's path of least resistance in the near term is higher, toward the round $200 price target. Any sharp bearish reversal lasting on a weekly closing basis below the $182 area would be a stop loss signal.While one could consider buying HD stock here based on the above analysis, my preferred way to express a quasi bullish view in said stock now is with a specific options strategy that also allows be to generate income.On Friday, I am holding a special webinar for InvestorPlace readers where I will explain this strategy in detail.

2019-04-03,"Dividends are a precious perk.Research over the past few years from FactSet, Ned Davis Research and River Road Asset Management, among others, has illustrated the long-term benefits of owning dividend stocks versus their non-paying peers. A 2019 Hartford Funds study showed that $10,000 invested in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 1960 would have generated $460,095 excluding the effect of dividends ... but $2,571,920 once dividends were reinvested.No wonder, then, that dividend stocks are a favorite holding of numerous &quot;smart money&quot; investors. Even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - which famously does not pay a dividend because Buffett believes he can allocate profits in better ways - has depended on numerous income-generating stocks for its long-term market outperformance.Hedge funds are no different. According to WalletHub data gathered from regulatory filings, more than two-thirds of the most popular holdings among hedge-fund managers offer up some sort of dividend, and the majority of those out-yield the market. These stocks provide defense in market downturns, and compounding dividends over time contribute to long-term returns.Here are a dozen dividend stocks that are popular among hedge funds.

2019-04-05,"It would appear foolish to argue against Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Home Depot clearly is one of the best retailers in the world - and the dominant force in U.S. home improvement. Annual revenue recently eclipsed $100 billion. And HD stock has been a star performer since the financial crisis: Home Depot stock has gained over 400% since late 2011.Source: Shutterstock But I've argued for close to eighteen months now that HD stock is too expensive, as I wrote in December 2017. The stock admittedly has gained about 6% since then, and paid another 3%+ in dividends. But that performance has been worse than that of the market as a whole and includes a 15% gain so far this year.Indeed, looking at the chart, Home Depot stock seems to have a clear path toward retaking all-time highs, reached last September, of $215. But looking at the business, there are concerns here. The housing market isn't exactly strong. The economy is in year ten of an expansion, which may reverse. Home Depot's top competitor is retooling, and Home Depot stock isn't exactly cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio To be sure, Home Depot is a wonderful company; that's not in dispute. The question is at what price investors should be willing to invest in that wonderful company. HD Stock Underperforms?Like a number of housing stocks, HD stock has benefited from the reversal in market sentiment in 2019. The reversal isn't necessarily surprising: in December, I called out the iShares US Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) as my choice for the Best ETF of 2019.Home Depot stock is a significant holding of that ETF, though the two largest positions are homebuilders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI).And in fact, the ETF has outperformed HD stock, returning 19% YTD. As I wrote in December, the problem for trying to time the lows in Home Depot stock was that other housing plays looked much more attractive.That's been the case so far this year, and it's still the case. LEN and DHI still trade a single-digit multiples to earnings per share. Construction suppliers like American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) and Jeld-Wen (NYSE:JELD) have rebounded this year - but remain cheap, and well off 2018 highs.The issue with HD stock thus remains. To own it, an investor has to have some faith in the mid-term housing market (and the economy) staying strong enough to drive renovation spending. If the market does stay strong, however, there are better choices out there. If it doesn't, investors won't keep paying nearly 20x earnings for a cyclical retailer like Home Depot. Home Depot Stock Has Stalled out BeforeMeanwhile, it might seem like HD stock simply outperforms the market no matter what. Over time, that has been true. But HD also has had long periods of not just underperformance but negative performance.Between the beginning of 2000 and the beginning of 2010, a ten-year stretch, Home Depot stock lost nearly half its value. Obviously, there's some cherry-picking there: the start of the decade saw the dot-com boom (which boosted stocks outside of tech) and the end of the decade came just months after the worst moments of the financial crisis. Still, for about twelve years, HD stock was dead money.That's not to say that HD is going to lose half of its value this decade or even that it will stall out for the next few years. Rather, the point is that valuation and timing matter, even for a quality company. That's doubly true for a cyclical play like Home Depot.And at this point in the cycle, almost 20x earnings simply isn't cheap. In fact, the stock is just a few dollars from the average analyst target price. That's exactly where it sat in late 2017. A year later, HD was down 15%. Is Lowe's on the Way?In addition, Home Depot's biggest competitor, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), is affecting a turnaround. And as James Brumley wrote last month, Lowe's &quot;is finally starting to close the gap&quot;.It's not quite a zero-sum game between Home Depot and Lowe's. Better sales at Lowe's may not come from its larger rival, but from independent stores and those that operate under the Ace Hardware and True Value banners.Still, a stronger Lowe's means tougher competition for Home Depot. And with investors expecting 4-6% same-store sales growth going forward, and the stock not cheap (again, due to cyclical exposure), it doesn't take much to change the narrative here. Be Careful with HDNone of this is to say that Home Depot is a short. But, at these prices, it's not a slam dunk, either. Any housing hiccups could end the recent rally. Macro concerns tanked the stock in the fourth quarter, and may return again soon. If the external environment stays benign, investors might benefit more from other housing plays.It does seem from my perspective like the rally is due to stall out. There's at least a case for taking profits - or hoping for a better price.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Lower Interest Rates Make it Easier to Buy a HomeThe dramatic decline in longer-term interest rates -- like the 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) -- has pulled 30-year mortgage rates down too, and that is great news for the housing sector. The cheaper mortgage rates are, the easier it is for home buyers to qualify for new mortgages and for existing home owners to refinance their older, higher-interest mortgages.Many of those people who are moving into new homes, or are pulling equity out of their current homes, are going to make their way to Home Depot to buy paint, tools and other supplies to fix up their homes. This increase in spending should drive the company's revenues higher.

2019-04-17,"For those investors in retirement, it all comes down to income. How can you convert your lifetime of savings into a steady stream of paychecks? There's plenty of ways to do that. But one of the best continues to dividend stocks. After all, dividend stocks generally offer higher yields than bonds and give you the ability to see your income rise through increasing dividend payouts as well as grow thanks to capital appreciation. Bonds, CDs, and other traditional fixed income products can't do that.The only problem is, not all dividend stocks are worthy for retirees.Those investors in retirement can't afford to see their payouts get cut or see their capital go up in flames. There's simply not enough time to recoup losses or balance out volatility. To this end, it takes a certain variety of dividend stocks to get you through your golden years. A focus on quality is key.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Which dividend stocks make the grade for retirement? Here are five dividends stocks that are perfect for retirement portfolios. Snap-on (SNA)Source: Snap-On via Wikimedia (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.43%Selling screwdrivers, wrenches and other hand tools may not seem that exciting, but this niche has helped make Snap-On Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) one of the best dividend stocks around.SNA manufactures a variety of tools, equipment, and repair information systems for various industrial markets. Many professional mechanics and assembly workers swear by Snap-on's better-made products. And with a simple socket wrench set costing north of $300, SNA isn't exactly going after DIY and weekend warriors here. You need high-performance when you're fixing a bullet train or repairing a wind turbine.This focus on the industrial market has widely insulated SNA from the whims of the consumer market. Because of this, SNA has paid dividends without interruptions or reductions since 1939. Its last increase was a strong 15.85% jump.Part of that jump comes from the reduction in corporate taxes. The other continues to be Snap-On's moves into higher-margined tech products. Modern machinery is chock-full of computers and sensors. SNA is quickly becoming the standard provider for computer-based diagnostics equipment. This has provided a supercharger to its earnings in recent years. EPS surged 12.6% year-over-year in 2018.All in all, Snap-On's continued leadership position in its niche market continues to pay benefits. That makes it one of the best dividend stocks for retirees. Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.25%Admittingly, the headline yield on Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) isn't much to write home about. BDX's current yield of 1.25% is about what you can earn from a savings account these days. However, the story at the medical device maker is one of payout growth. This why retirees should include BDX in their portfolio of dividend stocks.BDX is one of the world's largest producers of needles, syringes, and other sharps-related devices. This catalog of products spans everything from &quot;basics&quot; like insulin needles and catheters to more advanced regional anesthesia and drug delivery products. The beauty is that the bulk of these items are designed to be single use. That means your doctor and hospital has to come back every month to get more of them. Becton's integration of rival Bard has only expanded on this catalog as well.This, plus moves into life science products and more high-tech drug delivery medical devices, has continued to make BDX a cash flow machine. The firm has used that cash flow to reward shareholders by paying down the debt used to buy Bard as well as increase its dividend and conduct buybacks. Over the last decade, Becton has managed to double its dividend based on its strong cash flows. Given its strengths, there's a good chance that BDX will keep that streak going.  * 5 Wonderful REITs to Buy Today For retirees, BDX stock offers a chance to grow their income over the long haul. Home Depot Inc. (HD)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.66%It's no secret that retail has been a blood bath. Online shopping has continued to hit many traditional brick and mortar retailers hard. Empty storefronts and dead shopping malls are quickly becoming the norm. But just don't tell that to Home Depot (NYSE:HD). The home improvement retailer is killing it and has proved that its a top dividend stock. Retirees should take notice.Much of HD's recent success comes from its moves into omnichannel retailing. Consumers these days what to buy products when and how they what them. They want them in-store, online, via mobile apps, etc. Home Depot seems to have cracked the code. Spending on technology and beefing-up its operations have worked and customers keep hitting up HD for their home improvement needs. Sales grew nearly 11% last quarter to reach a whopping $26.5 billion based on its omnichannel moves.HD has clearly gotten the message about the changing face of retail.Keeping that going into the future and helping pad its dividend is that HD has also figured out how to attract Millennial and younger customers. Thanks to new classes, videos, and DIY help, Home Depot has continued to attract the customers of tomorrow. That's a demographic that many other retailers are struggling to court.With its strong growth, HD recently was able to increase its dividend by 32% and conduct more than $15 billion in buybacks. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.25%Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is proving that old school tech can still be a fertile ground for finding dividend stocks -- especially those for retirees. The key has been CEO's Satya Nadella vision to transform Mr. Softy into a software as a service (SaaS) company and reap plenty of reoccurring/subscription revenues.Today, the cloud rules the roost at MSFT. Microsoft's Azure and Dynamics 365 platforms are quickly becoming the standards for many enterprise customers. Growing by double-digits, MSFT has been able to reap plenty of earnings/cash flows from its new cloud model. Better still, is that MSFT has been able to turn that cloud model toward regular Joes as well. Office 365, as well as its Xbox gaming/entertainment units, are also seeing plenty of growth. Total revenues for MSFT jumped by 12% last quarter on the strength of its cloud operations.All of this continues to translate into plenty of profits and growing cash balance.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm And MSFT continues to share those profits with investors. Since 2010, the tech firm has managed to grow its payout by over 253%. That's very impressive. And given its huge cash balance, strong cash flows and high margins, there's a good chance that Microsoft will keep that streak going. For retirees, that makes MSFT one of the best dividend stocks to own for the long haul. Realty Income (O)Dividend Yield: 3.80%When your corporate tag line is the &quot;Monthly Dividend Company,&quot; there's a lot of pressure to keep to live up to that promise. Luckily for Realty Income (NYSE:O) it has been able to keep that promise for over 584 consecutive months.That steadfastness of payouts comes from Realty Income's business model. O is one of the largest owners of freestanding real estate in the country -- with more than 5.700 different properties under its wing. Freestanding real state includes everything from convenience stores and restaurants to movie theaters, and automotive parts/services centers. It's the standard fare that dots our suburban landscape. With nearly 500 different tenants and its huge swath of property, O provides unmatched diversification.As if O couldn't get any better, the vast bulk of these properties are so-called triple-net leased. This means the tenants are responsible for taxes, maintenance and other costs related to the property. This allows Realty Income to keep more of its rent checks.Well, not keep. O has been rewarding shareholders for decades. It's latest increase represents its 101st monthly jump to its payout. This follows its 100th increase back in January. A monthly check that keeps growing? If that's not the perfect stock for a retiree, then I don't know what is.With a 3,8% yield, conservative balance sheet and monthly payouts, Realty Income could be a perfect dividend stock for a retirement portfolio.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

2019-04-18,"For Vivint Solar (NASDAQ:VSLR), the bull case seems easy to make. VSLR stock isn't cheap on an earnings basis, but it's not supposed to be, at least not yet.Vivint Solar's residential installations will take time to bear fruit. However, management's estimate of future profits suggests that VSLR stock can rise meaningfully from its current share price of $5.45. Meanwhile, solar demand is only likely to rise going forward, suggesting VSLR should have substantive upside potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the bear case on Vivint Solar stock seems reasonably easy to make as well. Historically, the solar industry has been a black hole for investors. Plus, the company's costs are rising, and profitability appears a long way off.  * 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally VSLR stock doesn't look like it's worth the risk. But investors more optimistic on solar might see things differently. Reasons to Buy VSLR StockThere are several reasons to strongly consider Vivint Solar stock. Near-term earnings don't look all that impressive: adjusted net loss per share in 2018 was $2.38, notably worse than 2017's $1.58. But those figures include huge losses attributable to non-controlling interests i.e., the funds investing in Vivint Solar's investment credits.After backing out those losses, VSLR is close to profitable. And analysts, on average, are expecting the company to become profitable within the next two years.But the long-term nature of Vivint Solar's contracts means the company is trading near-term profits (and cash flow) for out-year benefits. The company's measure of &quot;net retained value per share&quot; estimates the total value of existing assets, less debt. That figure continues to rise, climbing from $6.61 at the end of 2016 to a current $9.20.Investors should be somewhat skeptical about that figure. Companies generally will have a more positive view toward their own futures, after all. But even a discount from the $9-plus figure still suggests that VSLR stock is reasonably priced, if not cheap, around $5. Meanwhile, the net-retained-value figure should grow over time as solar demand continues, spurred in part by regulations in California and elsewhere.While VSLR's demand should rise, competition may not do the same. Vivint Solar remains behind Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) in terms of total installations. But it does seem like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unit SolarCity is fading as a competitor. Per Tesla's 10-K filings, SolarCity deployed 523 megawatts of solar energy generation in 2017, and just 326 MW last year. In contrast, Vivint's installations rose, showing notable strength in the second half of the year. The Case for VSLRThere's a lot to like about VSLR stock. The industry is growing. Market share gains could be on the way. SolarCity is scuffling, and Vivint has partnered with Home Depot (NYSE:HD), after Tesla walked away from its deal with the home-improvement retailer last year.VSLR's earnings should improve in the near-term. Debt might be a concern, with the long-term total at $1.2 billion. But Vivint has proven able to refinance by securitizing existing installations. This includes the largest ever such deal, which closed in June.So Vivint should be able to grow its business. It should be able to finance that business. The numbers can be confusing, owing to the different financing deals. Plus, there's the fact that 20-year leases may not be profitable for some time to come. Still, the numbers seem to work and, if solar growth accelerates, so too should Vivint Solar stock. The Risks Facing VSLR StockAt the same time, Vivint Solar stock seems like anything but a slam dunk. The solar sector has been around for a century. Despite this, the number of solar companies that have made consistent profits for investors seems close to zero. VSLR itself trades well below its highs from earlier this decade. It originally planned to sell itself to SunEdison, but canceled the deal; SunEdison headed into bankruptcy not long after.RUN did hit an all-time high earlier this year. Solar cell manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) traded sideways in recent years. But overall, this has been a difficult sector, with tariffs and subsidies leading to pricing volatility. This dynamic created problems for manufacturers and installers alike.In that context, there's an obvious question as to whether Vivint Solar's model is just too tough. Its business is, and will remain, labor-intensive. Financing depends on investors' willingness to buy into securitizations at low interest rates.Interest rates have stayed low this decade, but they may not do so forever. Change the discount rate on future cash flows that VSLR uses to calculate net retained value per share from 6% to 8%. When you do that, the net retained value per share of VSLR stock drops to $6. That's a much lower margin of safety and suggests smaller potential gains from these shares.Low natural gas prices are an issue, as they affect energy rates and could potentially impact the pricing advantage of installed solar. Tesla's solar roof may not materialize any time soon, but other companies are looking to build similar models. Naturally, this could undercut the need for Vivint Solar's systems. Battery storage is another key potential growth catalyst for VSLR stock, but Vivint's partnership with Mercedes-Benz has fallen through, leaving the company potentially behind on that front. $5 Is Cheap, But VSLR's Road May Be Too ToughSince plunging after the SunEdison deal fell through, VSLR stock actually has been a reasonably good investment. It's possible that industry strength and continued retained-value growth will keep that trend intact.But there are an awful lot of obstacles in the company's path as well. VSLR can move quickly in either direction, based on external worries. New tariffs from China could spike the cost of solar panels, making the business model unprofitable, or close to it. Regulations can change. Subsidies can be added or withdrawn. There are myriad factors beyond Vivint Solar's control which can affect Vivint Solar stock.Investors who believe in solar and are willing to take on the risks of VSLR very well might see rewards. But the industry's track record and installation-space uncertainty make me believe that VSLR's road is a little too tough. At the end of the day, this is a low-margin and capital-intensive business. That's a difficult way to make money in any industry.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-23,"CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is an organization that should do well in any part of the economic cycle, since we all need medicine and healthcare products from time to time. So on paper,  CVS stock  has similar characteristics to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrBut unlike those latter names, CVS and other retail pharmacy stocks have not done well over the past few years. Since August 2015, CVS has dropped over 50%. Even worse, the owners of CVS stock have nothing on the horizon to cheer about, and CVS has tumbled 20% since January.Confronting retail pharmacy stocks, including CVS, is a double whammy of potentially crippling headwinds. First, the retail pharmacy giant must address political and public anger against rising healthcare costs. After embarrassing controversies such as the &quot;pharma bro&quot; scandal, the American electorate will make this a pivotal issue next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Not only that, but political momentum appears to be moving further against retail pharmacy stocks. That's  troubling for the owners of CVS stock.  Specifically, popular presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders have supported initiatives like the &quot;Medicare for All Act.&quot; Rising stars like Democratic and economic firebrand Andrew Yang are guaranteed to make &quot;Medicare for All&quot; a political talking point.That is already a huge problem for retail pharmacy stocks. But the other dark cloud impacting CVS stock is competition. I'm not just talking about individual players in a hurting sector cutting each others' throats. Rather, I'm calling out the giant gorilla in the room: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).I love Amazon because it's an unrivaled American success story. But let's also be honest: Amazon's success has come at the expense of other American businesses. Now that AMZN has its eyes on retail pharmacy, it's no wonder why CVS stock is so volatile. Threats Rattle CVS, But They Won't Be FatalNo matter how you look at it, CVS stock is incredibly risky. Unfortunately, recent developments have put more pressure on CVS. But as bad as things have gotten, the headwinds facing CVS stock are not completely devastating.While the political noose appears to be tightening its grip on CVS, this dynamic also offers opportunity. Sure, CVS and other pharmacy stocks probably won't benefit anymore from overpriced prescription medicine. However, if the Democrats take over the White House next year - and that's a real possibility - millions of underserved Americans will have access to quality healthcare insurance.These Democratic policies will cause many Americans who are buying drugs in foreign countries to obtain them in the U.S. instead.Earlier this year, NPR highlighted the case of Michelle Fenner. Doctors diagnosed her son with Type 1 diabetes almost a decade ago, meaning he requires daily insulin shots to live. Last year,  a three-month supply of insulin rose to $3,700.In Tijuana, Mexico, however, Fenner only has to pay an amazingly low $600. Such extraordinary discounts have inspired up to 320,000 Americans to travel abroad for healthcare reasons each year. Therefore, cost-cutting measures may initially hurt the profit margins of retail pharmacy stocks. But at the same time, the retailers would also capture revenue that previously went to foreign countries.That's not all. According to Harvard Health Publishing, millions of Americans skimp on medication because of their exorbitant costs. Again, a cap on costs would initially hurt the profit margins of pharmaceutical retailers. But in the long run, pharmacy retailers will obtain revenue from new sources, boosting CVS stock. Amazon Can't Quite Disrupt CVSAs I mentioned earlier, disruptive competition presents a serious threat to CVS stock. Amazon succeeded in disrupting multiple retail segments. Therefore, it's only natural to assume that AMZN will also cripple CVS.However, pharmacy retail is unlike other retail categories because consumers often need their medication right way. For instance, if someone has an especially explosive case of diarrhea, he's not going to wait three to five business days for a treatment to be shipped to him. Instead, he needs relief right away.As a result, I think Amazon's overall impact on pharmacies will be similar to its impact on the home-improvement sector. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) must contend with competition from the e-commerce giant. However, traditional brick-and-mortar locations serve consumers looking for home-improvement products well. They get what they want, when they want it. That attribute is much more important for people who need drugs.Having said all that, I'm not entirely gung-ho on CVS stock. The underlying company has a huge debt load. Moreover, it has struggled to adapt to its industry's changing landscape.But it's also very possible that, in the wake of the decline of CVS stock, the bad news is already reflected in the shares. Once investors realize that the bad news isn't all that terrible, CVS could rally, at least for awhile.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-23,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips In 1979 Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman made a then controversial statement He said in an interview that regulators should allow Sears OTCMKTS SHLDQ to buy Kmart In the late 1970s Sears,Do Not Expect the Lawsuit Against Lampert to Save Sears Stock
2019-04-23,"In 1979, Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman made a then-controversial statement. He said in an interview that regulators should allow Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) to buy Kmart. In the late 1970s, Sears had accounted for about 1% of GDP and faced a rising competitive threat from Kmart. At the time, regulators would have likely not allowed Sears stock to take such a dominant position.Source: Shutterstock By the time Dr. Friedman died in 2006, competitive forces and attitudes had changed, Sears and Kmart had, in fact, become one. Emerging companies such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had long-since supplanted the dominance of Sears and Kmart, and the long death spiral in Sears stock had begun.Today, as both Sears and Kmart fight for survival, they have now sued former chairman, Eddie Lampert for looting the company and leaving it no other option besides bankruptcy. Many possible outcomes exist for this lawsuit, which includes Lampert's ESL investment and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former ESL director. However, finding a result that will save Sears stock appears much less likely.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sears Trades as a Penny Stock As It Sues Its Former ChairmanLampert's actions might justify such a lawsuit. In February, Mr. Lampert bought most of the company's remaining assets for $4 billion. This left Sears stock holding billions in debt. Now, it seeks to reorganize with an estimated 425 stores. Unfortunately, it will do so without the Kenmore and DieHard brands that Lampert bought in February. It will also move forward without the iconic Craftsman brand that Lampert sold to Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK).  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt However, the question investors need to ask is how winning a lawsuit against Lampert will help Sears stock. Admittedly, those who have gambling money could make a profit. Traders who bought at the 12-cent-per-share low of last December have earned a return of about sixfold. However, the stock has also lost around 80% of its value from year-ago levels.Even worse, the company appears irreparably damaged. Thanks to the bankruptcy, Sears stock now trades on the pink sheets as SHLDQ. Even worse, what remains of the business will have to move forward with only its name to bolster the company. Also, even if it wins some of its brands back from Lampert, the company holds no obvious competitive advantage. The Future of SearsWhile Sears may have served consumers well in the 20th century, it remains unclear what Sears offers today's retail world. Sears plans to open small-format stores called Sears Home & Life. These stores will sell &quot;hardline&quot; items such as tools, lawn and garden equipment, appliances, and mattresses. In the old Sears, hardline items had long outsold &quot;softlines&quot; such as clothing.Still, as mentioned earlier, the company has lost the well-regarded brands it used to control. Today, we can now see how its catalog business served as a precursor to e-commerce. However, the company stopped publishing the catalog in 1993, the year before Jeff Bezos founded Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, despite the strength of Sears in hardline items, consumers have grown accustomed to buying those items elsewhere. Given these challenges, earning long-term profits in Sears stock remains difficult even at its depressed share price. The Bottom Line on Sears StockNeither suing its former chairman nor the move toward hardlines gives Sears stock much of a chance of re-emerging. Sears may have a strong case against Mr. Lampert and ESL. However, even if the lawsuit succeeds, Sears must again make itself a destination store, this time without the brands which bolstered the company in the 20th century.Unfortunately, it appears the retail world has moved on from Sears. Yes, it is possible to place one's gambling money in Sears stock and earn a massive payoff in a revitalized Sears. However, if we apply the lessons from the Milton Friedman interview, it is also possible that a merger of Amazon and Walmart could also happen someday. Such is the power of the market forces in retail that Dr. Friedman understood during his lifetime.  * 5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: TSLA, TWTR, TTD, O While knowing the past can benefit investors, it is still the future that drives returns. SHLDQ will struggle to become part of that future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-05-08,"Getting America's favorite value investor's stamp of approval is always a huge win for any stock. That's just what happened over the weekend when Warren Buffet announced that Berkshire had taken a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As awesome as this news is in underscoring Amazon stock as still valuable, it really wasn't the only or biggest piece of news for the firm last week.Source: Shutterstock Just as with CEO Jeff Bezos' divorce news, the Buffett news is overshadowing a potential game-changer for Amazon and its rivals. Amazon is unveiling one-day delivery for its Prime members.This is a huge development for Amazon and culminates the work of roughly four years' worth build-out. And every other retailer should be scared at the announcement. For AMZN stockholders, it's the real reason to be excited this past weekend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon Stock and the New NormalThe problem with online shopping is shipping time. Waiting to get your purchased items has long been the thorn in many retailer's sides. Consumers want their goods and they want them now. Amazon changed the ecommerce game a few years ago when it rolled-out two-day shipping for its Prime members. By doing this, AMZN upped the expectations for online shopping in a big way. This forced many other physical retailers to play catch-up.And those retailers with wide networks certainly did. Giants like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have been able to use their distribution channels to also offer two-day shipping as well as offering new omnichannel solutions. Blending online, physical stores and the ability to pick-up items in store after a mobile/web purchase has become the norm. For those retailers without this ability, it's meant lost sales and plenty of bankruptcies.The problem for these omnichannel solutions is that you still need to physically leave your house and get your items. That's one of the real benefits of online shopping. There is no fighting the Black Friday crowds and the 100% knowledge that your items are in stock. Which is why Amazon's latest news is a mega-sized game changer for the retail sector.After spending billions to beef up its network of distribution assets, Amazon announced that one-day shipping is here for its Prime Members. According to RBC Capital Markets, Amazon already can already offer same-day and next-day delivery to roughly 72% of the households in the U.S. It can do so for 95% of the 16 wealthiest and most populated states/cities. In order to make a reality for the rest of the country, Amazon will need to spend about $800 million this year on adding some additional capacity in its logistics network. But that expense will be more than worth it. Amazon and the One Day WinThe problem even with two-day shipping is that critical items or other must-haves still take time to get to your home. One-day and same-day Prime Now shipping options basically eliminates the need to go to a physical store in order to purchase goods.You really can buy your toothpaste and it'll be at your door pretty much instantly. According to Amazon, the new one-day shipping will be available on about 100 million items. This includes plenty Amazon private label brands.Moreover, one-day shipping could a major future revenue driver for Amazon stock. The firm has about 103 million Prime members and these members spend big. Prime members buy an average of $1,400 per year worth of goods and services on Amazon. On the other hand, regular customers only spend about $600. Same-day shipping will be a big driver to get more people to sign-up for Prime memberships. And once you're in the Amazon system, you get hooked pretty fast.At the same time, next-day shipping could be the push that gets Prime members to spend even more as time-sensitive purchases are now within grasp for the retailer. There's almost no need to go to other brick-and-mortar retailers. You can quickly tell Alexa to just buy it on your way home from work. All of this means more profits coming Amazon's way over the future. The Bottom Line on Amazon StockJust like its two-day shipping news a few years ago, one/same-day shipping is going to shake-up the retail sector. While larger firms like Walmart, Target and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) will be able to compete and use their vast systems to offer similar services, many smaller retailers are going to be toast.For many consumers, there really isn't much of a reason to shop anywhere else. Once you're in Amazon's system and a Prime member, you can now just shop there for pretty much everything.Over the longer haul, this will only help strengthen Amazon's grip on the sector, boost its revenues and ultimately, its profits. And yes, it will have to spend some cash to get to 100%, the price is really a small one considering the longer-term win.For investors, including now the Oracle of Omaha, Amazon continues to change the game in the sector. Amazon stock continues to be a major buy as it dominates and because the only retailer you'll ever need.Disclosure: At the time of writing, author Aaron Levitt was long AMZN.

2019-05-13,"Every quarter over the last few years seems to be a make it or break announcement for those stocks in the retail sector. This includes retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Source: Shutterstock So far, Walmart stock has been moving successfully in the new retail paradigm. Walmart has acted quickly to improve both its online sales and in-store experience. This focus on omnichannel has continued to pay benefits. Sales are rising and it has begun to take back some much-needed market share from rivals.But as rivals have acted equally as quick, Walmart finds itself once again back in &quot;show me&quot; mode. With earnings for the firm later this week, e-commerce and the growth of omnichannel sales will be the only thing that matters. And there's a good chance that WMT stock may just deliver on that front.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Walmart Faces Its Threat Head-OnRetail has long been a cut-throat business. But, unless you've been living under a rock, the sector has gotten even more violent over the last few years. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been clearly doing the most damage. Thanks to AMZN, traditional retailers have been forced to move outside their comfort zones and spend heavily to compete. Walmart has taken this task head on with gusto.Over the last few quarters, WMT has unveiled a variety of new apps, commenced on a variety of logistics upgrades, beefed-up omnichannel operations and underwent a massive buying spree of several major e-commerce properties. This included low-price algorithm-heavy Jet.com and Millennial favorites Moosejaw and Bonobos as well as more recently Art.com and lingerie retailer Bare Necessities.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever By in large, these efforts have continued to work for Walmart and have resulted in some torrid growth.Last quarter, Walmart reported a huge 43% jump to its online sales. This follows a 33% jump in the previous quarter. For the full year, WMT achieved its target e-commerce sales growth of 40%. That's really impressive for such a large firm like Walmart. After all, it pulled in more than $138 billion in total sales last quarter.With the firm reporting later this week, investors will be looking to see if the moves are continuing to pay off. Not only with actual growth, but with profits as well. Online Sales and A Bit More for WalmartOne of the problems for Walmart and other rivals like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) trying to compete in the blurred online/in-store world is that it takes a pretty hefty penny to do. Last year, WMT spent over $10 billion in upgrading its business model to better compete against AMZN and the like. It plans on spending more than $11 billion this year on store/e-commerce CAPEX … with the bulk going toward omnichannel and adding more products to its online operations.Clearly, these efforts are working in that they are generating sales. The question is, are they generating actual profits? This problem is something that is plaguing many retailers as they spend heavily. Walmart has acknowledged the issue last quarter when overall sales grew by just 4.1%, but operating income grew by barely 2%. Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said that investors should &quot;expect our losses in e-commerce to increase in fiscal 2020.&quot; Because of rising costs, executives at the retailer actually expect operating income to sink by about 3% year-over-year this quarter.While investors have been warned that losses will continue, any surprises here may not be good enough and eventually, investors will be looking for some actual bottom of the line results from Walmart. You can only grow sales so far before investors start looking for more. Specifically, investors are going to be looking at what WMT is doing to improve its profitability online. Shifts to higher margined items and upselling of add-ons will be critical this quarter. That's where the focus should be for those thinking about adding WMT stock. Just how is the retailer going to right the ship?  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%  Walmart Faces a Lot of PressuresAfter two years of rising e-commerce growth, this quarter, Walmart is under a lot of pressure to get it right. With its results, investors are going to want to have their cake and eat it too. The firm will need to deliver on not only rising online sales but start to make those sales/spending count in the profitability column. To be honest that might not be possible in the short run.Even Amazon isn't necessarily profitable in its retail operations all the time. It's the other stuff -- AWS, ad sales and services -- that generate AMZN's gains. Likewise, margins remain small on Home Depot's successful online operations.But for patient investors, the longer term is rosy and any mishaps here could provide a great opportunity. These efforts will eventually pay off through gains in market share. And if anybody can profit from low margins, it has to be the low-margin king. The key is to focus on what WMT is saying about its moves, not so much the actual headline number. If investors react poorly to the headlines, it could be a chance to snag Walmart stock for the long haul.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt was long AMZN stock.

2019-05-31,"Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) are under pressure after the company reported fiscal third-quarter results. Costco stock is down marginally -- just 2%, despite many investors worrying about a host of issues. Will retail sales start to come under pressure, broadly speaking? How will Costco handle the trade war and constant increase in tariffs?Source: Shutterstock That said, Costco did beat earnings expectations with $1.89 per share in profits. That came in six cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of ~$34.7 billion also topped analysts' expectations. E-commerce sales flew higher by almost 20% and same-store sales jumped 5.6%, with the latter again beating estimates.Given the move we're seeing in the stock market -- with the S&P 500 down about 1% -- after President Trump tweeted about hitting Mexico with monthly tariff increases, it's surprising COST stock is only off ~1.7%. Of course, those losses could be exacerbated throughout the session, but will these tariffs impact Costco even more?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Costco vs. TariffsThe company is already being impacted by the tariffs that the White House is levying against China. Obviously, Costco is far from alone. I've listened to quite a few conference calls over the past week from retail. The trade war and/or tariffs are something we're hearing from a lot of companies.  * Ranking the Top 10 Stock Buybacks of Last Year PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) said tariffs are hurting the consumer. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) warned investors that it's &quot;working through&quot; the recent tariffs and hasn't included their impact in the guidance. Luckily, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) moved most of its supply chain away from China, helping it to sidestep much of the current tariffs. Shares were rewarded with a 7% post-earnings rally as a result.Perhaps that will be the blueprint for Costco and other retailers. Costco said it will look to source its products from other countries when it can. When it can't, price hikes are on the table.The situation is &quot;pretty fluid,&quot; CFO Richard Galanti said on the conference call. Costco is getting its products shipped sooner in the hopes of missing the latest round of tariff increases. But that's only a short-term answer, not a long-term solution. Realistically, the company can only shift its sourcing so much without causing too much of a disruption. &quot;At the end of the day, prices will go up on things,&quot; Galanti said.Of course, the move against Mexico was not accounted for by Costco management. At least when it came the recent report. One might assume Costco gets more product from China than it does from Mexico, but either way, the move is creating a multi-headed issue that management will have to combat. Shifting supply chains from Mexico may be just as hard, if not harder, and that may mean more price hikes. That may not be good for revenue. Trading Costco Stock PriceSo far, Costco stock price is holding up pretty well to earnings and amid the broader market selloff. But there's a worry that the tariffs could start hurting COST stock going forward. Earlier this month, I outlined a few &quot;pullback levels&quot; that Costco stock would look interesting at. Some investors balked, saying COST is a blue-chip retailer that deserves a premium. I love Costco and don't disagree. But that doesn't mean we can't wait (and hope) for lower prices.Ahead of earnings, the stock lost its 50-day moving average and couldn't reclaim it. Short of a Friday reversal and rally, Costco stock could very well end May at its monthly lows. If it does, it increases the odds of lower prices. Particularly if the stock market selloff accelerates.Should Costco stock close below $241.80 on Friday, it will lose its 10-week moving average. It opens up COST stock to a decline down to the 50-week moving average now at $224.50 (not shown above, but in the prior link). Keep in mind, the 200-day moving average (as shown above) comes into play near $226.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth So that's what I'm looking for: A drop down to the ~$225 level to be a good buying opportunity. I still believe a great buying opportunity is in the $200 to $205 level, where Costco stock has long-term uptrend support (again highlighted in my prior link) as well as the 100-week moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-04,"Retail stocks got hammered in May amid a flurry of bad earnings reports, which converged on rising tariffs and slowing economic expansion concerns to create a perfect storm for retailers. That's why I wrote a piece a few weeks back that highlighted five retail stocks that were getting slaughtered in the retail selloff.Those five retail stocks were Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), all of which reported disappointing early 2019 numbers. But, that was just the tip of the iceberg. Since then, many more retailers have reported ugly early 2019 numbers, and many more retail stocks have been slaughtered, including Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Capri (NYSE:CPRI), Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS), PVH (NYSE:PVH), Movado (NYSE:MOV), Gap (NYSE:GPS), Tilly's (NYSE:TLYS) and many more.But, not all retailers reported bad numbers in early 2019. Indeed, there were a select few retailers that actually put up strong early 2019 numbers. That's impressive against the dour backdrop. As such, these retailers are probably the retailers you want to be buying into for the rest of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right With that in mind, let's take a look six retail stocks that actually popped this earnings season on surprisingly strong numbers.  Dollar General (DG)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrFirst up we have dollar store giant Dollar General (NYSE:DG), which reported strong first quarter 2019 numbers that topped expectations across the board and featured favorable growth trends.Specifically, Dollar General's first-quarter revenues and profits both topped expectations, while comparable sales rose more than expected. Further, comparable sales growth was 3.8%, on top of 2.1% growth in the year-ago quarter, so this company is clearly on an accelerating and positive growth trajectory. Gross margins did fall back in the quarter, but only marginally, and they've been stable around 30% for the past several years. Opex rate expansion moderated in the quarter, and profit growth was better than expected.Broadly, the results were more of the same for Dollar General. This company has been reporting positive comparable sales growth for the past decade, regardless of retail backdrop noise, because consumers consistently and always flock to low price consumables. So long as this trend persists -- and it will -- DG stock should outperform the broader retail industry. Dollar Tree (DLTR)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrNext up, we have the other dollar store giant, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), which likewise reported strong first quarter numbers that topped expectations where it matters. But, unlike Dollar General, the quarter wasn't great from head to toe.On the positive side, comparable sales growth and revenues both topped expectations in the quarter, while second quarter and full year 2019 comparable sales growth is expected to remain positive. But, on the negative side, profits were merely in-line with expectations, and the full year 2019 profit guide was cut 2.5% to well below consensus levels. Gross margins also fell big in the quarter. The opex rate rose noticeably. Operating margins took a tumble. And, the depressed fiscal 2019 profit guide doesn't even include the full impact of tariffs.  * 7 Retail Stocks Winning in 2019 and Beyond All in all, Dollar Tree had a good quarter, but not a great one like Dollar General. Nonetheless, Dollar Tree did report positive comps, a sign that the price focus strategy is working, as it has worked over the past decade (through which Dollar Tree has consistently reported positive comps). While big upside is limited by trade headwinds, DLTR stock should be able to move gradually here thanks to continued positive comp trends. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The third retail stock that was red hot this earnings season was big box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT), which reported first-quarter numbers that ran laps around the rest of retail.Revenues topped expectations in the quarter. So did profits. Comparable sales rose a whopping 4.8% (ahead of expectations for a 4.1% gain), while traffic rose 4.3%. Digital sales soared 42% higher. Gross margins fell back a measly 20 basis points, among one of the smallest declines in the entire retail sector this quarter. The opex rate actually dropped, and operating margins expanded. On top of all that, management provided healthy second quarter and full year 2019 guides that called for low-to-mid single digit comparable sales growth in both periods.In other words, everything is going right for Target at a time when nothing is going right for a bunch of its retail peers. The implication? Target is rapidly stealing share, and will continue to do so as the company is aligned with every important trend in retail (all-in-one convenience, low prices, digital sales, omni-channel capabilities, in-house brands, so on and so forth). As such, Target will only gain momentum over the next several quarters, and as it does, TGT stock will head higher. Walmart (WMT)Source: Shutterstock Joining Target, another big box retail giant that reported far better than expected first-quarter numbers was Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Walmart also reported a big positive comp in the quarter (+3.4%) with strong digital sales growth (+37%) and margin stabilization (for example, the Flipkart acquisition). This has become the trend at Walmart. The company has successfully pivoted to become a more fierce Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) competitor by building out a robust digital business, expanding omni-channel capabilities, enhancing logistics, and improving pricing and merchandising. Further, the company has tested the waters with streaming, digital advertising and cloud, illustrating that this company's innovation curve is rapidly inflecting higher.  * 7 Best Vanguard Funds for 2019 All in all, Walmart has turned into an innovative omni-channel retail giant that has successfully aligned itself with all of today's important retail trends. Because of this, Walmart projects as a winning retailer for the foreseeable future, and WMT stock likewise projects as a winning stock. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock In a total different area of retail, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) shined bright this quarter as the home improvement space benefited from the convergence of a strong U.S. consumer and low interest rates.Home Depot beat first-quarter revenue and profit estimates by a healthy margin, while reporting a strong 2.5% rise in comparable sales (3% rise in U.S. stores). Gross margins fell back some, as was the norm across the entire retail sector in early 2019 due to tariffs. But, the company levered the expense rate thanks to continued robust sales growth, and operating margins were flat in the quarter. Going forward, Home Depot actually expects things to pick-up, as the guide calls for ~5% comparable sales growth through all of 2019.Broadly, Home Depot reported a really strong quarter. That's because the underlying fundamentals here are good. The U.S. consumer is strong, defined by record low unemployment, a healthy job participation rate, and decade-high wage growth. Meanwhile, the Fed has moved to the sidelines, and rates have steadily dropped through the first half of 2019. Specifically, mortgage rates have dropped in a big way, and that has created support for a healthy housing market.Overall, the home improvement environment continues to be supported by healthy underlying trends. So long as this remains true, Home Depot will continue to report solid numbers, and HD stock will trend higher. TJX Companies (TJX)Source:  Mike Mozart via FlickrLast, but not least, we have off-price retail giant TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX).TJX proved yet again with strong first-quarter numbers that the off-price retail strategy is a winning one that works even when other retail strategies fall short. TJX's first-quarter numbers beat on revenue and profit expectations. The company also reported 5% comparable sales growth, on top of 3% comparable sales growth in the year-ago quarter, and on the back of big traffic gains. Operating margins did drop, due to a lower gross margin and higher opex rate. But, that drop was offset by 7% sales growth.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Impacted by the Mexican Tariffs Overall, TJX proved that the consumer's affinity for price does not change with the times. It is steady and consistent, and that's why TJX has reported steady and consistent positive comps for the past several years. This trend will persist, regardless of the economic backdrop. As it does, TJX stock will move higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JWN, URBN, DG, TGT, WMT, AMZN and HD.

2019-06-05,"U.S. stock futures are trading modestly higher this morning in a continuation of yesterday's Fed-driven rally. Dovish comments from Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell sent stocks skyrocketing Tuesday. The CME Fedwatch tool is now pricing in a 90% chance of a rate cut by September.Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.26%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.26%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.50%.In the options pits, Tuesday's optimism sent call volumes to the moon, outpacing puts by a mile. Specifically, about 23.4 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe euphoria was less apparent at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio settled at 0.67, which is still a modestly high reading for 2019. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held its ground near 0.70.The options activity leaderboard is littered with heavy call volumes. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) popped to a new one-month high ahead of its ex-dividend date. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares broke out to a new 2019 high amid a scorching 11% gain. Finally, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was flooded with call activity during its 7% surge.Let's take a closer look: Home Depot (HD)Home Depot shares surged 3% to a new one-month closing high. The jump propelled HD stock back above its 20-day moving average and placed it on the cusp of completing a bottoming pattern. Its price action since last month's earnings report has been constructive compared to the broader market weakness.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far That said, the real reason for Home Depot landing atop the options leaderboard was the looming dividend. As is customary on the eve of an ex-dividend date, traders used calls for short-term control of the stock to qualify for the cash payment. The company is slated to pay its next quarterly dividend of $1.36 to shareholders of record. That translates into an annual yield of 2.81%, which is well above the yield on the S&P 500 (1.76%).Options traders came after calls with a vengeance. Total activity zoomed to 705% of the average daily volume, with 216,973 contracts traded; 95% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility dipped on the day to 21% or the 27th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $2.64 or 1.4%. Snap (SNAP)Snap shares took full advantage of yesterday's market rally, scoring a high volume breakout to a new high water mark for 2019. The 10.8% gain eclipsed resistance from April and completed the recent basing formation. Compared to the rest of the market, SNAP stock is a real star. It has held firm during the market's temper tantrum and boasts promising technical characteristics.2019 is turning into a banner year for the once beaten-down stock. Its year-to-date gains have now grown to a mouth-watering 135%.On the options trading front, calls led the way. Activity grew to 336% of the average daily volume, with 208,272 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 65% of the session's sum.  * 7 Small-Cap ETFs to Buy Now Implied volatility sunk to 58% landing it at the 31st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of 47 cents or 3.6%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Bulls jammed Advanced Micro Devices shares higher into the close, delivering a robust one-day, 7.2% gain. High volume accompanied the buying binge marking the third accumulation day over the past six sessions. One thing is clear: institutions want in.The rally places AMD stock close to completing a gorgeous cup-and-handle formation.

The deal is not imminent and while it seems unlikely that it will fall apart unless the trade situation deteriorates immensely, it could certainly be on hold for a while.The trade war is inflicting pain on both sides. U.S. farmers are being compensated, China's economy is seeing some waves and how many retailers did we hear from regarding the trade war? PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) are just a few that come to mind.A delayed deal for Boeing may not result in the same impact retailers feel. But make no mistake, dragging out this deal doesn't help. At the end of the day, China needs aircraft and is almost a decade away from its own production. That leaves Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY). Before discounts are taken into consideration, the deal is said to be north of $30 billion. Boeing wants to land it -- of course -- and Chinese airlines need it. But until the trade-war tensions ease, it may not come to fruition for a bit. Trading Boeing Stock Price  Click to EnlargeEventually though, the deal should go through and Boeing will go back to what it does best: generating massive cash flow. If it also clears its 737 MAX issues, investors will have two sighs of relief and even more reason to back the company. Will that cause Boeing stock to rally? Most likely. But it still has some short-term issues.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets On the chart above, notice how $360 buoyed the name for a while (orange arrow). At the same time though, notice how BA stock was not able to push through its 10-week moving average. The same goes for its 50-day moving average, which isn't shown on this weekly chart.Eventually, $360 -- which was prior range resistance -- gave way and is again acting as is resistance. So are the 50-week and 200-day moving averages. With prior range resistance no longer acting as support, we have to put prior range support down near $320 back on the table.That doesn't mean Boeing stock will fall that far necessarily. But if the markets begin to selloff or BA stock slips on negative headlines, this area will be on watch. Over $360 negates a lot of the negativity and puts a move back to $400 on the table.I think eventually Boeing stock will get back to $400 and eventually back to that prior high near $443. Maybe that comes on the back of a 737 MAX fix. Perhaps a mega deal with Chinese airlines helps drive there. More than likely, it will need both catalysts. That said, a flush lower may still be in the cards before BA stock gets there.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-13,"Trian, the hedge fund run by veteran activist investor Nelson Peltz, has taken a 6 per cent stake in Ferguson, indicating it would attempt to drive up returns at the FTSE 100 plumbing and heating equipment supplier.  Shares in Ferguson jumped as much as 11 per cent on Thursday before closing up 6 per cent at £56.30, their highest level since last October, giving the company a market capitalisation of around £13bn.",Nelson Peltz’s Trian takes 6% stake in London-listed Ferguson
2019-06-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nelson Peltz’s latest investment target is a big, slow-moving target with a massive bullseye on its back. The renowned U.S. activist has zoned in on Ferguson Plc, a plumbers’ merchant formerly known as Wolseley. His gripe is that the company trades at a stubborn discount to American peers. The snag is that remedies aren’t easy to administer.Ferguson is among the handful of U.K.-domiciled, London-listed blue-chips that aren’t really British companies. Some – such as BTG Plc or Firstgroup Plc – have already attracted takeover or activist interest. North America generates 87% of Ferguson’s revenue; the company recently changed its name to that of its U.S. subsidiary; it reports in dollars.The one un-American characteristic is the valuation. Ferguson has traded at a consistent discount to U.S. peers such as Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos Inc. The obvious explanation is that the company is listed on the wrong exchange, which makes it harder to attract its natural investor base. But that’s not the only interpretation. The valuation may also reflect a lack of faith in Ferguson’s strategy or management, or some challenges unique to its business. Either way, the discount slightly narrowed on Thursday after the disclosure that various Peltz funds had amassed a 6% stake. This pushed the stock up 6%, valuing the group at 13 billion pounds ($16 billion).It is hard to know whether Ferguson would get a higher valuation if it just moved its listing. Markets may not be 100% efficient, but capital is global and location can’t be the only explanation for the lack of investor love here. True, some funds are restricted geographically in where they can put money but that’s unlikely to be a huge factor in holding back demand for Ferguson shares.Such restrictions on funds might, though, be an obstacle to engineering a move for Ferguson. Unilever Plc’s plan to simplify its Anglo-Dutch structure into a single Netherlands company would have seen it lose its spot on the FTSE 100. That irked index investors and those with mandates to hold U.K. stocks who would have been forced to sell their shares. The plan foundered.Unilever wasn’t a one-off. Re-domiciling headquarters or listings has long been controversial. The textbook case is the thwarted migration of car parts maker LucasVarity back in the late 1990s from the U.K. to the U.S. For these changes, existing investors generally demand a premium. The cleanest way to achieve a move is to take the company private, then relist it.More pertinent are worries about the company’s resilience in the face of a U.S. slowdown. U.S. organic growth is slowing from a recent high single-digit percentage clip, while margins have barely improved since 2015, UBS analysts point out. The share price seems to be assuming that Ferguson’s long-run sustainable operating margin is just 5%, according to independent research provider Willis Welby, which argues that this is overly pessimistic.Peltz’s pitch is that he likes to engage with the management of his portfolio companies. Ferguson has responded diplomatically that it looks forward to dialogue, as it does with all shareholders. The mere presence of such a big name has got people excited. The tougher job will be convincing investors that the company’s equity story – twinning organic growth with a strategy of acquiring competitors – is still a winner. That case has yet to be made.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-06-13,"The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLY), the largest exchange-traded fund dedicated to the consumer discretionary sector, was up nearly 18% year-to-date at the start of June 11, putting it nearly 240 basis points ahead of the S&P 500.Consumer discretionary is the fourth-largest sector weight in the S&P 500. The primary reason why traditional, cap-weighted consumer cyclical ETFs like XLY are thriving this year is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That stock is up almost 24% year-to-date and is carrying many consumer cyclical funds because it is by far the largest holding in those ETFs.For example, XLY allocates 24.57% of its weight to shares of Amazon, more than double the weight assigned to the fund's second-largest component.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSure, some of the best ETFs in the consumer cyclical space have large weights to Amazon. That is to be expected. On the other hand, some of the best ETFs offering exposure to this sector have surprisingly small weights to Amazon, offering investors unique and potentially rewarding approaches to consumer-related stocks.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Here are some of the best ETFs for exposure to the consumer discretionary to consider over the next few months. Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (FDIS)Expense Ratio: 0.084%, or $8.40 annually per $10,000 investedThe Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA:FDIS) is the least expensive consumer discretionary fund on the market today. Adding to the case for this being one of the best ETFs for investors to consider in this sector is that Fidelity clients can trade FDIS commission-free, which adds to their cost savings.Like the aforementioned XLY, FDIS is a cap-weighted fund, so it has a massive weight to Amazon, 25.48% to be precise. FDIS is also home to Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MDC), Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) -- four of the Dow Jones stocks that are up at least 10% this year.Investors considering FDIS right now should be advised that the consumer discretionary sector has a tendency to struggle in the summer months, but long-term investors that can catch a pullback in FDIS could be rewarded because consumer cyclical stocks usually bounce back in the latter stages of the third quarter and soar in the last three months of the year. Amplify International Online Retail ETF (XBUY)Expense Ratio: 0.69%The Amplify Online International Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XBUY) debuted earlier this year as the international counterpart to the popular Amplify Online Retail ETF (NASDAQ:IBUY). Online retail and e-commerce are themes dominated by Amazon in the U.S., but these themes are global, making XBUY one of the best ETFs to consider in this space.XBUY holds 46 stocks and tracks the EQM International Ecommerce Index. That benchmark &quot;seeks to measure the performance of equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies that derive at least 90% of their revenue from online business transactions or e-commerce platforms,&quot; according to Amplify.XBUY's holdings include traditional retailers, online travel providers and marketplace companies, such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). XBUY is one of the best ETFs for tactical investors seeking ex-U.S. exposure because online shopping has significant tailwinds.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure &quot;Ecommerce represented a growing share of the retail market in 2018, taking a 14.3% share of total retail sales last year, up from 12.9% in 2017 and 11.6% in 2016,&quot; notes Digital Commerce 360. &quot;More significant is that ecommerce sales represented more than half, or 51.9%, of all retail sales growth. This is the largest share of growth for purchases made online since 2008, when ecommerce accounted for 63.8% of all sales growth.&quot; ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)Expense Ratio: 0.58%The ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:ONLN) is one of the best ETFs for investors looking for umbrella exposure to the biggest names in online retail. Case and point: ONLN allocates over 40% of its combined weight to Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). ONLN is just 11 months old, but the fund is already displaying the potency of dedicated online retail investments as it is up nearly 23% year-to-date.While ONLN is essentially a bet on two stocks due to the largest weights assigned to Amazon and Alibaba, there is no denying the favorable fundamental data that underpins this fund, making it one of the best ETFs in this market niche.&quot;With nearly all of the constituents of the ProShares Online Retail index reporting, sales growth came in at nearly 20% and earnings growth came in at nearly 55%,&quot; according to ProShares.As ONLN's performance indicates, investors should embrace purity when it comes to online retailers.&quot;Some retail observers note the increased online presence of legacy bricks-and-mortar retailers as evidence that the online/brick and mortar bifurcation of the retail universe is becoming less relevant. However, this ignores the evidence that expanding the online businesses of legacy bricks-and-mortar players isn't benefiting their bottom lines. In the first quarter, Walmart's online sales grew 37%; however, Walmart's first quarter earnings shrank nearly 1%,&quot; according to ProShares.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The consumer cyclical name has been moving higher on light news this month, but there are some data points that portend some strength in the consumer, the driving force of the U.S. economy.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 &quot;The latest data on retail sales from the Census Bureau, released on Friday, suggests that spending is now rising to match incomes,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;Average spending at stores, bars, and restaurants, excluding gasoline stations, was up 1.2% in April and May, compared with February and March on a seasonally adjusted basis.&quot;Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said it is laying off around 600 workers in Charlotte as part of an outsourcing program. The company is the largest U.S. retailer and biggest non-government employer in the U.S. It is doubtful that a headcount reduction of 600 was behind today's gain of 0.4% for the stock. Shares of Walmart are up about 9% this month, serving as another example of investors' preference for defensive names. The stock hit a 52-week high today.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), the defense giant that has been making regular appearances in this space in recent days, traded slightly higher today after an analyst said the stock's drubbing in the wake of its controversial deal with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) is a case of too much, too fast.Today, Vertical Research analyst Jeffrey Sprague upgraded United Technologies to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; while lifting his price target on the stock to $145 from $140.Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS), the largest U.S. investment stock and the biggest financial stock in the Dow, rose 0.19%.The stock &quot;is currently trading at around tangible book value, and it has over 30% upside to our fair value estimate,&quot; said Morningstar. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayInvestors should expect to see more diverging data points and opinions over the near term. For example, the Federal Reserve said in a report out Friday that industrial production rose 0.4% last month. However, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading for June dropped to 97.9 this month from 100 in May. That was due in large part to tariff concerns.With second-quarter earnings season fast approaching, investors may want to consider looking for sector-level opportunities.&quot;At the sector level, analysts are most optimistic on the Energy (64%), Health Care (60%), and Communication Services (60%) sectors, as these three sectors have the highest percentages of Buy ratings,&quot; according to FactSet.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-16,"The leader in the professional and DIY home renovation and repair supply niches, Home Depot, Inc. (HD), has long been considered a steady, reliable stock. In today’s market environment – with President Trump’s aggressive trade policy and the opposition Democratic Party’s increasingly anti-business and anti-wealth policy stance – those are the very traits that may make HD an ever more attractive stock.The share price has, long-term, reflected that reliability. In the last five years, it has showed a slow and steady increase, capped by a 12% gain in recent weeks after last month’s market sell-off. The Underlying StrengthsHome Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the US, with over $108 billion in annual revenue (nearly 50% more than its closest rival, Lowe’s [LOW]). HD is widely recognized as a leader in the contract supply industry, and in recent months, the company has seen a steep increase in its tool rental business – a segment directly primarily at professional builders. According to company CEO Craig Menear, “We know 90% of pros rent tools, but several years ago, only about one out of 10 pros rented from us. Today, that number has improved to one out of four, yet there remains opportunity for further growth as we continue to invest in our tool rental experience.”Increase in tool rental helped push the company’s Q1 results to a 5.7% increase in net sales year-over-year (at $26.4 billion for the quarter), and 9.1% year-over-year increase in EPS (to $2.27). Net sales were in-line with expectations, while the EPS was a significant 4% beat of the forecast. A miss in same-store comparable sales was attributed to unusually wet weather nationwide during the quarter, which put a damper on construction activities.Financial blogger Luke Longo (Track Record & Ratings) finds additional reason for optimism in the current state of the employment and housing sectors. Specifically, he sees “record low unemployment, a healthy job participation rate, and decade-high wage growth” interacting with lower mortgage rates to create “support for a healthy housing market.” As long as these factors remain, he says, “Home Depot will continue to report solid numbers, and HD stock will trend higher.” Looking ForwardWhile HD’s management sees a solid foundation for the company now, they are preparing for the future. The company is confident enough to issue additional debt, locking in low rates in an effort to keep its large debt total affordable. While a somewhat risky move, it drew approval from five-star Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes (Track Record & Ratings), who said, “HD raised $400 million more than we assumed, providing the company with greater near-term financial flexibility.&quot;Forbes went on to comment about the company’s overall state and performance potential: “With no change to our interest expense outlook, we are maintaining our 2019 EPS estimate of $10.12 while reiterating our BUY rating and $215 price target. Bottom line, we continue to envision share price outperformance as we move through 2019 driven mainly by our conviction in HD's &quot;Core&quot; expense (business-as-usual) leverage…” His $215 price target suggests a modest 4.5% upside to the stock.Also taking an upbeat line on HD is Stifel’s John Baugh (Track Record & Ratings). He agrees with the company on the overall business landscape, pointing out that a combination of weather and deflation artificially depressed same-store comps during Q1. For prospects going forward, Baugh says, “Management is optimistic on the macroeconomic environment and does not see any impact from SALT (state and local tax deduction changes), home price appreciation slowing, or weak housing turnover.” In other words, no matter what happens, people still need to maintain their homes. Baugh raised his price target on HD by 5%, to $210. At the time he set that target, on May 22, it indicated a potential 22% upside. The Bottom LineHome Depot offers investors a firm business model in a niche that customers will always need. The company has a growing professional customer base, and a comfortable lead over its competition. The situation is neatly summed up by another financial blogger, Matthew Cochrane (Track Record & Ratings), who writes, “When one takes a longer view, though, it becomes clear that this home-improvement retail giant is on the correct side of several trends and has made the right investments to stay on top of potential e-commerce competitive threats as well as its primary rival, Lowe's Companies.”A look at HD’s analyst consensus confirms the general view: the stock has a ‘Moderate Buy’ ratings, based on 10 buys and 4 holds assigned over the past three months. The average price target, $207, suggests a 1% upside to the current share price of $205. Given the company’s solid quarterly results, expect that upside to adjust slightly higher in coming weeks.View HD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail",Is it Time to Buy Home Depot?

2019-06-17,"Wall Street is on tenterhooks this week, waiting for two big catalysts to hit. First, they're waiting on a Federal Reserve policy decision at a time when the markets are screaming for a rate cut. And second, they're watching for a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 meeting later this month.As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is in a holding pattern above the 26,000 level -- continuing a sideways shuffle that has been in effect since January 2018. If a breakout is going to happen, it's now or never as a breakdown could well call into question the vitality of this 10-plus-year bull market.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Last week, I highlighted several Dow components that were looking weak. Today, let's look instead at components that are ready for an upside move. Here are four to watch:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Dow Jones Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are pushing higher, testing above their 50-day moving average and looking longingly at the $200-a-share level lost back in early May. Now, the company is vulnerable to a worsening of the U.S.-China trade standoff. It could potentially get hit in both directions: first on a risk to its China-centered supply chain and second, with its image as an American tech giant in the eyes of Chinese consumers. However, hype is also building for the launch of the iPhone 11 later this year. Further, the company is looking to introduce two 5G phones in 2020.The company will next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.10 per share on revenues of $53.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $2.46 per share beat estimates by 10 cents on a 5.1% decline in revenues. Boeing (BA)After months of malaise following two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX, a resulting regulatory grounding, and long-term damage to the company's image, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares have stabilized. They now look ready for a possible push back above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. At some point, all the bad news gets priced in. The latest reports are that the FAA is expected to soon begin flight trials of the fix for the 737 MAX.The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.81 per share on revenues of $19.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $3.16 missed estimates by three cents on a 2% drop in revenues. Disney (DIS)Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares are threatening to push up and over their prior high from late April, aiming for new record highs. Analysts at Citigroup recently upgraded the stock and assigned a $160-a-share price target, a move that would be worth a gain of nearly 15% from here. A successful opening for the new Toy Story 4 movie would help motivate such a move.The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.77 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on May 8, earnings of $1.61 beat estimates by four cents on a 2.6% rise in revenues. Home Depot (HD)Shares of home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are threatening to break up and out of a two-year long consolidation range with a push above the $210-a-share level. Lower long-term interest rates in recent months is helping reverse a slowdown in the U.S. housing market, with the company benefiting form the pickup in activity as both buyers and sellers focus on everything from new appliances to gardening.The company will next report results on Aug. 20 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.09 per share on revenues of $31 billion. When the company last reported on May 21, earnings of $2.27 beat estimates by eight cents on a 5.7% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-19,"As was expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged following the conclusion of its two-day meeting today. But what market participants wanted was inklings of hope that a rate cut could materialize later this year. That wish was granted, helping stocks rally into the close.Source: Shutterstock Importantly, the word &quot;patient&quot; was not featured in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, indicating the Fed could take a more proactive approach to managing rates if the world's largest economy starts to show signs of weakness.&quot;The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased,&quot; said the FOMC. &quot;In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne Fed member, James Bullard, preferred to lower rates by 25 basis points at this meeting. That was not enough to deliver the coveted rate cut, but it was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 higher by 0.42% and 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.15%. Winners, But Were There Enough?Yes, the Dow is home to just 30 stocks and in late trading, two-thirds of those names were higher. But if nitpicking is to occur on an otherwise positive day, it is worth noting that Dow's offenders today were all cyclical names. Going a bit further with the scrutiny, several of the Dow losers today were among the index's biggest components. But to be fair, some of these stocks have been on winning streaks and the Wednesday losses were mostly modest.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the Dow Jones' largest healthcare component, was the blue-chip index's biggest winner today, adding 1.82%. Not to play politics here, but UNH's Wednesday rally occurred a day after President Donald Trump kicked off his reelection at a rally in Orlando.Obviously, the election is a long way out, but as has been note here, UNH and rival healthcare providers have been under pressure amid speculation that Medicare For All could become a reality if a Democrat wins the White House. Again, November 2020 is a long way away, but UNH has been trending higher for almost two months and looks poised to wipe out its year-to-date loss.American Express (NYSE:AXP) was one of the best-performing financial services names in the Dow today. The stock, a Warren Buffett favorite, added 1.01% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Kupferberg put a &quot;buy&quot; rating and a $145 price target on the shares, implying significant upside from Wednesday's close.AXP is a &quot;a worthy investment which offers customers unique experiences beyond traditional rewards points&quot; and &quot;we have been pleasantly surprised to see [American Express] strategically raise card fees to help offset these costs,&quot; said the analyst in a note cited by Barron's.Home improvement giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD) ticked higher, aided by the Fed minutes. Lower interest rates often benefit companies with exposure to the residential real estate market, and that rate chatter could aid Home Depot in its quest to break through resistance at the $210 area. If that happens, it could be off to the races for the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt is difficult to complain about Wednesday's price action. Sure, stocks could have gained more, but for the most part, investors got what they wanted in terms of dovish Fed commentary. Plus, Fed funds futures are indicating a July rate cut is a real possibility.Fortunately, investors looking to prepare for a rate cut without incurring significantly higher risk can turned to a beloved asset class: dividend stocks and ETFs. Several dividend ETFs hit record highs today and a large batch are withing just a few percentage points of doing the same.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Editor s note This article is a part of 160 InvestorPlace com s Best ETFs for 2019 contest Vince Martin s pick for the contest is the iShares U S Home Construction ETF,Best ETFs for 2019: iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF Still Has a Chance
2019-06-20,"Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Vince Martin's pick for the contest is the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB).Heading into 2019, the case for the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) was reasonably simple. Pretty much anything housing-related had been sold off big in 2018. In fact, ITB stock fell some 31% for the year. Yet the economy still seemed strong. Broad markets, even with a rough Q4, were in decent shape. Economically sensitive housing-related stocks were plunging despite the news simply being not that bad.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat divergence was why I named ITB as my pick for the Best ETFs of 2019 contest. So far, it has been a solid choice, with the ITB ETF gaining 29% year-to-date against a 17% rise in the S&P 500. Homebuilder stocks have risen, as have most of the industry's retailers and many of its suppliers.But at this point, the case for ITB gets a little thinner. After the first quarter, the fund had returned 16%, but that was only modestly better than low double-digit gains in most broad market indices. And so I made the case in late March that ITB still had some catching up to do.Three months later, ITB hasn't completely caught up. Since the beginning of 2018, the fund remains negative against an ~10% gain for the S&P 500. But the gap certainly has closed. As such, this ETF will need some outside help if it's going to keep rising.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever  The Case Against ITB as One of the Best ETFsUp 29% YTD, it certainly seems like the easy money has been made here. That seems particularly true looking at the fund's key holdings: 27% of assets are in the country's two largest homebuilders, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar (NYSE:LEN).Both stocks have rallied sharply this year (+29% for DHI, +33% for LEN), driving a good chunk of the fund's gains. Another 40% of the fund owns smaller homebuilders -- most of which have followed similar patterns. Most of the group is below their highs, but many have at least returned to 2018 trading levels.Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has gained nicely, and is threatening a new all-time high. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has underperformed, but is still positive. In December, ITB was a case of buying a group of stocks at or near the lows. That's not the argument anymore.Now, ITB needs at least a few components to break out from the highs -- and not just rebound off the lows. That might be tough. Tariffs are pressuring margins in the space. Trade war concerns are affecting the macroeconomic outlook. There's still a belief that a downturn in the U.S. has to be on the way at some point, as we head into year eleven of the economic expansion. Homebuilder stocks, in particular, likely would take a big hit.At this point, risks are rising and valuations aren't as cheap. That's a combination that suggests, at the least, that ITB's appreciation is going to slow in the second half. The Case for the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETFFor market and macro bulls, however, ITB still looks like a solid pick. The ETF remains about 15% below early 2018 highs. With some help from lower interest rates, which would lower mortgage costs, and economic strength, it could re-take those highs, suggesting another 20% or so in upside.From a longer-term standpoint, the ETF still sits below where it traded back in 2006. ITB started trading on May 1st of that year. The housing crisis followed, and in less than three years, 85% of its value had been wiped out. It has been a long climb back from those lows, but if the economy cooperates, that climb can continue.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market That's the key point, though: if the economy cooperates. To even consider ITB at this point, an investor truly has to trust both the economy and the broad market. If trade war concerns ease and/or if strong U.S. job and macro growth continues, ITB will keep rising. And, in that scenario, the ETF likely will outperform broad markets in the second half, just as it did in the first.But this is a different argument than it was six months ago. Then, the ETF looked like it was pricing in an almost-certain recession. That's just not the case anymore. For macro bulls, the ITB ETF is a way to get leveraged upside on more good economic news ahead. But it's not as cheap, or attractive, as it was six months ago.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This strong, consistent move into Treasuries has been pushing Treasury prices higher and, in turn, Treasury yields lower.For instance, the CBOE Interest Rate 10 Year T Note (INDEXCBOE:TNX) has dropped from a recent high of 3.24% on Nov. 8, 2018, to 2% last week. That's a huge decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile falling Treasury yields may not be good for all companies and stock sectors, they are definitely a bonus for the housing sector and housing-related stocks, like Home Depot (NYSE:HD).Here's why… The 30-Year Mortgage Rates are Tied to the TNXHousing stocks benefit from falling Treasury yields because the 30-year mortgage rate is closely tied to the TNX.The lower the TNX goes, the lower 30-year mortgage rates tend to go. The lower 30-year mortgage rates go, the more affordable housing becomes, which typically leads to more home purchasing and remodeling.The more consumers are buying and remodeling homes, the more stuff -- paint, carpet, microwaves, garden supplies and so on -- they are likely to buy at HD.The more consumers buy from HD, the more the company is going to earn, and the higher HD stock is likely to go. Climbing up to $212You can see all of this playing out on HD's chart. The stock has been moving higher all year as the TNX and mortgage rates have been dropping, but it has been particularly bullish since the company last reported earnings on May 21.Daily Chart of Home Depot (HD) -- Chart Source: TradingViewAfter climbing to a recent high of $212, HD has pulled back to retest the former resistance range the stock hit in April to see if it will hold up as a new support level. So far, support around $205 has held.We expect HD to continue moving higher during the coming weeks. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised if it climbs back up to challenge its 52-week high of $215.43. Because of the bullish action, we think selling a short-term put write is a good way to trade HD. With support at $205 holding up, we have a good strike price for any options we sell.If the bullish action continues, traders may even be able to roll this trade out for additional income.To find out which HD puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-07-09,"By all accounts, one of the biggest and most surprising winners this year is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). On the surface, a brick-and-mortars retailer should have no business doing so well in the era of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, a doubter just needs to consult the Walmart stock price. At just under $112, shares have gained over 23% year-to-date.Source: Shutterstock In doing so, Walmart proved one thing: a physical retailer can not only survive the ecommerce onslaught, but they can thrive as well. If you broaden your horizons, WMT stock is emblematic of pockets of resistance in the retail segment. For instance, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and to a lesser extent Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) have performed well over the years.Naturally, the question is, why? The easy answer (and the best one, in my opinion) is that certain retailers are insulated from ecommerce. I believe most folks buying power tools or renovation materials want to see the products in person before purchasing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLogically, the same principle applies to groceries. With WMT being the one-stop-shop, this sentiment benefits Walmart stock.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Additionally, a convenience factor bolsters the case for WMT stock. Currently, ecommerce companies and the online channels for major retailers are battling over shipping times. For instance, a few months back, Walmart introduced free one-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. That move directly counters Amazon's robust shipping offerings, but with one major difference: Amazon requires a costly $119 annual membership, while Walmart does not.As a result, the big-box retailing giant appears poised to deliver the goods, figuratively and literally. However, an old headwind may come back to strike Walmart stock: China. Trade War and Walmart StockBefore we dive into the reasons why the U.S.-China trade war poses problems for WMT stock, let me say this: I'm confident in the company's longer-term outlook. No matter how prevalent ecommerce becomes, there likely will always be a place for the brick-and-mortars.That said, the Walmart stock price has historically gained on the big-box retailer's primary business narrative: selling tons of products at everyday low prices.Thanks to Amazon, that focus has expanded to include online retail channels. Although a smart move, it has stretched Walmart thin. Thus, a poor outcome for future U.S.-China negotiations could hurt WMT.And here's why I'm bringing up this concern. From 2007 through the end of 2015, Walmart's average net margin measured 3.44%. But from 2016 onward, profit margins slipped to 2.21%. The noticeable slip coincided with Walmart's aggressive push to compete directly with Amazon. For example, Walmart announced its intentions to acquire Jet.com on August 2016.  Click to EnlargeIn the following year, Walmart introduced free two-day shipping. It also acquired several companies to bolster its online presence. To be fair, these moves have largely served to jumpstart the Walmart stock price. However, you also can't deny that these same moves are costly; hence, the declining margins.So far, management has a freebie for the pricey strategies because Walmart is a volume king. But should the trade war drag on, management has two choices: protect margins or protect volume. They've indicated the former choice, as have most other affected companies.However, that's not an easy choice for WMT stock because Walmart's shoppers aren't exactly high-rollers. Increased prices will negatively impact volume. In turn, that could put pressure on a company unaccustomed to big threats. How to Approach WMT StockIf you're a buy-and-holder, I think you should be concerned but not alarmed. Certainly, a trade war with the world's second-largest economy is always a concern for a retail investment like Walmart stock. At the same time, you can trust this leadership team to guide the company out of trouble, similar to what they did with the ecommerce threat.On the flipside, if you're a trader, I think it makes sense to trim some holdings here. Since the beginning of June, WMT stock has gained nearly 10%. That's a pretty strong number for a blue-chip company. And it's also surprising against a major geopolitical headwind that has not yet found resolution.Because it's important to know that the U.S. and China have only agreed to a truce at the G20 summit. That means a temporary hold on ramping up additional tariffs; the respite does not involve removing existing ones.But China has recently stated that they will only go to the negotiating table once all tariffs have been removed. That's a tough statement, and if President Trump agrees to it, it's not clear how that would hold China accountable for intellectual property theft.Therefore, whatever concerns Walmart had before the G20 summit remains unfortunately valid. That's the single but biggest hold up on me going fully bullish on Walmart stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-11,"Home Depot has long been known as the place to go if you need to fix something around the house. Now it has its own problem to fix. The company’s co-founder Bernie Marcus recently said in an interview that after donating $7 million to help elect Donald Trump in 2016, he plans to donate again to his 2020 re-election campaign. Social media (or at least a chunk of it) was not thrilled, and thus BoycottHomeDepot started trending on Twitter, with plenty of former customers pledging to stop shopping there. Home Alone Home Depot pointed out that Marcus retired from the company in 2002, and made the donation as a private citizen, not as a representative of the company, which does not endorse political candidates. As you can expect, Trump weighed in on this, calling the customer boycott “vicious and totally crazed.” The Bern Marcus also made it clear he is no fan of a higher profile Bernie. In response to this and several other criticisms Senator Sanders has received of late, the Presidential candidate just unleashed his list of anti-endorsements, a collection of CEOs that have spoken out against him, saying “In the words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt: 'They are unanimous in their hate for me–and I welcome their hatred.'&quot; Having A Say While Marcus didn’t make the donation as a current CEO, that is a distinction that the general public might not make, or even care about. It also overlaps with a sustained interest shareholders have in knowing what the companies they invest in are spending their money on, or who they might be donating to. If you don't like who they are donating to, remember you have a say. -Michael Tedder Photo: Mario Anzuoni / REUTERS","Home Depot CEO's Trump Donations Sparks Customer Boycott, Outrage from the President"

2019-07-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. has sent 35 truckloads of generators to stores in areas hit by tropical storm Barry, where local residents are grappling with power outages.The home-improvement retailer has dispatched 250 additional truckloads of supplies to the 28 stores in Louisiana and Mississippi that were in the storm’s path, according to Jeff Partin, Home Depot’s director of corporate security, emergency preparedness and business continuity. Those stores closed a few hours early on Saturday night but all were back open as of Sunday morning, he said.“The rain levels didn’t materialize as forecast,” Partin said in an interview Sunday. “But we became aware that power outages were steadily increasing. Generators are a big item.”Entergy Louisiana LLC, the main provider in the state with 1.08 million customers, reported that about 71,600 were affected. Almost 43,500 out of Cleco Corp.’s nearly 285,000 customers were without power. Home Depot didn’t see the need to create a separate command center at its Atlanta headquarters to deal with Barry, which was downgraded from a Category 1 hurricane. The retailer has done that for more devastating natural disasters, such as last year’s Hurricane Michael and 2017’s Harvey.“We didn’t think it was warranted to stand up several hundred people to watch it rain,” Partin said.Post-Storm SpendingHurricanes can be a boon for home-improvement retailers like Home Depot and rival Lowe’s Cos. Additional sales of plywood, pumps, generators and other items in the wake of 2017’s destructive hurricanes in Florida and Texas boosted Home Depot’s sales in the fourth quarter of that year by $380 million. But in the same quarter the following year, lower hurricane spending weighed on the company’s performance and shares.Lowe’s, which has 46 stores in the affected region, said it activated its emergency command center located in Moorsville, North Carolina. “Our command center is active and working to get needed products to our stores as quickly as possible,” a Lowe’s spokeswoman said by email.Barry came ashore near Intracoastal City -- about 125 miles west of New Orleans -- in Louisiana and as of 10 a.m. local time the top sustained winds had declined to 40 miles (65 kilometers) per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. As much as 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain could fall in some areas of the state, according to the NHC. The storm will weaken to a depression Sunday and could degenerate completely by Monday or Tuesday, the hurricane center said.&#92;--With assistance from Brian K.

2019-07-15,"U.S. equities continue to show an upward bias on Monday, with the S&P 500 holding above the 3,000 level while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains north of the 27,000 level. Impressive gains all around as Wall Street continues to look past things like uneven economic data and an inverted yield curve to focus instead on the dovish policy pivot by the Federal Reserve and the likelihood of interest rate cuts later this year.  A number of mega-cap components in the Dow are perking up nicely and still present attractive entry points for buyers on the sidelines looking to get into the action. The early action in many of the names seems predicated on a thawing of U.S.-China trade relations later this year.    * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond With all of that in mind, here are five Dow Jones stocks to consider: InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Caterpillar (CAT)   Click to EnlargeShares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are extending further away from its 200-day moving average to close in on the prior high set back in April. A breakout here would put an end to a long downtrend pattern going back to January 2018 and would set the stage for a challenge on the prior record high near $170, which would be worth a gain of more than 21% from here.  The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.12 per share on revenues of $14.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $2.94 beat estimates by 8 cents on a 4.7% rise in revenues.  Disney (DIS)   Click to EnlargeDisney (NYSE:DIS) shares keep marching higher, pushing to new records as it exits a multi-year funk. The opening of the new Galaxy's Edge theme park area as well as the approach of the release of the latest Star Wars movie has investors excited about ticket sales and merchandising revenue heading into the holiday shopping season.    * 7 Services Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.76 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on May 8, earnings of $1.61 per share beat estimates by 4 cents on a 2.6% rise in revenues.   Goldman Sachs (GS)    Click to EnlargeShares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are pushing away from a consolidation range going back to last fall with an extension away from its 200-day moving average. The stock is benefiting from expectations of easier policy from the Federal Reserve later this year, which would bolster long-term interest rates and help with net interest margins. Watch for a run at the mid-2018 highs near $240, which would be worth a gain of more than 14% from here.  The company will next report results on July 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $4.82 per share on revenues of $8.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 15, earnings of $5.71 beat estimates by 69 cents on a 12.6% decline in revenues.   Home Depot (HD)  Click to EnlargeHome Depot (NYSE:HD) shares are enjoying an extended rally off of their 200-day moving average, setting up a run to new record highs after breaking up and over old resistance near the $210 a share level. Falling long-term interest rates could help the housing market enjoy another surge of activity after a lack of affordability dampened activity last summer.   * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond The company will next report results on Aug. 20 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.09 per share on revenues of $30.9 billion. When the company last reported on May 21, earnings of $2.27 beat estimates by 8 cents on a 5.7% rise in revenues.   Intel (INTC)    Click to EnlargeIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are breaking up and out of resistance from their 200-day moving average to end a two-month funk and close in on the gap down range near $55. Such a move would be worth a gain of 10% from here. Remember that semiconductors are the raw materials that the modern economy runs on, with pretty much every device containing processing power of some type these days. A turnaround in economic activity, spurred by easier money, will benefit chipmakers like Intel.  The company will next report results on July 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 88 cents per share on revenues of $15.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of 89 cents per share beat estimates by 2 cents on $16 billion in revenues.

2019-07-15,"Last week's gallery on breakout stocks to buy delivered big-league profits. So we're returning to the well for three more candidates that boast price charts brimming with potential.This week's targets are inspired in large part by the S&P 500, which closed at a new record high of $3,013.77 on Friday. Nothing brings buyers to the yard like a major index touching its highest price in history. It reveals optimism and a risk-on attitude.Last week's demand surge was aided in part by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress that all but confirmed the market's expectation for a rate cut at the upcoming July 31 meeting. Betting markets peg the odds of a quarter-point cut at 72% and a half-point cut at 28%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Without further ado, check out these three breakout stocks to buy. 3 Breakout Stocks to Buy: Cisco (CSCO)Source: ThinkorSwim Friday's rally for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) succeeded where its predecessor did not. Last month's breakout attempt over $57.50 was met with rejection and sharp selling. Friday's bid, however, powered through the ceiling and closed at a new 52-week high.With the gain, CSCO stock officially ended its three-month consolidation zone and signaled that the next stage of its uptrend is upon us. I'd use $60 as the first upside target. It would take a break below the 50-day moving average at $55 to invalidate the bullish backdrop. So until then, the path of least resistance is higher.At 41%, the implied volatility rank is fiddling in the middle of its range. Couple that with earnings coming over the next month, and I think bull call spreads are the way to go.Buy the Sep $57.50/$60 bull call spread for around $1.20. Home Depot (HD)Source: ThinkorSwim Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was one of the best stocks on the board Friday. The retailer surged 2% on heavy volume to a new all-time high. On the technical front, there's nothing not to like about its price action. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages are trending higher to confirm buyers' dominance of the short- and intermediate-term trends.A few accumulation days have cropped up over the past two weeks to signal institutions are wading into the waters. As far as options go, implied volatility is in the basement revealing an utter lack of uncertainty in the stock. That means prices for derivatives are dirt cheap. Long calls and call spreads offer great low-risk, high-reward bets right now.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond If you think the good times continue to roll, then buy the Sep $220/$230 bull call spread for around $3.75. Spotify (SPOT)Source: ThinkorSwim Last week's rally ushered Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) to the cusp of a clear breakout zone. In fact, SPOT stock looks better than at any time since last year's IPO. This summer's recovery pushed shares of the streaming music service back above all its major moving averages for the first time.The base built throughout 2019 should serve as a solid foundation to build an uptrend from if buyers decide to press their advantage here.If SPOT can clear $155, look for a run toward the next ceiling of $170. To capitalize, buy the Oct $160/$170 bull call spread for around $3.30.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17,"Markets are high, as investors have rushed back into stocks on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least once before year’s end. With bond yields already low, and lower rates in the offing, stocks are the natural place to turn. And among the stocks, high-yield dividends offer investors an additional income stream to supplement share price growth. Here we look at three stocks offering high dividend payouts. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)Shares in Broadcom slipped in recent sessions, when acquisition talks between the chipmaker and cyber security corporation Symantec (SYMC) broke off. Symantec ended the negotiations, saying that Broadcom’s per-share offer was too low. Both companies saw a retreat in share price; Broadcom much less.Macro factors have been more important to AVGO’s share performance than possible acquisitions. The US semiconductor industry was hit hard last month when tariff fears flared up, but that has eased since Presidents Trump and Xi met cordially at the G20 summit and announced that formal trade talks would resume.So, Broadcom is looking stable, but more attractive to investors is the company’s 3.73% dividend yield. While that percentage may not seem high, AVGO’s $284 share price makes the annualized payout $10.60. Quarterly, it pays out $2.65 per share. Even better, AVGO has a history of both consistent payouts and steady increases of the dividend. It’s a guaranteed income that nicely complements the stock’s 9% upside potential.Broadcom has gained over 13% since the beginning of June, and analysts are sanguine about the stock’s future. William Stein, of SunTrust Robinson, remains “positive on Broadcom's outstanding historical track record of value creation from its investing decisions and expects its management to continue to make intelligent capital allocation decisions.” His price target, $307, suggests an 8% upside to the stock.A look at Stein’s ratings history on Broadcom shows that he has been consistently bullish on this stock for the last year. Even better, his ratings are frequently borne out by performance – he has a 19% average return on his recommendations for AVGO shares.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see William Stein’s complete Analyst ProfileOverall, Broadcom holds a strong buy from the analyst consensus, based on 21 buy ratings and 6 holds assigned in the last 3 months. The stocks $311 average price target suggests room for 9.6% growth from the $284 current share price. Home Depot, Inc. (HD)Home Depot leads the big-box home improvement superstore niche, with double the market share, double the share price, and triple the market cap of its largest competitor, Lowe’s (LOW). With recent positive economic indicators, especially June’s strong jobs numbers and the prospect of a Fed interest rate cut putting downward pressure on mortgage rates, the home improvement niche is looking strong.A solid business niche leads to profit and cash flow. HD is set to release Q2 earnings on Aug 13, and the expectation is for $3.09 per share, and increase of 36% from last quarter’s $2.27 EPS. Historically, the company’s fiscal second quarter is its strongest for earnings.HD also has a history of sharing earnings with investors through a robust dividend. The yield is a modest 2.5%, but the high share price makes the annual payout $5.44. Quarterly payments are $1.36, and HD has a history of raising the dividend each year.&gt;&gt;Click here to see the HD Dividend CalendarThe reliable dividend and profitable business model may explain HD’s popularity among investors. TipRanks tracks over 50,000 individual portfolios; among the best performing of these, Home Depot shares appear in 16.3%, or 1 out of 6. Top performing investors have increased their HD holdings by more than 2% over the past month, reflecting the overall “very positive” investor sentiment on the stock.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see HD Investor SentimentInvestors and dividend fans aren’t the only ones bullish on Home Depot. Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane reviewed the stock earlier this month and gave it a $235 price target, implying an upside potential over 8%. In her comments, McShane wrote: “Home Depot hits all the marks when it comes to gaining market share and increasing operating dollar growth. Expect these two attributes to drive upside to the stock over the next 12 months.”Home Depot’s price target presents us with the interesting case of a solid stock whose recent gains have pushed its share price above recent analyst expectations. HD is trading at $217; the average price target, however, is only $209, and still reflects older analyst ratings. As McShane’s comments and target show, Wall Street is beginning to readjust its outlook on the company. HD remains a strong buy, based on an analyst consensus of 8 buys and 5 holds in the past three months. Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM)Yes, this is a cigarette company, a classic “sin stock.” But investors are in the market to make a profit, and that’s where Philip Morris delivers. Year-to-date, shares in PM are up 22%. The profits come while cigarette sales are slowing, as the tobacco companies have been casting about for other business opportunities, making investments in cannabis, alcohol, and e-cigarettes.In looking for alternate revenue streams, Big Tobacco hasn’t forgotten the investor. PM pays out a regular dividend of $1.14 quarterly. Annualized, this represents an income of $4.56 per share and a yield of 5.59%. More important, is PM’s 11-year history of growing the dividend, making this stock particularly attractive to value investors.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the PM Dividend CalendarSecular trends – especially the poor reputation of tobacco and smoking products – may be lined up against the tobacco companies, but some Wall Street analysts see this as a buying opportunity. Writing from Goldman Sachs, Judy Hong says, “Tobacco valuations are &quot;at a 10-year trough despite a more accommodating market backdrop.”She sees a floor to cigarettes’ unpopularity, and a stabilization in sales and profits. Continuing, she says, “Expect the current discount on tobacco stocks to narrow as cigarette fundamentals hold up better than feared, contribution from next generation tobacco products builds, and regulatory concerns subside over time.”Hong says that the bearishness on tobacco traces back to lower sales volumes for cigarettes along with up-front costs of the shift to e-cigs and other alternative products. However, she adds, “Expect the decline in cigarette consumption to abate and the shift to e-cigarettes to moderate. And international cigarette volume trends have been mostly stable.” In line with her bullish stance on the industry, Hong gives PM a solid buy rating.Bonnie Herzog, of Wells Fargo, agrees with Hong on the outlook for Philip Morris. She bases her optimism, however, on a successful move toward alternative tobacco products, specifically the iQOS heat-not-burn option. Writing of PM, she says she expects the company to beat the Q2 earnings estimate, saying, “We expect PM will beat conservative EPS of $1.32 (vs our $1.36) and we expect: (1) sequential acceleration of iQOS shipment volume in Japan (+14.5%) given strength from next generation iQOS 3/Multi platforms; (2) iQOS to lead heat-not-burn (HNB) category growth in Japan and gain market share elsewhere; and (3) strong cigarette price realization.”Herzog gives PM a price target of $100, suggesting an upside potential of 22% to the stock. Her rating suggests that PM has more room for growth than the conventional wisdom would indicate – PM’s average price target is $93, indicating a possible upside of 15% from the share price of $81.PM’s analyst consensus rating is a moderate buy, derived from 7 buys and 3 holds in the last three months.TipRanks puts a wide variety of data analysis tools at your fingertips, so you can find the right investment for your portfolio.

Consumers have gotten fickler than ever, which has created an interesting environment for many retail stocks to operate in.Today, people want their goods when they want it and how they want it. This means that both physical stores and digital commerce need to be blended. Two-day and even one-day shipping is now the norm, while online ordering and pick-up have quickly become a default option for many consumers.Needless to say, a lot of retail stocks have buckled under this pressure. Store closures and bankruptcies dot the sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, not all retail stocks are being tossed to the wolves. In fact, several are getting it right. That includes the right tech and consumer experiences to compete in the new omnichannel paradigm. These winners are proving that investors don't have to ignore the sector completely, but they do have to be selective. Choose wrong and you could be staring at plenty of empty storefronts.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Which retailers are getting the job done in omnichannel? Here are five retail chains that will be winners in the years ahead. Williams-Sonoma (WSM)When being a &quot;foodie&quot; and collecting kitchen gadgets weren't as popular as they are today, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) was really the only game in town for it. If you wanted to find new kitchen appliances, high-end imported foods, and other now-common kitchen items, you had to go to WSM. Because of this, the retailer has built up a fanatical fanbase of customers.The best part is this fanbase tends to be older and more affluent than typical bargain shoppers. After all, if you're willing to drop nearly $12,000 on an espresso machine, you have some cash to spend. And they tend to transfer their love of the brand down to their children when they finally become adults.The same could be said for its other major brands like Pottery Barn and West Elm for home furnishings. WSM has managed to create a cohort of wealthy customers that are willing to shop there first before anywhere else. This gives it a monster edge over many other retail stocks.Williams-Sonoma has been an earnings machine -- especially in the world of omnichannel. It has been able to get people into its stores for demos and product help while making plenty of revenues online. Sales have grown by an annual rate of 6% per year since 2010, while earnings have grown 11% per year over the same time. And it has been sharing the wealth via a growing dividend. Today, WSM yields almost 3%.All in all, WSM stock has all the right ingredients to keep winning in the new retailing world. Five Below (FIVE)Dollar stores have been incredibly resilient in the face of rising online and omnichannel shopping. But dollar-store Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) isn't like your local Dollar General (NYSE:DG). The product is very different. That is, it's geared towards kids, tweens, and even college students. You're looking at toys, games, cheap tech gear and beauty items. Moreover, much of the product mix shifts as the season's change -- which adds a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; aspect to their locations and necessitates repeat customers.And customers are coming back in a big way.Because of its operating model and low-cost of goods, the funky dollar store has managed to turn sales into actual profits. New stores have an average payback time of just one year, while profits have compounded by over 32% per year since its IPO. That's torrid growth considering this is a budget retailer. And FIVE has managed to do all of this without debt.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Given its focus on tweens as well as on-trend goods, the retail stock has a unique niche that can't be tackled by many other rivals. For investors, this position offers plenty of opportunities to grow into the future. Kroger (KR)The grocery business is pretty cutthroat to begin with. Margins tend to be thin, consumers fickle. For many retail stocks that have operated in the sector, bankruptcy has been a forgone conclusion. This is especially true now that e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have entered the market.But Kroger (NYSE:KR) seems to be getting it right, albeit slowly. The firm has been able to leverage its scale as the nation's largest supermarket chain to make a serious go at the new world of omnichannel.This includes unveiling new order ahead options for its products, apps, a big partnership with Instacart, and other tech-oriented consumer experience products. Today, KR has more than 1,685 stores that offer order pickup locations as well as over 2,125 delivery locations for its groceries. That covers about 93% of its customers.These efforts have helped grow digital sales by more than 42% during the first quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Kroger has been copying Amazon and Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) playbooks and moving into so-called alternative revenue streams. This includes media and advertising, customer data, and other real estate investments. KR is on track to start producing some significant revenues this year. So far it crushed its latest earnings estimates and was able to increase its dividend by a whopping 14%.Though KR's moves are working at a slow pace, the grocery giant could be an interesting value among retail stocks. KR is getting it right, it's just taking time. At least you get paid a hefty dividend while you wait. Home Depot (HD)What housing crisis?That's the mantra for home improvement giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD). The retailer continues to see rising sales and demand for various home improvement products and services. And the reason is simple: HD has started to seriously court the next generation of homeowners.Thanks to generally low interest rates and looser lending standards, Gen X and Millennials are finally able to buy homes. But they are not buying move-in ready McMansions. They're buying fixer-uppers that require plenty of sweat equity, which means plenty of trips to Home Depot. Moreover, HD has courted these customers with new omnichannel operations, mobile apps, and customer service experiences.It's working in a big way. Last year, HD pulled in record profits and the streak is continuing this year. Sales for the first quarter of this year increased 5.7% to clock in at $26.4 billion. Earnings per share managed to jump by over 9%. Its continued moves into omnichannel have certainly helped on this front.With the continued revenue and EPS gains, HD has rewarded shareholders in a big way. Thanks to improved results, Home Depot unveiled a new monster $15 billion buyback program and increased its dividend by an insane 32%. And with interest rates set to drop further, more people could be able to buy a home.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond All in all, HD's outlook could be one of the rosiest of all retail stocks. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Grease monkeys and gearheads could give a flip about online and e-commerce sales. Both classic and modern cars require plenty of knowledge and specialized parts, many of which can only be found at your local auto parts store. Moreover, several maintenance issues require special disposal of waste. You can't just chuck old motor oil down the drain. That necessitates a trip to a physical location.All of this could help explain why O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) crushed the market last year.The retail stock has seen plenty of steady single and low double-digit earnings increases over the last few years as the economy continues to expand and miles driven increase. As long as the economy continues to clip at a steady pace, ORLY should be able to get the growth going.Another reason for its success is its management team. The stock is packed with insiders and family ownership. Because of this high ownership, management often takes more long-term views of investments and decisions. Yes, it's about improving quarter to quarter, but its more about building the company over the decades. And ORLY has done just that. During the recession, a decision to expand made the firm the giant it is today.With new moves to court professional garages and a $1 billion buyback now under its belt, ORLY continues to make the right moves in the new retail environment.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt had a long position in AMZN.

2019-07-19,"At some point the confident and positive game bulls have been playing will end. The good news is the party may just be beginning for well-positioned bears in large-cap stocks Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) offering classic topping patterns that are ready for a more troubled and profitable tomorrow. Let me explain.After hitting record highs out-the-gate in Monday's session, it's been a tough week for the broader averages. And maybe rightfully so. The S&P 500, the market's broadest barometer for large-cap stocks is up roughly 20% in 2019 alone. That's nothing to sneeze at. And let's face it, optimism regarding earnings, an endgame to the trade war and future interest rate cuts can only go so far.The fact of the matter is large-cap stocks are facing historically stretched price multiples following a remarkable bull-run of more than 325% over the last decade. But just because the market's rally may be in its final innings doesn't mean wagering profitably in the stock market isn't possible.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Let's now take a look at the price charts of NFLX stock, HD stock and DAL stock and appreciate how a more bearish trend can be an equally friendly and profitable environment for investors taking advantage of today's topping patterns into tomorrow and beyond. Netflix (NFLX)  Click to EnlargeNFLX is the first of our large-cap stocks for shorting. As any investor with even a passing interest in the market knows, Netflix's latest quarterly report which featured surprisingly weak subscription data, didn't sit too well with Wall Street. But the worst may be yet to come.While the S&P 500 has enjoyed its astonishing run, NFLX stock is up a staggering 6,300% since the financial crisis in 2009. But rather than just being dismissive of this amazing rally and betting blindly on the notion all trends do eventually end, this large-cap stock is giving bearish investors a technical-based heads up.Netflix's weekly chart shows shares have just confirmed a lower high after Thursday's post-earnings sell-off. The price action was severe enough to also break below key support put together during 2019. It's looking bad to say the least.With this large-cap stock's bearishly-positioned stochastics and Bollinger Bands just opening up from a pinched position, it's time to short NFLX stock. My recommendation is to place a 6% blended technical and dollar-based stop-loss and look to take initial profits around $250 as shares challenge the December lows. Home Depot (HD)  Click to EnlargeHome Depot is the next of our large-cap stocks for bearish investors. Home Depot hasn't delivered returns like Netflix over the past decade, but gains of more than 1,330% aren't in need of fixing either.The money shot for bears looking to position HD stock is a widening or inverted triangle topping pattern. We're looking at the monthly price chart of Home Depot as our guide for shorting shares.Honestly, this formation isn't likely to result in a complete deconstruction of the prior trend. Still, with Home Depot shares facing angular resistance and a bearish stochastics setup warning of lower prices, a reversal towards $140 - $150 and test of pattern support and the 38% retracement level looks compelling.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now For this large-cap stock I'd suggest a bit of price confirmation and short HD shares below $208 with a stop-loss above the pattern. That works out to risk of less than 6% compared to profits of around 30% if our forecast proves accurate. Delta (DAL)  Click to EnlargeShares of Delta are the last of our three large-cap stocks to short. DAL stock has also been flying high over the past ten years with returns reaching over 1,100%. Over the past couple years those gains have been the result of a bullish-looking channel. I've provided a weekly chart to target a proper short in DAL.With Delta stock in a testing position of pattern resistance and stochastics in overbought territory, the likelihood of a pullback is high. Admittedly, my technical forecast for the airline isn't nearly as gloomy as it is for NFLX or HD, and I suspect Delta's bullish trend will eventually continue. Right here, right now though, DAL stock is on the radar for shorting.My recommendation for shorting this large-cap stock is to wait for a candlestick topping candle to be confirmed. This could happen sometime in the next five days if shares of DAL pass through the low of the current shooting star doji pattern taking shape on the weekly chart.Once positioned I'd suggest a 4% stop-loss. This exits the short slightly above the high of the signal candle. If we're right though and DAL stock is grounded and shares move into the area from $48 - $53, I'd  definitely take profits and possibly even consider going long this large-cap stock as a safe, but profitable landing looks likely.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-22,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips With over a quarter of the S amp P 500 releasing earnings this week we ve officially reached the heart of earnings season And while some traders are comfortable swinging bets into the elevated volatility of these,3 Breakout Stocks to Buy Immediately
2019-07-22,"With over a quarter of the S&P 500 releasing earnings this week, we've officially reached the heart of earnings season. And while some traders are comfortable swinging bets into the elevated volatility of these quarterly events, others desire to sidestep the drama altogether. For this latter group, or anyone seeking sweet looking setups for the new week, these three stocks to buy will be of interest.I've finished my weekend scanning and discovered three powerful stocks eyeing new highs. They all boast powerful up-trends and are one resistance zone away from busting to new 2019 highs.And, perhaps, most importantly, none of them report earnings over the next month, leaving plenty of time to play before the volatility monster comes to town.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Flying, Overvalued Stocks in Danger of Crashing Check out these three breakout stocks to buy for the week. Best Buy (BBY)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Nasty price action plagued Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) heading into and directly following last quarter's earnings announcement. But since finding a bottom in early June, BBY stock has put together quite the consistent little uptrend.The ascent has been strong enough to turn the 20-day moving average higher, and the 50-day has flattened and appears poised to start treading higher. Each pullback materializing in the stock since last month's low has been shallow, short-lived and resulted in powerful upside breakouts.Last week's three-day slide proved no different and ended with a bullish reversal on Friday.Watch for a break out of the $76 resistance zone, then pull the trigger on bullish trades in BBY stock. I like the Sep $75/$80 bull call spread, which currently costs $2. Target (TGT)Source: ThinkorSwim Short of one hiccup, this year's price action for Target (NYSE:TGT) has been quite bullish. TGT stock is now a stone's throw from reaching all-time highs. The ceiling near $90 is all that stands from the retailer and clear blue skies. And I think bull trades are worth a shot once resistance is finally felled.The past six weeks of consolidation have created a stable base to launch from. Friday's test of the ceiling failed, but it's only a matter of time before buyers finally succeed in their breakout bid.  * 7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy for 2019 Watch for a breakout above $89.50, then deploy bull trades. Implied volatility sits at the 12th percentile of its one-year range, so options are cheap right now. I'm mirroring the BBY suggestion with a bull call spread idea. Buy the Sep $90/$95 call vertical for around $1.60 for a cheap upside bet. Home Depot (HD)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Home Depot (NYSE:HD) rounds out today's trio of key stocks to buy now. And while the pattern is more of a retracement than a breakout, it's too pretty to pass up. The past two months have seen a powerful uptrend emerge, delivering multiple breakout and pullback buy opportunities along the way. Last week's four-day retreat is delivering a perfect buy-the-dip opportunity right at the rising 20-day moving average.Also, we're testing the old resistance zone near $213, which could morph into support. Last week's breakout did take HD stock to a new all-time high, so buyers have proved their willingness to pay record-setting prices. If you're willing to bet on trend continuation, then deploying bullish trades here is worth a shot. Wait for a break above Friday's high at $215.23, then enter.With an implied volatility rank of 10%, options can be bought on the cheap. We're continuing our call spread theme with a suggestion to buy the Sep $215/$225 bull call for around $3.70.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-23,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has grown tremendously  over the last 11 years, with few interruptions. Since 2014, Home Depot's profits and HD stock price have increased faster than the profits and stock of  HD's archrival, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Source: Shutterstock However, Lowe's profits have recently begun to increase faster than those of Home Depot. Meanwhile,  the valuation of Home Depot stock remains higher than the valuation of Lowe's shares. Falling interest rates could boost the prospects of both HD stock and Lowe's stock. While I do not think current investors should sell HD stock, Lowe's appears better-positioned for the near-term.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund  Home Depot, Lowe's Battle for GrowthMuch as analysts frequently compare Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to Target (NYSE:TGT), it's difficult to discuss Home Depot stock without comparing it to Lowe's stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHD stock still appears to be outperforming Lowe's stock. The current Home Depot stock price stands at around $212 per share. That represents an increase of almost 35% from the lows of last December. During the same period,  LOW stock has climbed by about 24%.However,  Lowe's profits appear to be increasing faster than Home Depot's at this point. This year, analysts, on average,  expect HD's earnings to rise 2.3%, compared to a 9.2% increase for Lowe's. Both companies' profit growth should accelerate next year. Still, over the two-year period,  Lowe's profits are expected to rise 18.3% versus an 8.8% gain for Home Depot.Moreover, based on the stocks' forward price-earnings (PE) ratio, Home Depot stock appears slightly more expensive. Currently, HD trades at about 19.4 times analysts' average forward earnings estimate, while Lowe's forward PE ratio comes in at around 15.6. Dividends, Interest Rates Keep HD Stock a HoldStill, the dividends of Home Depot stock continue to be more attractive than those of Lowe's. The annual payout of HD stock has reached $5.44 per share, taking its yield to around 2.55%, ahead of Lowe's current 2.15% return. The dividend of HD stock has also risen for six straight years, making its dividend quite stable and dependable.HD stock's dividend may now be the best reason to own Home Depot stock as the company settles into slow-growth mode. HD operates 2,290 stores across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. While that constitutes a massive footprint, it is only six more stores than last year and 50 more than in 2008.In terms of home-improvement stores, the North American market has become saturated. Lowe's failed in its attempt to expand into Australia earlier in the decade. As a result, both HD and Lowe's seem reluctant to consider opening new stores outside of North America.Nonetheless, the market cap of HD stock has risen from just over $24 billion in October 2008 to over $234 billion today. Given this increase, I would encourage the long-term owners of HD stock to hold onto their shares. The company has managed to increase its profits and dividends without opening too many stores. Although HD's profit growth is decelerating this year, analysts think its profits will continue to rise.Moreover, interest rates have fallen substantially in recent months. That could help reignite the housing market, which has plateaued this year. It may also encourage more consumers to remodel their homes. Lower borrowing costs could also provide the needed incentive for the current owners of Home Depot stock to stay the course. The Bottom Line on Home Depot StockConsidering the valuation of HD stock and its gains since 2008, investors have little reason to either buy or sell this equity. Over the past 11 years, HD stock has risen by almost ten-fold on negligible store growth. This speaks to the strength of this company.However, archrival Lowe's profits are now growing more quickly. Moreover, on a forward basis, LOW stock trades at a discount to HD stock. In an environment of falling interest rates, I expect Home Depot stock to hold its own. However, in the near term, I do not expect Home Depot stock to outperform Lowe's stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-24,"We're deep into earnings season now, and with that excitement comes heavy scrutiny from bulls and bears. Today, I'd like to look at how this hype might affect the following home improvement stocks: Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowes (NYSE:LOW) and Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO).It's no secret the financial media is in the business of keeping the story lines flowing and updating investors as to why Wall Street was acting gloomy or gleeful on a particular day. Uncertainty on interest rate policy and the U.S.-China trade war have been popular topics. And it's understandable why battling with China and interest rates matter to big box retail suppliers HD, LOW and TSCO stock.For one, there is a whole lot of &quot;Made in China&quot; going on in Home Depot and its peers. As well, financing and whether we're willing to even think about that latest home project goes hand-in-hand with what's happening with interest rates. But it's not the only thing making Home Depot and its peers move on any given day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow and with earnings season in full swing, the attention has shifted to the latest and greatest or maybe less-than-great earnings reports such as Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) ugly earnings miss. And as with those broader uncertainties, this type of information is bound to be projected onto the likes of HD, LOW and TSCO stock. I get it.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 And as Wall Street's collective fears and cheers get priced into these retail supply stores, the price charts suggest it's time to ring the register in HD and LOW stock and continue shopping at TSCO. Here's more about each. Home Depot (HD)  Click to EnlargeHome Depot shares have enjoyed an incredible bull market since the financial crisis. As they say though, all good things must come to an end. And that could very soon be the case with HD stock.Right now Home Depot stock's monthly chart is establishing a broadening top pattern. It's bearish, but even more so given the rally in shares, as well as a fairly bearish-looking stochastics set-up that's supporting lower prices in the weeks and months ahead.HD Stock Strategy: For shorting HD stock, I'd recommend waiting until next week. The July candle in shares is shaping to complete as a doji pivot high within the broadening pattern. By waiting until August, this bearish entry can receive a bit more price confirmation than otherwise.I'd look to the pattern low near $140 for a downside target and use a breach of a fully formed July candlestick for containing upside risk. Lowes (LOW)  Click to EnlargeLowes is yet another name where investors who are long shares should take profits or consider shorting the stock. The writing isn't entirely on the wall for LOW stock. Still, a weakening monthly up-channel where shares failed at the pattern's mid-line and a canary-like stochastics set-up suggest a larger bearish correction is on its way.LOW Stock Strategy: For shorting LOW stock, I'd also suggest waiting until next week and let July run its course. With shares forming a bearish shooting star doji on the monthly chart, confirmation to short LOW is likely to occur early next month.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund I'd recommend using a stop-loss above the high of the doji to contain risk and not overstay the position in the event the up-channel isn't finished. Tractor Supply (TSCO)  Click to EnlargeNot that I'm saving the best for last, but retail improvement outfit Tractor Supply does have a lot going for it. As the smallest of the discussed supplies chains, TSCO stock logically has the largest opportunity for future out-sized growth if it can move into untapped markets or penetrate existing markets further.There are no guarantees TSCO stock will live up to this potential.

2019-07-24,Here are five different ways to invest in housing that could have very bright futures ahead of them.,5 Top Housing Stocks to Buy Now
2019-07-24,"It's inevitable: no matter where you turn, growth stocks generate the most headlines. Typically, these are companies involved in next-generation technologies. As a result, they simply attract risk-takers wanting to speculate on the next big thing. However, investors with longer-term and more realistic goals should consider dividend stocks.For one thing, dividend stocks obviously provide passive income. Therefore, they provide a platform of stability which will likely come at a premium. We all know that this is the longest-running bull market in history. Therefore, the best stocks to buy might not be related to companies that move under risk-on environments.Second, many if not most dividend stocks are levered toward secular industries that feature consistent demand irrespective of economic conditions. Areas such as consumer staples, healthcare, and even energy are increasingly becoming safe bets because they represent unavoidable expenditures. That's a key concept to consider as the ugly U.S.-China trade war rages on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFinally, the Federal Reserve is all but incentivizing dividend stocks. Although the economy is doing well on paper, the Fed will likely lower benchmark interest rates at July's end. Essentially, the central bank is determined to nip any sign of a broader slowdown in the bud.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Under such circumstances, it's almost criminal not to consider dividend stocks to buy. Here at the best ones to buy, divided among investments appropriate for conservative, balanced, and speculative portfolios. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock Whenever discussions arise about safe dividend stocks to buy, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) immediately rises near the top. Obviously, the company generates strong secular demand. Recession or not, people still have to renovate their properties or rebuild after a calamitous weather-related event. Thus, HD stock steadily inches higher, even though it's hardly the sexiest name.That said, HD stock is enduring a rare PR crisis. Billionaire co-founder Bernie Marcus recently pledged his support for President Donald Trump's re-election bid. After the initial word got out, the social media circus responded with outrage, calling for a Home Depot boycott.But is this enough of a reason to dump HD stock? Absolutely not! No matter what the circumstance, Home Depot is easily one of the best stocks to buy. Perhaps folks should realize first and foremost that this is America. The beauty about living in this country is that the people can vote for whomever they want.Secondly, Home Depot's business is largely Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)-proof. With products like power tools or kitchen tiles, you really want to try before you buy. Right now, e-commerce just doesn't suit this consumer need, which bolsters the case for HD stock. TD Ameritrade (AMTD)Under almost any circumstance in the pre-mass digitalization era, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) represented one of the best dividend stocks to buy. For one thing, AMTD stock brought steady capital returns, and for good reason: if you want to build wealth, the equity markets offered a simple and intuitive platform.But in the current era where millennials reign in the workforce, AMTD stock doesn't seem like such a smart bet. That's because millennials eschew the markets for cash, more so than any other generation. And why? Primarily, most millennials came of age during the 2008 financial crisis. Understandably, that event scarred young workers and put them off investing.So why even mention AMTD stock? Because no matter what happens, we'll always have a stock market. I'm saying this even though I personally hold cryptocurrencies in high regard.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Moreover, emerging and transformative investments like legal marijuana have enticed young buyers. As our own Will Ashworth reported, millennials consider companies like Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) among the best stocks to buy. Therefore, we haven't heard the last from AMTD stock. Unilever (UN)Unilever (NYSE:UN) represents the more traditional route of safe dividend stocks to buy for purely obvious reasons. As a producer of common household goods such as soap, deodorant, and skincare products, UN stock rides on secular demand. Even in a recession, you still need to take care of yourself.And the latter point is especially compelling for investors seeking the best stocks to buy in a possible downturn. Although the fact that we're on the longest bull market in history is an oft-discussed topic that may have lulled some to ignore the implications, a correction can come at any moment. If it does, passive-income generating investments like UN stock will probably suffer the least damage.Plus, you can have confidence in Unilever's solid financials. Sure, it doesn't have the cool factor of a fast-rising tech upstart. However, with UN stock, you get robust net income, which in turn helps generate consistently strong free cash flow.Where the market is right now, stability and trust may come at a premium. Therefore, keep UN stock close to your chest. Welltower (WELL)One of the most compelling dividend stocks to buy, Welltower (NYSE:WELL) is a real-estate investment trust specializing in senior care. In addition to this critical provision, Welltower brings to the table other highly-demanded services such as post-acute care and outpatient medical solutions. As a result of its diverse portfolio, WELL stock has jumped about 20% year-to-date.If you follow demographic trends, you'll recognize very quickly how much potential upside this company has. Earlier this year, I discussed the generational tailwinds that should drive WELL stock higher over the longer-term. Primarily, baby boomers are the largest living generation in the U.S. Logically, as more of these people transition to retirement, they'll require senior-care services.Of course, the countering argument against WELL stock is that a majority of Americans are not prepared for retirement. This includes a great number of baby boomers.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Certainly, that's an issue for WELL stock. But at the same time, an increasing number of millennials support their senior parents or even grandparents. Therefore, in my opinion, the long-haul picture for Welltower remains robust. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Historically, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has been one of the best stocks to buy, to the chagrin of drivers everywhere. Unlike many other investments, XOM stock is perpetually stuck in an awkward situation. If Exxon Mobil shares rise, it obviously pleases stakeholders. However, the lift also implies that gas prices have spiked, drawing scorn from the public.Now, XOM stock has another challenge, but one that's more impactful than road-raging drivers: the advent of electric vehicles. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have demonstrated that EVs can transition effectively from conceptual drawings to the production floor. Despite the rumblings in the TSLA share price, Tesla EVs have dominated the California luxury-auto market.Naturally, this presents a dark cloud over XOM stock. But should stakeholders worry?They should, but maybe not for a while. Although EV automakers have forwarded profound innovations, it will take time for societies to catch up. For instance, the U.S. transportation network is largely fossil-fuel based. Transitioning this network to an electrical-based infrastructure will probably take decades. That's why you're safe with XOM stock for now. AbbVie (ABBV)Another high-profile name mired in an awkward circumstance is AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV). Ordinarily, top-shelf pharmaceutical specialists experience generally steady market increases due to their critical, and sometimes life-saving products. However, ABBV stock hasn't been among the best stocks to buy this year; indeed, it's very much the opposite.Since January's opening price, ABBV stock has shed an alarming 25%. What's more, shares were holding steady between late January until late June. That was when AbbVie's management team disclosed their intent to buy out Allergan (NYSE:AGN). Investors didn't like the move, which would balloon the acquiring company's debt to unsightly levels.Also weighing on ABBV stock throughout this year is the specter of federal regulation. Specifically, rising drug prices have rankled patients. Aggressively, politicians from both sides of the aisle have directed criticism at drug-makers and our failing healthcare system.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Still, AbbVie has such a broad and viable drug pipeline that I think these issues will eventually fade. Plus, the dividend yield for ABBV stock stands at a remarkable 6.2%. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock If you're looking for high-yielding dividend stocks to buy, telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) is a name that comes up often. With a yield of more than 6%, T stock provides a lot of safety buffer, especially if we head into a recession. That said, the company also attracts a lot of criticism.Even though I'm a fairly recent shareholder, I can't say that I completely disagree with the naysayers. What comes up most often is that T stock has an extremely heavy debt load. In addition, as our own Vince Martin noted, AT&T is a low-growth entity. At some point, if core financial metrics don't improve, that lofty dividend may not last.However, as InvestorPlace contributor Laura Hoy explained, T stock might work out for those willing to exercise patience. For instance, management is focusing on profitability as opposed to market share. And as the 5G rollout becomes an increasing reality, AT&T should experience a sizable demand lift. Altria Group (MO)As with AT&T, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) attracts investors for its massive 6.4% dividend yield. But in recent years, MO stock hasn't really belonged on a list of best dividend stocks to buy. Although Altria -- which is most famous for the iconic Marlboro brand -- is a vice play, it has one crucial problem: people aren't smoking like they used to.That's especially true for millennials, who have largely shunned the behavior. Logically, this is a huge headwind for MO stock, which explains its volatility. However, what I like here is that management hasn't given up. They're going after what millennials do like, and that's weed.In the tail end of 2018, Altria made headlines when it invested $1.8 billion in Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). But once was massive optimism has faded this year. Did Altria make a mistake?  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills I don't think so. Marijuana firms have suffered because of legal and administrative challenges beyond their control. But once these obstacles fade, cannabis should rise. Therefore, I wouldn't give up yet on MO stock. AMC Entertainment (AMC)If you're basing your dividend stocks to buy on irrelevancy, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) would probably jump to the top of the list. When you have streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dominating in-home entertainment, AMC stock seems anachronistic. Also, it doesn't help that the company's cineplexes are almost always located in shopping centers, which themselves are fading.So why gamble on AMC stock, especially since it has lost so much money? Unlike other risky names, I know the pain because my stake isn't in the black. However, I genuinely believe that the markets are overreacting to bad news. For instance, it's not the company's fault that most of this year's top draws will be released toward the latter end of this year.Beyond that, AMC stock offers an experience that you can't replicate in the living room. And relative to other forms of entertainment, the box office is cheap. That's going to play a major role if the economy stumbles into a recession.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock and AMC stock.

2019-08-07,"The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is the largest home improvement retailer. HD stock is viewed as an important tell on several marquee economic data points, including consumer-related and housing numbers.Source: Shutterstock Home Depot stock is the second-largest component in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLY) behind a company called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, Home Depot is a mature consumer cyclical name. As such, it's not as volatile nor as richly valued as some of the growth-ier names in this sector. HD stock trades for less than 19x forward earnings.Up 21.89% year-to-date, Home Depot stock has been one of the steadier members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a theme that should continue because the company is not one at the epicenter of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes noted of HD stock price &quot;that while the shares might seem pricey after their 2019 run, he thinks that same-store sales will increase in the second half of the year, bolstered by strategic investments in the business, giving the rally fresh legs,&quot; according to Barron's.The company reports earnings on Tuesday, Aug. 20 with analysts expecting earnings of $3.09 per share, up from $3.05 a year earlier. A Winner in a Shifting Retail EnvironmentAs has been widely noted, the retail industry is experiencing a revolution, one that is likely to result in more store closures over the coming years. That doesn't mean all brick-and-mortar stores will disappear, but the trends at a play in the retail space will ensure the physical stores that remain will likely be those of stronger companies. For a variety of reasons, Home Depot will be one of the remainders (and winners) as retail undergoes a major face-lift.&quot;Other catalysts for top-line growth could come from the firm's efficient supply chain, improved merchandising technology, and penetration of adjacent customer product segments (like commercial),&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;Expansion of both new (like textiles from the Company Store acquisition) and existing (appliances could grow post-Sears bankruptcy) categories could also drive demand.&quot;Home Depot is also a wide-moat company, meaning it poses significant barriers to entry to would-be rivals. Lowes's (NYSE:LOW) is HD stock's big primary competitor, but it hasn't been much of a competition in terms of price action. Over the past five years, Home Depot stock is up more than 150% while Lowe's is higher by just 100%, according to Bloomberg data.Over that same period, HD stock has beaten XLY by a margin of more than 2-to-1, indicating that it has been one of the best large-cap consumer discretionary names not called Amazon over that span. Bottom Line on HD StockPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but Home Depot stock can continue being a long-term winner because of the company's excellence in execution, pricing power, wide moat and resilience in the face of rising online retail sales.&quot;Home improvement retailers remain one of the best-insulated sectors from e-commerce threats, as the high weight/value ratio of many products prohibit cost-effective shipping and the specialized knowledge base employees offer is difficult to replicate,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;These strengths have helped Home Depot deliver adjusted average returns on invested capital of 31% during the past five years, after the last housing downturn and focusing on its core orange box business.&quot;Yes, Home Depot stock is a tad pricey right now, but if its management can boost margins and return on invested capital, the HD stock price may grow into that valuation, muting the expensive nature of it.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-09,"Lately it seems that the turnaround in General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock is on track, but should we believe the hype? The decision is actually quite easy for General Electric stock investors.Source: Shutterstock Since hitting an intermediate peak a bit over three years ago on the heels of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, General Electric continues to demonstrate the once-mighty industrial blue-chip is on the mend. The company's Q2 earnings confessional at the end of July is proof of that.In a nutshell, General Electric delivered a profit and revenue beat for its second quarter, while raising its full-year profit forecast by a nickel to a range of 55 cents to 65 cents per share. The company also offered upwardly revised free cash flow guidance and noted improvements and signs of stabilization in its sluggish power business, which has been a formidable Achilles Heel for GE stock's turnaround story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street's reaction to the report though, proved skeptical. After taking shares to a fleeting marginal five-month high, it has been all downhill. General Electric stock is off roughly 12% and near its three-month lows just several sessions past the earnings event.  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered So, what are today's investors to believe, the quarterly report and GE's update on its business situation? Or is the weak response on the General Electric stock chart to be respected? It's our observation it's time to embrace a turnaround off and on the price chart with shares now strategically positioned for bullish investors. General Electric Stock Daily ChartDespite enjoying a year-to-date gain of around 23%, which rivals its former Dow Jones constituents Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), it hasn't been an easy ride for GE stock bulls. Shares were up as much as 55% in late February. And over the past few months there have been plenty of occasions filled with despair and hope as shares have meandered laterally.In the here and now though, it would be very hard to argue against General Electric stock's bullish positioning. Technically, shares have formed and confirmed a higher low pivot that's nestled across the longer-term 200-day simple moving average. GE's stochastics are also oversold and mostly conducive of buying this past week's pullback into trend support.Ultimately, GE stock offers a low-risk foothold into shares with the potential for outsized returns. If you see the company's turnaround as the real deal and another about-face readying within GE stock's uptrend, a quarter risked is either a great investment or certainly a well-conceived and smart exit strategy.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-13,"There's nothing better than getting paid for just holding on to an asset. Except if those dividends are paid monthly. Stocks that pay their dividends every month can provide faster compounding when those payouts are reinvested, not to mention budget simplification. After all, mortgage payments, car loans and utility bills are due every month. The only problem is, the number of individual stocks that pay their dividends monthly have been slowly dwindling over the years.Luckily, plenty of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have moved in to fill the void.While the vast majority of monthly dividend ETFs own bond and fixed income assets, there are more than 40 funds that invest in equities. With these ETFs, investors can gain valuable diversification benefits, decent yields, and a steady monthly paycheck. In many cases, buying the diversified dividend ETF makes more sense than buying individual stocks that pay monthly. This can be especially true for those in or near retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Do you buy a monthly dividend ETF? Which fund? How do you separate the wheat from the chaff? Luckily, InvestorPlace has done some of the work for you.With that, here are three monthly dividend ETFs worthy of your portfolio. Monthly Dividend ETFs to Buy: WisdomTree U.S. Total Dividend Fund (DTD)Dividend Yield: 2.13%If you're looking for a single-core fund to provide plenty of monthly dividends, then the WisdomTree U.S. Total Dividend Fund (NYSEARCA:DTD) has to be the first stop. Not only is DTD one of the oldest and largest monthly dividend ETFs on the market, it also has some of the widest coverage out of any ETF out there.WisdomTree is known for its fundamentally weighted and proprietary indexes. DTD is no different and racks the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Index. This index screens and weights firms by the number of dividends they are projected to pay in the upcoming year.The best part is that the ETF does this across large-, mid-, and small-cap U.S. stocks. That's important as many dividend ETFs only focus on the big guys. Small- and mid-cap stocks can pay amazing dividends as well.Holdings for the ETF range from giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to relative unknowns like J&J Snack Foods (NASDAQ:JJSF). All in all, with the inclusion of small- and mid-cap stocks, DTD boosts its holdings north of 860. This wide net provides plenty of diversification.It also pays some decent dividends. Currently, DTD pays a market-beating 2.13% yield. And the ETF has paid that dividend monthly since its inception. This yield, expanse of holdings, and monthly payment makes DTD one of the best core solutions for income seekers.Expenses for this dividend ETF run at a cheap 0.28%- or $28 per $10,000 invested. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)Dividend Yield: 2.10%For many retirees or investors near retirement, owning small-caps can provide some restless nights of sleep. After all, even dividend-paying smaller stocks still provide plenty of volatility. To that end, focusing on the big boys could be the way to go. And you can't get much bigger than the Dow Jones Industrial Average.While the Dow Jones does get called a flawed index due to its weighting formula, you can't deny that the index holds 30 of the biggest and most stable blue-chips in the world. This has a ton of appeal for investors.The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEArca:DIA) is the way to gain access.The &quot;Diamonds&quot; hold all thirty stocks in the index and provide access to leading firms like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Visa (NYSE:V). It really is a who's who of America's leaders and provides instant access to these blue chips. The ETF is very liquid and trades millions of shares per day. Moreover, expenses for the fund are super cheap at just 0.17%.Unlike its holdings -- which pay quarterly dividends -- the DIA pays its dividend every month. This allows investors to own the biggest stocks in the nation and get the needed income to fit their budget. No wonder why more than $21 billion worth of investor cash sits in this dividend ETF.  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now The fund is a great way to score a good monthly dividend from stocks. Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)Dividend Yield: 9.14%A quick scan of many of the top individual monthly dividend pay stocks happens to be mortgage REITs (mREITs) or business development companies (BDCs). Given the nature of their underlying businesses, stocks in these categories tend to be on the riskier side of things. Not to mention, they can be a bit difficult for laymen to evaluate and research. As a result, stocks like mREIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) compensate investors for that risk with yields in excess of 11%.But there is a way to score the high yield, reduce risk, and still get a monthly payout. That's through Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (NYSEArca:KBWD).KBWD tracks the KBW NASDAQ Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index, an index of mREITs, BDCs, and other high-yield financial stocks. With it, investors can access up to 40 different stocks in these categories. This helps cut down on the risk and potential issues with individual stocks in the sector. However, what investors don't sacrifice is income. KBWD's broad portfolio still allows it to provide a massive 9%-plus dividend yield.Like the other two dividend ETFs on this list, KBWD pays their dividend monthly. Expenses for the fund clock in at just 0.35%.With its broad access to these risky stocks and its high yield, KBWD could be one of the best dividend ETFs to boost your overall monthly income.

2019-08-13,"Hop into the time machine with me and travel back about five years. At that time, SolarCity was the residential and small-commercial solar installer. The firm continued to rack up plenty of clients and was seen as the next big thing. Unfortunately, thanks to the constant need for funding, rising debt costs and new competition, SolarCity ran into some serious issues. Racing towards insolvency, the solar firm received a big buyout from Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. And in the years since the 2016 rescue plan, investors have sort of forgotten about SolarCity and Tesla's solar operations. Heck, Tesla management didn't even mention &quot;solar&quot; on its last conference call.Source: Shutterstock But thanks to a series of tweets from Musk, TSLA and its solar plans are once back into the spotlight.Don't be fooled. TSLA stock and its assets picked up from SolarCity are a disaster and they continue to be a huge drain on the firm. The reality is, the buyout of SolarCity was simply a bailout -- and one that won't bear any fruit for investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips TSLA Struggles in SolarSolarCity was supposed to be a jewel in Musk's crown. The idea was that Tesla would transform itself into a total green-energy company -- supplying vehicles, solar panels and battery storage solutions to take consumers off the ground and away from fossil fuels. On the surface, that was a great plan. When TSLA picked up SolarCity (which had Musk as its chairman) back in 2016 for $2.6 billion, the firm was the top solar installer. At its peak, SolarCity was installing more than 200 megawatts worth of solar panels per quarter.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates And then the clouds came.Thanks to its constant need for creative funding to get those panels into consumers' hands, rising competition from smaller installers like Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR), as well as dwindling subsidies for solar panels, SolarCity hit hard times. Under the TSLA umbrella, the clouds have only gotten thicker. These days, SolarCity and Tesla's solar ambitions seem to be running on life support -- with newly installed wattage dropping like a stone.During its last reported quarter, Tesla installed just 29 megawatts worth of solar panels. That's lower than the 47 megawatts it installed during the first quarter of the year and lower than the 73 megawatts installed during the fourth quarter of 2018. Looking out further, that's a 65% drop year-over-year and nearly 90% plunge from its all-time quarterly installation record of 258 megawatts.To make matters worse, Tesla stock has seen its solar installations drop while rivals have actually seen steady numbers or even increases to installed capacity. Taking a look at rivals, RUN managed to install more than 86 megawatts last reported quarter and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) added 52 megawatts worth a capacity. Tesla Tries to Reignite SolarWhat really stinks is that TSLA has been trying hard to save the business. Tesla cut its prices down to just $2 per watt after accounting for tax benefits. It fired its door-to-door and store-based sales staff and moved to a strictly online model. It also ended its agreement with Home Depot (NYSE:HD) to market panels. And speaking of those panels, Tesla now offers basic and standardized systems. Those solar roof tiles that Musk promised right after snagging SolarCity have failed to come to fruition.Meanwhile, Musk is doing what he does best -- acting like P.T. Barnum and throwing out hope.After management basically forgot to mention solar on their last conference call, Musk sent out a series of tweets talking about ramping up production. Tesla hopes to turn out about 1,000 solar roofs per week by the end of this year. For TSLA stock bulls, this was great news. The once-mighty solar stock was coming back.And yet, analysts peg that production as impossible given the low adoption rate so far and the fact that it hasn't even completed its Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo yet. That plant was specifically designed for its solar roof project. So far, despite being around for nearly three years or so and collecting numerous customer deposits, Greentech Media reports that TSLA has connected just a dozen solar-integrated roofs to the grid. Debt Is the Real IssueThe original idea behind the acquisition of SolarCity was that the integration of solar assets would help spur its storage and vehicle sales. By offering an all-in-one package, Tesla would be a total green energy firm. Unfortunately, that bill of goods hasn't happened, as evident by still-declining solar sales.However, TSLA did get something for its troubles -- a ton of debt.SolarCity's business model basically ran on debt in order to make it work. That pumped it full of various convertible bonds, solar bonds, senior loans and other asset-backed securities. That huge debt burden was one of the main reasons why TSLA swallowed the firm in the first place. Today, that legacy debt from SolarCity makes up around one-third of Tesla's overall debt outstanding. Moreover, that debt continues to weaken the electric vehicle manufacturer's position.While in recent quarters the growth in its auto operations have lessened the impact of the solar debt, Tesla still needs to raise money to finance expansion on the vehicle side. With such a huge noose around its neck, that could become complicated. During the spring, S&P Global Ratings highlighted this fact and put Tesla on a negative credit watch -- highlighting SolarCity's impact on the firm's credit situation. TSLA Stock Is Still a Risky PlayWhen Tesla first bought SolarCity, I was skeptical of adding the solar firm's operations into the vehicle makers umbrella. Turns out that might have been the right call. Deterioration of those assets have only quickened pace, while the debt has continued to harm TSLA's position.In the end, Musk and Tesla's recent moves to hype the solar business most likely won't bear serious fruit and should follow the pattern of over-promising and under-delivering. Solar is a rock around the firm's neck and should continue to be so. TSLA stock remains a risky trade and nothing more.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-14,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips This morning the equity markets are falling on the headline that the yield curve has inverted but that doesn t mean there aren t great stocks to buy It is nice to know that a stock like Home Depot NYSE HD,Home Depot Stock Will Reach $230 Sooner Than You Think
2019-08-14,"This morning the equity markets are falling on the headline that the yield curve has inverted but that doesn't mean there aren't great stocks to buy. It is nice to know that a stock like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) only has one real competitor in the U.S., which is Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). And it's even better to know that HD stock is 30% cheaper than LOW.Source: Shutterstock And what is even more awesome than that is that HD is also performing five times better year-to-date than LOW.So if the overall equity thesis is still bullish, and stocks will be higher in the future than now, then the Home Depot stock is a buy. This is especially true if investors have a time frame longer than a few ticks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is a temporary hitch in the logic now because Home Depot's earnings report is approaching. Such events are binary in nature. That means the short-term reaction in HD will solely depend on trader sentiment, not the facts themselves.In other words, even if Home Depot management delivers a home run earnings report, we don't know if the traders will accept it as positive. It is impossible to forecast the direction of the stock into its following open. That is why we do homework and decide on the viability of holding a stock like HD for at least the mid-term.Additionally, the fundamentals and the technicals also suggest that the upside scenario in HD stock is still more likely than the disaster scenario.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul For about 18 months, Home Depot stock has been fighting over a neckline around $205 per share. Last year, the September rally failed as the whole market crashed into Christmas.But since then, HD fans rallied the stock back up to the same neckline and beat it. They have clearly established higher-lows in HD stock attacking a long-term standing neckline. More often than not, these end in a breakout more unless management errs in a big way. Home Depot Stock Has a Big Rally Setup Looming AboveSince July, HD stock set a double top near $220 per share. But unlike most traders, I don't consider those as omens to absolute tops. As long as HD is setting higher lows, $220 then becomes a clear target to beat. And if that happens, more momentum sellers will jump into the rally and HD stock will spike at least $10 from there.For the last two years, the weekly Home Depot chart shows the stock is consolidating inside a wide range. This usually sets of a solid floor underneath, so in this case the bulls will have support to embark on their next upside scenario.Moreover, Home Depot stock is not expensive as it sells at price-to-earnings ratio of 21. This is much cheaper than LOW's and in line with most companies with similar growth. So owning the stock for the long-term, even at these levels, is not likely to be a financial disaster.Can the price go down? Sure, but as part of normal price action. The only reason Home Depot would fail completely is a story line that doesn't yet exist.The Federal Reserve is committed to keeping long-term rates low. This will encourage people to spend money on their homes. It also entices businesses to build and expand. A lot of this money will end up in Home Depot stores.Given the current geopolitical economic environment, and since all central banks are also committed to global expansion, shorting Home Depot fundamentally is wrong.We are still in headline mode where fundamentals fall hostage to tweets and state media releases. So clearly for the short-term we do have bumps in the road. The economic battle with China stalled and is a source of angst for Wall Street.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale But nothing has changed in the last year. Both countries still need to come to a truce and will eventually get to it. It is just a matter of time before investors can stop selling on knee-jerk reactions for extraneous reasons.Meanwhile, companies like Home Depot are still delivering great reports so there are no wheels falling off the hinges here. This is not last December and definitely not 1999. I consider this to be a fundamental trade with a relaxed stop below.Of course, I never risk more than I can afford to lose and most importantly, I don't enter an entire position all at once. This leaves room to adjust size in order to manage the trade.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-16,"In normal circumstances, off-price discount retailers like TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) offer a straightforward investment thesis. Selling name-brand fashion and household goods far below their regular retail price, TJX stock broadly appeals to investors. Furthermore, the company's attractive rates create a moat against disruptive e-commerce stores.Source: Shutterstock That said, TJ Maxx stock took a beating starting from the middle of this week. With the shocking 800-point drop in the Dow Jones on Wednesday, virtually all companies saw red ink. Furthermore, TJX Companies faces an acute threat from the ongoing and escalating U.S.-China trade war.As everybody knows, TJX stock lives on profitability margins. Their business revolves around taking off-season or otherwise discounted goods and passing the savings onto customers. However, a protracted trade war risks common goods and apparel from suffering a price hike. Eventually, this translates to higher costs for TJ Maxx, which directly impacts their more price-sensitive customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall However, this circumstance most likely won't impact the upcoming TJX earnings report for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Analysts are expecting a solid showing, in line with prior results. Still, recent macro-economic headwinds will impact how you approach TJ Maxx stock. Let's take a deeper look: TJX Earnings Should Beat, but Guidance Will Be KeyFor Q2, consensus estimates peg TJX earnings per share at 62 cents. This is in the middle of a narrow forecast spectrum, which ranges from 60 cents to 64 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the discount retailer produced an EPS of 59 cents, besting consensus of 53 cents. Therefore, a beat is well within reason, given the company's impressive growth trajectory.Speaking of growth, analysts forecast revenue to hit a consensus target of $9.9 billion. Again, the forecast range was very narrow, from $9.8 billion to $10 billion. In Q2 fiscal 2019, top-line sales came in at $9.3 billion. As with expectations for TJX earnings, it's not unreasonable to anticipate a revenue beat.Ordinarily, I'd expect TJX stock to jump both ahead of the print and after it. Fundamentally, TJ Maxx has done what few retailers have: offer a viable alternative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online threats.More impressively, the underlining business for TJ Maxx stock doesn't lend itself to organic protection. This isn't Home Depot (NYSE:HD), where consumers must absolutely have the perfect product. Instead, we're talking about apparel and home goods, not exactly mission-critical stuff.Further, 44% of online consumers begin their e-commerce window-shopping on Amazon. Thus, Amazon has countless opportunities for spur-of-the-moment purchases. Yet TJX stock has performed very well up until recently due to attractive prices, rotating inventory, and powerful initiatives like targeted mobile ads.But because we have this nasty trade war, most retailers understandably face credibility questions. And that's why TJX stock won't have an easy go just because management hits all the right notes for the print. Instead, it's guidance that will count.How they will spin this is tough to predict. Like I said, TJ Maxx stock depends on margins which the trade war threatens. How to Approach TJX StockWhen strategizing your next move, it helps to adopt a practical approach. On one hand, the TJX earnings report will likely highlight the reasons why you're thinking about these shares. Additionally, TJ Maxx stock appeals to those who seek protection from a broader market downturn.Because no matter what happens in the economy, people need to buy clothes. This dynamic alone will make TJX stock incredibly relevant.Further, deflated consumer sentiment may actually help TJ Maxx at Amazon's expense. If belt-tightening occurs, consumers are less likely to pay for things like shipping or premium subscriptions. Instead, they'll hop into their cars and shop at brick-and-mortar retailers.But on the other hand, this market decline probably represents a sign of things to come. We've been riding the longest bull market in history. Inevitably, we'll have some kind of corrective action. And in this context, I believe TJX faces volatility risks.Therefore, I'd probably sit out doing anything rash prior to and immediately following the TJX earnings report. Let the markets fully digest these macro-headwinds, and then carefully buy into the discount.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-16,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar turns to retail next week. And that might not be a good thing for the sector.To be sure, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) did post a strong Q2 report on Thursday, with raised full-year guidance leading WMT stock to rally 6%. But that followed a disastrous report from Macy's (NYSE:M), which cut its outlook and saw its stock plunge to a post-financial crisis low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat split isn't a surprise to anyone who has followed the retail industry in recent years. Those companies with the scale to manage through a quickly changing environment have been able to at least survive, if not thrive. (Walmart stock, for instance, has roughly doubled from late 2015 lows.) Smaller operators, with few exceptions, have taken a beating.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Earnings reports next week seem unlikely to change that trend. But specialty retailers like Gap (NYSE:GPS) and department store operators Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) will do their best to fight the tide. Meanwhile, three more leaders in the sector will try and keep pace, while a struggling tech giant attempts a turnaround of its own. Broad markets will struggle with their own external challenges, but retailers, in particular, have a big week ahead. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Aug. 20, before market openFiscal second-quarter earnings from Home Depot (NYSE:HD) will be closely watched. After all, Home Depot sits at the intersection of several of the fears rattling the market right now. Investors are worried that a recession is coming: Any weakness in consumer demand could be reflected in Home Depot sales.Increased -- and then delayed -- tariffs have amplified those cyclical concerns. Home Depot said after Q1 that it was working to mitigate the impact of those duties, but still forecast a potential impact of $1 billion annually.HD stock already has pulled back about 8% amid those worries. Any weakness in Tuesday morning's report could add to the declines.Meanwhile, rival Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) follows on Wednesday. If both reports disappoint, that would be a signal that even two of the country's strongest retailers aren't immune to external factors. And that would be a big problem for the rest of retail, and maybe even the rest of the market. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Aug. 21, before market openFor Target (NYSE:TGT), Wednesday morning's report will help answer which side of the retail divide the company sits. Is Target a real competitor to the likes of Walmart and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)? Or is it not quite large enough, or strong enough, to completely determine its own destiny?Trading in TGT stock over the past few quarters shows that investors haven't quite figured out which side to take. Target stock touched $90 less than a year ago and was at $60 three months later. A 25% rally so far this year shows some confidence, while an ~8% drop in recent weeks (not coincidentally similar to that of HD stock) reflects the rising external risks.And so this seems like an important, and maybe even crucial, earnings report for Target. Walmart's blowout quarter sets the bar high. Target has tariff and macro issues of its own. The stock is cheap enough that it can rise if margins keep expanding. But it's expensive enough that it can fall if they don't.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On In short, the question is whether Target is a retail leader? Wednesday's report will help answer that question. VMWare (VMW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Aug. 22, after market closeKey earnings reports next week go beyond the retail space. Software developer VMWare (NYSE:VMW) has an important report on Thursday afternoon. And it won't just impact VMW stock.VMWare earnings will move shares of Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL) whose majority stake in VMWare is worth more than its current market capitalization. (Dell has earnings of its own, but VMWare numbers will be the big mover.) Meanwhile, the company's reported interest in Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) could be a topic of conversation on the post-earnings conference call.But the Pivotal deal and Dell's potential plans for its VMW stake are just noise. VMWare simply has to stem the bleeding. The stock has dropped by 30% just since May. Here, too, cyclical fears are a factor, but soft fiscal first-quarter earnings in late May didn't help the cause. At 20x forward earnings, VMWare stock can rally if the company can deliver. At the moment, however, that seems like a big if.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Gap, Dell and is short call options in VMWare.

2019-08-19,"[Editor's note: This article was originally published in July 2019. It has since been updated to reflect changes in the market.]Investing in penny stocks can be appealing to some. And investing in marijuana penny stocks can be even more appealing … if you're willing to take massive risks. But with great risks comes even greater potential rewards.Surely, in an industry with the growth potential of cannabis there must be some stocks out there that are future millionaire makers. But, while every investor has dreams of finding the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) amid the pile of cheap stocks, you need to be very careful when investing in any highly risky area of the markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter all, these companies are penny stocks for a reason. And most of them will not survive.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The following marijuana penny stocks are offer interesting opportunities for investors willing to take risks on the future of the marijuana industry. While note of these are flat-out buys in my book -- you have to make your own decisions -- these companies have all recently had some positive developments that might make them good long-term plays. GrowGeneration Corp (GRWG)GrowGeneration Corp (OTCMKTS:GRWG) sells products for hydroponic growing. GRWG announced in July that it has appointed Bob Nardelli as a strategic advisor. As the former CEO of Home Depot (NYSE:HD), its pretty obvious that he will bring tremendous experience and wisdom to the table.The company just reported its Q2 2019 results and they looked pretty good. Net income was $1,062,000. During the same period last year, the company reported a loss of $929,959.  Same store sales were up 23% versus last year's quarter. In addition, the gross profit margin increased to 29.9% from 24.2% for Q2 2018.Despite these positives, the stock is overbought and there is resistance at the $5.05 level, which is just above where it is trading. This level was resistance last year in April and September. 48North Cannabis Corp (NRTH)48North Cannabis Corp (TSE:NRTH) grows and sells medical marijuana. I like this company because it is an outdoor organic grower and I think this type of growing will be the way the industry trends … 48North is already ahead of the curve.The company just announced Charles Vennat as its Chief Corporate Officer. Mr. Vennat is an experienced veteran who was most recently the President of Bastos of Canada. He will drive the company's business plan and strategic vision.The marijuana industry is full of incompetent management teams. Many are comprised of idealistic entrepreneurs who got the business up and running but don't have the skills to manage it as it grows.  * 10 Mid-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Bringing in senior level management could give NRTH an advantage over is competitors that are managed by people with less experience. The company also announced that it has successfully completed its first shipment to the Ontario Cannabis Store. This marks its entry into Ontario's recreational retail market. Body & Mind Inc (BMMJ)Body & Mind Inc (OTCMKTS:BMMJ) is involved in the provision of medical cannabis. This company operates in Nevada, California, Ohio and Arkansas. It just announced that it has qualified to trade on the OTCBQ Venture Market.Typically when a company qualifies to be listed on an exchange investors consider it a positive thing. This will provide greater transparency and more liquidity for the penny stock.In addition, last month, Body and Mind announced that is has been added to the Horizons U.S. Marijuana Index ETF. This will give the company greater exposure to investors.Maybe this news will help turn the price of the stock around. Since April, it is has dropped from $2.60 to 62 cents. Flower One Holdings Inc (FLOOF)Flower One Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:FLOOF) produces and sells wholesale cannabis. This company just reported its Q2 2019 results and it exceeded expectations.In addition, the company announced that it has also obtained up to $30 million in debt financing and that its stock has been upgraded from the OTCBQ to the OTCQX exchange.From a technical perspective, the stock is at an interesting inflection point. It is testing support around the $1.80 level. This level was also support in March and June. If it breaks, the stock could make a rapid move lower.This is because it gapped up in February and gaps tend to refill quickly. Support is formed when sellers believe they made a mistake selling after the stock goes higher. They tell themselves that if it comes back down to the level they will buy it back. This demand for the stock at a particular level is what forms support.  * 7 Vanguard Funds for Conservative Investors Because FLOOF spent such a limited amount of time trading between $1.20 and $1.80 in February, there probably wasn't enough time for meaningful support in this zone. And thanks to this lack of support, the gap could be refilled quickly. Global Hemp Group (GBHPF)Global Hemp Group (OTCMKTS:GBHPF) develops hemp cultivation for cannabinoid extraction. This company recently announced that its subsidiary, Covered Bridge Acres, has completed preparing 35 acres at its Scio, Oregon farm.Most of the large cannabis companies such as Aphria (NYSE:APHA) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) grow their cannabis either in indoor growing facilities or greenhouses. There are advantages to these methods compared to outdoor growing, such as greater security and the ability to grow year round.However, outdoor growing is considerably cheaper. I've seen estimates that the costs are between 10 - 25% of the other methods. In addition, some argue that cannabis that is grown outside is better than cannabis grown indoors. This is because it is grown with natural sunlight and soil.Given these dynamics, companies that are outdoor growers have advantages over the larger indoor growers. As such, I would expect that eventually companies like Global Hemp will be acquired by the larger companies. Global Cannabis Applications Corp (FUAPF)Global Cannabis Applications Corp (OTCMKTS:FUAPF) is involved in the development of smart phone applications for the cannabis industry. This company announced that it has appointed Shay Meir to the position of General Manager, Global Grow Operations.Meir was one of the first 10 Israelis to hold a license to cultivate cannabis. He set up a research lab and worked closely with the Israeli Ministry of Health to research and develop cannabis for medical purposes.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul He is a pioneer in the medical cannabis field and his addition to the company should be a positive. Maybe it will help to turn the stock around. It the past year, FUAPF has dropped from 25 cents to 4 cents. Emerald Health Therapeutics (EMHTF)Emerald Health Therapeutics (OTCMKTS:EMHTF) is a Canadian producer of cannabis products. Pure Sunfarms is a joint venture that is 50% owned by Emerald. It just announced preliminary results. The full, second-quarter earnings release will be out on Aug. 28.Pure Sunfarms reported all-in growing costs of 65 cents Canadian to grow one gram of cannabis. In U.S. dollars, that would be about 48 cents.To put this into perspective, consider that Aurora Cannabis recently reported that its cost to produce a gram is $1.42 -- nearly three times as much.In addition, sales increased sequentially by 125% and the company reported its third quarter of profitability. This may not sound like its that big of a deal, but consider that most companies in this industry are losing money and it's a bit more impressive.EMHTF stock continues to hold the $1.50 support level. If this level breaks, we could get a large move lower.As of this writing, Mark Putrino did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-19,"Usually, a headline like that would spell doom for stocks, but that wasn't the case Monday. Major U.S. equity benchmarks rallied even as President Donald Trump had some, shall I say, &quot;words of encouragement&quot; for the Federal Reserve.&quot;The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well,&quot; said the president on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). &quot;If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!&quot;President Trump has a long history of moving markets via Twitter, but that wasn't necessarily the case Monday when it comes to the dollar, which he has long complained is too strong. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP), which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, closed modesty higher and just a third of a percent below its 52-week high. UUP is up about 2% this month, indicating Fed rate cuts aren't always the elixir to quell a strong dollar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Despite the dollar firming again today, the plenty of export-sensitive sectors and individual names rallied, helping the Nasdaq Composite to a gain of 1.35% while the S&P 500 added 1.21%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the week higher by 0.96% with just two of its 30 components finishing lower on the day. Be Careful With These Dow WinnersTwo of the best performers in the Dow today may require some caution. Sure, it was nice to see Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rally after the network gear maker was drubbed last week following disappointing guidance on its earnings call, but Monday's bounce may be one of the dead cat variety.Similar caution may be warranted with chemicals maker Dow (NYSE:DOW), which was the second-best Dow stock today behind Cisco. Again, it's nice to see a cyclical, tariff-sensitive name in the green today, but the stock was downgraded last Friday to &quot;neutral&quot; by Bank of America Merrill Lynch with that bank also paring its price target on Dow shares to $44 from $55.Of the 17 analysts rating shares of Dow, just six have &quot;buy&quot; ratings on the name while 11 have the equivalent of a &quot;hold&quot; on the stock. DJIA Earnings NoteI've been mentioning The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) recently because the company reports earnings tomorrow, and today's gain of 2.11% suggests trades were buying the name in advance of that report. There was some elevated options activity in Home Depot today, too, but history suggest traders should be careful with the home improvement giant post-earnings.&quot;Looking into HD's earnings history, the stock has closed lower the day after earnings in all but two of the past eight quarters, though the reaction to Home Depot's most recent report in May was positive,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. &quot;Over the past two years, the shares have swung an average of 1% the day after earnings, regardless of direction. This time around, the options market is pricing in a larger-than-usual 6% swing for Tuesday's trading.&quot; Some Good Dow NewsI've mentioned a few times this year that alternative energy stocks and ETFs are really weighing on the traditional energy sector, so with that in mind, it was nice to see Chevron (NYSE:CVX) jump 1.68% today on some bullish analyst chatter. Barclays started coverage of Chevron today with an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and a $145 price target. That price target implies significant upside from today's close just under $118.&quot;Chevron is well positioned to both return significant free cash flow to shareholders and fund its…compound annual growth rate guidance,&quot; according to the bank. Dow Jones Bottom LineIn addition to the aforementioned Twitter action by President Trump, today's upside was the product of familiar themes: expectations that more Fed rate cuts are coming and that the U.S. and China might be able to make some headway on the trade front.Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell speaks in Wyoming late this week, so it's safe to say all eyes and ears will be on that speech regarding rate cut clues.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

There was some risk-off sentiment permeating markets today following the resignation of Italy's prime minister and more comment from President Donald Trump that he's not quite ready to make a trade deal with China.Let's get into some of the names that moved the Dow Jones Industrial Average today. Today's Dow WinnersI have repeatedly mentioned the The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) in recent days simply because that was the lone looming marquee earnings report among Dow components for investors to digest. The stock soared 4.59% today following that report.Atlanta-based Home Depot posted fiscal second-quarter earnings of $3.17 per share, beating Wall Street's estimates of $3.08. More importantly, the stock rallied on what was some glum guidance from the company. Not only did Home Depot warn about the impact of tariffs on its results, the company lowered full year same-store sales growth estimates to 4% from 5%.&quot;Home Depot said it now expects 2019 sales to rise about 2.3%, down from a prior forecast of a 3.3% increase,&quot; according to Reuters.While Dow winners were hard to come by, it was encouraging to see Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) close modestly higher. The company has recently seen some controversy after a former accountant alleged Disney artificially inflated revenue for years.&quot;Sandra Kuba, formerly a senior financial analyst in Disney's revenue-operations department who worked for the company for 18 years, alleges that employees working in the parks-and-resorts business segment systematically overstated revenue by billions of dollars by exploiting weaknesses in the company's accounting software,&quot; reports Barron's.Kuba said she has alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the matter. This isn't a comment on the allegations, but shares of Disney have been basically flat over the past week, indicating markets aren't putting much weight on the accounting accusations.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained 0.15% a day after the company said it plans to spend $6 billion on original content for its streaming platform as plans for its Apple TV+ begin to crystalize. Rumors are swirling that Apple could price that offering at $10 a month in the middle of two of Disney's Disney+ plans. Downed DowMaterials name Dow (NYSE:DOW) was by far the worst offender in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, plunging 5.34% on seemingly light news. One reason the stock may have fallen today, and I emphasize &quot;may,&quot; is delayed reaction to an analyst downgrade out last Friday. Delayed because the stock trade higher yesterday, but with Tuesday's loss, it's lower by about 13% over the past 90 days. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayTuesday was another one of those sort of directionless, &quot;let's wait and see days&quot; where broader takeaways are hard to come by. For traders looking for near-term ideas, headline risk due to regulatory issues for big tech lingers, potentially bringing some short opportunities there, but that's a cautious bet at best.Second, there is growing sentiment that the worst of the energy sector's doldrums have passed and that the sector is primed to bounce back as the third quarter enters its latter stages.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-20,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) earnings beat analyst estimates, sending the stock up in pre-market trade Aug. 20.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Investors even ignored warnings from management about trouble ahead.The home improvement retailer earned $3.479 billion, $3.17 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $30.839 billion, for the quarter ending in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis beat estimates of $3.12 per share of earnings but missed estimates of $31.1 billion in sales. The company also trimmed its outlook for the full year, based on worries about tariffs. Come for the DividendThis didn't stop the party. Even at its expected opening price of $213 per share on Aug. 20, Home Depot's dividend of $1.36 per share still yields 2.5%, and it's fully supported by earnings.With a government 30-year bond yielding 2.05%, that's a bargain for income investors. Especially since the dividend has nearly tripled over the last 5 years from 47 cents.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential It means that if you got into Home Depot stock five years ago, when it was trading at $93 per share, you're getting a yield of nearly 6% on that investment, along with capital gains of about 22% each year. That's the very definition of a dividend aristocrat.Home Depot has been such a good stock, for so long, that it now represents 5.5% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which it joined in 1999, replacing Sears. Stay for the GrowthSince joining the Dow, Home Depot shares have resisted two sharp recessions. The company has even proven resistant to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it a unique investment proposition.Growth has accelerated in recent years, from a $6 billion gain in sales to an $8 billion gain pace. The company is now the fifth largest U.S.-based retail company, behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).The current interest rate environment could cause another jump in Home Depot's price. Fundamentals are strong, growth looks sustainable and the dividend is high relative to other income instruments.Home Depot bears were worried going into earnings over beating last year's sales, the state of the home remodeling market, and the fact that earnings per share are constantly buoyed by stock repurchases. But these voices are being drowned out, as are those of management, which lowered its guidance for the year at its conference call. Why the Pop?Home Depot stock rose after earnings because it was making up for ground lost to the trade war and global growth fears. HD stock shed more than $10 during August, even crossing a technical sell signal.While the company is known to skew male, it has recently been improving its home decor selection to appeal to women. The focus on textiles and furnishings can help in &quot;staging&quot; homes for re-sale, which also appeals to core customers.While young homebuyers are acquiring older, smaller houses, Home Depot executives say they're still interested in big projects as their home values rise. This should maintain the company's sales momentum. Home Depot Stock Is the Best Retail Buy Right NowHome Depot is the best retail stock to own now. While Costco shares have matched its march upward over the last five years, Costco's dividend yields less than 1%. Home Depot remains devoted to its dividend, it supports the stock with buybacks, and that dividend now yields more than a 30-year bond.That's why investors are ignoring warnings that the stock market is high, that Home Depot stock may be technically stretched, even management's own concerns about the future. They're buying with both hands because, in the current market, Home Depot is a genuine bargain.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Home Depot Inc.’s shares rallied amid signs of a stronger second half, in spite of a lower sales forecast from falling lumber prices and uncertainty about tariffs.Same-store sales -- a key gauge of a retailer’s performance -- rose 3% in the second quarter, trailing the average 3.2% projection, according to Consensus Metrix. The company now sees 4% growth for the full year in that measure, down from a previous forecast for 5%. It also sees full-year revenue growth of 2.3%, down from about 3.3%. Earnings per share exceeded analysts’ average estimate.Key InsightsWhile concerns are growing that the economy is slowing, Home Depot sees a market that’s doing well: “The current health of the U.S. consumer and a stable housing environment continue to support our business,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said. Still, he cited lumber deflation and the tariff outlook for the lower sales outlook.The key observation, according to Chuck Grom, an analyst from Gordon Haskett, is that bad weather hurt sales one month, but performance improved after that. “It’s one of these situations where the report was no worse than feared,” Grom said. Growth improved every month -- an indication that the problems were mostly weather related, he added.Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones, said Home Depot demonstrated “good cost controls” and margins in the quarter. The lowered sales guidance due to lumber costs was already factored in by investors, he said.There’s about a two-quarter lag for orders, meaning the follow-through of slowing home building is hitting companies like Home Depot that are closely tied to housing. Still, the company maintained its earnings per share forecast for the year.Market ReactionHome Depot rose as much as 2.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after the announcement, reversing earlier declines. The stock had advanced 21% this year through Monday’s close, exceeding gains in the S&P 500 Index.Get MoreFor more on the results, click here.For the company statement, click here.&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin (Bloomberg Global Data).To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa Wolfson, Thomas MulierFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Rises as Performance Seen Improving in Second Half

2019-08-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. rose as much as 3.9%, the most intraday since Dec. 26, after the home improvement retailer’s second-quarter results broadly cleared investor expectations -- or at least, were no worse than expected by Wall Street.Analysts were unfazed by the full-year cut to comparable-store sales, which was expected amid lumber price deflation and tariffs, hinted at by the company on its first-quarter earnings call. Wall Street saw the 3.1% growth in U.S. comparable store sales as either in-line or better than feared, and analysts were pleased the company was able to maintain its annual earnings target.Morgan Stanley’s Simeon Gutman noted that Home Depot “has attained a ‘safe haven’ status in this choppier market” -- which is a testament to how “well managed the business is and its strong perceived positioning over the medium term.”Peer Lowe’s Cos. Inc., which reports results Wednesday, gained as much as 3% on the heels of the Home Depot report.Here’s more of what Wall Street said after the earnings:Morgan Stanley, Simeon GutmanThe 3.1% growth in U.S. comp. sales was “respectable,” clearing the market’s expectation, the exit rate was solid, while the full-year comp. sales cut wasn’t a surprise, the analyst wrote in a note2Q earnings quality was “good”The focus now turns to the implied second-half comp. sales accelerationRates overweight, PT $210Guggenheim, Steven ForbesOperating results were “solid,” with both Ebit and EPS coming in ~2%-3% ahead of Guggenheim’s estimates; comp. guidance revision was expectedPerformance was driven by better-than-expected expense controlIncremental color (and conviction) on today’s earnings call regarding the potential impact of business investments will “likely be essentially for sustained outperformance as we move through 2H 2019”Sees limited risk to full-year EBIT/EPS estimates; rates buy, PT $230Baird, Peter BenedictU.S. comp. growth of 3.1% missed Baird’s 3.5% estimate, but were “likely no worse (and perhaps even better) than feared given softer macro indications, and HD noted acceleration across the quarter,” Benedict wroteAs expected, the year comp. sales view was trimmed (Street models were already there) but EPS guide held and likely reflects “some conservatism”Visibility into implied 2H comp acceleration (~5%) is the key question Rates outperform, PT $220SunTrust, Keith HughesForecast implies a “substantial pickup” in sales in the second half of the year, although management discussed momentumExpects a “modestly positive reaction in that sales results were not weaker”Rates hold, PT $180To contact the reporter on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Morwenna ConiamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Gains as Sales Were Better Than Wall Street Feared

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Whatever U.S.-China trade war fallout may be looming for the retail industry, Target Corp. is doing all it can to ensure that its turnaround – now nearly complete – will remain on track.The big-box giant reported on Wednesday that comparable sales rose 3.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, powered by strong foot traffic in its stores and a 34% increase in online sales.Target also raised its full-year earnings guidance, sending a message that it sees its run of healthy growth continuing even if the consumer environment gets more challenging when tariffs get slapped on $300 billion worth of goods from China. Target shares soared more than 16% in early trading, putting the stock on track to open at an all-time high.The details of the report underscored that Target’s approach to grabbing digital business – which heavily emphasizes using its stores as fulfillment centers – is working. Nearly three-quarters of its online comparable sales growth in the quarter was driven by its same-day services such as curbside or in-store pickup. This is important, because that type of online order tends to be more profitable than those that include free shipping for customers or require Target to foot the bill for last-mile delivery.Growth in curbside and in-store pickup is a balm for Target’s gross margin, which improved to 30.6% in the quarter from 30.3% last year. Several other factors also contributed to the gains on this measure, including cost-control initiatives and pricing. The improvement is an encouraging sign for investors who have worried about the chain’s ability to pad profitability, particularly now that the liquidation of Toys R Us and Babies R Us have made Target even more of a go-to for low-margin items such as toys.Target gave us tea leaves to read earlier this week for how it plans to keep capturing more foot traffic. It announced that in September it will launch a new private grocery brand called Good & Gather. The line will eventually contain more than 2,000 products and will focus on items that don’t contain artificial flavors and sweeteners. At the same time, it will phase out stalwart private food brands Archer Farms and Simply Balanced. This game plan in food sounds a lot like what Target has done with great success in its apparel section, where it axed tired labels such as Merona and Mossimo in favor of more current, trend-focused ones. If it can replicate that in food, it bodes well for a chain that could stand to grab more market share in a category that is essential in driving store trips. Coupled with its continuing store remodeling project, which includes updates to the grocery department, the revamp may  help Target drive more customers to the food section.It’s almost eerie how similarly the quarter shaped up for Target and Walmart Inc. Both had solid comparable sales growth that was notched despite a difficult comparison to last year, a period when both retailing giants recorded their best quarterly sales results in over a decade. Both also delivered upbeat e-commerce growth that relied heavily on their brick-and-mortar fleets. And both raised their guidance for the year, showing at least near-term confidence in the health of the U.S. consumer.In fact, in a series of earnings reports over the course of the last week, the giants of retail have given us little reason to worry that the U.S. consumer is flinching in the face of trade and economic uncertainty. Lowe’s Cos. reported a solid increase in comparable sales on Wednesday, showing strength in the most important quarter of the year for the home-improvement business. While Home Depot Inc. said yesterday that part of the reason for lowering its guidance was concerns about the impact of tariffs, executives said they were doing that out of “conservatism,” not because they were currently seeing caution from consumers.Tariff pressure may change that view if it drags on for a long time. For now, though, the environment is positive one for Target and its ilk. As long as they deliver what shoppers want, there’s no reason to think customers won’t keep coming.  To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-08-21,"A recession isn't guaranteed. With each passing day, however, an economic downturn becomes increasingly likely. At the very least, we should expect some broader correction in the markets due to timing issues. After all, we're on a record-breaking bull run. That alone should help adjust how we approach which stocks to buy.Moreover, evidence exists all around us that we'll incur a recession. Obviously, the biggest factor here is the U.S.-China trade war. President Donald Trump has aggressively prosecuted his economic rivalry with China, but his efforts have yielded almost nothing fruitful. And while he has succeeded in damaging the world's second-biggest economy, domestic stability is starting to fracture.This might lead to both sides inking a deal, thereby rendering moot the demand for recession-proof stocks to buy. However, the trade war may have accelerated certain vulnerabilities past the tipping point. More significantly, the trade war has impacted other nations including Germany. Due to uncertainties over the U.K. leaving the European Union, export-dependent Germany risks falling into a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential And if that happens, it will send a ripple effect throughout the world. Therefore, it doesn't hurt to be prepared. Here are 10 recession-proof stocks to buy: Waste Management (WM)Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com This is perhaps the ultimate irony. In an article about recession-proof stocks to buy, I'm here talking about Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Although seemingly an illogical idea, it's actually not. You see, Americans produce a massive amount of waste, or roughly 230 million tons of it every year. Right there you have a legitimate bullish argument for WM stock.Due to the almost inhuman rate at which we throw junk away, landfills throughout the country have been nearing capacity. To help remedy this situation, we've been exporting our recyclables to China. We've mixed our trash with our recyclables, but Chinese workers have sifted through the junk to find recyclable items. However, trade war tensions destroyed this relationship, which might be a benefit to WM stock.Why? With China and other countries rejecting our trash, land earmarked for waste will jump to a premium. And I don't think it's any surprise that WM stock is one of the strongest-performing recession-proof stocks to buy. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I couldn't think of a more boring name than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Known everywhere for their household goods, the company specializes in such compelling products like diapers, detergent and over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medicine. But if you want to protect yourself with recession-proof stocks to buy, boring is usually best.The markets fully agree with this basic assessment. On a year-to-date basis, PG stock has gained over 33%. Moreover, shares have charted a very clean and consistently rising trend channel. This has been accentuated only by brief moments of volatility. Plus, shares have recovered well from the 800-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in mid-August.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill But will PG stock continue to trek higher? If we head toward a recession, this is one of the few names that will give you confidence. That's because practically everything that Procter & Gamble sells is a necessity, whether we have a downturn or not. Home Depot (HD)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com In discussions about recession-proof stocks to buy, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) comes up often. I believe that's the case because HD stock has both bullish and bearish catalysts.When things are going well, Home Depot benefits from more construction activity. During downturns, its revenue streams are somewhat insulated because repairs and renovations don't wait for recessions. And since other sectors are doing poorly in bear markets, HD stock wins over defensive-minded investors.Unsurprisingly, Home Depot shares have performed well this year, gaining about 30%. However, HD stock has offered up a turbulent ride toward those returns, worrying some onlookers.That said, the company received some good news. Due to the repercussions of the U.S.-China trade war, Home Depot's suppliers are shifting manufacturing from China to other countries like Taiwan or Vietnam. That translates to a significant mitigation of the trade war impact, bolstering the argument for HD stock. Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I've said this before, but the best recession-proof stocks to buy have the most straightforward and logical arguments. Under this context, you should definitely consider adding Dollar General (NYSE:DG) to your portfolio.Simply put, DG stock is a direct play on consumer behaviors during an economic downturn. What do most people do when job opportunities run dry? They buckle in for a long financial winter. For many folks, that translates into doing whatever is necessary to save money, including shopping at dollar-only stores.Another factor benefiting DG stock is that such stores offer comprehensively great deals. For instance, I once picked up a can opener for a buck. To this day, this cheap can opener has never failed me, whereas a $12 variant from a big-box retailer might not last a year.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip Overall, I think this is the reason why DG stock is up nearly 30% YTD. During this period of extended saber-rattling and worrisome economic metrics, Dollar General has become incredibly relevant. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Over the years, I haven't shown much love toward grocers like Kroger (NYSE:KR). A big reason why is competition. Not only do you have disruptive organizations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) encroaching into the arena, big-box retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) offer one-stop-shop solutions, which include groceries. Thus, KR stock has a steep uphill climb to navigate.Furthermore, I have been right on my hesitancy toward KR stock. However, with Wall Street now shifting their focus to recession-proof stocks to buy, Kroger suddenly looks much more interesting. Of course, some serious risks abound. For instance, shares are down 15% YTD. This is also a company within an industry that depends on high volume to compensate for the low margins.However, KR stock has an advantage during downturns. As a strictly grocery specialist, Kroger can offer lower prices due to bulk shipments. Furthermore, Amazon's disruptive acquisition, Whole Foods Market, probably won't do so well in a recession. Thus, don't overlook KR in your search for recession-proof stocks to buy. Ross Stores (ROST)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com If you're like me, you probably don't care too much about fashion trends: you just buy whatever looks best on you. And for that reason, I love off-season discount retailers like Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST). I get to buy brand-name shoes and apparel, simply because they weren't popular enough or they're a few months old. Millions feel the same way, which supports the case for ROST stock during bull markets.But even in bear markets, ROST stock is compelling. That's because recessions don't happen like a light switch. A decline in GDP doesn't immediately evoke images of a dystopian nightmare. Instead, people do normal things, but with a more cost-conscious mindset. Logically, this environment benefits ROST stock.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall The markets have agreed with this assessment. Currently, ROST stock is up over 29% YTD. Moreover, shares have so far handled the August volatility well, moving up slightly for the month. Therefore, this is another name to keep on your list of recession-proof stocks to buy. Kirkland Lake Gold (KL)Recession-proof stocks to buy don't always have to be so boring and predictable, as Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL) proves. As you might deduce from the name, KL stock is a precious metals mining investment. And I really love gold and silver in this particular market setup.Primarily, I say this because the Federal Reserve is essentially greenlighting gold and silver prices to jump to all-time records. How? In late July, the Fed announced that they will cut benchmark interest rates, a first since 2008. Later, the yield curve inverted, which basically forces the central bank to cut rates further to flatten the curve.Generally speaking, these actions are inflationary for the U.S. dollar. And that is good for gold and silver prices, which in turn benefits KL stock.Another factor bolstering shares is the political stability of their projects. Largely doing business in Canada and Australia, these two nations have stable infrastructures and are allied with the U.S. With precious metals moving higher, KL stock just seems like a no-brainer. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Unfortunately, cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) hasn't panned out as I had hoped. Of course, the critics would blast me for even thinking about AMC stock. In a world where streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dominates the content-entertainment ecosystem, AMC seems anachronistic, like a time-traveling DeLorean.A major reason why AMC stock hasn't performed to speculators' expectations is this year's movie offerings. In my opinion, it's a very slow season for Hollywood. Furthermore, it won't get better until Disney (NYSE:DIS) releases its highly anticipated &quot;Star Wars&quot; film.But as a speculative play among recession-proof stocks to buy, I like my chances with AMC stock. No matter what, humans are social creatures. Therefore, no amount of streaming will change our hardwired psychology to interact with others.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now Plus, AMC represents (relatively) cheap entertainment. Even with buying outrageously priced popcorn and drinks, you're still better off at the box office than at a typical NFL game. And during a downturn, that pricing advantage is a huge tailwind. RCI Hospitality (RICK)If you're looking for viable recession-proof stocks to buy, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) isn't an equity that you would put on your portfolio. Instead, you would recommend RICK stock to your &quot;friend,&quot; who utilizes the company's services frequently. In fact, your &quot;friend&quot; probably has a problem receiving too much hospitality.Joking aside, RICK stock is one of the most interesting and controversial recession-proof stocks to buy. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, several gentlemen's clubs reported that business was booming. Psychologically and practically, I understand why. Men need an outlet after suffering humiliation at work. On the other hand, some women are willing to provide acrobatic hospitality when opportunities run dry.Of course, this is a really shady way of profiting from a possible downturn. However, if you're truly agnostic about your portfolio, RICK stock offers a pathway to survive and thrive. Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com I must admit that I don't feel too terrible about suggesting RICK as one of the better recession-proof stocks to buy. Ultimately, I see this activity as consenting adults doing adult things.However, I feel almost shameful about discussing Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). It's not because of their underlying product. Few things are as American as having a cold one at a backyard barbeque. Instead, it's the reason behind it: BUD stock may outperform your expectations during a recession.Why is that? According to health-related studies, an economic recession correlates with increased imbibing. That's not a surprise. After all, who hasn't knocked back a few to take the edge off a stressful situation?But the question is, should you profit from this narrative? If you feel that this is also a case of adults being adults, check out BUD stock. Bud Light is the top-selling beer in America. And due to its price point, it's very attractive during a recessionary period.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and silver bullion, and AMC stock.

2019-08-26,"For the past several months, I've been sounding the bull horn on shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD). During that stretch, HD stock has risen nearly 30%.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com As enthusiastic as I was (see here and here), not might be the time to start taking those earnings before they evaporate. Instead, it's time to switch into a neutral stance. For early 2019 dip-buyers, that means it's time to do some profit-taking.The &quot;sell the rally&quot; thesis is pretty simple. The fundamentals are deteriorating. Comparable sales growth is slowing. Macroeconomic risks are rising. Margins are flattening out. Profit growth has been relatively anemic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the same time, HD stock has sprinted to a premium valuation, and these conditions can't last forever.This combination of deteriorating fundamentals and a premium valuation is not a winning one. Instead, it is one that will probably result in HD stock either coming back down towards $200, or trading sideways for the foreseeable future.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Either way, I don't see Home Depot stock gaining much ground from here over the next few months. Fundamentals Are WeakeningAlthough Home Depot is up nearly 30% year-to-date, it cannot be ignored that the company's core growth fundamentals, while still solid, are weakening.The story is simple. Home Depot is a home improvement retailer. As a home improvement retailer, this company grows largely with the U.S. economy, and to a lesser extent, the global economy. The global economy is slowing and is projected to keep slowing, weighed by escalating trade tensions. The U.S. economy is similarly slowing and is projected to keep slowing, also weighed by escalating trade tensions.In other words, the U.S.-China trade war is creating a problematic outlook for Home Depot. I think this trade war will eventually come to a beneficial resolution. But, at the moment, both sides are upping the ante with more tariffs and more threats. So long as this ante keeps getting upped, economies around the world will continue to slow, and Home Depot's growth trajectory will flatten out.Home Depot's numbers confirm this story. Comparable sales rose 2.5% in the first quarter of 2019 and 3% in the second quarter of 2019. That's a big slowdown from 5.2% comp Home Depot reported in 2018. Further, comparable sales are expected to rise just 4% this year, marking the worst comp since 2011.At the same time, margins are under pressure for a variety of reasons and likely won't improve until top-line momentum returns and allows for more operating leverage. Thus, profit growth has been depressed year-to-date (EPS up less than 4% year-over-year last quarter), and will likely remain depressed until the trade war stops creating macroeconomic headwinds.Broadly, while the Home Depot growth narrative should remain largely positive for the foreseeable future, it will remain less positive than it has been over the past few years. The unfortunate thing here is that HD stock isn't priced for &quot;less positive.&quot; Valuation Is Rich on Home Depot StockThe present valuation on Home Depot stock is rich; too rich considering the company's go-forward growth prospects.HD stock trades at 21.5-times forward earnings. The five-year-average forward earnings multiple for this stock is roughly 20. Thus, HD stock is trading at an above-average valuation today, despite the fact that the company is firing off multi-year worst growth rates, and the fact that those depressed growth rates are here to stay for the foreseeable future.That doesn't add up.Let's model this out. Home Depot has been a mid-to-high single-digit revenue grower for the past several years. Given that the global economy is slowing, it is likely that Home Depot's revenue growth rates similarly slow into the mid-single-digit range. At that growth rate, it will be tough to drive robust operating leverage. Instead, margins will likely only inch higher over the next several years, especially considering they are basically at all-time highs.Net net, Home Depot reasonably projects as a mid-single-digit revenue grower over the next several years, with tepid margin drivers. Some buybacks are in the mix, too. That should drive mid-to-high single-digit profit growth, paving the path for around $15 to $15.50 in EPS by fiscal 2025.Combining the high-end of that range with the historically average 20-times forward earnings multiple, that equates to a 2024 price target for HD stock of $310. Discounted back by 8% per year (accounting for the yield), which implies a 2019 price target of about $210, below today's price tag of $220. Bottom Line on Home Depot StockHome Depot stock was a great buy in early 2019. Not so much anymore. The valuation is stretched, and the fundamentals are weakening. This discrepancy ultimately means that HD stock may be maxed out and that weakness in the foreseeable future is likely.Because of this, I think profit-taking is the right move here and now.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-28,"To understand how much respect Home Depot (NYSE:HD) gets from the market, just look at the price of Home Depot stock. The stock gained last week; in fact, it touched an all-time high before a recent, modest pullback.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Those gains came after the company missed Wall Street revenue estimates and lowered its full-year same-store sales guidance.In this market, that combination for any stock -- let alone one with macro and tariff concerns -- would have sent investors fleeing for the exits. Instead, the HD stock price actually rose more than 4% after the earnings release.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's a case that, at this point, Home Depot has earned the benefit of the doubt. It's a great American retailer, with a likely $110 billion in sales this year. Home Depot stock has been one of the best stocks in the entire market. Valuation concerns in the past -- and I've raised them as recently as April -- have proven to be short-sighted.That said, investors are giving Home Depot an awful lot of credit. In fact, they're treating HD stock like a defensive play, not a cyclical one. That seems risky in this environment, and suggests that maybe this time, the HD stock price finally has gone too far. Home Depot Stock Rises on a Guidance CutTo be sure, Home Depot's Q2 report wasn't a disaster by any means. Earnings beat consensus by 9 cents. Same-store sales still increased 3%, including a 3.1% print in the U.S. The consolidated 3% gain was just 0.2 points below analyst estimates.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond And the general take on the quarter seems to be, as one analyst put it, that it &quot;was no worse than feared&quot;. Even with modest signs of a housing slowdown (particularly in new construction) and potential impacts from the U.S.-China trade war, Home Depot is still growing sales and keeping operating margins basically flat. The lower revenue outlook is coming in part from deflationary prices in lumber (although tariffs are a factor as well).That said, the HD stock price doesn't seem to incorporate &quot;no worse than feared&quot;. A 20x+ multiple to updated fiscal 2020 (ending January) guidance doesn't sound that high. But this is a cyclical stock -- one whose sales and profits will plunge in a recession.Even that aside, the lower guidance is a concern. In late 2017, Home Depot gave a three-year target for comp growth of 4.5-6% -- it's missing that mark. Margins are nearing the low end of the company's target range. Earnings-per-share rose less than 4% year-over-year: pre-tax income actually declined.Investors are clearly betting on a stronger second half. But the issue here is that Home Depot can't drive that improvement all on its own. The Concerns About the HD Stock PriceAfter all, Home Depot needs help. It needs the economy to hold up. In many places elsewhere in the market, investors hardly seem confident on that front.Admittedly, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, has gained 33% so far this year. But those gains have come simply from regaining some of its lost ground.ITB is up only 5% over the past year and still sits ~13% below January 2018 highs. And it's not like Home Depot stock -- a major component of that ETF -- hasn't joined in on the 2019 fun. It has risen 27% despite better performance heading into this year.Meanwhile, other macro-sensitive stocks -- think Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) or automotive stocks -- have struggled and/or seen big sell-offs amid tariff and trade war worries. Home Depot's U.S. focus gives it exposure to the still-strong U.S. economy, admittedly, but on the whole investors still see at least some kind of downturn coming in the next few years.That's one big risk. The other is competition. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is trying to execute a turnaround and it's having some success. Its stock soared after earnings. Its same-store sales have outpaced those of Home Depot for the last two quarters. Home Depot isn't losing its crown any time soon, to be sure, but a combination of a weaker market and lower market share -- even if both impacts are modest -- is not priced in at 20x+ FY20 EPS. A Cyclical Treated Like a DefensiveAnd yet the HD stock price keeps marching higher. What's interesting about the trading -- particularly this year -- is that Home Depot stock really hasn't been rattled much by outside forces. It posted some big declines in 2018, but the biggest dip so far this year came from late April through late May, when the stock dropped about 9%.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week That's a surprise given the fact that the market as a whole has, at times, been seized by selling amid tariff concerns or an inverted yield curve. A cyclical play like HD stock theoretically should be vulnerable to those swings, but it simply hasn't had much in the way of downside.Instead, Home Depot stock has traded more like a defensive stock. Its chart looks much more like that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or a Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Those stocks aren't immune to macro worries, but they're generally considered &quot;safer&quot; plays for investors worried about overall growth.It certainly seems like, particularly after last week's earnings, the market is treating Home Depot stock the same way. But that would be a mistake. If a recession hits, Home Depot sales will fall. And so will the HD stock price. Investors ignore outside worries -- and guidance cuts -- at their peril.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The volume behind the advance wasn't exactly thrilling either.Source: Shutterstock Computer company Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) took the lead, gaining more than 3% during the regular-hours session in front of earnings, and then jumping more than 9% in after-hours action after reporting an earnings beat after the closing bell rang.Holding the market back more than any other name was Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). Although it rallied more than 2% after the closing bell rang, that move didn't even come close to offsetting the stock's 12.5% setback during the normal session … a move mostly prompted by profit-taking after an incredible runup since mid-August.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September As for names worth a look as trading prospects headed into the long weekend though, take a look at the stock charts of Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Newell (NASDAQ:NWL). Here's what's most noteworthy, and how that may point to what lies ahead. Newell (NWL)Newell shares have been fighting a losing battle since the middle of 2017. And, technically speaking, it's still within the confines of a well-established downtrend.On the other hand, thanks to a slow turnaround effort that started to take shape just a few weeks ago, NWL stock is close to snapping its way out of the slump. Just know that Newell has been in this condition before, only to be up-ended before it took off. But, this time it is shaping up a little bit differently.  *   Click to EnlargeThe upper edge of the bearish trend is the convergence of the white 200-day moving average line, and the dashed blue line that connects all the key highs going back to the beginning of last year.  * Underscoring the budding bullish effort thus far is the fact that the Chaikin line is now back above zero, suggesting there's a healthy amount of volume behind the current advance.  * If the prospective breakout ends up taking shape, the most plausible upside target is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $28.85. A move to that mark still wouldn't be in a straight line though. Home Depot (HD)The past couple of weeks have been good ones for Home Depot, and things were particularly hot yesterday. Thursday's 2% pop carried shares above a near-term ceiling, to bring the two-week advance to 13%. The move, however, also stopped right at another, more established technical ceiling.That momentum is compelling to be sure, particularly given how it first took shape. But, the odds of there being any more upside left to dish out are pretty slim, given everything else evident on the chart.  * 7 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks on a Rebound Now   *   Click to EnlargeThe rally appears to have been capped at the resistance level that aligns Thursday's high with the peaks made in September and January of last year. It's the upper of the two blue lines that frame the rising trading range marked on the weekly chart.  * HD stock has also now punched through the upper boundary of a shorter-term trading range, marked by red dashed lines on both stock charts. This hints at a breakout, but the sheer scope of the advance thus far is unusually big.  * Underscoring the above-average odds of a pullback from here is the fact that the weekly chart's RSI indicator is very near its overbought level. Mylan (MYL)Finally, Mylan has been routed since the beginning of 2018. In fact, it looked downright unsalvageable in May thanks to a hard-hitting selloff.In some ways though, that drubbing may have ultimately been the best thing for it. Although Mylan shares have yet to work their way back into a bullish mode -- and are still far from it -- the recent action suggests May's meltdown may have served as a capitulation. Better still, the proverbial lines in the sand are pretty clear.  *   Click to EnlargeThe pinnacle line in the sand is the falling resistance line that connects all the peaks going back to January of 2018, marked in red on the weekly chart. It's currently at $27, and falling fast.  * Also note the gray 100-day moving average line is soon going to be tested as a technical ceiling. It has been a problem several times in the recent past, albeit not exactly.  * It's small, but MYL stock has made a string of higher lows since May's low, plotted with a yellow line. It's the longest string of higher lows seen in well over year.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-30,"Home-improvement retailers are expected to benefit from the initial sales boost caused by Hurricane Dorian, as residents of Florida buy generators, batteries and flashlights in preparation for the storm. But Home Depot Inc. , Lowe's Cos.  and Floor & Decor Holdings Inc.  also have exposure in the form of the stores that are potentially in the storm path, Jefferies analysts wrote Friday. Home Depot has 153 stores in Florida equal to 8% of its U.S. fleet, while Lowe's has 126 stores equal to 7% of its U.S., analysts led by Jonathan Matuszewski wrote in a note to clients. Floor & Decor has 18 stores, equal to 18% if its fleet. &quot;While not all stores are in communities expected to be impacted, each retailer has clear exposure,&quot; the analysts wrote. The retailers are expected to enjoy demand for flooring once the rebuild begins after any damage, and the tailwind could be big, they wrote. Hurricane Matthew in the third quarter of 2017 lead to an initial sales lift of $100 million for Home Depot, they noted, while Lowe's cited a 60 basis point lift from weather. In the third quarter of 2019, Hurricanes Irma, Nate and Harvey generated a $282 million sales lift for Home Depot and a 140 basis-point comp lift for Lowe's. Still, &quot;similar to past significant weather events, storm-related expenses will be incurred,' said the note. &quot;Recall, HD reported costs of $167M to drive $650M in hurricane-sales during F'2H18, encapsulating the months Irma/Nate/Harvey hit and the next quarter. Some degree of gross margin deterioration for home improvement centers is likely given the profitability profiles of in-demand SKUs like plywood and generators.&quot; Home Depot shares were up 0.3% Friday, while Lowe's was flat. Floor & Decor rose 1.2%.","Home Depot, Lowe's and Floor & Decor will get initial boost from Hurricane Dorian, but risks remain: analyst"

2019-09-03,"According to the financial media talking heads, the sky is falling because key interest rates are falling. But that's just not the case. Yes, rates have continued to collapse around the world, as China devalued its currency and the pound and euro are weak ahead of the October Brexit. So, money is still sloshing around and finding its way to the U.S.Source: Shutterstock The truth of the matter is that we remain in a very positive environment for stocks right now, as the U.S. remains the oasis around the world.Now, the falling interest rates are affecting all corners of the stock market, so, today, we're going to take a look at how they're impacting the housing market -- and what's the right way to play that, as investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHome sales have turned up after 18 months of trending lower. This isn't surprising, as mortgage rates are lower per month when interest rates are lower. So, this helps with housing affordability. Basically, more people can qualify for mortgages based on their income to debt ratio. And the lower the rates, the more homes are going to sell because they're more affordable.Every home requires upkeep (if you own a home, then you know exactly what I mean!), and The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is the place to go for supplies, whether you're a contractor or a do-it-yourselfer. And that was very evident in the company's most-recent quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, HD topped analysts' estimates. On overall earnings of $3.5 billion for the second-quarter, earnings per share increased 3.9% year-over-year to $3.17, up from $3.05 per share in the same quarter a year ago. The consensus estimate called for earnings of $3.08 per share, so Home Depot posted a 2.9% earnings surprise.Looking forward, company management expects sales to grow 2.3% year-over-year, which is below current analyst forecasts for 2.8% annual sales growth. The company also reaffirmed its earnings guidance, as it looks for earnings per share of $10.03. That's up from earnings of $9.89 per share in 2018.Now, heading into its earnings report, HD had earned a &quot;C&quot; for its Total Grade. However, as you can see below, the stock was upgraded to a &quot;B&quot; post-earnings.Following the quarterly report, buying pressure increased, boosting the stock to new 52-week highs. In fact, it hit more 52-week highs this week. Clearly, the &quot;smart money&quot; is still very much interested in this stock. That's also reflected in HD's strong Quantitative Grade-the most important variable in my stock grading formula. It's ultimately why I recommended it to my Growth Investor subscribers as a High-Growth stock.One such company is Dr. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), which as a homebuilder seems to be benefiting from the low interest rate environment. After all, at times when a mortgage costs less to obtain for the same house, more people will take the leap.That being said, in this battle of housing stocks, we can't forget about the homebuilders!  Because there's a rising demand for homes, more are being built, too. There are plenty of folks who are getting older and downsizing, but they want homes with easy upkeep. So, they turn to the new models.So, against that landscape, let's see how THIS particular homebuilder is looking. For the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report on July 30, DHI announced earnings of $1.26 per share on 10.6% year-over-year increase to $4.9 billion in revenue. This topped expected earnings of $1.07 per share on $4.5 billion in revenue. So, the company posted a 17.6% earnings surprise and an 8.9% sales surprise.For a fuller picture, here's how DHI stacks up in Portfolio Grader.Both its Fundamental and Quantitative Grades are B-rated, which isn't surprising given the solid earnings report and recent momentum. On August 22, DHI hit a new 52-week high of $50.64, and the shares traded less than a dollar from that level this past week.That's pretty impressive given the market selloff we've been facing. While good stocks like HD and DHI can't entirely avoid market selloffs, they do tend to bounce back quickly and with force. As you can see in the one-month chart below, even at a time when the S&P 500 is down roughly 3%, DHI is UP 4.6%, while HD is up a good 11.9%!Like D.R. Horton, Home Depot just hit new 52-week highs.While both stocks are B-rated in Portfolio Grader, I believe HD will be the winner over the long term. Over the years, Home Depot has become the world's biggest home improvement retailer, and it offers over one million products in its more than 2,000 stores across the U.S., Canada and Mexico for DIY shoppers, professional contractors and others.The good news is that the &quot;smart money&quot; on Wall Street knows this -- and is showing a clear preference for &quot;Bulletproof&quot; stocks like this one. They've already tipped their cards by pouring their capital in. And the buying pressure that results from this is exactly what my Portfolio Grader system is designed to spot!There's Another Factor At Work Here, TooHaving spent time on Wall Street, these big institutional investors quickly learn that you need dividends to grow a portfolio over time, and I think that's another reason for this clear preference. The income really helps smooth over the rough patches.Dividend growth stocks are especially important today - when the global bond market is just going haywire. And even the 30-year Treasury can't be relied upon for good yield anymore. Recently, its yield dropped below 2% for the first time ever!So -- whether you're managing big institutional cash, or your own portfolio - you're going to need what I call the Money Magnets.Not only did these stocks earn an A in my Portfolio Grader, thanks to strong buying pressure and great fundamentals …The stocks also earn an A in my Dividend Grader. These stocks are able to pay great yields - and have the strong business model to back it up!All in all, I've got 27 strong dividend growth stocks for you, almost all of which yield more than the S&P 500.

Check this out.Source: Shutterstock A &quot;Lehman-like&quot; market disaster could happen this week, analyst warnsSeriously?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe analyst cited negative sentiment triggered by the inversion of the yield curve and how it correlated to 2008. (Here's the article if you really want to read it.) I think he needs to be held responsible if he's wrong.I am sick of hacks trying to make names for themselves with insane and irresponsible Doomsday Calls. Do yourself a favor and ignore them. Instead of becoming fearful with these crazy calls, now is the time to set yourself up for big profits.I think we're headed for one of the greatest &quot;melt-ups&quot; (as my colleague Steve Sjuggerud accurately calls it) over the next 12-18 months. The new issue of Investment Opportunities will focus on stocks that I believe will be among the leaders of that rally, and I want to give you a preview of my analysis today. Already Moving HigherLet's dispense quickly with the idea that a recession is around the corner. I shared my full market outlook with you this weekend, but I've written before about the inverted yield curve and talked about it at length in a recent MoneyLine podcast (which you can listen to here).I'll share one stat with you now: Over the last 40 years, an inverted yield curve has actually been more of a buy signal than a recession indicator. Since 1978, the market has gained 20%+ on average one year after the inversion event when the 10-year Treasury begins to yield less than the two-year Treasury.Add in the likelihood that the Fed will lower interest rates a couple more times this year, and the odds of a major rally increase.But even if you're skeptical, please don't ignore a tried-and-true buying opportunity that so many other investors are missing amid the panic.I'm talking about housing stocks. I know. They don't sound as exciting as next-generation batteries, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, or personalized medicine. But who cares -- as long as they can make us money?Take a look at the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB). It broke above $40 last week for the first time since last June. That is a potentially major breakout going back to levels from 18 months prior. It also broke out of a consolidation phase that lasted about three months.Those are two bullish technical indicators, and I see more upside ahead with very low housing stock valuations and strong fundamentals.You may not hear much about strong fundamentals in the current environment, but they're there. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is at all-time highs, and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is within about 6% of its peak. Both reported solid sales growth, as did consumer bellwethers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). This tells us that the consumer is doing pretty well, and so is the housing market.It's simple if you ignore the noise and doomsday headlines. Long-term interest rates are down, which means mortgage rates are, too. Any way you slice it, lower mortgage rates boost housing. They make homes more affordable.We already see potential home buyers on the move. Mortgage applications (the orange line below) have turned sharply higher as rates (the blue line) have fallen.Note how mortgage originations fell to their lowest level since mid-2014 earlier this year but are back on the upswing -- to their highest levels in about two years, in fact. The last time mortgage rates were this low (late 2016), mortgage originations spiked above $600 billion. What to Buy NowI look for a similar spike to occur in the next few quarters. A move from $344 billion in the first quarter to over $600 billion would be a massive 75% surge … and would light an even bigger fire under housing stocks.The opportunity is more than just low rates. There are multiple catalysts to drive housing stocks higher in the coming months, including high employment, consumers' willingness to spend, still-low valuations, and millennials buying homes as they start families. That last one is especially big and could last for years, as we are in the early stages of the greatest wealth transfer in U.S. history, from the baby boomers to the millennials.I focus a lot on cutting-edge trends and breakthroughs, like batteries that will change the way we live and communicate. That's where a lot of the life-changing gains will come from. But I don't ignore more &quot;traditional&quot; trends like housing when the time is right, like now.I'll have my full analysis on housing stocks and at least one related stock recommendation in the new Investment Opportunities issue this Thursday. I wanted to let you know today so you can have them on your radar, too.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

2019-09-03,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is much like its publicly traded equity: both don't draw much attention until you need them. Put another way, Home Depot stock is usually a safe, reliable investment, but it is a tad on the boring side.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com However, shares have been doing something recently that they don't usually: being interesting. While the benchmark indices like the Dow Jones have been struggling to gain traction in August, the HD stock price has put on a remarkable run. Since the first of the month, shares gained nearly 7%.But at the same time, Home Depot stock is at record levels. Typically, even the strongest and most stable names experience volatility in a market-wide downturn. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to jump aboard HD, especially when headwinds like the U.S.-China trade war and rising economic fears have gripped investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, I can understand the concerns here. But if you want exposure to recession-resistant companies, HD stock is among your best bets. Here are three reasons why: 1&#92;. Home Depot Stock Is Insulated from AmazonIn retrospect, the late 1990s to early 2000s was the peak of American shopping malls' cultural influence. Since then, brick-and-mortar retailers had to contend with the threat of e-commerce. And when I - or anyone - refers to e-commerce, we're talking about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now You only need to look at the technical charts for traditional retailers like Macy's (NYSE:M) or Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to recognize the damage rendered by Amazon. Although these two names are renowned brands across high-end shopping centers, they can't escape the ecommerce onslaught. But Home Depot stock? Fortunately for stakeholders, they won't have to worry about digital disruption.The biggest reason why is that most people who shop at Home Depot do so for renovations or repairs. Neither is an exact science, which essentially insulates the HD stock price from Amazon's encroachment.From my experience with repair work done on my home, the process is a hit-or-miss affair: pipes don't quite work right, or components somehow are either too big or too small. And don't get me started on repainting the interior. I had no clue how many different shades of white existed.I say all this to illustrate a point: Home Depot's business necessitates a physical presence. In fact, going digital would be a nuisance to its millions of customers. Therefore, I'm confident that the HD stock price can hold up better than most retail names. 2&#92;. HD Stock Benefits from Secular DemandDuring bull markets, cyclical investments like tech stocks get all the love. And that's really not a surprise. When the money is flowing, people feel comfortable tacking on greater risk. If their investments fail, hey, the money is still coming in from other sources.But in recessionary markets, Home Depot stock and its rivals like Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) fare better than their high-growth counterparts. It's much easier to predict the company's revenue streams but there's not as much guesswork involved. Aside from obvious technological improvements, construction materials are construction materials.Moreover, HD stock benefits from consistent, secular demand. Yes, a recession will hurt Home Depot like it would any other company. However, consumers don't really have a choice if they the home-improvement giant's services.Again, I speak from personal experience, but I suspect your experiences aren't dissimilar: your plumbing doesn't decide to conk out based on when it's most convenient to your schedule.Plus, I actually see some potential tailwinds for Home Depot stock if we suffer a recession. For instance, home sales have been plummeting even prior to the trade war escalation. Also, the average price of homes sold has started to flatline. Understandably, people are hesitant toward exposing themselves to unnecessary financial risk.But homeowners might take advantage of this lull and focus instead on renovating their properties. Then, when housing comes back, they could reap greater returns. Invariably, such circumstances will only help bolster HD stock. 3&#92;. Mitigating China RisksTurn on the news and chances are, you'll hear various analyses about the longer-term impact of the U.S.-China trade war. And while Home Depot stock does have a secular, insular business, it too suffers from supply chain cost increases.According to Home Depot CEO Craig Menear, the tariffs on Chinese goods will have a &quot;cost impact&quot; on U.S. revenue. This amounts to 2%, or $2 billion.However, the company's suppliers have thought ahead, shifting some manufacturing outside China. These location shifts are toward friendlier nations, including Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, even back home stateside.Of course, retailers broadly have pushed these cost increases to their customers and that worries economists. But for Home Depot stock, burdening the consumer base isn't as atrocious as it is for a discretionary-spending retailer.I go back to the point about secular demand. If your home needs repair, you're going to pay the increased material costs because you have to. While it's a cynical situation, it really does favor HD stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Few multinational companies would publicly advertise some U.S.-based jobs to women and others to men. In Mexico, though, some have listed gender preference right alongside qualifications like “education” and “experience.”Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal in both countries, but in Mexico, it remains a regular—and open—practice. According to a Bloomberg analysis of more than 10,300 job ads posted during one week in August on the popular Mexican job site OCCMundial, more than 800 specified male or female applicants.Most were for local firms, but not all. Staffing giants Kelly Services, Adecco and Manpower designated some of their Mexico-based postings for men or for women. Home Depot Inc. was recruiting male sales associates. VF Outdoor Services sought a woman with “excellent presentation” and “emotional intelligence” for an executive assistant role. Several local car dealerships did the same, along with Hyundai Glovis, a logistics subsidiary of the Korean car company.The data examined by Bloomberg showed that, overall, ads targeted men for more senior or managerial positions. Women were recruited for secretarial and customer service roles. Job ads seeking men also offered higher salaries than openings for the same position but a preference for women.Those companies say the ads Bloomberg found aren’t consistent with their policies or practice and have been fixed. Nonetheless, they illustrate the challenge of connecting company rhetoric with on-the-ground operations around the world. In August, Home Depot joined nearly 200 companies in signing a letter from the Business Roundtable that promised to foster “dignity and inclusion” in their operations. On its website, VF Corporation touts its “Global Women’s Advisory Council” and its promise to achieve gender parity in its senior leadership by 2030.“This was an oversight for several job postings by stores in Mexico,” a Home Depot spokesperson said in an email. “The job postings have been corrected and this has been addressed with the stores that posted them. Home Depot does not discriminate in hiring practice and is always looking for the best talent for the specific position.”Hyundai Glovis said the job ads reflected an error made by a new employee. “The part about gender was deleted immediately, the HR staff will be trained in company policy and law, and HR hiring processes will be strengthened,” the company said in a statement. “Hyundai GLOVIS Mexico does not discriminate on gender-related acts when hiring employees.”“Unfortunately, a small percentage of job postings in Mexico that did not reflect our commitment to diversity and inclusion were brought to our attention and we have taken immediate action to correct these,” a spokesman for Manpower said in an email. “We continue to review job posts on an ongoing basis to ensure they reflect our position on diversity and our commitment to equal employment opportunities.”Kelly Services said its recruiters in Mexico are trained and informed on compliant and ethical employment practices in the regions where they operate, and that the company “now will place postings to recruit individuals who are most qualified for the job duties at hand, without regard to immutable personal attributes.” Addeco said that in Mexico, it has policies to prevent any mention of gender in a job posting “unless there is a legitimate reason,” and that it was looking into the job ads flagged by Bloomberg.VF Corp., parent of VF Outdoor Services, along with brands like Vans, The North Face and JanSport, didn’t return several emails and phone calls seeking comment.“Global companies should make sure that any standards they say they’re holding themselves to are observed the world over,” said John Paul Rollert, a behavioral science professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and “in-house ethicist” at the Chicago Booth Review. “If they're not, people will find out and they’ll be held to account.” OCCMundial is owned by SEEK Ltd., a $4.8 billion tech company based in Melbourne, Australia, that owns and operates job sites around the world. Sergio Porragas Moreno, OCCMundial’s Chief Operating Officer, said the site’s terms and conditions forbid discrimination in job postings, and the site retains the right to remove any post deemed “illegal or abusive” following a formal investigation.“It’s a form of gender discrimination that’s unfortunately very common in the country,” said Gonzalo Sanchez de Tagle, a constitutional lawyer and author of the new book, “The Political Constitution of Mexico City.” “It’s 100% illegal, but a lot of labor rights violations go unnoticed or unreported.”“An example of using an outdated, unsubstantiated stereotype to deny women equal opportunity.”Using data captured by a Quaretaro, Mexico, firm, Bloomberg analyzed 10,334 job ads in Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Nuevo Leon, Jalisco and Guanajuato—the country’s main economic hubs—over about a week in August. The data captured openings in some of the country’s biggest and fastest growing industries: logistics, sales, administration, engineering and manufacturing.More than 800 postings specified a gender preference, more often for men than for women. Administrative jobs, mostly for receptionists, secretaries and assistants, accounted for almost half of all the openings seeking women. Sales jobs, including customer service representatives and cashiers, represented 38%.By contrast, nearly one-third of the listings seeking men were for drivers, forklift operators, storekeepers or other logistics positions. Another 28% were for manufacturing jobs, including supervisors, technicians and inspectors.Sales accounted for just 12% of the openings seeking men, but unlike the sales positions seeking women, they were more likely to be for management jobs or other, more senior titles.Among open engineering jobs, 82% were gender neutral. But 15% specified a preference for male applicants; just 3% targeted women.“There’s growing awareness over these issues, but there’s still a lot of discrimination in the work culture in Mexico,” said Alexandra Haas, president of Mexico’s National Council to Prevent Discrimination, or Conapred.More than 40 countries still allow gender discrimination in hiring. Another 50 place at least some restrictions on women’s work, according to the World Bank. Where discrimination is illegal across the board—in Mexico, the U.S. and elsewhere—it’s still common, just more subtle, Haas said. In several languages, including Spanish, job titles can be specifically masculine or feminine—recepcionista, for example, or as Deloitte specified in a March ad, asistente ejecutiva. (Deloitte didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Employers in Mexico can request a photo with a job application, another way to screen for gender, race or simply appearance.In most industries, there’s a deep imbalance, with fields dominated by men or by women; so-called women’s work also pays a lot less, said Rita Ramalho, researcher for a World Bank study on women’s rights across 187 countries. This dynamic reinforces the gender pay gap, she said. “It’s not only that less women are actually working, but when they do work, they are more likely to earn less than men.”The ads on OCCMundial reflected a stark pay gap. Coordinator jobs that specifically asked for men listed salaries that were on average 26% higher than what was offered in the ads asking for women. For managers and manager assistants, male-specific jobs offered 11% more than those that were specific to women.The gender pay gap and discrimination in hiring have become hot-button issues among the global economic elite in recent years, in part because the full economic enfranchisement of women is good for overall productivity. Closing the global gender pay gap would add $32 trillion to global GDP, according to the most recent estimate from the World Economic Forum.Investors, employees and customers have been pressuring companies to address gender biases and promote diversity. The MeToo movement forced executives to rethink their own behavior. BlackRock Inc., State Street Global Investors and other large funds are demanding diversity at the board level, and many pension funds are pushing for more disclosure and diversity among top executives.Even in countries where discrimination is legal or even tolerated, U.S. companies are ethically responsible for following their own best practices on gender equality, said Kabrina Chang, business ethics and law professor at Boston University. The job ads in Mexico are “an example of using an outdated, unsubstantiated stereotype to deny women equal opportunity,” she said. “No matter where that happens, it’s not good for women.”&#92;--With assistance from Nacha Cattan, Andrea Navarro, Sohee Kim and Corinne Gretler.To contact the authors of this story: Amy Stillman in Mexico City at astillman7@bloomberg.netJeff Green in Southfield at jgreen16@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janet Paskin at jpaskin@bloomberg.net, David MarinoCarlos M RodriguezFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Multinational Companies Reveal Gender Bias in Job Ads

2019-09-04,"U.S. stock futures are bouncing back after yesterday's slide.Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.87%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.89%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 1.00%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the options pits, call volume outpaced puts despite Tuesday's selloff. Overall volume settled near average levels signaling a run-of-the-mill trading session. Specifically, about 15.3 million calls and 14.9 million puts changed hands.Meanwhile, over at the CBOE, the distance between calls and puts narrowed driving the single-session equity put/call volume ratio back up to 0.73 - another one-week high. The 10-day moving average popped to 0.68.Let's take a closer look at the most actively traded options: Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)Typically investors view the announcement of a dividend increase with glee. But with iron-ore producer Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF), it caused traders to flee. CLF stock plunged 14.6% amid substantial volume after the company issued a press release detailing plans for a 20% bump in their dividend to 6 cents per share. Additionally, they will pay out a one-time special dividend of 4 cents per share.Falling steel and iron-ore prices amid trade war drama and global slowdown fears have plagued metal stocks like CLF, and it appears traders aren't willing to bank on a recovery just yet. While the dividend bump might be a win in the long run, Tuesday's price action shows traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach.On the charting front, the next major support looms at $5.60 so consider that the downside target if bears continue their rampage.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy As far as options trading goes, put volume exploded Tuesday driving 70% of the day's action. Total activity rocketed to over seven times the average daily volume.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 68% placing it at the 71st percentile of its one-year range. Premium sellers will be happy to note this is the highest level since last December. Home Depot (HD)Last month's earnings report lit a fire under Home Depot (NYSE:HD) shares, and they continue to burn bright. Tuesday's drop was well-deserved and allowed HD stock to digest recent gains ahead of its next dividend payment. Its price action is extremely bullish with a rising 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. Buying dips and breakouts remains the name of the game.Home Depot's ex-dividend date is today and was undoubtedly the cause of yesterday's boom in options trading. Dividend seekers took to the options market for short-term control of HD shares to capture the $1.36 payout. The annual yield is 2.44%. Activity zoomed to 411% of the average daily volume, with 182,882 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 88% of the tally.Implied volatility rose to 23%, pushing it to the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $3.22 or 1.4%. Bull call spreads aren't a bad way to go if you're speculating on further gains. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) shares scored a long-awaited breakout Tuesday morning, but broad market weakness ultimately upended the rally. The intraday rejection pushed TWTR stock back toward the low of the day ending with a nasty upper shadow on its candlestick.Fortunately, it still closed above its 20-day moving average, keeping the recent consolidation pattern intact. While the volatility challenges buyers' resolve, the path of least resistance is still higher until support near $40 fails.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income On the options trading front, the breakout attempt boosted call demand. Activity grew to 195% of the average daily volume, with 144,250 total contracts traded. 79% of the trading came from call options alone, showing strong enthusiasm backing the breakout bid.Implied volatility continues to hover at the lower end of its trading range. The 40% reading places it at the 20th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.06 or 2.5%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"Markets have been volatile lately, bringing uncertainty to a business that really just wants predictability. In a way, this is worse than a run of bad news; at least when times are bad, investors know what will happen next. The question for investors now, is how to ride out this wave of volatility? That’s a hard question to answer; in August, 11 of 22 trading sessions saw the total market shift 1% or more.Protection lies in the market’s traditional refuge, the defensive stock. Nicholas Getaz, of Franklin Templeton Investments, says of the perfect stock that it’s a company with “a leading market position, products that are industry norms and standards, innovative growth drivers, and a business model that increases resilience.” So, let’s use the TipRanks Stock Screener to find three companies that meet this definition, and see what makes them compelling buys right now. Home Depot, Inc. (HD)We’ll start with an industry leader, the largest of the home improvement superstores. HD reported Q2 earnings on August 20, and the results were interesting. Revenues just missed the forecast, coming in a half-percent low at $30.84 billion. EPS, however, showed a 3.26% positive surprise; the expectation was $3.07 while the actual result was $3.17. Investors were pleased, and HD stock has gained 4% since.Just as important, HD is well-positioned to keep gaining, given today’s business environment. Interest rates are low, and the Fed is widely expected to make at least one more cut this year. This puts downward pressure on mortgages, creating an environment in which homeowners are more likely to refinance and plow their savings into needed home improvements and repairs. Which, of course, necessitates a trip to Home Depot.Home Depot, for its part, has been using its solid earnings, at least in part, to reward investors. The company offers a 2.4% dividend, a modest yield but a $5.44 annual payment due to the high share price. The company has been steadily increasing the dividend payment for the last decade.Wall Street’s top analysts are mostly pleased with HD’s performance in the first half. From Wells Fargo, Zachary Fadem writes, “We believe solid first half cost controls bode well for second half achievability, and … an improving setup ahead, featuring easing year-over-year compares, cycling lumber deflation, potential housing category improvements, etc.” Fadem gives HD a buy rating with a price target of $235, suggesting an upside of 4.8%.5-star analyst Peter Benedict, of Baird, agrees that HD is a valuable buy, writing, “Home Depot Q2 results did not contain any surprises and its results were likely good enough to support the shares at its current valuation.” His $230 target is slightly more conservative, with a 2.6% upside.Overall, HD shares have a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 10 buys and 6 holds assigned in the last three months. Shares are selling for $224, and are still rising after the positive quarterly report. The average price target of $228 suggests a small 1.8% upside. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)Cisco is the tech company that other tech companies rely on. It makes networking hardware, the gear that physically connects the internet. It’s a solid niche, that has defined its ‘industry norms and standards,’ and keeps the company in a comfortable position.Despite some recent share price losses, CSCO returned a 1.32% positive EPS surprise in its most recent quarterly earnings. And the company continues to pay out its 2.96% dividend. The quarterly payment is only 35 cents, but it’s reliable, and adds up to $1.40 per share annualized. Better yet, Cisco has been steadily increasing that payment; the dividend has risen 13% over the past 5 years. Shares have more than doubled over that time, as well.Reviewing CSCO for Cowen, 5-star analyst Paul Silverstein gave the stock a solid buy rating with a $61 price target. He wrote, “Trends in the bulk of its businesses remain healthy, supporting our view of a meaningful increase to its impressive margin structure and improving execution across most product and customer markets.” His price target implies an upside of 28%.Piper Jaffray’s James Fish agrees that Cisco is a buying proposition and a clear value. He says, “We see good risk-reward on Cisco at current levels as long as the company's growth segments … continue to execute.” His target, $55, indicates a 16% upside.The analyst consensus on CSCO is a Moderate Buy, based on 15 buys and 7 holds. The stock is trading for $47, and the average price target of $56 suggests an upside potential of 19%. General Dynamics Corporation (GD)Sheer size insulates this company from most economic problems. It is the fifth largest defense contractor in the US, and the sixth largest globally, with over $36 billion in annual revenue. Some of the company’s products are highly classified; others, like the F-16 fighter jet and the M1A1 tank, are among the world’s most recognizable weapon systems.Its leading position in the defense industry means GD is poised outperform the market this year. Where as the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date, GD shares have gained 21%. Back in July, when the company reported Q2 earnings, the $2.77 EPS beat the forecast by 3.25%.For return-minded investors, General Dynamics offers a 2.14% dividend. The share price is high enough to make the annual payment $4.08 per share, or $1.02 paid out quarterly. The company has paid out steadily, and regularly increased the payment, going back to 2011.GD’s well-founded position in its industry has attracted Buy ratings from some of Wall Street’s best analysts. Cai Rumohr, an aerospace expert with Cowen, gave the stock his approval along with a $202 price target at the end of August. His target suggests a 6% upside. Recent gains in GD shares have pushed the stock price above the average price target. GD is selling for $190, a 16% premium to the target. The analyst consensus, based on the two most recent reviews, a buy and a hold, is to Hold this stock. Momentum is on GD’s side however, considering the stock’s gains so far this year and its key role in a critical industry.TipRanks evaluates over 5,500 Wall Street analysts, based on their success rate and average return.

2019-09-09,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning in a continuation of last week's breakout. Optimism surrounding recent strides in the U.S.-China trade war survived the weekend intact, and investors have returned to the business of buying.Source: Shutterstock Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.22% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.34%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.28%.In the options pits on Friday, calls were the hot commodity during a session that saw overall volume climb to above-average levels. Approximately 20.1 million calls and 15.4 million puts traded.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, over at the CBOE, Thursday's shallow reading in the single-session equity put/call volume ratio was followed-up by another low number of 0.56. The 10-day moving average continued its rollover with a drop to 0.66.Options traders favored calls in several marquee names. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) shares stretched to a new record high amid higher than usual options volume. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) finally broke out of a falling wedge pattern on high volume and unusual call activity. Finally, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares paused after Thursday's breakout attempt, while buyers continued to chase calls.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever Let's take a closer look: Home Depot (HD)Home Depot shares ended the week on a high note, rallying to a new record close at $231.13. Robust earnings growth, coupled with a firm price trend, have propelled the home construction giant to a 33% year-to-date gain. This compares to only a 19.3% gain for the S&P 500. Momentum traders flocking to relative strength no doubt have HD stock sitting atop their respective watch lists.Friday's surge cleared a prior pivot high signaling an official breakout that should bring buyers to the yard. That said, HD is moving into overbought territory so it's not the best entry point.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a wide margin. Total activity grew to 287% of the average daily volume, with 130,643 contracts traded; 86% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility remains in the lower quartile of its one-year range at 21%. The rank of 25% suggests selling puts, and bull puts will only yield small pay-days. If you're inclined to chase here, bull call spreads (such as buying the Nov $230/$240) offer a better risk-reward. Snap (SNAP)Snap shares have technicians salivating after Friday's textbook rally. The past month of consolidating took on the form of a falling wedge. And after pausing for a week to build momentum, SNAP stock finally burst higher with a high volume, 4.7% gain.The jump carried SNAP above near-term resistance and its 20-day moving average and signals its next upswing has officially begun. Look for followthrough to push the stock back toward its 52-week high at $18.36.Friday's buying bonanza lit a fire under options trading with calls leading the charge in a big way. By day's end, activity climbed to 283% of the average daily volume, with 259,428 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 86% of the session's sum.Implied volatility ticked higher on the day but remained in the basement. At 52%, it rests at the 13th percentile of its one-year range. The low reading, coupled with Snap's cheap price tag, make long calls a compelling buy here. The Oct $16 calls could work for a short-term speculative bet. Otherwise, grab the Jan $16 calls to give yourself more time.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects  Amazon (AMZN)Thursday's upside breakout in the tech-heavy Nasdaq is pointing the way for Amazon. Ever since July's beatdown, AMZN stock has been stuck in a trading range or base, biding time until demand would return and its long-term uptrend would resume. But if last week's awakening in stock indexes is any indication, the time for AMZN bulls to respond is now.Indeed, the stock did see a breakout attempt on Thursday, and though the follow through has been tepid, buyers hold the upper hand. Look for a run toward its 50-day moving average at $1,875.On the options trading front, calls won the popularity contest despite Friday's down day. Activity swelled to 116% of the average daily volume, with 184,251 total contracts traded. Calls added 58% to the day's take.The past month's trading range has killed implied volatility. At 23% or only the 5th percentile of its one-year range, premiums are incredibly cheap here. Bull call spreads are a no-brainer if you're banking on higher prices.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish positions in SNAP.

2019-09-11,"Although Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been red hot recently, it finally met a small roadblock on Tuesday. Here's an in-depth explanation for the session's uncomfortable selloff and, more importantly, what likely lies ahead for CMG stock.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com CMG stock has enjoyed a terrific 2019. Shares of Chipotle have returned an amazing 83%. That's more than Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or most any other large-cap stock out there. And that's on top of 2018's gains of nearly 50% in CMG. Yet as recently as Monday, shares were up nearly 99% and hitting all-time-highs.So, what gives?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Tuesday, New York City filed a lawsuit against the fast-fresh restaurant operator. Authorities allege the company violated its Fair Workweek Law. But despite investors not taking any chances with CMG stock, today's troubles aren't remotely close to being a repeat of Chipotle's food scare scandal from a couple years back.To be clear, I'm not suggesting Chipotle stock will walk away scot-free. There will be a monetary slap on the wrist when all is said and done as NYC wants at least $1 million in restitution. utlimately though, the damage will be negligible and Chipotle is working dutifully alongside officials to ensure procedures and systems are in place to comply with the city's laws in the future.The other fact to remember is Tuesday's story won't impact Chipotle's stunning and well-deserved recovery over the past two years from the nadir of its food scare crisis. The company is poised to deliver more growth with its rapidly building digital leadership through e-commerce sales, mobile apps and loyalty programs.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold According to Wedbush's Nick Setyan, Chipotle's strategic sales channels should usher in a multi-year streak of mid-to-high single-digit same-store sales growth. Along with Monday's upbeat forecast, Wedbush upgraded CMG stock from neutral to buy, while slapping a $980 12-month price target on shares. CMG Stock Price Weekly Chart    If investors look at the Chipotle stock chart for today, conditions are serving up a nice-looking pullback in the making. Tuesday's pressure has taken shares back into a test of uptrend support and toward a test of its prior, pre-scandal, all-time-high set in late 2015 and the stock's massive corrective base.Ideally, another couple sessions of profit-taking or short sellers trying their hand once again in CMG will take shares down to $755 - $760. And buyers stepping up to buy technical support around the old high will enjoy immediate gratification. Don't hold your breath though.Technically, the real world rarely works out so neatly on the price chart. That's not to say Chipotle stock isn't a buy. It is, but be prepared for price volatility around any future purchases of CMG stock.My suggestion is to size the initial buy decision in shares with the intention of buying additional CMG stock on weakness into a wide area of Fibonacci support from $565 - $773. Additionally, as the more extreme levels could produce some intestinal discomfort for any investors acting too aggressively, I'd also advise waiting for a bullish stochastics crossover or for actual oversold conditions to come into play before making that first move.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management recently exited Chipotle stock (CMG) and / or its derivatives.

2019-09-11,"After a rough late 2018, shares of home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have staged a huge rally in 2019, rising 35% year-to-date to fresh all time highs. But, with HD stock price north of $230, I'm worried that valuation friction will ultimately short circuit this big 2019 rally in Home Depot stock.Source: Mihai_Andritoiu / Shutterstock.com To be sure, there's a lot to like about HD stock here and now. The U.S. economy is picking up steam. Housing data broadly looks pretty good. The labor market remains healthy. Rates are still low. Trade conditions are improving. Hurricane Dorian has done huge damage in the Southeast, requiring massive rebuilding efforts.But, there's also one big thing not to like about HD stock here and now: valuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHome Depot is firing off multi-year low revenue, comparable sales, margin, and profit growth rates. Yet, HD stock trades at its richest valuation in several years. That's not a winning combination - especially if the long end of the yield curve rises as the outlook for the U.S. economy improves (low rates help support big valuations).As such, I'm worried about HD stock here and now. I love Home Depot stock long term. But, I don't think the current valuation is sustainable in the coming months. Lots to Like About Home Depot StockThere's a lot to like about the fundamentals underlying Home Depot stock.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy In the near term, the U.S. economy is picking up steam, as evidenced by a huge upswing in Citi's Economic Surprise Index, which measures how U.S. economic data is doing with respect to consensus estimates. For the first time in 2019, that Index just swung into positive territory. At the same time, housing data broadly looks pretty good. Existing and new home sales are still largely trending higher, as are building permits and new housing starts. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are easing. Hurricane Dorian should provide a near term lift to home improvement and repair sales in the Southeast.Against the backdrop of all that, rates are still low, Americans are still working, and wages are still moving higher. Thus, in the near term, Home Depot should benefit as the U.S. economy and housing market gain momentum against the backdrop of a healthy labor market.Meanwhile, in the long run, Home Depot has crafted a niche for itself as America's favorite home improvement retailer by becoming a one-stop shop that offers everything home improvement from product sales, to expert help, to installation services, and much more. It's tough to see anyone unseating Home Depot in this market -- they are just so big and so dominant in the home improvement space.Consequently, long term, as goes the U.S. economy and housing market, so will go Home Depot stock.In the big picture, then, both the near- and long-term fundamentals supporting HD stock are favorable. That should lead to shares heading higher, right? Current Valuation is UnsustainableThe one big impediment to Home Depot stock heading higher in the near term is the stock's valuation.Consider this. Home Depot's sales are expected to rise just over 2% this year on a 4% increase in comparable sales. Both of those growth rates are multi-year low growth rates. Over the next several years, Home Depot's sales growth isn't projected to rise much above 5% -- slower than what the company has reported over the past five years.Meanwhile, margins are expected to rise very slightly this year, a sharp divergence from the big margin expansion years Home Depot experienced earlier this decade. According to Street estimates, margins aren't expected to move much higher over the next several years as it seems like gross margins are maxed out, and mid-single-digit revenue growth isn't enough to drive significant operating leverage.Moving down the income statement, profit growth is expected at less than 3% this year. Since 2014, Home Depot has fired off nothing but double-digit profit growth rates. Home Depot is projected to be a sub-10% profit grower over the next five years.The big picture shows Home Depot is firing off multi-year low growth rates, and will remain in slow-growth mode for the foreseeable future. In stark contrast to this reality, Home Depot stock trades at 23-times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 20x.To be sure, this valuation premium is warranted by the fact that the 10-year Treasury yield has dipped to 1.6%. Yet, the long end of the yield curve is starting to move higher. It should continue to move higher for the foreseeable future as the outlook for the U.S. economy improves. As it does, HD stock's extended 23x forward earnings multiple will be under pressure. Bottom Line on Home Depot StockLong term, I like Home Depot stock. This is a company which has sustainable dominance in the secular growth U.S. home improvement retail market. That sustained dominance will drive steady revenue and profit growth in the long run -- the sum of which should drive HD stock higher.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market But, in the near term, nothing about Home Depot shares appeals to me. The current valuation is extended relative to its historical norm. Yet, the company growth profile is weak relative to its historical norm. This divergence is not a favorable one. While it is supported today by low yields, yields should creep higher over the next few months as the U.S. economic outlook improves. As they do creep higher, the divergence between the stock's valuation and growth profile will be corrected.This correction should ultimately result in HD stock pulling back towards $200.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-13,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock continues to ride high. An earnings beat in its second-quarter sent Home Depot stock surging to over $232 per share an all-time high. Lower interest rates and a renewed interest in the housing market have also helped HD stock.Source: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com However, not all headwinds for Home Depot stock have gone away. Home prices have plateaued in many major markets. Also, an inverted yield curve and the length of the current economic growth period point to a possible recession.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession Although HD stock remains a long-term winner, investors should not add to positions at these levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips HD Stock Is a Long-Term Winner Facing Near-Term StrugglesTaking a negative view of Home Depot stock is a difficult decision. After all, it did not grow to almost 2,300 stores and a $250 billion-plus market cap by making poor decisions. HD has delivered massive returns to investors over the last few decades and remains a solid long-term investment now.Admittedly, bulls have many signs of optimism on which to base their call. The Fed lowered interest rates over the summer, setting up the highest level of mortgage originations since 2018. Moreover, the company announced they had beaten estimates by nine cents per share on Aug. 20. This sparked a rally that took the HD stock price from about $208 per share to the approximate $232 per share level where it trades today.Furthermore, both Home Depot stock and its main peer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) continue to show resiliency. It continues growth even as a mature company. It also has fended off any potential threat from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company many feared would &quot;take over retail&quot; a few short years ago. Multiple Does Not Price in a Possible RecessionHowever, the recent rally took the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio to about 21.2, very close to the average PE of almost 23 it has experienced over the last five years. Admittedly, a 21.2 forward multiple is not high by S&P 500 standards. However, it seems pricey when analysts predict only 2.4% profit growth this year and 8.4% in fiscal 2021.Also, many signs point to tough times coming soon. For one, the company missed its revenue estimates. Although the market has chosen to ignore that fact, it indicates some level of struggle for the home improvement giant. Moreover, investors cannot know for sure that the economy has avoided a recession. An inverted yield curve has frequently pointed to a downturn within two years in the past.Home price growth appears mixed as well. Thanks to the lower rates, analysts forecast annual price growth of 5.4% over the next year. Still, that is an average number. Many of the larger, pricier markets such as New York or Seattle continue to see a decline in prices. Since many consider Home Depot stock a proxy for the housing market, this indicates contradiction more than growth.Further, the current economic expansion is in its 11th year. This does not mean the economy will stop growing. However, it dramatically increases the chances of a downturn. It also calls into question whether investors should pay a higher multiple for Home Depot stock in such an environment. The Bottom Line on Home Depot StockHome Depot stock has become the solid equity that investors should avoid for now. In a sense, the recent run in HD stock makes sense. Interest rates have fallen in an environment where home prices have plateaued in many major markets. Without a doubt, this increases home affordability for many.Still, the current economic expansion has become long in the tooth. Moreover, an inverted yield curve has always pointed to a recession over the last 60-plus years.Although Home Depot has matured as a company, its ability to maintain growth over the last few decades is a testament to its long-term resiliency. I still believe in the future of Home Depot stock, and I do not recommend selling at these levels, except to log some profits.However, given the current circumstances, this seems like a time where investors should try to buy Home Depot stock on the cheap, not when it trades at a higher multiple.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-09-16,"There's always a bull market somewhere. And with Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Home Depot (NYSE:HD), you don't have to look very far to appreciate that very fact. But is now a good time to buy Home Depot stock? Let's examine what's happening off and on the price chart to reach a stronger, risk-adjusted decision.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com It has been good year for the market, albeit a volatile one at times. The Dow Jones is up nearly 17% and less than 1% from recapturing late July's all-time-high. At the same time, Home Depot stock's gain of 36% has more than doubled the venerable blue-chip index while hitting fresh highs.Only the Dow's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and its return of nearly 39%, is larger than HD's rise through Friday's close. However, that top spot has come at a price. AAPL stock's gains have failed to match Home Depot's technical wherewithal with shares still 5.5% beneath its October all-time high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, what's behind the burly gains of America's largest home improvement retailer? No doubt 2019 has raised the specter of potential difficulties for Home Depot and peer Lowes (NYSE:LOW) given the ongoing U.S. China trade war and retail shelves lined with &quot;Made in China&quot; products.But so far, HD stock has managed to trump those fears.Removed from trade war concerns of what might be, a defensively positioned Home Depot has benefited from this summer's interest rate cut by the FOMC and ongoing demand for home improvement. And the good times, which showed up in August's earnings beat, aren't over either.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy According to Citi analyst Gregory Badishkanian, HD stock enjoys &quot;still-solid underlying macro fundamentals and housing drivers,&quot; which should help with further sales and margin wins. For its part Citi reaffirmed its buy rating while lifting the price target on HD from $246 to $269 and a premium of 15% compared to Friday's closing price. Home Depot Stock Price Monthly Chart Technically speaking, Home Depot stock appears ready for a strong second-half of 2019 after dismantling a large bearish topping pattern.In August, HD produced an earnings-driven breakout from a 20-month long broadening base pattern. This type of formation is generally viewed as bearish once the fifth pivot receives price confirmation through the low of the monthly candlestick. Home Depot stock obliged bearish shorts as it traded beneath July's low of $212.39 and eventually down to $197.84 before quickly and unequivocally failing.A bullish earnings gap and follow-through in Home Depot stock took shares to new highs while also breaking out above angular pattern resistance. Now September's price action is confirming August's engulfing candlestick while being supported by a bullishly positioned stochastics indicator.With HD shares just a couple percent above the August high, it's time to embrace the bearish pattern failure as an important signal to go long shares. I'm inclined to see Citi's price target of $269 to perhaps as much as $275 in Home Depot stock as a reasonable forecast for shares.My recommendation is to simply buy Home Depot stock today and set an initial stop-loss below $219. Early Monday and with HD trading around $232.50, that works out to price exposure of 6%. That's attractive relative to the risk taken. And smartly, it pulls the plug on the position just in case the broadening pattern has a repeat and more bearish performance in store for Home Depot stock.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-09-17,"The stock market's major indices are at or near all-time highs, and as stocks go up, dividend yields go down. As a result, many of the best dividend stocks to buy right now sport relatively modest yields.That's OK. Because your focus also should be on dividend safety and payout growth that will enhance your yield over time.Not every stock has been caught up in 2019's surge to new peaks. GameStop (GME), CenturyLink (CTL), Vodafone (VOD), Pitney Bowes (PBI), L Brands (LB), Deutsche Bank (DB) - all of these well-known companies have either cut or outright suspended their dividends this year. Those moves were a blow to all existing shareholders, but especially those who were relying on the income from these sometimes generous dividend payers to tackle regular expenses in retirement.How do you ensure the dividend stocks you're invested in won't do the same? One way is to monitor the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON's methodology uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health, where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut. And within each of these ratings is a composite score determined by cash flow, earnings, stock buybacks and other factors.These are 13 of the safest dividend stocks to buy right now. Each stock has not only achieved a DIVCON 5 score, but a composite score within the top 15 of all stocks that DIVCON has evaluated. This makes them the crème de la crème of dividend safety - and more likely to keep the dividend increases coming going forward.

2019-09-18,"With the major indices scoring a fairly strong September, recession fears may have subsided for some. Plus, certain metrics for the U.S. economy appear healthy, suggesting that the bears are overplaying their hand. Thus, loading up on dividend stocks to buy for a coming downturn seems unnecessary.Of course, I don't have a crystal ball: none of us do. Perhaps President Trump can convince the Federal Reserve to perform some fiscal voodoo, keeping the party going. Still, I believe that no matter what your perspective is, dividend stocks represent an important component of your portfolio, and especially at this juncture.First, let's look at reality. According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Research, the average price of a house sold jumped over 37% since the beginning of this decade. In contrast, the hourly earnings of all employees only gained a little over 25% during the same period. In many markets, housing affordability greatly exceeds personal income. That's probably not a sustainable situation, which bolsters the case for recession-resistant dividend stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, it's not just the U.S.-China trade war that drives the case for contextually defensive dividend stocks. Because we live in a globalized economy, nothing occurs in a vacuum. Germany is finding that out the hard way, with exports to China suffering due to geopolitical conflicts. And if Germany goes down, it could send a ripple effect everywhere else.  * 10 Defense Stocks to Buy During Rising Geopolitical Tensions Finally, the stock market's total market capitalization is 144% of the last reported GDP. That's extreme speculation, meaning you better be right about your non-recession call. Otherwise, here are eight dividend stocks to buy: Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession: Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I usually don't like to start off my list with speculative or overheated names. However, I'm going to make an exception for Dollar General (NYSE:DG). Yes, DG stock has absolutely soared so far this year, gaining over 48% since January's opening session. Also, I concede that after a huge jump late August, shares are liable to come down.When or if they do, however, I'd look into picking up shares. Primarily, the enthusiasm over DG stock has fundamental justification. Both Dollar General and rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) produced solid earnings results overall. For Dollar General, the discount retailer raised its full-year guidance despite the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.Secondly, I think investors can reasonably expect bullishness to underline DG stock if our economy weakens. With wage growth not keeping pace with housing prices, a good-sized shock could disproportionately impact our labor market. That would drive increased traffic to discount retailers.Of course, compared to other dividend stocks to buy, Dollar General's yield is nothing to write home about. But with its relevant business, DG may offer some capital growth to compensate. Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Logically, recessions make everything worse. Not only must you complete your usual routine, you also must do so with potentially less funds. But what's truly problematic is that recessions don't coincide to fit your timetable conveniently. If something goes wrong, it'll go wrong when it wants to. And that simple thesis underlines Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and HD stock.As with Dollar General, HD stock has outperformed many other dividend stocks. Therefore, I'm not necessarily fishing to buy shares right now, especially near all-time highs. But with every dip and dive, HD stock becomes increasingly appealing.First, in my opinion, Home Depot has a moat against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While modern shoppers have gravitated toward the e-commerce platform, many shoppers prefer the brick-and-mortar experience. A big reason why is because they can see and test out products before purchase. This is especially crucial for home repair or renovation projects.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale Second, cash-strapped families are more likely to shop at Home Depot during an economic downturn. Video platforms like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube have made do-it-yourself projects more accessible. Indirectly, this benefits HD stock as people are financially incentivized to roll up their sleeves. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com A common theme among defensive dividend stocks to buy is that they have outperformed this year. For those who don't believe that we're facing a recession, they may want to consider why names like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have delivered robust market returns. On a year-to-date basis, PG stock has jumped 36%.In a world where drones fly your online purchases to your door, what Procter & Gamble offers seems incredibly boring: toothpaste, tampons, hair products, dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent, among many other product categories. At the same time, these are also necessities: unless it's an extremely severe one, recessions don't prevent people from taking care of themselves. Hence, you have your case for PG stock.Moreover, as a stalwart among blue-chip dividend stocks, Procter & Gamble represents a safety valve for your portfolio. This is not a get-rich-overnight investment. It might not make you rich at all. However, the secular demand for the company's products should help PG stock weather the storm. PepsiCo (PEP)Source: Shutterstock While recession-resistant consumer dividend stocks tend to emphasize the necessities, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) demonstrates that's not always the case. Since the start of this year, PEP stock has jumped over 27%. For traditional soft drink makers, the bullishness in this arena is a welcome change.For many years, investors avoided PEP stock and rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) because of shifting consumer behaviors. The major problem was that younger consumers eschewed sugary, carbonated drinks for healthier alternatives. That has led to frustrating sideways consolidation for shares of Coca-Cola, as well as PEP stock.To their credit, neither PepsiCo nor Coca-Cola took the consumer behavioral change lying down. Specifically for PepsiCo, management shifted their priorities to higher-growth beverage segments, such as energy drinks. They've also invested heavily in Bubly, Pepsi's sparkling water brand.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy Best of all, these changes are working. PepsiCo scored an earnings and revenue beat for its second-quarter report. Also, a recession might provide an unexpected lift for PEP stock. In a downturn, beggars can't be choosers. Therefore, don't be surprised to see a lift in cheap, sugary soft drinks. Disney (DIS)Source: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.com Among dividend stocks to buy, Disney (NYSE:DIS) presents a very tricky case. On the bearish end of the spectrum, the trade war has a direct impact on the global tourism industry. Recently, the Financial Review noted that fewer Chinese tourists are visiting Australia, sounding alarm for the nation's tourism industry.If the Chinese aren't visiting countries close to them, they're certainly less inclined to visit the U.S. Naturally, this may hurt DIS stock, which enjoys a dominant presence in the theme park and resort space.On the other hand, Disney owns multiple resorts and entertainment properties throughout Asia. Even in economically rough circumstances, many families like to treat themselves to an excursion.Plus, other elements of Disney's businesses are quite compelling in a slump. For example, the company is rolling out their streaming service called Disney+. It features the Magic Kingdom's lucrative content library, along with shows inspired by marquee franchises like Star Wars. That's a huge plus for DIS stock.As far as the yield goes, many other dividend stocks offer superior passive income. However, Disney has a very stable business that becomes net more attractive in a recession. AT&T (T)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com Although it frequently pops up in lists of dividend stocks to buy, AT&T (NYSE:T) is somewhat of a controversial name. That's because the telecom giant has been very acquisitive, and many observers don't view this as a positive attribute. Principally, AT&T's $85 billion buyout of TimeWarner seemed excessive to conservative investors.For a while, the detractors were dead-on with their assessment. Since the early spring of 2017, T stock was mired in an ugly bearish trend channel. At its worst, shares closed below $30 in December of last year.However, since hitting that bottom, T stock has looked much more interesting. I'll admit that the capital growth narrative is a more of a slow grind. But that's what dividend stocks do, right? Additionally, while it inched higher, shareholders received a nice payout.  * 10 Defense Stocks to Buy During Rising Geopolitical Tensions Over the long run, I believe T stock has potential. First, the 5G rollout cannot occur with giants like AT&T and rival Verizon (NYSE:VZ) investing in the infrastructure. Second, while the TimeWarner deal was expensive, it does give the company a valuable content empire. Cinemark (CNK)Source: Rennett Stowe via Flickr (modified)Over the past few months, I've consistently forwarded the argument that recessions place a premium on sources of entertainment. Although Americans are generally hard-working and have a history of working harder when the times get tough, we're not robots. We do need our downtime, a distraction from our daily troubles. This is where Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) and CNK stock come into the picture.Under the Cinemark umbrella, the company has multiple brands: its namesake brand, Century Theatres, Tinseltown USA, CineArts and Rave Cinemas. This allows the company to cater to different tastes. Audience members can watch summer blockbusters in Century Theatres, often located in major metropolitan areas. For those who prefer classier affairs, they can enjoy films showing at CineArts.But what really drives interest for CNK stock is its comparatively low overhead. Cinemark features fewer locations in high-rent areas. Therefore, the company is more profitable than its rivals.Another important factor for CNK stock is Cinemark's lower ticket prices relative to the competition. With a possible recession on the horizon, low-cost leaders will look more attractive. Therefore, don't overlook Cinemark in your short list of dividend stocks to buy. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Touting Cinemark's comparatively low overhead, there doesn't seem to be much reason to talk about AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Sure, people want a distraction from their troubles. Additionally, as I've mentioned before about AMC stock, it's money well spent. When you compare buying movie tickets to watching professional sports live, there's no comparison.However, you can also say the same about Cinemark. So what makes AMC stock worth buying, especially considering the company's lower margins relative to Cinemark? It comes down to that one word repeated three times: location, location, location.Take a look at Cinemark's southern California locations: I count a whopping 22 theaters. This covers Los Angeles County and a handful of locations in Riverside and Orange counties. Interestingly, San Diego gets zero love.Now compare that to AMC. Throughout high-market areas, you get extensive representation. Plus, AMC Theatres tend to be located in nicer neighborhoods.  * 7 Fantastic Fidelity Funds for a Range of Investors If these factors aren't enough to convince you to buy AMC stock, it also pays a nearly 7% dividend yield for your troubles.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long T stock and AMC stock.

2019-09-23,"AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) is the largest after-market auto parts retailer in North America. While there are plenty of e-commerce up-and-comers as well as brick-and-mortar competitors, AZO continues to dominate the sector.Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com As with most old school, brick-and-mortar industries, many feared that the traditional auto parts stores would succumb to online stores that were able to out compete on price, even if there was a lag in delivery time.However, that's proving not to be the case. As of May, AZO had 5,686 stores across the United States and Puerto Rico. And AutoZone added 35 new stores in the past year. Those stores are delivering enough sales growth -- and particularly earnings growth -- to earn AZO stock an &quot;A&quot; rating from my Portfolio Grader tool. These earnings also earn AutoZone stock a place on my Top 5 Stocks for Growth Investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AZO Stock Benefits From DIY MentalityWhy? The answer is simple. It seems that most people that buy auto parts and materials prefer laying their hands on the products.It also might be that most DIY-ers know that they may need to make a second trip for another tool to get the job done. Like home improvement stores Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) there's an advantage to having a big selection of supplies around when someone is ready to start a project.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Also, many folks that are on a budget get the tools and supplies they need as they need them, rather than buying them ahead of time. This kind of thinking is why same-store sales remain strong for AutoZone.It also helps to have staff present to help you make sure you're getting the right part. And when it comes to used batteries or other parts, AZO allows you to drop them off in exchange for store credit toward new parts. Going GlobalThe other piece of the equation, as I've explained in Growth Investor, is its operations outside the U.S. AZO has 576 stores in Mexico and 25 in Brazil.Both of those markets are great places for a U.S.-based firm in this sector to establish a presence. AZO knows how to do the market research, sort out supply chain challenges and manage inventory.Chains with such breadth and depth are especially valuable to customers in regions that aren't used to having such convenience available. And given the grinding recession that has been going on in Brazil, DIY work on cars is a very popular way to save some money.What's more, the fact that AZO is slowly entering Brazil shows that management is smart about targeting new markets. It can get an idea of how well the stores are doing and products are popular to better understand the customers. This in turn gives AutoZone increased confidence.It seems to have already found the model for the U.S. and Mexico. And remember AZO is not a franchise operation -- all the stores are directly owned by the company. AutoZone Stock ValuationAutoZone may all be all about vehicle components, but, unlike a car, AZO stock is worth more than the sum of its parts. AZO is up almost 38% year-to-date and 50% in the past year. While strong fundamentals are certainly contributing to that, another key factor is buying pressure from big, institutional cash on Wall Street.That's a major reason AZO stock gets an &quot;A&quot; from me (and there's a couple of other things you should be looking for in a stock at this juncture, too).With all these strengths, it's no surprise that my Portfolio Grader rates AZO as a &quot;Strong Buy.&quot; But what may be surprising is that after all the growth we've seen so far this year, AZO stock still has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio just a hair above 20.And there's a market phenomenon going on right now that works to drive these ratios even lower. How Washington Created the Biggest Investor Windfall in HistoryWith all this talk of trade wars and oil wars, let's not lose sight of what's driving the economy here in the United States. One major catalyst is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Not only will U.S. corporations save $600 billion -- even more money stashed overseas can finally return.That being said, only 13% of these tax savings will go to workers, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. So where will the rest of this massive pot of money go?I've got the full details on this trend -- and how to profit -- in this investor briefing. Long story short: Much of this money will go right back to investors, and particularly dividend investors. Yet new investors will be able to buy these stocks cheaply.From my own research, I can tell that the best way to get your slice of this pie is with a group I've started calling the Bulletproof Stocks.

2019-10-04,"For investors, a little can go a long way. That's the theory behind investing in small-cap stocks. These stocks have the ability to beat large-cap stocks over time … if you know which of these stocks to buy.One of the reasons for this is because of their relatively low price. When these companies have even small increases in revenue, it can have a significant impact on their sales and profit. And since these companies typically have a lower stock price, a small movement of just a few dollars in their price can be a 20% or higher positive return on their investment.The end of the calendar year is a time for investors to take stock of where their portfolio is, and where they want it to go. We've identified five small-cap stocks that look to finish out the year in style. Some of these companies have seen growth this year that has outpaced that of the S&P 500, and represents a much smaller investment on our part.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors So without further explanation, let's take a look at five small-cap stocks to buy as we get ready to put a wrap on 2019. Best Small-Cap Stocks to Buy This Year: LivePerson, Inc. (LPSN)Source: Shutterstock If you've ever had a &quot;live chat&quot; online and realized that you weren't talking to a real person, you've probably been exposed to LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) technology. The company uses artificial intelligence to deal with customer relations management. The company calls their technology &quot;conversational commerce&quot; and it allows businesses to interact with their customers at a fraction of the cost of using live agents.LivePerson serves the needs of two demographics (milennials and Gen Z) who prefer messaging to human conversation. The company currently works with over 18,000 businesses, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Delta (NYSE:DAL) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). LivePerson is one of the best performing stocks on the market regardless of size. It is up nearly 100% year-to-date.In the most recent quarter, the company announced that it signed more deals than it had in all of 2018, and recent comments from the company's CEO Rob Locascio indicate the addressable market is continuing to grow. To capture this market, the LPSN is adding to its sales team, which will add to the company's expenses in the short term. However, the company forecasts year-over-year growth in the high teens for this year and 20% growth in 2020. The company generated $249.8 million in revenue, which is up 14% from 2017. Telaria, Inc. (TLRA)Source: Shutterstock The trend toward consumers cutting the cord is having an effect on how advertising is delivered. Which is where Telaria (NYSE:TLRA) comes in. Telaria delivers digital video solutions that address mobile, over-the-top and connected TV (CTV) content.For the past two years, Telaria has been a revenue-generating machine. Their revenue on CTV devices increased 322% year-over-year in 2018. As of March of this year, revenue from CTV devices accounted for almost 1/3 of their revenue. And the company is forecasting an increased demand for their tools, allowing them to capture more market share.  * 7 Stocks to Buy From the Harvard Endowment The share price took a recent tumble, but with the revenue the company is generating, this may have been a case where the market got ahead of itself. What is more intriguing about the stock is that the consensus analyst expectation is for the company to turn a profit in 2020. This would require a growth rate of approximately 68%. While this may be a little optimistic, the company has a clean balance sheet with regard to debt and certainly looks like a low risk for investors who are concerned about investing in a company that has yet to post a profit. Callaway Golf (ELY)Source: Shutterstock The good news for Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY) is that they have high brand equity. They are one of the most recognized golfing brands. And their &quot;[e]quipment and golf balls account for over 60% of its revenue.&quot; What has some investors concerned is the added debt the company has accumulated as they've tried to grow through acquisition.However, this debt appears to represent an opportunity for ELY to increase its exposure in other markets. That has been the case with their acquisition of Jack Wolfskin that increased its presence in China and Central Europe. As of March, revenue outside the United States accounted for over 50% of its sales.Furthermore, the company has a solid balance sheet with a gross margin in &quot;the high 40% range.&quot; Callaway also has positive trailing-12-month net income of $90 million of net income through the first quarter of this year. Recently Raymond James raised its rating on ELY stock to an Outperform from Market Perform. The analyst firm also raised its price target for Callaway to $21, which would give the stock about a 15% bump from its current level. Instructure (INST)Source:  PRONEC Corporation via FlickrWhen you're looking to invest in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, you want to see that they have well-established products. Instructure (NYSE:INST) has two products that should be able to provide solid, repeatable revenue for the company. Its main product, Canvas, is widely used in the higher education market. And their newest product, Bridge, is starting to catch on with corporations.  * 7 Next-Generation Healthcare Stocks to Buy But Instructure has a wide range of software products that are being used by over 4,000 colleges, universities and K-12 school systems. And each client pays the company thousands to millions of dollars. Even better news for the company is a net revenue retention rate that exceeded 100% in 2018. In fact, revenue from recurring subscriptions is over 90% of INST's sales. And sales saw a 30% YoY increase to $210 million in 2018. The combination of the education and corporate markets gives the company an estimated $15 billion addressable market. Institutional investors are buying large volumes of shares from the company as well signaling that the stock may be on the verge of a breakout.  Freshpet (FRPT)Source: Shutterstock Rounding out our list of small-cap stocks to look at for the remainder of 2019 is Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT). In case you haven't noticed, the pet industry is big business. The math is simple and favorable. There are over 300 million pets in America. The dog- and cat-food retail market is valued at over $30 billion with a compounded annual rate of growth of 6%.That's the pool that Freshpet is swimming in. But they're not just swimming, they're disrupting the market. Freshpet supplies refrigerated, fresh food options by providing refrigerators in over 20,000 retail outlets. That was a 10% YoY increase. Sales are estimated to increase by 24% in 2019.The company's stock was punished after it posted a second-quarter loss that was larger than expected. There was also some concern about contracting margins. However, for a long-term growth stock like Freshpet, increasing revenue should be the priority for investors. That has been the driver for a stock price that has tripled over the last three years. According to CEO Billy Cyr, &quot;Our second-quarter results demonstrate continued momentum behind our Feed the Growth strategy. Our strategic advertising investment drove our strongest gains in household penetration and retail availability in several years, giving us tremendous confidence that Freshpet is still in the puppy stage…with significant growth ahead.&quot;As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-16,"After a strong earnings-driven rally yesterday, U.S. equity benchmarks gave back some of those gains Wednesday following some slack retail sales data.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Retail sales dipped 0.30% in September, disappointing analysts that had been forecasting a 0.30% increase. In better news, the Commerce Department revised the August figure to a gain of 0.60%, but as stocks' performance today indicates, market participants focused more on the September number, a logical approach considering the holiday shopping season is essentially upon us.I've been reluctant to join the calls regarding a recession, but I've also been clear that the consumer is integral when it comes to holding things together for the U.S. economy. Another bit of silver lining is that the September retail sales figure was the first decline in seven months and that the decline was largely attributable to spending drops at motor vehicle supply stores.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong Dow components, looming earnings reports from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) should bring the state of the consumer into clearer view.For today, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.30% while the S&P 500 declined 0.20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated by 0.08% with just 12 of its 30 components higher in late trading.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the only Dow stock to gain more than 1% today on what looked liked some follow through on Tuesday's earnings report as well as some favorable reaction to some of the various opioid-related verdicts the company is contending with. Other Bright SpotsIn late trading, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, was clinging to a modest gain. This might be another example of follow through on yesterday's earnings report as well as a sympathy move on the back of Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) strong report out earlier today.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever &quot;Given the fact that multiple rate cuts have already occurred, with the possibility for more, this was not surprising,&quot; said Morningstar in a note on JPM out yesterday. &quot;Management also nailed down its expense guidance a bit more, coming in at roughly $65.5 billion, whereas before the guidance was simply for less than $66 billion. After incorporating these and other changes, we are increasing our fair value estimate to $114 per share from $110.&quot; Finally Some Good NewsShares of 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) traded lower today, extending the stock's run as one of this year's worst-performing Dow names, but the stock is up more than 8% over the past week and some analysts are waxing bullish on the industrial conglomerate.&quot;Even after the 4% bounce on Oct. 11, we still believe the stock trades at a discount to intrinsic value in a diversified industrial space with few bargains,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note on 3M. &quot;As a GDP-plus business, 3M doesn't offer much in the way of top-line growth. Even so, we like the name with speculation of an upcoming recession because 3M is a defensive stock.&quot; Oil WoesWhile there was some talk that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may extend recent supply cuts, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the worst performers in the Dow Jones today.Big oil companies report third-quarter earnings later this month, but some analysts are already warning that estimates could be missed and that could explain some of the malaise in the group today. This year, energy is the worst-performing group in the S&P 500.  * 7 Big Bank Stocks on the Move  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayReminder that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reports today after the bell and that tomorrow is light on the Dow earnings front with none of the index's members report. American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) resume Dow earnings season on Friday before the bell.As for the consumer, there are some good data points to consider.&quot;Perhaps the biggest difference versus last cycle: consumers are less indebted. On the eve of the financial crisis consumers were contending with record levels of debt,&quot; according to BlackRock. &quot;At its peak in 2007, household debt was more than 130% of disposable income. Today household debt is less than 100% of income. Not only are debt levels lower, but thanks to historically low yields the cost of servicing the debt is near an historic low.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-18,"[Editor's note: &quot;8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]With so much uncertainty weighing on key economic metrics -- most notably the U.S.-China trade war -- the idea of buying dividend stocks is an attractive one. Primarily, as passive-income generating securities, dividend-bearers are likely to weather volatility better than stocks that don't offer payouts. Plus, any capital returns are bonuses on top of the yield.Source: Shutterstock However, dividend stocks typically have one glaring weakness, especially for those who depend on stocks for income: their payouts occur on a quarterly basis. That's not particularly helpful when our society revolves around monthly cost expenditures, such as mortgages, car payments, and utility bills. And that's one of the reasons why monthly dividend stocks are so attractive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder this arrangement, you're receiving income 12 times a year as opposed to the usual four times. Because money has a time component to it, monthly dividend stocks allow investors much more flexibility. Also, if you like to reinvest dividends into more shares of the target asset, a monthly schedule allows you to advantage technical dynamics, such as a pricing dip.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock That said, conservative investors should adopt the same precautions toward monthly dividend stocks as you would any income-generating investment. For instance, you should never jump aboard a company or fund merely because they pay out monthly. The key here is healthy cash flows and robust, stable sectors.At the same time, monthly dividend stocks offer speculators a reason to join in on the fun. With payouts every 30 days, sometimes risky, high-yielding names offer compelling opportunities. Of course, that depends on your personal tolerance to volatility.And with these cautionary notes out of the way, here are the eight best monthly dividend stocks to consider in 2019: LTC Properties (LTC)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to boring sectors as I mentioned above, I can't think of anything more sleep-inducing than senior care. At the same time, I can't think of anything more robust and relevant than the senior care market. That's why investors ought to take a long look at LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) and LTC stock.As a viable name among monthly dividend stocks, LTC Properties utilizes a powerful tool as leverage: demographics. Baby Boomers are retiring in droves, which present serious challenges. But they also present opportunities. Increasingly, millennials are taking care of their aging family members, indirectly bolstering the case for LTC stock. That's because a senior may not have adequate funds, but a working millennial might.Furthermore, LTC stock has steadily trekked higher since the collapse of the 2000 tech bubble. Given the demographic tailwinds, I expect this longer-term trend to continue. Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN)Source: Shutterstock Main Street Capital Corporation (NYSE:MAIN) is what experts refer to as a business development company. In this case, Main Street provides debt and equity financing to small and mid-tier private organizations. With a broad range of services, they're able to help scale businesses as their output expands.And supporting the case for MAIN stock is the current entrepreneurial environment. With the advent of e-commerce technologies, and the digitalization of everything, there's never been a better time than now to start a business. Moreover, the efficiencies inherent in smaller and more nimble organizations allow them to disrupt larger entities. Again, this supports the capital gains narrative for MAIN stock.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Just as importantly, the underlying company has a track record for delivering the goods under pressure. For instance, Main Street first offered MAIN stock to the public in 2007. While incurring volatility during the financial crisis, shares fought back. Today, it pays out a healthy dividend monthly that yields nearly 6%. Realty Income (O)Source: Shutterstock Whenever discussions about monthly dividend stocks come about, it's almost inevitable that you'll hear the name Realty Income (NYSE:O). And that's for good reason. Although a boring name, strong and consistent cash flows back up O stock. Obviously, this is critical for a company paying out monthly; after all, the money for dividends has to come from somewhere!But O stock has two reasons why it's especially relevant at this juncture. First, the Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates despite robust domestic economic metrics. Global economies don't necessarily share the same optimism as the U.S. Furthermore, the Fed is determined to learn the lessons that led to the disastrous 2008 financial crisis. Thus, investors seeking substantive yields will probably gravitate toward investments like O stock.Second, many of the commercial properties that Realty Income owns feature retailers who have competitive or natural moats against e-commerce threats like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). For example, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) customers like to see and test out their prospective products. You simply don't get that convenience from online channels. And this dynamic should keep the rent money flowing into O stock, which bolsters the dividend payout. Shaw Communications (SJR)Source: Shutterstock Canadian cable company Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) is another name that frequently pops up among recommended monthly dividend stocks. It's not hard to see why. Currently, SJR stock has a dividend yield of 4.5%. Shares have also gained over 10% since January's opening price.More importantly, SJR stock should prove to be incredibly relevant in the years ahead. While cable is a dying industry due to the streaming revolution, Shaw levers a wireless subsidiary called Freedom Mobile Inc. And in April of this year, Freedom substantially expanded its wireless footprint in the Canadian market. This move improves Freedom's LTE service and lays the groundwork for the upcoming 5G rollout.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Finally, Shaw is a name that delivers a consistent revenue and earnings stream. As a result, it generally features reliable free cash flow -- which is key for stocks that pay out monthly. And while cord cutting hurts SJR stock in the nearer-term, I believe its spectrum coverage will outweigh these concerns. Pembina Pipeline (PBA)In years past, the oil market used to be a no-brainer: we consume energy and therefore we need energy. However, rising global supplies have depressed prices, making this sector a tough call. But infrastructural plays like Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) typically offer stability.No matter what happens in the underlying market, transportation of energy-related commodities is vital. In recent years, this dynamic supported the bullish case for PBA stock.Still, some risks cloud the narrative for PBA stock. First, shares have done well this year, moving up 21% year-to-date. But the equity has demonstrated some notable volatility in recent sessions. Thus, prospective buyers may want to wait a little before pulling the trigger.Further, Pembina doesn't have the greatest balance sheet. With a total debt to total equity ratio of 63, I wouldn't go all in on PBA stock. That said, energy remains a viable long-term play due to the uncertainties of renewable alternatives. Therefore, Pembina is among the riskier monthly dividend stocks that nonetheless deserves a careful look. Colony Credit Real Estate (CLNC)For those who are interested in higher stakes -- and of course, higher yields -- you should check out Colony Credit Real Estate (NYSE:CLNC). CLNC stock provides shareholders exposure to the world of commercial real estate credit REITs, or real estate investment trusts. Essentially, the company finances and manages commercial real estate debt.Now, I must give you some cautionary notes for CLNC stock. First, shares have not enjoyed the greatest time since its introduction in early 2018. A massive collapse in November of last year, along with the rest of the markets, has not inspired confidence.Also, as a commercial debt investor, Colony Credit faces turbulence from a possible downturn in the economy. With most folks talking about at least a correction coming up, CLNC stock is only for the risk tolerant.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock However, shares have stabilized this year and has recently inched forward. Plus, with a yield of 12%, CLNC is one of the monthly dividend stocks that will consistently draw eyeballs. Armour Residential REIT (ARR)If you want another high-stakes REIT among monthly dividend stocks, but with a residential angle, consider Armour Residental REIT (NYSE:ARR). ARR stock gives you exposure to mortgage-backed securities which are backed by a federal entity, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.Of course, whenever anyone hears the term mortgage-backed securities, the last housing crisis comes immediately to mind. Certainly, no investment is foolproof and that should give you pause before diving into ARR stock.On the flipside, both the government and the mortgage industry have taken the lessons of the last decade to heart. Today, it's very difficult to quality for a mortgage unless you've got your financial house in order. Additionally, homeowners themselves have learned not to overextend themselves. Thus, this environment helps bring some confidence toward ARR stock.Lastly, Armour Residential has a history of consistently rich monthly payouts going back to 2015. But I wouldn't get too comfortable as the payouts have declined in value over this time. Also, ARR stock is down nearly  18% YTD. All that said, if you're willing to assume the risk, Armour is an interesting play due to the current economic resiliency. Mesa Royalty Trust (MTR)Source: Shutterstock A far riskier counterpart to Pembina Pipeline, Mesa Royalty Trust (NYSE:MTR) is truly an investment only for the hardened speculator. From the get-go, MTR stock screams caution.Let's start with the obvious. Mesa Royalty distinguishes itself from the other monthly dividend stocks on this list because the company doesn't own anything. Instead, it has an interest in oil and natural gas projects dispersed throughout the U.S. Basically, the dividend from MTR stock represents a share of the spoils from the facilities' output.This leads to my next concern about MTR stock: volatility. I'm not just talking about the share price, which historically is terrible. The payout fluctuates like mad. Needless to say, Mesa Royalty will not belong on a list of stable dividend stocks anytime soon.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Still, the company offers the prospect of a big payday that could arrive at any month. For instance, earlier in March, Mesa paid out nearly 19 cents for each share of MTR stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-25,"Is it time to shop for a pop in Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock? Let's look at what's happening off and on the SHOP stock price chart and see if shares are ready for a risk-adjusted purchase, or maybe the wish list shopping cart instead. Let me explain.Source: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.com Buying on weakness in the stock market is a proven strategy. And there's little doubt SHOP stock has settled into just that sort of opportunity. In recent weeks shares of the e-commerce solutions platform shed as much as 30% from its late August all-time high. And SHOP is still off 25%. Moreover, buying after a correction the size of Shopify's is a popular approach among savvy growth investors recognizing even the best stocks can fall temporarily out-of-favor.  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income The fact is even the market's largest companies from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Costco (NASDAQ:COST) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have all suffered this type of unavoidable behavior at one time or another en route to enriching their shareholders. So SHOP stock is a buy, right?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShopify does maintain its share of favorable supports backing a purchase right now. Aside from buying SHOP at a healthy discount from recent highs, shares are also more than 10% below last quarter's bullish earnings reaction. At the same time, analysts fully expect another quarter of solid growth when the company reports next Wednesday night.Still, Shopify isn't perfect and investors should be prepared for volatility.For one, as Shopify has grown its e-commerce business competition continues to heat up. And among those challengers is the market's 800-pound gorilla Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). SHOP also relies heavily on merchants that source their goods from China and use a drop shipping model. Neither is good for Shopify if the trade war wages on.Shopify stock's valuation isn't cheap either. Even for those that can see the company's long-term potential like InvestorPlace's Ian Bezek, buying SHOP is a difficult proposition. And with a forward price multiple of 325x earnings, 27x sales, lighter revenue growth trends and only modest cash flow generation coming out of SHOP, some of that concern is understandable. SHOP Stock Price Weekly ChartAs the provided and well-illustrated weekly chart shows, SHOP stock has done a lot of things technically pleasing on the way up over the last couple years. And aside from the picture perfect correction of 30%, shares continue to act constructively as Shopify tries to establish a bullish double bottom pattern.If you think I'm bullish, you're correct. Despite some of SHOP's valuation concerns, the fact is it's also not unusual for a growth stock of Shopify's caliber to look and remain expensive as shares enjoy their largest and fastest gains in their momentum phase. Bottom-line, Wall Street isn't known for its RSVPs. But I'm also not a buyer of Shopify stock right here.SHOP Stock Buy Strategy: I'd recommend investors wait for weekly price confirmation of the pattern bottom, as well as a clear sign Shopify's stochastics are turning bullishly up inside oversold territory before buying shares. Should SHOP stock accommodate our wishes in front of earnings I would highly stress the use of an options hedge to protect the stock purchase or a limited-risk bull call spread for positioning.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-11-01,"One of the hardest things to do in the stock market is to time the bottom in a falling stock. That's because momentum is a very real thing. Stocks that have been trending higher, usually continue to trend higher. Stocks that have been trending lower, usually continue to trend lower.But that doesn't mean investors should completely avoid buying the dip in falling stocks. Those can often turn into some of the most profitable trades.Instead, it means investors should be very selective in buying dips and pay attention to the clues surrounding these falling stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne such clue is insider activity. That is, investors should look for falling stocks which insiders are buying on the dip, since this show of confidence from insiders is usually a bullish sign that the worst is over and a bottom is close.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November With that in mind, let's take a look at five cheap and falling stocks that insiders are buying the dip in, and see whether or not these stocks have actually bottomed. Insider Buying Stocks: Ulta (ULTA)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Shares of cosmetics retailer Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) fell off a cliff in late August after the company reported ugly second-quarter numbers which missed revenue and profit estimates, and also included a cut to its full-year profit guide.In the wake of that big selloff, insiders have turned bullish. Specifically, there have been five open market purchases of ULTA stock since the post-earnings selloff, led by long-time board member Charles Heilbronn. This was the guy was cashing out on ULTA stock on the way up -- before the plunge. Thus, the fact that he's buying the dip now is a bullish reversal sign.Indeed, Heilbronn is part of a broader reversal here. Over the past three months, there have been zero insider sales of ULTA stock. Compare that to the prior nine months, where there were 37 insider sale transactions. In other words, insiders aren't selling anymore.Does that mean the worst is over for ULTA stock? I think so. The post-Q2 selloff was overdone. Sure, the numbers weren't great, and the growth narrative here is slowing. But, this is a still a very strong company, supported by secular cosmetics adoption tailwinds, healthy margins, direct retail expansion and a big unit growth runway.In the long run, those strong growth drivers will power profits significantly higher. As those profits trend higher, so will ULTA stock. The Tile Shop (TTS)Source: Rosemarie Mosteller / Shutterstock.com Struggling retailer The Tile Shop (NASDAQ:TTS) recently reported really ugly third-quarter numbers in late October that included negative comparable-store sales growth, margin erosion, a net loss and a surprise delisting announcement. In response to the ugly print, TTS stock lost more than two-thirds of its value.In the wake of the huge selloff, though, insiders stepped up. Board member Peter Jacullo bought roughly 2.4 million shares over the span of a few days, while the chief financial officer and chief accounting officer both acquired about 60,000 shares. In response to this vote of confidence from insiders, investors have bought the dip, too. From its post-earnings lows, TTS stock is already up 90% -- and it's only been a few days.Will this rebound last? It's tough to say. At current levels TTS stock is certainly cheap. But, revenues, margins and profits are all dropping. Current fundamentals imply that they will keep dropping, as The Tile Shop finds itself as an undifferentiated retailer in a crowded building materials space that is rapidly consolidating around leaders like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Floor & Decor (NYSE:FND).  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Struggle to Continue Payout Hikes As such, this insider-driven rebound in TTS stock may just be a head-fake. Until the fundamentals turn around here, caution is warranted. Stage Stores (SSI)Source: WhisperToMe via Wikimedia CommonsDepressed department store operator Stage Stores (NYSE:SSI) has been the recipient of significant insider buying over the past three months as the company has more aggressively pursued its discount-oriented turnaround plan.Here's the story. Stage Stores owns two types of stores -- full-price stores and off-price stores. The full-price stores aren't doing well. The off-price stores are doing much better. But, most of the company's stores today are full-price stores. Management wants to change that. They want to close some of those full-price stores and turn the rest into off-price stores. Thus, the big plan here is to turn Stage Stores into a mini TJX (NYSE:TJX) or Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST).Will it work? It could. And, if it does, SSI stock could turn into a multi-bagger in the long run. Just look at the sales multiple on SSI. It's below 0.05. Now look at the sales multiples on TJX and ROST. They are each north of 1.8.Insiders clearly believe in the plan. Over the past three months, as the company has converted multiple full-price stores into off-price ones, there have been 10 open market insider purchases, and just one insider sale.Should you buy in too? That depends on your risk appetite. The stock has come very far, very fast, so if the turnaround plan doesn't work as hoped, the stock could fall a lot from here. At the same time, there's also a bunch of upside potential in the event the turnaround does work. It's a typical high-risk, high-reward situation -- and it's tough to say which way the stock will go next. GameStop (GME)Source: Emil O / Shutterstock.com Shares of struggling video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) have been in a secular decline for several years now, as revenues and profits have been wiped out by a shift from physical to digital video games.But, GME stock has essentially doubled since mid-August amid renewed optimism regarding the company's growth prospects in 2020 and 2021. Specifically, at the end of 2020, PlayStation and Xbox are set to unveil new generation video game consoles for the first time since 2013. That is supposed to create huge tailwinds throughout the entire video game industry, and those tailwinds should power meaningfully improved results at GameStop.Ahead of this game-changing catalyst, investors and insiders alike are buying GME stock in bulk. In September 2019, five different insiders executed six different open market purchases of GME stock -- the first open market purchases by insiders since September 2016.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings The big question now is will the big rebound in GME stock continue? I think so. There's a lot of optimism out there regarding the 2020 video game console upgrade cycle, and all this optimism will continue to translate into strong demand for GME stock. Kraft Heinz (KHC)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com A lot has gone wrong for global consumer staples giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) over the past few years, as an obsession with cost-cutting has come at the expense of growth. But, one thing that has gone right over the past few months is that insiders are finally starting to buy the dip in beaten up KHC stock.Over the past twelve months, KHC stock has dropped 40%. For the first nine months of that selloff, insiders refused to buy the dip. There were zero insider purchases during that stretch. But, over the past three months, insiders have fully embraced a &quot;buy-the-dip&quot; mentality. During this stretch, there have been a whopping 22 insider purchases.This insider vote of confidence has sparked life back into KHC stock. Most of the insider buying started in mid-August. Since then, KHC stock is up 13%.Will this newfound strength in KHC stock persist? It could. There's a new management team here, and this new management team is less obsessed with cutting costs than its predecessors. Instead it's more obsessed with organic growth. That's the right mindset to adopt going forward. It should stabilize revenue growth and return the company to positive profit growth.If that happens, then KHC stock -- which presently trades at just 12.6 times forward earnings -- has plenty of room to run higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ULTA, TJX and GME.

2019-11-14,"These certainly are exciting times on Wall Street.Source: Shutterstock The S&P 500 hit another all-time, intra-day high on Tuesday, and it looks like it might be gearing up to do it again either today or sometime later this week.Perhaps the best part about this latest bullish run is how bought-in everyone on Wall Street seems to be.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSometimes the major stock indexes -- like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- can be pushed higher by the strong performance of just a few stocks. That doesn't seem to be the case this time though.This move seems to be powered by a broad bullish consensus building among traders.How do we know?Two of our favorite relative-strength charts are telling us so. XLY/XLP Relative-Strength ChartOne of our favorite indicators to gauge whether we are in an expansion phase or a contraction phase is the comparison of the two consumer-based stock sectors: consumer discretionary and consumer staples.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Consumer discretionary stocks represent companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which tend to do better when consumers have extra money to spend and enough confidence in their economic future to spend it.Consumer staples stocks represent companies like Procter & Gamble (NSYE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which tend to do well even during economic downturns because people tend to continue buying shampoo, Coke and general supplies when the economy stinks.You can see in the chart above which stock sectors tend to outperform during various stages of the business cycle. Consumer discretionary and consumer staples are at opposite ends of the cycle. Sector Rotation During the Business CycleConsumer discretionary stocks typically start to outperform near the bottom of the business cycle. This is when the economy is shifting from its contraction to its expansion phase. Consumer staples stocks typically start to outperform near the top of the business cycle. At the top of the cycle is when the economy is shifting from its expansion phase to its contraction phase.By comparing these two stock sectors, we can see whether Wall Street is preparing for continued expansion or continued contraction.When consumer discretionary stocks are taking the lead, we can be increasingly confident that traders believe both the economy and the stock market are doing well. When consumer staples stocks are taking the lead, we can be increasingly confident that traders believe both the economy and the stock market are doing poorly.You can easily compare the performance of these two sectors by creating a relative-strength chart of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLY) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), where XLY is the first exchange-traded fund in the pairing and XLP is the second (XLY/XLP).When the XLY/XLP relative-strength chart is moving higher, it tells you that XLY is outperforming XLP, and the S&P 500 is likely doing well. Conversely, when the XLY/XLP relative-strength chart is moving lower, it tells you that XLY is underperforming XLP, and the S&P 500 is likely feeling some bearish pressure.The comparison of the XLY/XLP relative-strength chart and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) chart in the figure below shows that the S&P 500 chart typically moves lower with the XLY/XLP chart. XLY/XLP Compared to the S&P 500 (SPX)Source: TradingViewThe S&P 500 doesn't always move in lockstep with the XLY/XLP chart, but seeing the XLY/XLP start to move lower can be a good indication that the S&P 500 might start moving lower.Right now, the XLY/XLP chart is finally starting to form some higher lows (see the green arrow). This tells us that trader sentiment is becoming more bullish.Look for the XLY/XLP chart to start forming higher highs in the next few months to go along with its higher lows. VIX Relative-Strength ChartMost traders tend to focus on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) when they think about measuring trader sentiment. The VIX is a measurement of the anticipated volatility being priced into S&P 500 options for the next 30 days.However, sometimes focusing only on the next 30 days isn't a long enough view. Sometimes it is helpful to expand your horizons out to the next three months, or 90 days. When traders need a longer-term outlook, they can look at the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3M), which is a measurement of the anticipated volatility being priced into S&P 500 options for a three-month time frame.By comparing the value of the VIX to the value of the VIX3M, you can identify periods when trader sentiment has turned extremely bearish and when it has normalized.The value of the VIX3M is usually higher than the value of the VIX. That's because it measures the magnitude of the price movement traders believe the S&P 500 may make for a longer time period. After all, if you give the market three months to make a move, it has a greater chance of making a larger move.Interestingly, there are times when traders will price in a greater chance of a larger move in the short term. Usually, this happens because they are nervous the market is about to drop, and that fear pushes the value of the VIX up higher than the value of the VIX3M. VIX/VIX3M Compared to the S&P 500 (SPX)Source: TradingViewThe easiest way to compare the value of the VIX to the value of the VIX3M is to create a relative-strength chart. Start by dividing the value of the VIX by the value of the VIX3M.Typically, the VIX/VIX3M relative-strength chart will have a value less than 1, because the value of the VIX is usually less than the value of the VIX3M.During periods of high market stress, the VIX/VIX3M relative- strength chart will often have a value greater than 1. That's because traders are pushing the value of the VIX higher than the value of the VIX3M.So, where is the VIX/VIX3M now?According to the figure above, the VIX/VIX3M is at its lowest level since October 2018. As you can see in the comparison of the VIX/VIX3M relative-strength chart and the S&P 500 (SPX) chart, the VIX/VIX3M typically moves higher when the S&P 500 moves lower and vice versa.So, the fact that the VIX/VIX3M is at a 52-week low tells us trader sentiment is extremely bullish. The Bottom LineAt the moment, the only thing that looks like it could potentially derail the bullish market sentiment we are experiencing on Wall Street right now is a collapse of the trade talks between the United States and China.Traders appear quite comfortable with everything else that is happening -- the impeachment proceedings, earnings, interest rates and so on.John Jagerson & Wade Hansen are just two guys with a passion for helping investors gain confidence -- and make bigger profits with options.

2019-11-14,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar heats up again next week. Retail earnings reports take center stage, but next week's earnings also include other companies on the same fiscal calendar (with years ending on or around Jan. 31).For retail in particular, earnings reports look key. Increasingly, there's a &quot;now or never&quot; aspect to the more challenged categories in the industry like department stores and mall retailers. A macroeconomic expansion will reverse at some point. And the holiday season this year is six days shorter, adding a potential headwind.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor that group, it may be forward guidance rather than backward-looking numbers that drive trading. Positive outlooks despite the compressed shopping period would drive buying in a group that still looks like one of the cheapest in the market. Soft guidance, however, could be yet another negative catalyst for many stocks that trade at or near multi-year lows.Several larger retailers -- the ones that can move entire sectors on their own -- report fiscal third-quarter numbers next week as well. Meanwhile, a pair of growth stocks that have gone in different directions could give clues as to trading in a group that's been shaky despite broad market strength.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 This is a week that can shape trading for the rest of the year. With broad markets at all-time highs, next week's earnings could drive further strength or red flags. They could also support what looks like a long-awaited shift from growth to value. On both fronts, these are the seven key earnings reports to watch next week. Home Depot (HD)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 19, before market openIn terms of broad market impact, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has the most important report on the earnings calendar this week. Home Depot's dominance in home improvement makes it a bellwether for construction spending by both consumers and professionals. That in turn means Home Depot earnings can move stocks in and around the housing industry.That impact will be amplified by recent trading in housing and construction stocks. HD stock itself is near an all-time high. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, has gained 50%, and sits barely off its own peak reached briefly in early 2018.On both fronts, there's some cause for caution. Both Home Depot stock and the sector, as measured by the exchange-traded fund, have flattened out in recent sessions. HD stock in particular seems to have a questionable valuation, as investors are treating it more as a defensive play than the cyclical stock it is. The earnings multiples assigned stocks in the rest of the industry have expanded significantly in the last eleven months.To support rising share prices, both Home Depot and the industry need a blowout report, or something close, on Tuesday morning. And given that Home Depot actually cut its guidance after its Q2 report in August, there's an obvious risk that Home Depot's Q3 can lead the group lower. TJX Companies (TJX)Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 19, before market openThere's really just one objective for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) with its Q3 release on Tuesday morning. It's the same objective as it's been for TJX earnings reports for a couple of years now: no surprises.After all, off-price has been surprisingly immune to the challenges facing other brick-and-mortar retailers. Online penetration remains minimal. Same-store sales continue to rise at a steady clip. As a result, after sideways trading in 2016-2017, TJX stock has rallied nicely and returned to its place as one of the market's great long-term investments.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now At the moment, off-price is the one retail category that investors trust almost unconditionally. TJX needs to keep it that way. A similarly strong report from rival Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) on Thursday afternoon would help. Good numbers likely will lead to post-earnings upgrades by Wall Street -- TJX is nearing the average target, and ROST actually is above it -- and keep the rally going. Anything less, however, and the bulletproof nature of off-price may be questioned again. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openLike Home Depot, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has an important third-quarter earnings release next week. Lowe's Q3 doesn't have quite the same potential to move the market given its smaller share relative to Home Depot. And its ongoing turnaround suggests that strength, or weakness, in Lowe's results may have more to do with operational changes within the company than broader trends affecting the industry.That said, it's precisely because of that turnaround that Q3 numbers are important. LOW stock tanked after first-quarter results undercut optimism toward the company's new strategy, and soared after second-quarter numbers resurrected bullish sentiment.From that sense, Q3 is a bit of a rubber match. Another strong result suggests the company is gaining traction. A weak report relative to Home Depot, however, confirms Lowe's second-place status. The LOW stock price is trying for the fourth time to clear $115 and hold its gains. That won't happen without good news on Wednesday morning. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openLike Lowe's, Target (NYSE:TGT) reinvented itself to try and compete with the category leader, in its case Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Those efforts have been a roaring success so far: TGT stock has gained 64% this year thanks in large part to a 20.4% spike after a blowout second-quarter report in August.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 For Q3, Target simply needs to keep the momentum going. With the company's role in the new omni-channel world seemingly secure, and valuation reasonable at 16x forward earnings, there's room for upside if Target simply can avoid a stumble in the third quarter and give a reasonably positive outlook for the key holiday season. But after the big gains, and with investors clearly convinced Target is a legitimate rival to Walmart, anything less could lead to a significant selloff. Pinduoduo (PDD)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openThird-quarter results from Chinese e-commerce play Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) likely will echo across the market next week. Pinduoduo provides increasingly stiff competition to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), who reports tomorrow. A big quarter from Pinduoduo that follows any stumble from JD.com could knock JD shares from their current 52-week high.Trading in PDD stock after Wednesday's report might also highlight investor appetite for high-flying growth names. Even with a recent pullback, PDD has more than doubled since July. We've seen several similar high-quality growth stocks decline on little or no news, with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) the two highest-profile examples. If investors are willing to pay 70x forward earnings for PDD even with China and trade war risks, that might be a sign that broader demand for growth stocks will return.And for PDD itself, this is a big report. Sales increased 228% in the first quarter and 159% in Q2. The Street is looking for growth of 124% in Q3. Obviously, there's not much room for error, particularly given the existing dominance of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com in the market. A big quarter from Pinduoduo establishes PDD stock as the country's preeminent growth play. Anything less, and the 100%-plus gains seen in the last four months can quickly, and sharply, reverse. Macy's (M)Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 21, before market openDepartment stores simply need some good news, and Macy's (NYSE:M) would be the best company to deliver it. It's still the best-known and most widely held stock in the group. And its struggles of late give it the most potential to improve both in terms of its operations and its stock price.After all, M stock in late August touched a nine-year low. The few bulls left often focus on the value of the company's real estate rather than its operations.It might seem like there is some hope for Macy's given a report from one of its peers. Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) gained 14% in early trading Thursday after its third-quarter earnings report beat estimates. But Dillard's same-store sales stayed flat, with profit improvement seemingly attributable more toward corporate belt-tightening than customer (and pricing) strength. The post-earnings spike may have come from a short squeeze rather than sustainable investor optimism.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth For long-term gains, the category probably needs more than that from Macy's and from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), who also reports next week. In this macro environment, department stores need to be able to drive some growth. If they can't do so now, investors rightly will wonder if they ever will. Splunk (SPLK)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 21, after market closeOf all the earnings reports next week, fiscal Q3 results from big-data play Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) might be the most important without seeming like it. As noted relative to PDD, growth stocks have somewhat oddly struggled despite rising broad markets. SPLK stock hasn't been immune: It's pulled back about 16% from late July highs.And as I wrote last month, this is a stock that looks like an interesting test of just what valuation investors are willing to pay. SPLK hardly looks cheap on an absolute basis at nine times revenue and 52x forward earnings. But those multiples are not out of line with those that growth stocks have received in recent years.In other words, with a strong report Splunk stock can rally -- if investors again are willing to pay up for growth. But if those same investors fade an earnings beat, that's another piece of evidence that investor preferences are shifting to value over growth. Right now, sentiment doesn't seem particularly bullish: SPLK traded down 5% on Thursday thanks to a downgrade from smaller firm Cleveland Research.A selloff in SPLK in regular trading Friday might not make headlines. But it could be important. It would bode poorly for growth names, who are increasingly likely victims of tax-loss selling over the last few weeks of 2019. In that sense, the Splunk earnings report isn't going to move markets, but it might provide a valuable clue as to where those markets are going to move for the rest of the year.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

But bond prices declined today on the positive trade news.&quot;Concerns about the chances of the U.S. and China completing a phase-one pact had propelled Treasuries earlier this week, and acted as a headwind to a stock rally that keeps taking American gauges to record highs,&quot; according to Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome decent earnings reports out of the semiconductor space propelled all of the Dow's technology components higher today.

Pfizer FunIn news that didn't get much attention, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) announced the start of a new stroke prevention study known as Guard-af. This stands for &quot;reducing stroke by screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation in elderly individuals.&quot;While the companies took some liberties with that acronym, shares of Pfizer were up 2% today, pacing a mini-healthcare resurgence for the Dow today because each of the index's components from that sector traded higher on Friday. Nike Rewards InvestorsI mentioned a couple of times in recent days that Nike (NYSE:NKE) was dealing with rough public relations and the trade wranglings with China are often a headwind for NKE stock.

Morgan, Piper Jaffray, and Wedbush --each raised their price forecasts on Apple today.J.P. Morgan's Samik Chatterjee increased his target on the stock to $290 from $280, while Wedbush's Daniel Ives went to $325 from $300.

2019-11-15,"One of the surprise hits in the markets this year is Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Not known for delivering much excitement, early investors were nevertheless rewarded with robust returns. Since January's opening price, HD stock has gained nearly 38%. Not only that, the home improvement retailer has provided steady passive income along the way.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Of course, the markets work in cycles. Even the best bullish prospects encounter healthy corrections. Besides, Home Depot stock hasn't always strung together consistently strong annual performances. And with the company's fiscal 2020 third-quarter earnings report scheduled for release on Tuesday, Nov. 19, should investors expect an inflection point?On the surface, it would take a brave soul to bet against HD stock. First, expectations for Q3 are very much in line with reality. Covering analysts hold a consensus target for earnings per share of $2.52. The estimate spectrum ranges from $2.47 to $2.58. In the year-ago quarter, HD forwarded EPS of $2.51, beating consensus of $2.26.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot only that, the company hasn't failed to meet EPS expectations since at least Q1 fiscal 2017. Over the last 3.5 years, the worst performance that it delivered was meeting per-share profitability targets in Q2 fiscal 2017.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 On the revenue front, analysts expect sales of $27.5 billion. Estimates range from $27.3 billion to $27.8 billion. If the retailer hits its mark, this would represent a 4.6% year-over-year lift. Seasonality wise, this is a very reasonable target.Thus, I don't think HD will disappoint on Q3. Unless management says something silly, I believe Home Depot stock has more room for upside. Favorable Timing Will Benefit HD StockA major reason for my confidence in Home Depot stock is timing. The company will report earnings for the three-month period preceding Oct. 31, 2019. Frankly, those months featured positive data for companies involved in the home improvement industry.First, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index has been steadily rising between January of this year till the end of August. To further confirm the rising price of real estate, the average selling price of a home sold in the U.S. increased from $376,700 in Q2 to $380,300 in Q3.Logically, a robust housing market can benefit HD stock because it's a seller's market. Moreover, homeowners have an incentive to renovate their homes to jack up the selling price. Whether it's money from the homeowner directly or from their contractor, Home Depot is collecting a nice payday.Second, the Federal Reserve got into the act of helping out Home Depot stock. Perhaps due to pressure from President Donald Trump, the Fed adopted a dovish monetary policy. And the central bank's financial engineering brought substantive impacts via crazy low interest rates. Since this action correlates with lower mortgage costs, buyers entered the housing market, making it even hotter.In turn, this likely incentivized more renovation projects, driving up sales for HD stock.Third, the labor market has been moving in the right direction this year, despite some blips on the radar. For instance, the number of workers unemployed for a period of 27 weeks or longer dropped to 1.25 million people in October. This is a metric that has more or less held steady since April 2018.While HD stock has recession-resistant qualities, most companies perform better in bull market. Home Depot is no exception. Current Politics Are Favorable for Home Depot StockAlthough Home Depot's Q3 featured many positives, one negative weighed on the broader retail industry: the U.S.-China trade war. According to a CNBC report, tariffs had a 2% (or $2 billion) impact on the company's U.S. sales. Thanks to supply chain adjustments, HD cut the tariff impact down to 1%.But recently, Trump declared his optimism in getting a substantive deal done with China. Of course, Trump can go back on his words, which he's certainly done before. However, with a critical election year coming up, he may at least keep up the charade. Thus, Home Depot's management team has an opportunity to put a positive spin on an otherwise ugly issue.Overall, then, I believe HD stock is well positioned thanks to what should be a positive Q3 report. If you want to go contrarian to the downside, this isn't the name you should consider.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-15,"Would you like to get a head start into the New Year with a healthier portfolio? Look no further than three health and fitness stocks with monthly price charts making the right moves to achieve that goal.It's that time of year where the conversation turns to food, family and football. The upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays are entrenched in all three. The downside is the combination can take a toll on the waistline. And this leads many people to make New Year's resolutions of healthier and more physically active habits.I'd recommend starting early on your path to a better you. And as you jump on the bike, go to the gym or choose a better diet plan, health and fitness companies Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) and WW International (NASDAQ:WW) are there to help you succeed. And as I'll show below, the price charts of PTON, PLNT and WW are looking healthy for buying into big-time profits in the portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Fitness Stocks to Buy : Peloton (PTON)Peloton is the first of our health and fitness stocks to buy. PTON stock has its share of skeptics like InvestorPlace's Dana Blankenhorn. Yet the indoor cycling startup and recent IPO has put together a bullish two-month long cup-shaped base. And in the face of all the public criticism, that's worth paying attention too. Sure, there's no guarantees this is the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Home Depot (NYSE:HD). But the fact is more often than not, great investments make their largest gains for investors early on as publicly traded companies.  * 7 Silver and Gold Stocks to Buy That Offer Contrarian Upside PTON Stock Strategy: Buy PTON stock on a breakout of its cup base. I'd personally like to see a bit of technical digestion take place. Classically, that would look like a handle pattern to complete the cup prior to a breakout. Either way, waiting for a move through $28.08 to go long this health and fitness stock and using a 7%-8% stop-loss looks like a strong investment idea. Planet Fitness (PLNT)Planet Fitness is the next health and fitness stock to buy. A recent well-received earnings beat vaulted shares of the national fitness club chain into the right side of a monthly base. That's a step in the right direction. And there's more too.The pattern was PLNT stock's first significant correction since going public in 2015. The trimming of shareholder value also established a near picture-perfect decline of 32% into the 38% Fibonacci level. With an oversold stochastics crossover in hand, this combination looks great as a platform for new eventual highs in 2020 for Planet Fitness stock.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 PLNT Stock Strategy: I'd recommend buying shares above $72.25. The entry is marginally above the 62% resistance level within the right side of this health and fitness stock's seven month base. I'd suggest a svelte 7.25% stop-loss beneath $67. More happily, peeling off risk on a challenge of PLNT stock's all-time high near $82 looks like a good step toward a longer-term profitable holding. WW International (WW)Formerly known as Weight Watchers, WW International is the last of our health and fitness stocks to buy. The weight management services company, backed by Oprah, is a mover and shaker as the weekly price chart of WW stock reveals. It also shows a platform for shares to jump higher in 2020.After a substantial ten-month corrective move, WW is now in the early stages of a new uptrend. Over the last couple months WW stock has quieted and put together a narrow, but still volatile base that's found support on top of two prior key earnings reactions. I've highlighted those events in yellow. With stochastics inside neutral territory, the opportunity for a breakout and profits for WW investors looks good.WW Stock Strategy: I'd advise buying a breakout in this health and fitness stock if shares can rally through $38.50. This entry is roughly 1% above the pattern high. The strategy also rests on WW stock maintaining technical support.To contain risk I'd suggest a blended 11% stop. This allows sufficient exposure within today's base while not playing this volatile stock too close to the vest. As a reward, if WW shares begin to climb, I'd allow a run toward a challenge of the 38% retracement level and decade mark from $50-$51 for taking initial profits.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-11-19,The company disappoints on revenue and full-year outlook Continue reading...,Home Depot Falls Sharply After Release of 3rd-Quarter Results
2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Home Depot Inc.’s DIY renovation project has hit some snags. But its stumble isn’t necessarily a warning sign about either consumer spending or the housing market.The big-box giant reported Tuesday that comparable sales rose 3.6% from a year earlier in the third quarter. That’s not exactly a weak increase, but it was well below analysts’ expectations. The growth was slow enough that the retailer cut its full-year guidance on this measure, sending shares down more than 5% in morning trading.On a conference call with investors, Home Depot executives didn’t suggest the results reflected any softening in the larger economy. The housing market looked “healthy and stable,” they said, and noted that growth in big-ticket transactions, those over $1,000, was strong — a sign that shoppers are spending with confidence.That sunny portrait of the consumer is similar to what Walmart Inc. described last week when delivering robust third-quarter results. And it is consistent with other readings of consumer sentiment.Instead, Home Depot said it suffered because some elements of its long-term strategic plan are taking longer than expected to benefit the company’s results. In particular, executives said it was proving challenging to upgrade its technology systems to better support their website for home-improvement professionals. The company had already slashed its sales guidance once this year, but that was largely because of factors beyond its control, including tariffs on goods coming to the U.S. from China and lumber price deflation. Today’s guidance cut is noteworthy because it suggests that even Home Depot, a generally well-run chain that has essentially been untouched by the retail apocalypse, is finding the shift to a more digital-centric business to be a bumpy one.These results should hardly leave anyone in a state of alarm about Home Depot’s future. Many mature retailers can only dream of 3.6% comparable sales growth at a time when Amazon.com Inc. is encroaching on their turf. Home Depot saw comparable sales growth in all U.S. geographic divisions and across all product categories except lumber and electrical — indicators of balanced, diversified strength. In addition, Home Depot has been conservative about opening new stores for years now, a prudent decision many of its industry counterparts have not been smart enough to imitate.The downside surprise at Home Depot also puts sharper focus on the quarterly results of Lowe’s Cos., which are scheduled for release Wednesday morning. Under CEO Marvin Ellison, Lowe’s is looking to change the perception that is an also-ran to Home Depot. A strong showing in a quarter when Home Depot disappointed could help Ellison do that.Whatever happens with its chief rival tomorrow, however, Home Depot’s results are a reminder that digital transformations in retail are extremely hard to execute.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

              <p>Leading home improvement chain Home Depot posted disappointing quarterly results. Sales came in weaker than expected and the Dow component once again cut its full-year outlook.</p>

              <p>Housing demand has jumped this year thanks to falling borrowing costs.

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. both posted disappointing results on Tuesday, raising fresh doubts about whether American consumers can keep up robust spending as the crucial holiday season approaches.The two retailers cut their annual forecasts for the second time this year. While the companies blamed shortfalls on specific issues -- including lumber prices at Home Depot and lower demand for women’s apparel at Kohl’s -- the weak results sent jitters across an industry that has been scrutinized for any sign of weakness amid a record streak of economic growth.The concerns were reflected in a broad decline in consumer stocks, with the S&P 500 Retailing Index down as much 1.5%. Home Depot’s stock dropped as much as 5.6%, the biggest decline since February 2018. Rival Lowe’s Cos., which reports earnings Wednesday morning, fell 0.8%. And an S&P 500 department stores index plunged by the most intraday since the start of 2017 following Kohl’s results.Kohl’s, whose stock plunged as much as 19%, is particularly worrisome ahead of the gift-giving season. The company has made investments that it said would draw in more customers -- specifically millennials.“Top-line sales weakness raises concern for the retailers to deliver in the all-important holiday quarter,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Poonam Goyal said in an email. A deep cut to Kohl’s profit forecast calls into question “the effectiveness of management’s initiatives and suggests more may still be needed.”TJX Cos. Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman added to concerns, pointing to the uncertainty about tariffs talks between the U.S. and China. The comments followed an otherwise strong quarter for the operator of the TJ Maxx and Marshalls chains.“We don’t have as much visibility moving forward to whether or not we can keep mitigating as we have,” Herrman said on a conference call with analysts. “For next year, it’s a bit of a wait-and-see when we get closer to that time period.”The outlook for retailers will come into sharper focus as more companies report quarterly earnings this week, with results from Target Corp., Macy’s Inc., Gap Inc., Ross Stores Inc., Nordstrom Inc. and L Brands Inc. -- the owner of Victoria’s Secret.‘Cold Wind’Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said Kohl’s results weren’t all negative, since the company managed positive comparable sales. But apparel weakness and aggressive discounting across the industry illustrate “a challenging backdrop.”“Kohl’s felt the cold wind of this and struggled to generate growth,” Saunders said in an email.Walmart Inc.’s report last week pointed to investors’ nervousness. Although Walmart posted quarterly sales matched estimates and raised its outlook, the shares fell on concerns about persistent weakness at Sam’s Club and the high cost of new initiatives and slow progress in diversifying sales beyond groceries.Consumer spending has been fueling U.S. economic growth at a time when the global economy weakened, prompting concerns over when the record expansion will inevitably come to an end. Evidence that American households are starting to feel stretched is showing up in debt data, as serious delinquencies on credit cards and auto debt have crept up.Over at Home Depot, some online investments didn’t pan out as early as expected, and the benefits will take longer to materialize. The weak performance was all the more surprising since the Atlanta-based company had told investors that the second half of the year would be better. Same-store sales have now trailed projections for three straight quarters, a concerning trend for a retailer that’s been a consistent top performer this decade, according to Brian Yarbrough, an analyst for Edward Jones.“Housing is good, but not great like it was,” said Yarbrough, who downgraded Home Depot’s stock to hold last week. “It’s going to be harder for Home Depot to show those outsized gains.”The company now sees same-store sales growth of 3.5% for the full year, down from 4% previously.(Adds TJX CEO’s comments in sixth pargaraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Matthew Boyle.To contact the reporters on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.net;Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.net;Jordyn Holman in New York at jholman19@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, ;Crayton Harrison at tharrison5@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Cécile DauratFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Weak Home Depot, Kohl’s Results Unnerve the Retail Industry"

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc.’s shares fell as much as 5.6% in New York trading, the biggest decline since February 2018, after the retail giant missed third-quarter sales estimates and trimmed its annual growth outlook for the second time in three months.Some online investments didn’t pan out as early as expected, and the benefits will take longer to materialize, Home Depot said in a statement Tuesday. Same-store sales -- a key measure of a chain’s performance -- gained 3.6% last quarter, compared with the average projection for 4.6% growth, according to Consensus Metrix.The weak performance was all the more surprising since Home Depot had told investors that the second half of the year would be better. Same-store sales have now trailed projections for three straight quarters, a concerning trend for a retailer that’s been a consistent top performer this decade, according to Brian Yarbrough, an analyst for Edward Jones.“Housing is good, but not great like it was,” said Yarbrough, who downgraded Home Depot’s stock to hold last week. “It’s going to be harder for Home Depot to show those outsized gains.”Home Depot gets scrutinized because it can be seen as a harbinger of the American consumer and the real estate market. Still, Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors they interpreted the lighter second-half results to be “more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments” than the sign of a softer macro-economic demand for the home-improvement retailer. The analysts still recommend buying the stock.The shares were down 5.2% to $226.43 as of 9:47 a.m. in New York. Home Depot had advanced 39% this year through Monday’s close, exceeding gains in the S&P 500 Index.Rival Lowe’s Cos., due to report quarterly earnings before markets open on Wednesday, fell 1.4%. One of the big questions entering last quarter was how big of an impact a resurgent Lowe’s would have on results. The smaller competitor had posted higher same-store sales growth than Home Depot in the two previous quarters.Home Depot also cut its outlook for the full year. The company now sees same-store sales growth of 3.5%, down from 4% previously.The results came even as existing home prices in the third quarter rose 5.1% from a year earlier, boosted by a decline in borrowing costs. Home prices are the economic data point that Home Depot’s management cares most about, because when values rise property owners spend more.“The environment has become slower growth and now you have this competitor, in Lowe’s, that’s getting stronger,” said Yarbrough, the Edward Jones analyst.Department-store stocks also dropped Tuesday after Kohl’s Corp. reported quarterly sales that trailed analysts’ projections.To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Cécile Daurat, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Tumbles Most in 21 Months on Weaker Sales Outlook

First, the sheer amount of time it's taking to get a deal done. Phase I of the trade accord was supposed to be settled earlier this month, but now it looks like Dec. 15 is the target date.However, that's far firm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, there are dueling views on the state of the talks themselves. Some market observers view the situation as sanguine, while others see plenty of tensions lingering.&quot;Some people close to the talks describe them as being in a sensitive, make-or-break stage and caution that what President Donald Trump proclaimed as a done deal a month ago, sending U.S. stocks soaring to records, could still easily fall apart,&quot; reports Bloomberg.  * 7 High-Yield ETFs to Buy Now Those competing views and frequent postponements have created an aura of uncertainty. The markets dislike this uncertainty, as reflected by the fact that just nine Dow components were higher in late trading. Some Juice For JNJJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the leader of the Dow today. Shares of JNJ were boosted after Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen initiated coverage of the stock yesterday with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and a $160 price target.&quot;Upwards earnings revisions to JNJ's Pharma business and multiple expansion…driven by diminishing headlines risks from talc and opioids, should move shares higher,&quot; said the analyst.JNJ has been a Dow laggard this year, as it has been hampered by fears of opioid-related litigation costs. But investors may have over-exaggerated those fears. As Chen notes, the company's pipeline offers room for growth. An Interesting Day For OilExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) -- the two largest U.S. oil companies -- were among the Dow Jones winners today, mainly because domestic inventories data showed a smaller than expected increase.That's a credible catalyst, but the strength in shares of Exxon is arguably surprising because Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit rating on the oil giant, citing &quot;cash burn&quot; concerns.&quot;ExxonMobil's negative outlook reflects the company's substantial negative free cash flow and expected reliance on debt to fund its large growth capital spending program,&quot; said the ratings agency. &quot;The company's high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil's substantial dividend payout.&quot;The dividend is one of the primary reasons investors have stuck by Exxon stock and the company may be loathe to cut it. Plenty of OffendersToday's lift of Dow losers, of which there many, featured a predictable cabal of trade-sensitive fare, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), among others.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors Home Depot (NYSE:HD) followed up yesterday's 5.4% tumble with a slide of 2.2% today after rival Lowes (NYSE:LOW) reported decent quarterly results that sent that stock higher by nearly 4%. Looming Black Friday promotions and the rest of the holiday shopping season stand as tests for both home improvement retailers. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWhile trade will continue commanding headlines over the near term, it may take a step back Thursday simply because several marquee economic data points are due. In addition to a broad swath of retailers reporting earnings (no Dow components), the Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index for November will be reported along with October's existing home sales.&quot;Economists are estimating 5.46 million U.S. homes sold in October, according to Dow Jones.

2019-11-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Lowe’s Cos. raised its earnings outlook for the year and said it plans to reorganize in Canada, even as the home-improvement chain reported third-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates. The shares rose to a record high on Wednesday.Excluding some items, profit per share will be between $5.63 to $5.70 for the fiscal year ending in January, the company said Wednesday. That’s above an earlier estimate of as much as $5.65. Same-store sales increased 2.2%, missing projections for 3.2% growth. The company also said it plans to shut 34 underperforming stores in Canada.Key InsightsThe forecast and store-closing plans show that Lowe’s is pushing hard to get back on track. Rival Home Depot Inc. disappointed investors earlier this week. Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison also told analysts on a conference call that the company is “still committed to Canada.”The company said the revamping of its web business will slow online growth in the short term. In this quarter, the company expects same-store sales to grow about 3% and the web business will contribute almost nothing to that.Lowe’s is often compared to Home Depot, and for many years it struggled to keep pace. That had changed this year, with Lowe’s at times posting better sales results.Gains in home prices accelerated in the quarter, boosted by a decline in borrowing costs. That usually means home-improvement spending picks up because more people see their properties as investments.Market ReactionLowe’s shares surged as much as 6.9%, the most in three months, to $121.22 on Wednesday.

For those keeping score at home, that's four straight monthly declines and that certainly isn't the type of data point retailers want to be digesting at this time of year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith stocks gaining in the face of some concerning consumer data, it's safe to say today's gains were largely attributable to trade news.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in December &quot;The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed to fresh records before paring gains,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;China said earlier that Sino-American trade negotiators 'reached consensus' on certain issues in a phone call and agreed to stay in contact on the remaining points.&quot;With gains as tepid as they were for the broader benchmarks, it wasn't surprising to see that, in late trading, half of the Dow components were higher while half were in the red. Let's get into some of the individual performances right now. More DisneyDisney seems to be making all the right moves lately and investors are being rewarded. On Monday, I noted the stock pushed higher thanks to a boffo weekend at the box office for Frozen 2.Today, the catalyst for Disney's ascent to yet another record is similarly easy to identify: a report in the New York Post suggesting the new Disney + streaming service is luring 1 million subscribers per day.That pace isn't tenable over time, but it does underscore the point that Disney + is off to a stellar start and positions Disney to be a streaming winner. Help for Home DepotShares of home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have been under some pressure since the company's recent and disappointing earnings report, but the stock got a lift today on the back of some incremental bullish analyst chatter. Long story short: there are some on Wall Street that don't expect this year's shorter holiday shopping season to be much of a drag on Home Depot stock. UnitedHealth AgainUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has been making some frequent appearances in this space as of late. Although the stock traded lower today, it still offers some value heading into year end and it appears Wall Street agrees with that assessment.Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes boosted her price target on UNH shares to $300 from $270 today, noting the company &quot;is an attractive long-term investment opportunity given the industry backdrop, double-digit EPS growth rate, strong cash flow generation and sound capital deployment strategy.&quot;She expects UNH to earn $16.25 to $16.55 a share in 2020. Big Mac, Big GainsIt has been a while since McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) made an appearance here and the last time it was discussed, it was in the wake of CEO departure controversy that predictably weighed on the stock. There's better news to offer up today.Shares of McDonald's gained almost 1% after one investor speculated the stock has the potential to gain 25% or more over the next 12 to 24 months. McDonald's is down about 11% this quarter, a selloff that at this point looks very overdone. Bottom Line On the Dow Jones TodayFor the all talk about trade, and there has been plenty, it's important to remember that a new year is fast-approaching and that it's a presidential election year. That probably means President Trump will be tweeting and commenting about the Federal Reserve. However, some market observers believe the Fed has helped out Trump this year and investors are winning as a result.  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality &quot;The three Fed rate cuts, the commitment to purchase Treasury bills and the promise to conduct repurchase agreement operations have pushed short-term interest rates lower,&quot; said State Street in a recent note. &quot;At the same time, long-term rates have modestly increased as fears of recession have receded and optimism regarding a potential phase one US-China trade deal has grown. As a result, the yield curve has steepened over the past several weeks. The Fed has successfully and purposefully un-inverted the yield curve through their powerful policy responses. This has further flattered stock prices to new all-time highs, particularly for portions of the market that were previously out of favor, such as cyclicals, value stocks and financials.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-06,"Since becoming General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO in October 2018, Larry Culp has made the company a favorite of turnaround lovers.Source: Sergey Kohl / Shutterstock.com If you picked up some shares one year ago, you're sitting on a gain of 54%. But it's all a matter of timing. If you bought the day Culp joined, you're still down 14%.The glory days of Jeff Immelt, when this was a $30 stock and a dividend aristocrat, are gone forever. Culp has frozen pensions, leading to talk of a general &quot;pension crisis&quot; sweeping the world.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut Culp has also remade his executive team, made hard decisions on what to keep and let new hires make forward-looking statements.From here, everything depends on execution. Hard DecisionsCulp's hardest decision may have been to let General Electric's biopharma unit go to his former employer, Danaher (NYSE:DHR). The cash is desperately needed to firm up the balance sheet, which still had $76 billion of debt on it, against a market capitalization of $94 billion, in September.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Dominated Thanksgiving Shopping As I wrote in July, those numbers understate the case. The company also has $74 billion of &quot;other liabilities&quot; -- pensions and risks from old long-term care policies -- to deal with.The pension freeze helps with the former. The latter is a 25-year old legacy from former CEO Jack Welch, who took on re-insurance for long-term care policies before the cost of nursing care became apparent. Activists want Welch to turn in his retirement payout, as well as Immelt, whom I consider the greatest destroyer of shareholder value the world has ever known. It ain't happening. The New ToneThese moves have created a new tone around the company. Product rollouts are now called victories and buzzwords like &quot;citizen developer&quot; are gaining traction.Some analysts are coming around. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) co-founder Ken Langone says he likes General Electric again, saying Culp &quot;is doing a hell of a job.&quot;But this is only tone. General Electric under Culp remains much as it was under Immelt and his successor, John Flannery, an industrial machine company. GE Power remains a drag on results, although the company now makes more from renewable energy equipment like wind turbines. Healthcare is mostly big machines. Boeing (NYSE:BA) remains a drag on GE Aviation, and GE Capital can no longer soften the blows.For the third quarter, General Electric reported a loss of nearly $6 billion, 69 cents per share, on revenues of $23.4 billion. Culp emphasized that losses from continuing operations were just 8 cents per share. He showed $650 million in industrial free cash flow. He also pointed to a backlog of orders that now totals $386 billion, mostly for jet engines and industrial turbines. Since then the shares are up 9%, against a 2.5% gain for the average S&P 500 stock.Not everyone is convinced. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa, who saw the Immelt disaster coming and may wear the label &quot;GE Bear&quot; to his grave, says General Electric is still missing targets set only in March. He believes numbers look good only because of restructured spending. The Bottom Line on General ElectricGeneral Electric remains an industrial goods company. Industrial goods are not a great business to be in. The company continues to struggle with enormous debt. The amount it will owe on those long-term care policies remains uncertain.I continue to wish Culp well, but from the sidelines. General Electric is, at best, a speculation. If you buy shares today, you're betting it can generate big profits from industrial revenue, and that it can grow. Hope is still not a plan.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-12-06,"Wall Street is in Santa Claus rally mode at the end of the week. But will it be another and more bearish December to remember? One thing is for certain, blue-chip stocks 3M (NYSE:MMM), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are showing technical signs that admired income streams will be trumped by capital gains for bearishly positioned investors.Let me explain.Wall Street is breathing much easier at the end of the trading week. Following a bearish opening act after POTUS took aim at China and the E.U. and a back-and-forth NATO summit provided market volatility but finished empty handed, investors are cheering Friday's jobs data. For its part, the Dow Industrials with its cadre of blue-chips is up roughly 1% and off fractionally for the five-day period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors are also finding strength from a &quot;calmer tone on trade&quot; and perhaps motivated by seasonal bullish tendencies. The fact is it has been a solid 2019 and window dressing those gains could be in full-force this season. Still, there's always the chance the market could see a repeat performance more in keeping with last year's memorably bearish December.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends At the end of the day, historical patterns such as a Santa Claus rally are nice to consider. But as we've seen, those leanings are far from ironclad opportunities. And with uncertainty surrounding Dec. 15 when a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports are set to begin, the chance for other bearish drivers to emerge or maybe reawakened concerns to rear their ugly head, it's a good time to keep some blue-chips on the radar for shorting. Blue-Chip Stocks to Short: 3M (MMM)Source: Charts by TradingView3M is the first of our stocks to short. As of this writing, this blue-chip stock is the Dow Industrial's biggest dog with its year-to-date loss of nearly 14%. Income-oriented investors might see this weakness coupled with a dividend of 3.45% as an opportunity. But I don't buy it. I see MMM's bearish patterns and overhead resistance as keeping shares in a shortable position.MMM Stock Strategy: Short this blue-chip stock if shares can break beneath the low of the November topping candle for a second time. One caveat is to make sure this price action is accompanied by a bearish stochastics crossover. It may mean shorting at a lower price in MMM stock, but it's worth the confirmation given what's been stated.Look to support near $133 - $140 for taking initial profits in 3M shares. Likewise, respect pattern resistance for exiting this blue-chip stock if necessary. ExxonMobil (XOM)  Source: Charts by TradingViewExxonMobil is the next of our stocks to short. This blue-chip stock isn't in the same dog house as MMM, but XOM has been a definite laggard with its flat-line, year-to-date performance. And the price chart is telling me the worst is yet to come.Here, I'm focused on a broadening pattern top to complete in conjunction with a test of the 62% level. And as XOM stock wrestles with a breach of its long-term trendline and a bearish crossover of the weekly stochastics, there are good indications $60 - $62 will come into play.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice XOM Stock Strategy: For this blue-chip stock I'd recommend shorting shares beneath this week's opening price of $68.50. From there, the aforementioned support area is where bearish traders should look to take profits. As important, since this is XOM stock's fourth stab at rejecting technical trendline support, there's not a whole lot of margin for error. I'd allow a bit of wiggle room, but $71 to cut down losses makes sense off and on the price chart. Home Depot (HD)   Source: Charts by TradingViewHome Depot is the last of our blue-chip stocks to short. Technically, all stocks face corrective periods and bearish cycles at one time or another. And right now, HD stock's monthly chart supports the argument that this phase is just beginning.Shares of HD have confirmed November's bearish engulfing candlestick as part of a larger broadening top pattern. The price action also has the backing of a bearish stochastics crossover. And with this blue chip still near the pattern's signal price and support significantly lower near $140 or worse, HD is a stock to short today.HD Stock Strategy: To accompany a short in HD stock, I'd recommend using the pattern top to contain exposure to greater losses if required. This poses stock risk of around 11%. It's slightly more than I'd typically allow in a name like Home Depot. However, given the pattern's prospect's and skewed risk-to-reward in favor of bearish positioning, it makes a strong case for your consideration.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-12-09,"Following a banner day for stocks on the back of strong consumer and employment data last Friday, stocks edged lower Monday as traders renewed their focus on U.S.-China trade negotiations.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 dropped 0.32%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.38%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.40%  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was by far the best-performing name in the Dow Jones today and the only one to gain more than 1%Trade talks between the U.S. and China are on the clock, and that clock is loudly ticking away. New tariffs on Chinese imports are set to go into effect on Dec. 15. There's impetus for both sides to get a deal done, but data suggest China could use a more sanguine relationship with the U.S. sooner than later.&quot;Data showed China's exports fell 1.1% in November, with those to the U.S. tumbling 23%, underscoring why the Asian nation may want to resolve the dispute,&quot; reports Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Now that the market has digested marquee data points in the form of the November jobs report and the early reading on December consumer sentiment, coupled with the fact that there are no earnings reports of consequence to consider, trade is going to dominate near-term headlines.So until credible reports emerge that a deal is going to be signed by the U.S. and China, or at the very least, the Dec. 15 tariffs will be pushed, investors could be treated to more days like today when just 12 of the Dow's 30 components were higher in late trading. Apple Needs Some Tariff HelpWith trade in focus today, it probably wasn't surprising that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the Dow's most trade-sensitive names, was the worst-performing member of the blue-chip index, shedding 1.4%. To be fair to Apple, plenty of U.S. technology companies are levered to the trade talks and could be pinched by the tariffs that could go into effect on Dec. 15.However, shares of Apple performed far worse today than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).It's clear why Apple would like the White House to avert the December tariffs: the company's iPhones, iMacs, iPads and AirPods in China. Those are already pricey products and the company would have to pass higher costs onto shoppers in the event of new tariffs.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives &quot;estimates that a 15% tariff would trim fiscal 2020 profits by about 4%, or around 50 cents a share, if it proceeds as scheduled,&quot; reports Barron's.Hope isn't lost for Apple investors. CEO Tim Cook has one of the best, if not the best relationship with President Trump among major technology executives. Help From Home DepotAs noted earlier, home improvement giant Home Depot was the leader of the Dow pack today as some analysts were waxing bullish on the name ahead of the company's Wednesday analyst day.&quot;As sentiment sours, we're buyers into analyst day,&quot; said Wells Fargo in a note to clients today. &quot;We believe the Analyst Day overhang is peaking, and see opportunities for post-event relief should [fiscal year 2020] commentary prove better than feared.&quot;It's also fair to surmise that Home Depot's Monday move higher represents some follow through on last Friday's consumer sentiment and employment reports, which appeared to be good news for consumer cyclical stocks of which Home Depot is one. Goldman Going Robo?Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lost 1.2%, but there was some news out indicating that the bank could join the expanding ranks of financial services firms that are branching out into the robo advisor business.The new service, assuming it's launched, could focus on clients with just $5,000 in assets and represents Goldman's ongoing effort, one that includes expanding its exchange-traded funds roster, to attract clients beyond the ultra wealthy. Merck MovesAfter closing at its highest levels in nearly two decades last Friday, Dow healthcare name Merck (NYSE:MRK) posted a modest Monday gain on news it's acquiring cancer treatment maker ArQule (NASDAQ:ARQL) for $20 per share in cash. While the deal didn't really move the needle for Merck today -- the stock inevitably ended the day down 0.15% -- Wall Street likes it.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now &quot;Analysts have been quick to comment, with Cantor Fitzgerald calling it smart and strategic and SVB Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang claiming it will be 'unlocking value for investors,'&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere are a couple of central bank meetings that could provide some respite from the trade drama, including the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. However, a rate cut is not likely to emerge from this meeting and last Friday's data confirm as much,The European Central Bank (ECB) meets Thursday and for investors engaged with Eurozone equities or ETFs, that meeting could deliver some positive news on the easy money front.Beyond those meetings and barring surprises, market participants will likely be hanging on trade words this week and hopefully that doesn't mean bellicose rhetoric from President Trump on Twitter.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

More importantly, the commentary from the central bank should be seen as positive and, stocks reacted as such, because the Fed sees the U.S. economy on firm enough ground right now that lower borrowing costs aren't necessary.It may take a while for the lack of an imminent rate cut to sink in as a positive, but it was enough to have 17 of the 30 Dow stocks higher in late trading. First, The Bad NewsAs noted above, Home Depot was the Dow's trouble spot today. The home improvement retailer said it expects sales to increase by 3.5% to 4% next year, below the consensus estimate calling for 4.3% growth.&quot;We are building on our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on a large and fragmented market opportunity,&quot; said CEO Craig Menear in a statement.Home Depot forecast &quot;diluted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3.1 percent from fiscal 2018 to $10.03.&quot; Shares of Home Depot are down more than 7% this month. Even More Bad News…Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second-largest domestic oil company, was the second-worst Dow performer today after Home Depot. The oil giant slipped 1.4% after saying it's writing down $11 billion worth of assets.&quot;We believe the best use of our capital is investing in our most advantaged assets,&quot; said CEO Michael Wirth in a statement. &quot;With capital discipline and a conservative outlook comes the responsibility to make the tough choices necessary to deliver higher cash returns to our shareholders over the long term.&quot;Chevron also said it's planning $20 billion in capital expenditures for 2020 -- the third straight year the company has held spending flat at that level. Finally, Some Good NewsApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the Dow leaders today as another analyst chimed in about the company's leverage to the consumer and the holiday shopping season, including, of course, the iPhone and AirPods.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani &quot;thinks investors should get ready for the tech giant to return to growth again in 2020. He also sees upside to December quarter sales estimates, given signs of a robust holiday season for AirPods Pro and iPhone 11,&quot; reports Barron's. Disney AgainIn talking about Dow stocks and good news, these days it's hard to avoid mentioning Disney (NYSE:DIS).

2019-12-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. shares fell as much as 2.5% Wednesday as the retailer’s sales and operating margin guidance for next year disappointed Wall Street. The forecasts were provided ahead of the its 2019 Investor and Analyst Conference, which began at 9 a.m.Analysts weren’t completely surprised by the guide down, following Home Depot’s weaker-than-expected third-quarter report Nov. 19, which included cuts to its current year comparable sales and net sales forecasts. Sentiment was low in the stock since then, with shares down 9.6% through Tuesday’s close. The slightly lower views will result in earnings-per share reductions for the year ending in January 2021, sell-side analysts said this morning.Here’s more of what analysts had to say following the press release, but ahead of the meeting:Evercore ISI, Greg Melich“HD decided to rip off the band-aid this am,” with its new forecast“The 3.5-4% top-line guide and 14.0% EBIT margin should soften expectations into next year,” the analyst wroteHe predicts a bear case for EPS for the year ending January 2021 will come in around $10.50, with comparable sales growth around 3.5%, while those more bullish on the home improvement outlook can use 4.0% on the comp. line “and stay closer to $11.00”While next year’s outlook is a “touch lighter than we expected,” it does affirm the company’s current trends and investments in a “healthy home improvement market”Rates outperformGordon Haskett, Chuck GromNext year’s forecasts were “a touch below what we think the bull camp was hoping to receive;” believes the forecasts imply EPS of around $10.20-$10.30, which compares to the current estimates of $10.87, as compiled by Bloomberg data“Ultimately, HD has and will continue to invest from a position of strength as it continues to fortify its leadership on the Pro front, but with the multiple not in a forgiving position and numbers coming down, the stock may retreat before moving higher”Rates buy, price target $260Morgan Stanley, Simeon Gutman“We were wrong thinking the stock had been largely de-risked ahead of the Investor & Analyst Conference,” the analyst wrote in a noteHe and buy-side were already expecting a “below-consensus guide,” but he didn’t expect “the magnitude of the miss relative to expectations”The “incremental margin pressure” appears mostly to be caused by shrinkage, as well as a merchandise mix shiftIn addition, the softer-than-expected sales growth results in expense deleverage against a “peak investment year”Gutman cuts his EPS estimate for next year to $10.40 from $10.80Maintains overweight, but reduces his price target to $225 from $235RBC, Scot CiccarelliThe stock is down ~10% from recent highs as investors have adjusted their growth outlooksThe analyst believes industry trends remain “solid, albeit not as robust as they were 18+ months ago”HD has built up “a lot of goodwill with investors for delivering nearly a decade of strong performance,” but this year has been “a bit rockier for the company than what we had become accustomed to,” and today’s margin forecast suggests that next year’s forecasts will also have be lowered, “at least modestly”This could add incremental pressure on the stock in the near-termCiccarelli remains a long-term bull on Home Depot and expects a “fairly upbeat message” at today’s meetingRates outperform and recommends investors buy the stock on today’s pullback; price target $246(Updates stock move to reflect regular session trading.)To contact the reporter on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Falls as Next Year’s Forecast Rips Off ‘Band-Aid’

2019-12-13,"Stocks surged Thursday on the back of movement on Phase I of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, but the party may have been a little too raucous because there was some hangover today as equities barely budged.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 added just 0.01%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.01%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.20%  * For the second time this week and again on light news, American Express (NYSE:AXP) was in the spotlight, leading the Dow on what appears to be a technical breakoutSo here's where we're at with trade: Phase I appears to be a go and the tariffs that the U.S. was set to impose on Chinese imports on Sunday will be averted, explaining why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ascended to a record high today.Explaining why Thursday's ebullience waned today, the White House is leaving in place some of the tariffs it previously levied on Chinese goods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China,&quot; said President Trump on Twitter. &quot;They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product, Energy, and Manufactured Goods, plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder.&quot;In speaking with the press today, Trump mentioned desire on China's part to get to work on Phase II of a trade package, but investors should not expect much action on that front over the near-term.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade With just 13 of the 30 members higher in late trading, the Dow was likely reflecting expectations that Phase I is as good as gets for the time being. Fighting Off DataThe Commerce Depart said today that U.S. retail sales rose 0.2% last month, well below the 0.5% increase economists were expecting, a scenario almost universally blamed on Thanksgiving arriving a week later than usual. Taking some of the sting off that result was the October number being revised up to growth of 0.4%.&quot;The data suggest a slowdown in business investment and weakness in manufacturing is weighing more broadly on Americans' willingness to spend, which could mean a soft holiday-shopping season despite a relatively strong labor market, improved wage gains and record stock prices,&quot; according to Bloomberg.That's a somewhat gloomy take, the accuracy of which is challenged by the fact that on a day in which a weaker-than-expected retail sales number was revealed, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Dow stocks with significant exposure to consumer spending, all traded higher. Speaking of the Consumer…Nike (NYSE:NKE) was another one of the Dow's consumer discretionary names trading modestly higher today. Nike is a name to watch over the next several days because the athletic apparel giant reports fiscal second-quarter results on Dec. 19.Wall Street is expecting year-over-year earnings per share growth of 10.5% on sales growth of 7.5%. Investors appear to be betting on a solid report from Nike because the stock is up more than 9% just this month. Gaming UpdateMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added nearly 1% today after the company revealed plans for the Xbox Series X, the next generation of its popular video game console. As I've recently noted, 2020 is setting up to be a big year on the hardware upgrade front in the video game industry where Microsoft is one of the dominant players.Microsoft &quot;said it will run 4K graphics at 60 frames per second, though the system has the capabilities to hit up to 120 FPS, with support for Variable Refresh Rate and 8K capability,&quot; reports Barron's.Both the Xbox Series X and the rival PlayStation 5 will be available during the 2020 holiday shopping season. Financial FunAs noted above American Express was a Dow leader today, but the same can't be said of fellow Dow financial components JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  * 7 ETFs That Investors Charged Into This Year However, it's worth noting that the broader financial services sector is breaking out to multi-year highs and that the group remains attractively valued. More upside could be in store next year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAlthough Nike reports next week, there's some time between now and the true start of fourth-quarter earnings season, but there are some data points for investors to mull in that regard.&quot;The estimated (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for CY 2019 is 0.3%, which is below the 10-year average (annual) earnings growth rate of 9.1%,&quot; notes FactSet. &quot;If 0.3% is the actual growth rate for the year, it will mark the lowest annual growth rate for the index since CY 2015 (-0.6%). Six sectors are projected to report year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Utilities and Health Care sectors.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But broader indexes rallied on follow through on last week's trade news.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 jumped 0.71%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.36%  * The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.91%  * On the back of some positive analyst chatter, United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) paced the Dow Jones today with a gain of 2.27%Technology and healthcare, the two largest sector weights in the S&P 500, were the leaders today, helping the benchmark U.S. equity gauge gains for the seventh time in the past nine days.

Key Elements Affecting the Dow TodayUpside for UnitedHealthUnitedHealth is a name that has been mentioned plenty of times in this space over the course of 2019. For much of this year, the news hasn't been good, but in recent months, the managed care provider has really perked up and more analysts growing bullish on the name heading into 2020.Fanning the flames of UnitedHealth's rally today, Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction buy list, noting that although 2020 is a presidential election year, healthcare sector valuations are compelling and Medicare For All Risk is declining.Goldman has a &quot;buy&quot; rating on UnitedHealth with a $330 price target, implying upside of nearly 13% from where the stock was trading late Monday.Sticking With HealthcareStaying in the healthcare sector for a moment, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind only UnitedHealth. The blue-chip pharmaceuticals name rallied 2% after the company announced an almost 6% hike to its quarterly dividend, taking the pay to 38 cents a share from 36 cents.Saying Oui to DisneyShares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) advanced again today, cementing the stock's status as one of the Dow's best in 2019. Streaming news was again at play as the shares jumped on news Disney will bring its Disney+ streaming service to France in March. Another catalyst is imminent as the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie debuts later this week.Earnings PrepAs I noted last week, there's one Dow earnings report to watch for this week and it comes courtesy of Nike (NYSE:NKE). The company reports on Thursday, Dec. 19. In advance of that report, there was some bullish options activity in the stock today.&quot;At last check, already over 37,000 calls have changed hands, four times the expected intraday amount and double the average daily volume,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. &quot;Most of this action is occurring at the December 102 call, where new positions are being opened, and looks tied to stock. There are also new positions being opened at the weekly 12/27 99-strike call.&quot;An Upgrade for GoldmanAs noted above with UnitedHealth, stocks often move on upgrades from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), but shares of the investment bank were on the move today after Citigroup upgraded the stock to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; while boosting its price target on the name to $255 from $220.Separately, Goldman said it will curb lending to coal companies and oil drillers operating in the Arctic, becoming the latest big-name company to prioritize climate change.Familiar OffenderJust a few Dow stocks were in the red today, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) was by far the worst offender, shedding 4.1%. There were reports out earlier today that the company is considering production cuts or an outright suspension of the troubled 737 MAX passenger jet.  * 7 of the Worst Retail Stocks That Refuse to Die Boeing is lower by almost 6% this month and with any more headline risk, the stock could give up its 2019 gains (just under 6%) before the end of the year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayBank of America's widely followed survey of global fund managers is due out tomorrow and some are forecasting bullish musings in there. As it is, the bank is forecasting a &quot;melt up&quot; for stocks in the first quarter of 2020.Although central banks may not be able to affect equity markets in 2020 on par with 2019, there are still plenty of endorsements for riskier assets, such as cyclical equities, heading into the new year.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-20,"It's the four walls and roof over our heads which we call home. But when it comes to investing, the universe of related housing stocks is so much more. And right now the price charts of three housing stocks within this broader market are offering bulls and bears opportunities to build profits today.For many in the United States, living the American dream is strongly associated with home ownership. And these days D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) are names at the forefront of this vision. And rightfully so. These three companies are the country's largest builders of residential homes of all types.Still, there are great opportunities within housing stocks if investors think and look outside the box. For one, there are many other types of dwellings many Americans proudly call home. And importantly, there's the companies which make the materials and tools, as well as the suppliers which are integral to guaranteeing your residence is even possible. And right now, three of these alternative housing stocks have constructed price patterns for big-time bullish and bearish profits.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Housing Stocks to Trade: Home Depot (HD)Source: Chart by TradingView The first of our housing stocks to trade is home improvement retailing giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD). No doubt it's been a great run for HD stock and its investors. Still, all stocks do correct. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) current funk or Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) recent bottom are strong evidence in today's market that even the best and biggest companies hit periods of bearish behavior. And Home Depot is no exception.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Technically, shares of HD stock have already confirmed a bearish top within a five-point broadening pattern. Now a small rally has brought this housing stock back near November's topping candle signal price. Coupled with a bearish stochastics crossover, the pattern risk relative to profits is skewed very favorably for a short position in this housing stock.Trading HD Stock: Short HD stock today. A stop-loss above the broadening pattern works out to a manageable 8%. However, if all goes more or less according to plan, a deeper corrective phase could land shares in a very profitable support zone between $125-$152 before finding a bottom.   Sherwin Williams (SHW)Source: Chart by TradingView The second of our housing stocks to trade is paint and coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW). My colleagues at InvestorPlace are uniformly bullish on SHW stock. In fact, it made Will Ashworth's recent list of nine stocks to own for the next decade despite having rocketed by approximately 1,350% since the financial crisis.I'm unsure as to whether SHW stock investors have been smelling paint thinner with those heady gains. Nevertheless, I'll concede technically the case for buying this housing stock looks good.On the weekly chart shares of Sherwin Williams have put together a smallish symmetrical triangle formation. This is typically seen as a continuation pattern. And following a lengthy double corrective period from 2018 into this past summer, gains following the breakout could be just halfway home for bulls.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 Trading SHW Stock: Buy this housing stock on a breakout above pattern resistance near $585. I'd look to start taking profits and reduce exposure near $635-$650. However, another similar size leg could take SHW stock towards $700. To contain risk on the downside I'd keep a tight lid on shares with a stop-loss beneath the triangle's support at $565.   Winnebago (WGO)Source: Chart by TradingView The last of our housing stocks is recreational vehicle or RV giant Winnebago (NYSE:WGO). Remember what I said about alternative dwellings? Well, many folks do aspire to hit and live on the road full-time. And Winnebago is a definite way to go about living this type of American dream.What's more, following an impressive earnings beat, shares of this unconventional housing stock are breaking out in style. I'd call it a large cup-with-handle pattern breakout. Others label today's bullish price action as coming out of a flat base. Either way, WGO stock is a buy today.Trading WGO Stock: Buy WGO stock today and park profits in your trading account by reducing risk at new all-time-highs between $65-$70. To protect against this momentum-driven purchase going south, setting a stop-loss below $47 looks like a smart enough exit off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-12-27,"Friday's gains were modest for the widely followed domestic equity benchmarks, but on the Dow Jones, a slew of familiar names lifted the blue-chip index to another all-time high today.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of FinViz   * The S&P 500 was flat%  * The Dow advanced 0.08%  * The Nasdaq Composite inched lower by 0.17%  * Under the theme of big brands boosting the Dow today, Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the index's leader, gaining 0.77%.Albeit in modest fashion, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were also among the Dow winners today after oil advanced to a three-month high. The Energy Information Administration inventories report oil out earlier today showed oil stockpiles decreased by 5.467 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 20, well above the 3 million barrel decline analysts expected.Keeping with the theme of small gains, in addition to Nike, several of the Dow's other consumer-related names closed slightly higher following yesterday's report that e-commerce sales hit record highs this holiday season.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places In fact, with 24 of the 30 Dow stocks higher in late trading, the only consumer name in the red was Home Depot (NYSE:HD), but it's loss was tiny. Nike on a RollA research firm known as Consumer Edge Group initiated coverage of Nike today with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and $110 price target. That estimate could need some upward revising soon if Nike stock continues its torrid pace, which includes a December gain of more than 8%.The more likely catalyst for Nike shares today was news that the company signed Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic, the 2018-2019 NBA rookie of the year, to a Jordan Brand endorsement deal. Doncic is a likely All-Star this season and a credible MVP candidate, so this deal could have some impact on Nike shares in 2020. Fizzing HigherOn a day when plenty of the Dow's more defensive names strutted their stuff, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) took part in that party, advancing 0.52%. That stock along with fellow Dow consumer staples name Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) were among the index's top performers today and more could be on the way for those low beta names in 2020 due to some long-running advantages for these household names.As Barron's notes, Coca-Cola enjoys low labor costs, an advantage that could be on display next as wages rise. The argument against consumer staples stocks is that after rallying this year although the market largely preferred higher beta sectors, big names like KO and PG are pricey. Speaking Of DefensiveVerizon (NYSE:VZ) fits the bill as a defensive Dow stock, but it's up just 9% this year, nowhere near the pace set by the aforementioned KO and PG. Next year may not bring much more to cheer about when it comes to Verizon, meaning the 4% dividend yield could remain the primary source of allure with this name.&quot;Verizon doesn't expect 5G to meaningfully contribute to revenue growth until 2021. In the meantime, its business remains immensely profitable but isn't growing much,&quot; reports Barron's. Intel InterestThree of this year's best-performing S&P 500 stock are semiconductor stocks. That doesn't include Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Given Intel's heft relative to other chip stocks, it's rare that it will rank among the top performers on an annual basis, but here we are talking about the stock being up an admirable 28% year-to-date and hitting a 52-week high today. That's pretty good work for an old school tech name. Bottom Line on Today's Dow Jones ActionThis is the fifth consecutive week of weekly gains for the S&P 500 so it's fair to say domestics are entering 2020 on a strong note. Other assets getting in on the act, too. As noted earlier, oil advanced to its highest levels in three months, potentially providing some reason to examine energy stocks in the first quarter, while gold notched its best weekly performance since August.If the S&P 500 can cobble together a couple of decent days to start next week, 2019 will go down as the best percentage performance on an annual basis for the benchmark U.S. equity gauge since 1997.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities More From InvestorPlace  * 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid   * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way   * 10 Best ETFs for 2020: The Competition Is Stacked Full of Potential   * 4 Gold Stocks to Buy as the Yellow Metal Surges The post Dow Jones Today: A Rally Boosted by Nike, Coca-Cola and More appeared first on InvestorPlace.","Dow Jones Today: A Rally Boosted by Nike, Coca-Cola and More"

For example, housing starts jumped to a 13-year high last month. Housing starts of 1.6 million in the last month of 2019 topped the 1.375 million units economists were expecting and likely contributed to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) as one of the best Dow performers after Visa.Housing data is vital because that segment accounts for over 3% of domestic economic output. In a separate report, the Job Openings and Labor Market Turnover Survey (JOLTS) said job openings slipped by 561,000 to 6.8 million for the month of November, indicating the economy is getting close to full employment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Value Stocks to Own in 2020 Those are just two data points, but they speak to the notion that the U.S. economy is unlikely to encounter a recession this year. Stocks seem to be reflecting as much. A DowngradeWhile Home Depot, Visa and plenty of others were among the Dow winners today, IBM (NYSE:IBM) wasn't part of the fund. Big Blue only gained 0.23% after Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty downgraded the stock to &quot;equal-weight&quot; from &quot;overweight.&quot; She maintains a $155 price target on the stock.&quot;With signs of deceleration at core IBM, we see long-term revenue growth as less likely without a more meaningful shift in the portfolio,&quot; Huberty said in a note to clients.She added that a Morgan Stanley survey of CIOs indicates spending on IBM products and services could slow and there is &quot;risk to CY20 EPS guidance.&quot;Overall, IBM's Friday decline was modest and it was far from the worst-performing stock in the Dow today. Boeing AgainThat &quot;honor&quot; goes to Boeing (NYSE:BA), a stock that has been making regular appearances in this space to start 2020, often for challenging reasons. Today, Boeing issued a statement saying it's making &quot;necessary changes&quot; to the software in the 737 MAX passenger jet. At issue is monitor connectivity, which tells pilots if systems are operating correctly.&quot;One of the monitors was not being initiated correctly, officials said. The monitor check is prompted by a software command at airplane or system power up, and will set the appropriate indication if maintenance is required, company officials added,&quot; according to Reuters.The software update is needed, but is another delay in the effort to get the 737 MAX back in the skies. Fun FactIn cheerier news, there's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which posted another modest gain. I can remember writing about Apple seven or eight years and using factoids, such as the stock's market value exceeding that of all the stocks in countries like Poland and Vietnam. Well, hat tip to CNBC on this one, Apple is now worth more than the entire Australian equity market and that's saying something because that's a top 15 global economy. More MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) basically flat on the day, but it wasn't for lack of news flow. The company is launching a new campaign this weekend aimed at stealing market share in the workplace app arena from Slack. Microsoft competes with Slack with its &quot;Teams&quot; platform.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week &quot;Microsoft said in November that it had more than 20 million daily active users, a 54% increase from its prior announcement about usage and apparently more than Slack, which said in October it had 12 million daily active users,&quot; according to CNBC.

Of course, investors will want to hear about guidance, at least for the current quarter. That looks like, on a consensus basis, earnings of $2.82 a share on revenue of $62.5 billion. Any indication that numbers will be surpassed will send the stock soaring after-hours.Remember that in the the fiscal fourth quarter, iPhone revenue slipped, but the fiscal fourth quarter includes the launch of the iPhone 11, meaning Apple stock, which has been bid up in significant fashion over the past year, likely needs some good iPhone news over the near-term. Setting the Record StraightNike (NYSE:NKE) was a modest Dow winner today despite conflicting reports about how the company was treating Kobe Bryant merchandise following the NBA legend's untimely death Sunday in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles.Earlier today, reports surfaced that Nike was pulling Bryant-related gear from Nike.com to prevent buyers from turning around and taking apparel, shoes and more and selling it on other online venues for higher prices.The most recent article I found indicates Nike didn't do that with the company saying it has sold out of the Laker legend's jerseys, shoes and more. No Fun for PfizerPfizer (NYSE:PFE) delivered disappointing quarterly results this morning, sending the stock lower by 5.03%, making it one of the worst-performing Dow names today. Yes, the results were disappointing, but an issue for investors may have been executive comments on the conference call indicating that Pfizer will redirect some capital used for buybacks to research and development.That's a symptom of how addicted to buybacks investors have become and a case can be made that the reaction to Pfizer's call to reduce share repurchases is too much. After all, the company is facing a major patent cliff over the next several years and new drugs -- not buybacks -- are the lifeblood of well-run pharmaceuticals firms. Not To Be OutdoneNote above that I said Pfizer was &quot;one of the worst-performing&quot; Dow stocks today. The healthcare company was tussling with industrial conglomerate 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) for bottom honors today.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your Income-Generating Portfolio 3M's problems today weren't so much about its fourth-quarter earnings report, but rather news that the company is laying of 1,500 workers. That and the pesky matter of a grand jury subpoena related to an environmental investigation.&quot;The company received a federal grand jury subpoena last month regarding discharges at an Alabama facility that may not have complied with relevant permits,&quot; reports Bloomberg, citing 3M CEO Mike Roman. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's not a stretch to say that although there are some other important earnings reports to digest before the bell tomorrow, much of Wednesday's market action will be determined by what's happening with the coronavirus in China and what Apple says on today's conference.It may sound simple, but barring unforeseen circumstances, that's probably a fairly accurate 24-hour forecast for equities.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.China’s state-controlled oil explorer PetroChina Co. has directed employees in 20 countries to buy face masks and send them home to help combat the lethal coronavirus.Employees from Rio to Houston to Lagos are rushing to pharmacies and home-improvement stores Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. in search of masks. One employee was able to secure the last lot of masks at a Home Depot in Texas and shipped it back to China by express mail.It might sound strange that one of the world’s biggest oil companies would urge employees to get involved in the effort, rather than assigning the task to its purchasing department. But the request came as no surprise to Chinese nationals. PetroChina’s status as a government-owned entity means all workers are employees of the state and, as such, are expected to play an active role in the process, one person said.The goal is to get 2 million masks shipped back to headquarters. the person said. Petrochina didn’t immediately return email seeking comment.PetroChina, the oil titan with a market value larger than western majors like BP Plc and ConocoPhillips, is just one of many corporations with foreign operations that the Chinese government has deployed to gather medical supplies and send them home.CounterfeitersThe brisk demand for masks is spurring counterfeiters to flood the market with bogus respiratory devices, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. A single N95 mask -- the grade commonly employed by hospital workers and civilians -- usually must be replaced every eight hours, the CDC said.Home Depot has experienced a nationwide increase in demand for masks, including some stores selling out, spokeswoman Sara Gorman said. To avoid a run on the products through bulk purchases, the retail giant has limited the number of masks that each customer can buy to 10, she said.Several Home Depots in the Houston area reported running out of masks by noon every day.Meanwhile, alcohol and ethanol makers including Tsingtao Brewery Co. are shifting to produce disinfectant to help ease a shortage in medical grade alcohol, with an industry association urging others to follow suit.Rising TollMore than 31,000 people have been infected with coronavirus in China as of Thursday, and more than 600 have died. The run on face masks and medical supplies has stretched beyond China’s borders.From airlines that have halted travel to China to Saudi Arabia blocking expatriates that travel to the country from returning home, the growing health crisis has pushed governments and businesses around the world to adopt unprecedented measures to stem the spread of the virus. Nowhere is the problem more acute than in China, with Hubei province still in lockdown as deaths continue to rise.PetroChina sent instructions in the form of a memo to offices globally, including Tokyo, Houston and Singapore, according to a copy of the memo seen by Bloomberg News. Chinese steel companies also have been buying masks and other gear abroad, including from Japan, Germany and Italy, according to the nation’s iron and steel association.(Adds detail on mask procurement beginning in second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Jinshan Hong, Krystal Chia, Tian Ying, Alfred Cang, Jackie Davalos, Matt Townsend and Niu Shuping.To contact the reporters on this story: Lucia Kassai in Houston at lkassai@bloomberg.net;Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, ;David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Expat Chinese Workers Scouring Foreign Pharmacies for Masks

2020-02-14,"For alternative energy outfit Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), 2020 looks increasingly like a plug-and-play situation for its investors. But to avoid the larger risks with this type of investment, buying PLUG stock today goes beyond the price chart and simply seeing things optimistically.Source: Shutterstock No doubt 2019 was a good one for Plug investors. At the nadir of late 2018's near-crippling market correction, shares traded as low as 99 cents. But bears trying to squeeze out that last bit of coin in share price have been punished.The hydrogen fueling specialist continues to make strong strides in its plans of reaching $1 billion in sales over the next couple years. And shares have reacted strongly, rocketing higher the last 14 months by nearly 350% to $4.40. It's not just wishful thinking on the part of management or investors, either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPlug has defied skeptics by landing major deals with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the last couple of years. The company's hydrogen fuel cell or HFC technology enables those retail giant's forklifts to more efficiently power their commercial operations. And the buck, or should I say, the $60 million Walmart plans on sending Plug's way this year or Amazon's $70 million agreement, doesn't stop there.  * 7 Exciting Stocks to Buy for Aggressive Investors The most recent news is Plug has landed another major customer within this growing market as companies continue to look for innovative, less-costly and greener options to being competitive. The whisper is the $50 million deal could be with home improvement chain Home Depot (NYSE:HD). If that's confirmed, could Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) be far behind?Bottom-line, the chase for retailers to remain competitive with the likes of Amazon and Walmart appears to be on its way. What's more, there's also plenty of fuel in the tank for a profitable ride on the price chart. PLUG Stock Monthly Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewIt has been a nice ride to be certain for Plug investors that looked the other way when conditions appeared to be at their worst in December 2018. Technically, though, the stock has only just begun to turn the corner on the price chart. And PLUG stock looks ready to buy today for continued big-time profits.As the monthly chart illustrates, the rally in Plug from sub $1 has just cleared a key area of price resistance. It's bullish, but there's more. Shares are now in an uptrend supported by higher highs and higher lows. Nice, right? Further, with nearly three months of testing this critically important zone before convincingly using it as technical support in February, this still small $1.3 billion stock is well-situated for a larger momentum cycle to take hold. Still, there are risks to consider.Despite the positives supporting PLUG stock, shares are still more of a risk-asset than the large capitalization customers it's serving. Also, our observation of shares being ripe for momentum can be a double-edged sword. I'd also be remiss if I didn't note the price chart already maintains some of those risks tied to Plug's stochastics and Bollinger Bands.I view Plug's prospects favorably. But as a name which also has its share of obvious and potentially larger risks, I'd suggest a collar or married put to go along with a stock purchase. Unlike simply holding shares as a standalone investment, these are two guaranteed spread strategies which can capture big-time profits while avoiding the always real possibility of a lights out situation off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management own positions in Plug Power (PLUG) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2020-02-14,"If you're like many Americans, retirement is arguably the biggest expense you're saving for. To that end, there's a good chance that your biggest pool of assets is your 401k account at work.According to industry group Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2018 there are more than 55 million Americans actively participating in their 401k accounts. Moreover, they have just over $5.7 trillion dollars in those accounts. And it's easy to see why as 401k's do provide plenty of benefits. From tax-deferred savings to employer matching, the accounts can be a real cornerstone to meeting retirement goals.The problem is that many 401k accounts are plagued with lousy mutual funds. Thanks to loose fiduciary standards, many plan providers aren't doing their part to help investors find the best mutual funds for their portfolios. Truth be told, the average 401k plan is a minefield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen) But luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we care about your returns and reaching your retirement goals. To that end, we've combed through the hundreds of portfolio options to bring you the best mutual funds to buy in your 401k.These 10 funds appear in plenty of plans and represent some of the best mutual funds to buy for long-term savings. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX)Expense Ratio: 0.04%, or $4 per $10,000 invested annuallyIt should come as no surprise that an option from Vanguard would be top-dog on a list of the best mutual funds. Investors are waking up to the power of index funds as they tend to outperform active management and feature rock-bottom expenses. And Vanguard is the indexing king.Plenty of 401k plans feature the top-notch Vanguard 500 Index Admiral (MUTF:VFIAX), which tracks the S&P 500. However, the Vanguard Total Stock Mkt Index (MUTF:VTSAX) may be a better choice for your 401k.The reason comes down to simplicity. VTSAX tracks everything. And we do mean everything. The mutual fund follows the CRSP US Total Market Index. This measure looks at the entire U.S. stock market. That includes giants like Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as absolute small fries that you've never heard off. All-in-all, VTSAX holds more than 3,590 different U.S. stocks.That huge breath of holdings means there's no need to hold individual funds covering every corner of the market. It's all here in VTSAX. This makes the option one of the best mutual funds for your core portfolio. After all, the whole point of a 401k is long-term growth. With VTSAX, you can get that all with ease.You also get some decent returns as well. Since its inception in 2000, the fund has managed to return at least 7.2% annually. Part of that comes from the fund's rock-bottom expense. VTSAX costs just 0.04% or $4 per $10,000 invested.With low costs, good returns and one-ticker access, VTSAX is a great core mutual fund for your 401k account. Fidelity Puritan (FPURX)Expense Ratio: 0.53%Thanks to their all-in-one diversification, balanced funds are often seen as one-stop shop for 401k investors. That's because they own both stocks and bonds under one ticker, usually at a 60/40 stock/bond split. The Fidelity Puritan (MUTF:FPURX) is considered a balanced fund. But one big twist makes it one of the best mutual funds to own for the long haul.FPURX isn't static in that 60/40 allocation. Unlike most balanced funds, Puritan's underlying asset allocation can shift as market conditions change. Managers can gauge market sentiment and play with that 60/40 weighting.So, in rising and bull markets, that 60/40 stock/bond split can be as high as 80/20. In declining markets, the reverse is possible. And since the fund's managers aren't tied to an index in either their bond or stock allocations, they can move around in this regard as well.This means they can load up on dirt-cheap values or small-cap stocks as well as tread into high-yield bonds. As a result, FPURX is a very different balanced mutual fund than what most investors are used to and it is more of a total return element for a portfolio. That makes it perfect for a tax-sheltered 401k.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness Speaking of those returns, Puritan has been spot on. Over the last decade, FPURX has managed to beat the average balanced fund in its category by roughly two percentage points annually. That return has been pretty close to the S&P 500 as well. And yet, FPURX has managed to produce less volatility.With low expenses of 0.53%, FPURX is a great all-in-one choice for your 401k. American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX)Expense Ratio: 0.57%&quot;The Bluest of the Blue Chips&quot; would be a prime way to describe American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (MUTF:AWSHX) fund. The reason for that moniker comes down to conservativism and stock picking requirements of its managers.Founded in 1952 specifically for fiduciaries, lead manager Alan N. Berro and his team use a variety of strict eligibility screens covering everything from debt levels, quality of earnings, dividend strength and other fundamental criteria. Only about 1% of all available U.S. companies are good enough to make into AWSHX's holdings.The end result in those strict requirements is a list of those stocks that absolutely dominate their respective fields, have been around since the beginning of time and feature strong sales/profit profiles. They churn out some hefty dividend income, too. Top holdings for the fund include Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).A despite being a gigantic fund -- with more than $120 billion in assets -- AWSHX has been pretty nimble. The focus on strong dividend-paying equities and holding them for the long-haul has resulted in some great returns. Over the last decade, the mutual fund has managed to pull in just over 12% annually. That's not too shabby at all.What's also not too shabby is its expenses. As an active fund, AWSHX's expense ratio of 0.57% is actually lower than some index funds. That makes it one of the best mutual funds to own for 401k investors heading into retirement. Dodge & Cox Stock (DODGX)Expense Ratio: 0.52%While &quot;growth&quot; has been a favorite since the recession, &quot;value&quot; has been the proven winner. And that's why 401k staple Dodge & Cox Stock (MUTF:DODGX) has been one of the best mutual funds to own.The fund has long had a contrarian and value tilt to its stock holdings. The key to DODGX's 8.95% annual return over the last two decades has been its unique strategy for picking stocks.DODGX runs on a committee basis. That is, each of its managers come up with stock ideas and screen for various value and metrics. Those ideas are taken to the fund's underlying committee who hold a vote for inclusion into the fund.Because stocks require an all or nothing vote, only a handful of values make into the portfolio. The fund has nearly $70 billion in assets and it only spreads those onto just 63 different names. Top holdings include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX).  * 10 Best Cloud Growth Stocks Right Now This, plus the fact that that DODGX tends to hold stocks for a long time once they're in the portfolio have made it an outstanding performer over the long haul. That includes besting the S&P 500 for much of the fund's lifetime. However, the shift to growth over value stocks in recent years has put pressures on its performance. But given values history of winning, it shouldn't be long before DODGX is back on top.With low expenses and a 1.79% dividend yield, investors can sit comfortably while they wait. Metropolitan West Total Return Bond (MWTRX)Expense Ratio: 0.67%Interest from bonds and cash holdings are generally taxed at ordinary income rates. So, a 401k or similar retirement plan is a great place to park fixed income mutual funds. The Metropolitan West Total Return Bond (MUTF:MWTRX) could be one of the rock stars of the sector.As its name implies, MWTRX is a so-called &quot;total return&quot; bond fund. That means the team at the fund isn't just buying bonds and clipping coupons. They are actively performing credit analysts to find bonds trading for discounts to their par values and underlying cash flows.At the same time, they're willing to sell overvalued bonds or securities that have seen their discounts shrink from their portfolio for gains. The combination of coupon clipping and price improvements results in the fund's return.This also has the fund not just buying IOUs from Uncle Sam. MWTRX holds a mix of government debt, corporate bonds and asset/mortgage-backed securities.The real win is that MWTRX's team happens to be one of the best at doing this. Fixed income is one of the few areas that active management can actually add real alpha to a portfolio. What makes this one of the best mutual funds to buy is its returns. Over the last decade, MWTRX has managed to outperform the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by more than 1% annually. For boring fixed-income investments, those are some serious extra returns.Moreover, those extra returns make the fund's expenses of 0.67% much easier to justify. T.Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (TRBCX)Expense Ratio: 0.7%Most active managers are pretty terrible. But when they are good, they are really good. Case in point, Larry Puglia and the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (MUTF:TRBCX). Puglia has been guiding TRBCX for twenty-five years and the results have been more than impressive.Since the fund's inception back in 1993, it's managed to produce an 11.01% annual total return. This compares to just a 9.6% return for the S&P 500 over that time. The reason for those extra returns comes down to stock selection.Puglia's combs the large- and mid-cap stock universe for stocks that have plenty of competitive advantages and wide moats. He then screens for those that have faster earnings growth than the broader market as well as high measures of free cash flows. The combination creates a portfolio of stocks primed for long term capital appreciation.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends And speaking of the long haul, Puglia tends to stick with his winners. For example, he's held Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) shares for roughly than 15 years. Add in a relatively concentrated portfolio of holdings -- at just 128 different stocks -- and you have a recipe for one of the best mutual funds to buy.Perhaps the only hit to TRBCX could be its expense ratio of 0.7%. However, given the continued gains and market-beating record of the fund, the higher than average expense ratio is justified. In the end, TRCBX is proof that active management can work. Vanguard PRIMECAP (VPMCX)Expense Ratio: 0.38%As we said, Vanguard is the index king. But you know what? It's a pretty great active fund manager as well. And the Vanguard PRIMECAP (MUTF:VPMCX) is its top dog.VPMCX is closed to new outside investors, but there is a backdoor. The fund is still open to those investors who have it as a 401k. Those investors should jump on the opportunity to own one of the best mutual funds around.Primecap is run by arguably one of the best sets of active managers in history. And while each of the fund's five managers are responsible for their own sleeve of assets, the idea is the same. PRIMECAP focuses on large- and mid-cap stocks that trade at bargain prices. However, these stocks do have plenty of growth behind them and many have specific growth catalysts that could propel them forward. This could mean an announced massive buyback program, segment disruption or even restructuring efforts.With the fund currently holding 139 different stocks, VPMAX's managers aren't afraid to place their bets on just a few key ones. Top holdings include Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Better still is that the team at VPMAX tends to hold stocks for the long haul in order to realize those growth catalysts and value creation.The end result? VPMAX has crushed the S&P 500. Over the one, five and 10-year periods, the fund has managed to beat the S&P 500 by over 1% annually. Constant outperformance is what makes Vanguard PRIMECAP a top choice for your 401k. Vanguard Real Estate Index Admiral (VGSLX)Expense Ratio: 0.12%When it comes to real estate mutual funds in a 401k, there really is only one option. And that's the Vanguard Real Estate Index Admiral (MUTF:VGSLX). Luckily, VGSLX is a great option and investors don't really need to look anywhere else.Thanks to its immense size -- nearly $70 billion in assets -- VGSLX was recently forced to switch indexes to accommodate that heft. It now tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50.But that switch may not be a bad thing after all. VGSLX's new index includes previous ignored real estate segments like data centers and timber REITs as well as real estate management firms like CBRE Group (NASDAQ:CBRE). This provides extra diversification and the ability to tap into some niche real estate sectors. All in all, the new index expands the fund's holdings from about 150 to 185 different real estate stocks.It's hard to gauge returns for VGSLX because the index transition is relatively new. However, over the longer term, the fund has done a great job mirroring its exposure and has produced some hefty average annual returns.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility And there's a reason to believe that VGSLX will keep that streak alive. Once again, as a Vanguard index fund, fees are dirt cheap for the fund. VGSLX only charges 0.12% in expenses. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX)Expense Ratio: 0.62%Retirement plans are required to include some specialty mutual funds and diversifiers in their mix. There's a good chance that includes the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund (MUTF:FLPSX), which is good because FLPSX has long been a great performer for investors.The fund is a bit of an odd bird in that manager Joel Tillinghast is forced to buy, as its name implies, low-priced stocks. The fund's mandate requires managers to only buy stocks that are initially trading for less than $35 per share. While that may seem crazy, it actually is really smart and helps generate some really big returns over the long haul.For starters, that low price requirement causes FLPSX to buy many small- and mid-cap stocks. Secondly, this requirement tends to skew the portfolio towards value names. The combination puts the mutual fund right in the sweet spot of the market. Small-cap value stocks have traditionally been the market's best performers for decades. And the fact that Tillinghast typically holds onto stocks for a long time only enhances this effect for the fund.What it really does is cause FLPSX to produce some top-notch returns. Over the life of the fund, FLPSX has managed to crush the Russell 2000 Index by nearly four percentage points per year. Meanwhile, the fund has managed to see lower drawdowns versus the index during rough patches such as over the last year.In the end, FLPSX is weird and but funky, and it has been a proven winner in many 401k plans. Vanguard Target Date Retirement SeriesTarget date funds get a bad rap from many investment professionals. And it's easy to see why. Many come layered with fees, under-performing active management and too much or too little risk for timelines. But when they are done right, they can be wonderful core or sole positions in a 401k plan. It's not surprising that Vanguard offers the gold standard.Funds like Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (MUTF:VFIFX) and Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 (MUTF:VTTVX) offer a blend of stocks and bonds that get more conservative as investors get closer to the date listed in the fund name. The funds are set up as &quot;through&quot; retirement funds and, as such, do include stock allocations during retirement.Vanguard uses just four underlying broad index funds to create the asset mix: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund and Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor Shares.With those four holdings, investors literally own every stock and bond on the planet. The diversification is amazing and supports long term growth until retirement. Even better is that Vanguard does a roll-up fee scheme in that the 0.15% you pay to hold the target date fund is the total fee for everything.All in all, if your plan offers Vanguard's target-date funds, it could be the only holding you need to have. And that makes them some of the best mutual funds around for retirement savers.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held a position in VFIFX.

2020-02-19,"Read enough financial coverage about the COVID-19 outbreak, and there's plenty, and one of the takeaways is apparent: China's willingness to step up and support the world's second-largest economy. It's a point I've highlighted several times in this space over the past few weeks and one that's relevant today because Beijing is a big reason why stocks in the U.S. rallied.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 jumped 0.47%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%.  * The Nasdaq Composite surged 0.87%.  * Disney (NYSE:DIS), a Dow component that has been dragged lower by COVID-19 headlines, jumped about 1.6% today and was the leader in the blue-chip index.Chinese policymakers know that they could face an economic crisis if the novel coronavirus doesn't abate soon and analysts are already forecasting a massive slowdown in first-quarter GDP growth with estimates ranging anywhere from 1% to 3%, well below the 6% China is hoping for this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere in the U.S., there was some decent data on the real estate front. Earlier today, the Commerce Department said housing starts declined by less than expected last month while permit applications jumped near a 13-year high. Perhaps surprisingly, shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) didn't respond much to that news, as the stock traded slightly lower today.By the end of the trading day, 14 of 30 Dow components were higher. Boeing UpdateThere has been a bit of break from Boeing (NYSE:BA) in this space recently, but the company was back in the spotlight today amid reports that the company found debris in the engines of some 737 Max jets that have been sitting in storage.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy Now for the Future Boeing didn't say how many planes had engine debris. Whether its 2 or 200 isn't the issue. The issue is regulators will view this as a quality control concern, one that could hamper the company's ability to get the 737 Max airborne again by the middle of this year.Boeing is dealing with the issue by providing new checks and guidelines for employees to use when examining jets in storage. Time will tell if this enough to get the 737 Max back in the skies by July. Relief For OilWith oil prices settling at three-week highs, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were among the Dow winners today. Perhaps equally as important is that several exploration and production stocks -- companies that are usually viewed as more volatile and riskier than Chevron and Exxon -- recently boosted dividends.That could allay concerns, particularly those pertaining to Exxon, that the two oil giants may not extend their long-running payout increase streaks this year. Bank BounceThere was some strength in financial names today, led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the latter of which may have gotten a lift on news of some reshuffling in its investment banking division.Recoveries have to start somewhere and this could be that start for the financial services sector, which has seen some of its bigger names crimped by low interest rates to start 2020. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's hard to argue with Wednesday's results, particularly with the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 indexes ascending to new records. Interestingly, the dollar and gold got in on the act, not to records, but with some notable upside.Going forward, an obvious potential headwind is just how destructive the coronavirus has been to the Chinese economy. Global investors may be able to deal with a quarter of slack growth, but Beijing adjusts full-year forecasts too far below 6%, that will likely roil markets.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. rebounded from a string of disappointing results with profit in the fourth quarter that topped analysts’ projections as the U.S. housing market heated up. The shares gained the most in six months.Earnings per share amounted to $2.28 in the period that ended Feb. 2, the company said Tuesday, exceeding the average estimate by 17 cents. The home-improvement retailer also raised its forecast for same-store sales this year -- a key measure of performance -- to as much as 4% after cutting it to 3.5% three months ago.The report brought relief to investors, who sent the stock reeling in November after Home Depot trimmed its outlook. The shortened holiday season and abnormally warm temperatures took a toll on many retailers and some analysts had expressed concern that the company’s investments in speeding up its supply chain and improving e-commerce would hurt earnings in the near term.“Home Depot posted a very solid fourth quarter to end what has been an extraordinarily noisy 2019, especially in light of the challenges that have hampered other retailers,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said he wasn’t surprised that Home Depot topped estimates in the period after it issued a “fairly conservative” outlook last fall.The shares rose as much as 3% to $246.97 in New York Tuesday, the biggest intraday gain since August. The stock had already advanced 9.8% this year through Monday’s closeThe chain’s shares have been recovering as the U.S. housing market strengthened, thanks to lower borrowing costs bringing a flood of buyers. That boosted home prices, which is the metric Home Depot cares most about because when home owners see their property as more of an investment, they increase renovations.Ciccarelli, who rates the shares the equivalent of a buy, said Home Depot will continue to capitalize on the strength in the housing market and its investments in technology and its supply chain.The retailer’s forecast doesn’t include any potential repercussions from the coronavirus outbreak, Ted Decker, executive vice president for merchandising, said on a conference call with analysts. The company is working with vendors and suppliers to mitigate any potential impact, said Mark Holifield, executive vice president of supply chain and product development. Same-store sales last quarter jumped 5.2%, also surpassing projections, according Consensus Metrix. With this quarter’s results, Home Depot hasn’t missed Wall Street’s profit estimates since the first quarter of 2014.(Adds forecast excludes any impact from coronavirus outbreak in penultimate paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin (Bloomberg Global Data).To contact the reporters on this story: Lisa Wolfson in Boston at lwolfson@bloomberg.net;Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sally Bakewell at sbakewell1@bloomberg.net, Lisa Wolfson, Anne CroninFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Rises After Profit Gains on Revved-Up Home Market

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Who would have thought power tools and patio sets would be big holiday-season winners?After big-box retailers such as Walmart Inc.  and even superstar Target Corp. came up short during the 2019 holiday shopping sprint, Home Depot Inc. rebounded with a better-than-expected fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 5.2%, ahead of consensus expectations of a 4.7% gain.The gains indicate the home-improvement chain is back on track after a third-quarter stumble. Then, same store sales were below estimates, and growth was slow enough to prompt the company to cut its full-year guidance on this measure. A strong housing market helped in the latest quarter. Consumers are more likely to renovate when prices are rising; moving to a new home also is a catalyst for spending. Meanwhile, warm weather prompted some projects to be brought forward, although this was offset by fewer winter storms, which typically drive repairs. Lumber deflation also eased. The upbeat results are also a sign that an $11 billion effort it announced in 2017 to modernize the company’s stores, upgrade digital options and enhance offerings for its key trade customers is starting to bear fruit.Home Depot is right to invest. Do-it-yourself stores can be soulless sheds if not updated regularly and managed properly. What’s more, the focus on the trade market is sensible. Many consumers, particularly young people, are shunning DIY in favor of  “do-it-for-me” – hiring a tradesman to carry out a job. But the group needs to ensure the benefits of its spending continue to filter through to its results.And there are risks. The first is from the deadly coronavirus. About 70% of the company’s products are sourced from the U.S.; the rest come from elsewhere, much from China, where supply chains are being affected by the spread of the disease. A large amount of first-quarter merchandise is already in stores, and the company is working with suppliers to ensure a continued flow of stocks.The bigger danger, however, is that the epidemic has a broader effect on global economic growth and consumer confidence. Monday’s stock market plunge will do little to make Americans feel good about their wealth, something that is essential for purchasing expensive items such as new kitchen. Meanwhile, Lowe’s Cos. — which is working on its own renovation project under new chief executive Marvin Ellison —could become a more muscular rival.Investors seem to be shrugging off these concerns right now. The shares rose almost 2 percent on Tuesday morning, and now trade on a forward price earnings ratio of about 23 times, a premium to about 18 times for Lowe’s.Home Depot may have put its rough patch behind it. But at its current valuation, the risks can’t be swept entirely under a graphic print rug.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-03-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Major U.S. equity indexes have come unhinged from each other. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose membership and archaic weighing system caused it to beat practically everything into a bear market, now is trouncing all comers amid its fastest run in nine decades.Up 17.5% since Monday, the Dow is enjoying its biggest two-day gain versus the S&P since 1953. Against the Nasdaq 100, it’s the best showing since 2001.Made up of only 30 blue-chip giants and weighted by share price, rather than market-capitalization, the Dow is getting an outsize boost from companies previously pressured by the coronavirus -- Boeing Inc. in particular.“The companies that make up the Dow tend to be slow growers. When the Dow was on the decline, they were hit the fastest,” said David Yepez, portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors. “So now we’re seeing them catching up on the upside.”Boeing shares have soared as much as 65% over the past two sessions amid the prospect of imminent congressional aid for the beleaguered plane manufacturer. The jet-maker makes up more than 5% of the Dow, compared to less than 0.5% of the S&P 500. The company isn’t even included in the Nasdaq 100.So far this week, the surge in Boeing shares has accounted for a fifth of the Dow’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg show. UnitedHealth Group Inc. and The Home Depot Inc.’s performances have each driven another 10% of the Dow’s gain.United Health and Home Depot are the second and third largest weightings in the price-weighted Dow, respectively. Neither appear in the Nasdaq 100.The divergence also reflects the role of tech stocks as a haven during the rout -- the Dow fell faster and now is rising faster. Thanks in part to internet giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc., whose shares are higher this year and aren’t in the Dow, the blue-chip gauge is trailing the S&P 500 by 2 percentage points year-to-date and the Nasdaq by 12 percentage points. Versus the tech-heavy gauge, the Dow is still on track for its worst quarter in eight years.It’s common for beaten-down stocks -- like Boeing, in this case -- to start to outperform in the nascent stages of a market rebound from a major shock, according to Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC. His anecdotal experience is that the return of foreign inflows into American equities typically has started with the economic bellwethers that make up the Dow.“From major, major volatility bottoms (and we think this is a bottoming process not THE bottom), the laggards tend to outperform,” Emanuel said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Dow’s Surge Opens Up Widest Divergence in Benchmarks Since 1953

2020-04-01,"Just before the market correction driven by the coronavirus pandemic, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) was trading at a high of $126.73. LOW stock subsequently plunged and briefly traded around $60.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com A strong relief rally has followed; driven by the $2 trillion stimulus package that has taken the stock higher. However, I believe that it's too early to assume a market bottom and further correction will be an opportunity to accumulate the stock. This column will discuss the factors that make Lowe's Companies worth considering.It's likely that the unemployment rate in the U.S. will increase to 13% by May 2020. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicts an unemployment rate of 30% by the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Therefore, as the lockdown impacts businesses, the real impact will be felt in the coming quarters. This will keep the markets jittery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, there are optimistic views as well. Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate, is predicting a quicker coronavirus recovery. Michael Levitt has correctly predicted the end of the outbreak in China and this adds credibility to his views.  * 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch Another optimistic view comes from a research by Harvard Business Review. Research shows that, &quot;V-shapes monopolize the empirical landscape of prior shocks from an economic recovery perspective.&quot;The overall objective of this discussion is to underscore the following point: There is economic pain ahead and LOW stock can trend lower again. However, renewed growth is likely to be strong and there is no reason to panic. Instead, accumulating quality stocks should be the objective and Lowe's Companies is worth considering. Lowe's Companies Business ImpactLast week, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison opined that &quot;As customers are sheltering in place, they're looking at that deferred list of home projects.&quot; Further, the company is still hiring for the spring season.This might indicate that there is limited initial impact of the coronavirus driven crisis on the company's revenue. This is a key positive and the management has not withdrawn or revised its earnings forecast.However, Marvin Ellison also pointed to the fact that the company is making special payments to full-time and part-time employees. Even if I assume that revenue is not impacted in an optimistic scenario, the company's margin is likely to be hit.Further, it remains to be seen if the demand from consumers remains at the same level in the coming quarters. If the unemployment rate indeed surges close to 30%, consumer spending will be impacted.It's worth noting that Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) has guided for Q2 2020 revenue above consensus. The reason is demand for edible gardening, professional growing and pest control.Therefore, there are indications of resilient demand. This can translate into LOW stock outperforming the index. Valuation Perspective and Risk FactorFor FY2020, Low's Companies is expecting earnings per share of $6.45 at the low-end of the guidance range. Considering the current stock price of $86.98, LOW stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5.The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is trading at a P/E of 18.6 and Scotts Miracle-Gro is trading at a P/E of 19.6. Therefore, from a valuation perspective, the stock is not expensive. My only concern is renewed broad market correction, which can take the stock lower in the near-term. Gradual accumulation on correction is possibly the best strategy as uncertainty on the extent of slowdown sustains.stOne of the risk factors is that Lowe's Companies and Home Depot have 30% of products sourced from China. The impact of supply chain disruption will be evident in the coming months. Another risk factor is margin compression that I already discussed. It can impact the diluted EPS even if revenue guidance is on-track. My Concluding Views on LOW StockSome analysts are talking about the recent stimulus-driven More From InvestorPlace  * 25 Stocks You Should Sell Immediately   * 1 Under-the-Radar 5G Stock to Buy Now   * This Stock Picker's Latest Video Just Went Viral   * The 1 Stock All Retirees Must Own rally as a &quot;dead cat bounce.&quot; This can be potentially true and renewed broad market correction will give investors a chance to buy quality stocks at mouth-watering valuations.LOW stock is worth keeping in the investment radar with the company having a decent balance sheet and a robust free cash flow.Once the coronavirus driven economic crisis is over, the stock can deliver robust returns in addition to attractive dividends.Faisal Humayun is a senior research analyst with 12 years of industry experience in the field of credit research, equity research and financial modeling.

2020-04-15,"One of the big themes emerging due to the novel coronavirus outbreak is the effect of the virus on economic data and how equity markets are reacting to that news. As Wednesday's market action suggests, poor economic data is likely to be met with ugly stock market response.  * The S&P 500 dipped 2.20%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.86%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.44%  * With economic data taking center stage, it wasn't surprising that cyclical names endured harsh punishment today as Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) was the blue-chip index's biggest loser, sliding 8.92%.It's no mystery as to why Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) were among the worst Dow offenders today. Earlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department said March retail sales fell 8.7%, the worst decline since 1992. Even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) wasn't spared by the retail carnage, posting a modest loss. The report deals an unsurprising but still severe blow to the thesis that consumer demand could prop up the U.S. economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurther pressuring Home Depot was an early look at April homebuilder sentiment, which looks extremely dour. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index resides at its lowest levels in eight years.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Heats Up The New York Fed's general business conditions index plunged a staggering 56.7 points to a negative (yes negative) reading of -78.2. As a result, each one of the Dow's industrial components with the exception of Boeing (NYSE:BA) traded lower today.In late trading, 25 of 30 Dow stocks were in the red. Healthy EarningsUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was one of the Dow's lone bright spots today, trading higher after the managed care provider reported first-quarter earnings of $3.72, topping the consensus estimate of $3.65 a share. The company confirmed 2020 earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $16.25 and $16.55. Looks Like Good News Is ComingProcter and Gamble (NYSE:PG) was another Dow winner a day after the company said it's boosting its quarterly dividend by 6%. The company has one of the longest payout increase streaks in the U.S., but this increase was bigger than expected. Additionally, P&G said it will report earnings this Friday, moving its release date up from April 21.It's just speculation, but it wouldn't be surprising if this report is good and/or contains positive guidance. After all, if bad news was coming, P&G probably wouldn't be in a hurry to reveal it. Giddy for GoldmanGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was another Dow winner today despite reporting a 46% drop in first-quarter earnings. Goldman said it earned $3.11 a share, well below the $3.35 per share analysts expected. Revenue checked in at $8.74 billion, topping the $7.92 billion estimate.Investors appeared to look over the glum broad results, opting to focus on robust bond trading revenue. The bank said it allocated $937 million for sour loans in the January through March period. Cheaper Isn't Always BetterIt can be argued that with many things, cheaper probably isn't ever better and that may explain the market's lack of enthusiasm today for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company said today it's rolling out a new iPhone SE that costs just $399, its cheapest model launch in two years.The new SE launch has some pros and cons. The primary drawback is that it won't feature 5G capabilities at a time when the world is transitioning to that wireless system. Conversely, some buyers like smaller phones, of which the SE is one, and it could serve as a springboard to entice users to eventually purchase pricier Apple products. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIf today's economic data wasn't bad enough, there's a strong chance it will get worse tomorrow with another look at weekly jobless claims. The consensus estimate for initial jobless claims last week is 5.46 million.If that number is accurate or is exceeded, that means when combined with the previous three weeks of unemployment claims, all of the jobs gained in the U.S. since the end of the 2008 global financial crisis will be wiped out.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-17,"We are truly in uncharted waters. We're seeing economic numbers the likes of which last happened in the 1930's. The unemployment rate seems to be heading to 20% or higher, and U.S. GDP growth could hit some staggering figure like -20% or -25% in coming quarters. The shock is going to have a huge impact on the properties, and in particular, real estate stocks. Houses, offices, shopping malls and more -- investors are suddenly questioning what everything is worth.To understand the impact on the real estate market in general, we reached out to James P. Gaines, chief economist, Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. He told InvestorPlace that:&quot;First, nobody knows at this point exactly how the pandemic is going to affect the real estate markets, but there is little doubt that it will have significant impacts. These impacts will first be the immediate short-run effects of much slower to near stoppage of new transactions -- residential and nonresidential -- while the economy is shut down and people are sequestered.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy For Portfolio Strength In Uncertain Times So which real estate stocks in particular might be hit significantly by the novel coronavirus' longer-term impact? Here are seven that stand out:  * Lennar (NYSE:LEN)  * Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH)  * Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG)  * First American Financial (NYSE:FAF)  * Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG)  * Realogy (NYSE:RLGY)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)Let's take a deeper look into why each of these companies face big challenges from the resulting economic slowdown. Real Estate Stocks to Watch: Lennar (LEN)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com How will a near stoppage of real estate transactions end up affecting the market? The first area of concern is the housing market.Housing was the catalyst for the 2008 financial crisis, and investors are wondering if a similar fiasco could happen this time around as well. While the housing market and banking system seem healthier now than they were then, questions remain. Mr. Gaines told us that he expects to see:&quot;Home sales fall tremendously once we work thru the backlog of signed contracts awaiting closing.  This may take a month or so and the market is working on doing remote, online closings without having to actually attend a closing in person.  Adding to the problem, of course, are the problems of appraisal and inspections that historically require a physical inspection. A very positive policy move was the prohibition on foreclosures and evictions for failing to make mortgage or rent payments. It remains to be seen how we will work through the financing chain from household payments to securitized mortgage bond defaults.&quot;Homebuilders like Lennar are obviously in the line of fire if these delays with contracts, inspections and closings drag on. Homebuilders tend to have a fair chunk of leverage. And their business relies on selling high-ticket items. As a result, an economic slowdown can wreck havoc on their cash flow if transactions dry up.Lennar looks cheap though, trading at just 9x earnings. And home purchases had been booming right up until the quarantines started. The Federal Reserve's massive rate cutting campaign has generated dirt-cheap mortgage rates, and has given folks more buying power. At this point, it's not clear if consumers will feel comfortable buying given the economic stress. If they do, however, LEN stock could come roaring back. Invitation Homes (INVH)Source: Shutterstock It isn't just homebuilders that are nervous about the economic slowdown. There are publicly traded real estate investment trusts that solely focus on owning and renting out homes, and traders have sold those as well.To give one example of a company in this space, look at Invitation Homes. It has more than 80,000 units around the country, with most of those being single-family houses. It primarily owns houses in strong economies with growing demographics. Its biggest markets include California, Florida and the fast-growing Atlanta metro market, among others.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Invitation completed its initial public offering in 2017. It's still a relatively new company, and as such, it has been in aggressive growth mode. Until the market crash, INVH stock had traded sharply higher. Now, however, it's back near its IPO price. While the dividend yield is a modest 2.5% for the time being, the REIT is priced to give a strong capital gain if and when the housing market picks back up again. Simon Property Group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Remember, housing is far from the only part of the real estate market that will face a massive impact from the coronavirus' economic shock. Mr. Gaines explained the potential impact on commercial real estate:&quot;Forbearance is the operative word in the commercial sectors. Landlords will have to be patient with tenants' ability to pay their rent. But really, they won't have much choice as there won't be any other tenants available to replace them.&quot;Simon Property Group is the nation's largest mall REIT, and one of the highest-quality ones as well. The Simon family wisely spun-off its weaker malls into Washington Prime Group (NYSE:WPG) years ago. Washington Prime has lost nearly all its value; however, Simon held onto the best malls and until March 2020, it appeared to be in decent shape. Despite the retail apocalypse, Simon had enjoyed rising rents and sales at its top-tier properties.But all that is in danger now. Simon's stock has plummeted from $150 to as little as $40 during this bear market. While Simon has a fantastic balance sheet, investors are rightly concerned that the virus will cripple the company's cash flows going forward. That's particularly true as even high-end tenants with seemingly robust finances like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) have decided to withhold part or all of their rent payments going forward. With rent in doubt, it's not certain how Simon will react. One thing's for sure: Dividend investors shouldn't rely on Simon's 13% yield for sleep-well-at-night income right now. First American Financial (FAF)Source: Shutterstock Turning back to the housing market, there's a lot more in play than just housing REITs and homebuilders. You have a bunch of other companies that are tied to the housing ecosystem. For example, take First American Financial, which is one of the nation's largest title insurers. Title insurance is a service that banks require in order to provide a mortgage. The title insurer is response for guaranteeing that a property's deed is in good standing. In the event of a problem with the mortgage, the title insurer may end up liable for damages if legal issues arise.What do title insurers get in return for providing this necessary, if mundane, service? Fat fees, generally. Title insurers tend to earn a premium in proportion to the dollar amount of a real estate transaction. Thus, they have double leverage to the housing market. A booming market causes more transactions, and also increases the dollar amount per transaction, resulting in bigger fees. Needless to say, the downside is painful as both those levers run in reverse.That said, the major title insurers did fairly well even in 2009, and this crisis shouldn't be as bad for the industry as that one. For one, there was no major housing bubble this time around. There also doesn't appear to have been much fraudulent mortgage underwriting in recent years, unlike 2008, which should reduce realized insurance losses for companies like First American.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip While FAF stock dropped as much as 50% in the crash, shares should rebound quickly. Shares trade for just 8x normal-year earnings at this point and yield 4%. Demand for the product isn't going anywhere -- remember, title insurance is mandatory for new mortgages. Also, the Fed's interest rate cuts should drive more refinancing; a refinanced mortgage produces a fresh title fee for First American as well. Zillow (Z) (ZG)Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com Zillow is another fascinating housing stock to watch during this crisis. You probably know the company for its popular real estate website. On Zillow, you can track housing prices, get estimates for properties, see what's on the market and much more.However, more recently, Zillow made a huge switch to its business model. In addition to its traditional housing information portal, the company decided to get into the house-flipping game on its own. In theory, the company would have advantages in buying and selling houses thanks to its wealth of market information. It seemed like a dream job for big data analytics.Alas, it hasn't panned out -- at all -- so far. For full-year 2019, the company's traditional businesses made a net profit of $7 million. Not great, but it was in the green at least. The home-flipping segment, however, lost more than $300 million, causing Zillow overall to take a big loss. The company projected better days ahead for 2020, but analysts were skeptical toward ZG stock as 2019 was a good year for the housing market, but Zillow still lost tons of money.For now, Zillow is suspending much of its real estate buying and selling program to conserve capital. It's also slashing other expenses to try to ride out the economic slowdown. However, investors aren't convinced. ZG stock lost as much as 70% of its value recently before bouncing moderately. If the housing market takes a leg lower, Zillow could face real trouble. Realogy Holdings (RLGY)Source: Shutterstock For another angle on the real estate market, take a look at Realogy Holdings. This company is one of the biggest real estate services companies in the U.S. It has a unique approach, as it has acquired a bunch of leading brands spanning things such as real estate agents, content providers, insurance services and more.Notable brands include Coldwell Banker, Better Homes And Gardens Real Estate and Century 21.Unfortunately, given the abrupt plunge in economic activity, Realogy has found itself in a bind. With few buyers willing to act during the stay-at-home period, transaction fees are few and far between. As a result, Realogy has had to slash costs; the CEO accepted a 90% pay cut, for example. The company also tapped a $400 million line of credit. Still, with RLGY stock down from $12 to $3.60, investors are clearly skeptical that Realogy will make it through okay.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy If you are bullish on housing coming back more quickly than expected, RLGY could be a stock to pick up at rock bottom prices. Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Finally, when you're watching real estate, you should have an eye on Home Depot. As a hardware store, it may not be quite the first thing that comes to mind when you think of real estate stocks. However, Home Depot is closely tied to the home building and home repair industries. As a result, Home Depot is often the No. 1 or No. 2 largest holding within homebuilder industry exchange-traded funds.Some analysts are already warning about HD stock given its housing exposure. On Wednesday, for example, Wedbush's Seth Basham warned that HD stock is expensive and more levered to the cyclical sales than rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Basham left Home Depot at just a neutral rating, saying that the stock is still expensive, even after its recent decline. With Home Deport at 20x earnings heading into a real estate market downturn, that's a reasonable call to stay on the sidelines for now.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-04-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Google will make product listings on its Shopping service free, part of a broader push to expand in e-commerce and mount a bigger challenge to Amazon.com Inc. as the Covid-19 pandemic drives more consumers online.The Alphabet Inc. unit will let merchants post their wares on Google Shopping for free regardless of whether they pay for Google ads. Before, these listings were all sponsored, meaning merchants paid Google every time someone clicked through to their website from a Google product listing.The move may reduce advertising revenue initially, but it could also entice more merchants to use Google Shopping in the long term. The company turned the service into a paid product in 2012 and it grew into a huge business, generating billions of dollars in highly profitable revenue each quarter.Google is returning to its original free approach for shopping, with some important caveats. The company will still sell Shopping ads, which will give merchants the option to appear in paid slots above the free listings. Product ads will also continue to appear on the main Google search results page, while the free listings will only show up in the less-popular Shopping search tab.“For retailers, this change means free exposure to millions of people who come to Google every day for their shopping needs,” Google said in a blog post on Tuesday. “For shoppers, it means more products from more stores, discoverable through the Google Shopping tab. For advertisers, this means paid campaigns can now be augmented with free listings.”Google has long wavered on its approach to commerce. The company is first and foremost an advertising platform, designed to make money whenever consumers search for things to buy online. But in recent years, consumers have increasingly gone directly to Amazon to begin their hunt, and the online retailer has built an ad business to take advantage of this traffic. Now, Google is trying to reaffirm its position as the go-to place for people to look for things to buy online.“Digital commerce has huge opportunity and it shouldn’t be the case that only a handful get to participate in that,” Bill Ready, head of Google Commerce, said in an interview. Ready, the former chief operating officer of PayPal Holdings Inc., joined Google in January.Ready wants Google Shopping to be a place where consumers can find products from anywhere, whether they’re sold by large or small merchants. A search for hammers could return listings from Home Depot Inc. or a neighborhood hardware store.The Covid-19 pandemic makes good product search even more necessary, as the best-known retailers run out of stock while smaller sellers struggle to stay afloat, Ready said.To get more merchants listing their products on Google Shopping, the company is partnering with Ready’s old company, PayPal. Merchants who already use PayPal to process payments can integrate directly with Google Shopping.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Makes Listing Products on Its Shopping Service Free

The Dow (DJIA) is trading 301 points, or 1.3%, higher, as shares of Home Depot (HD) and Apple Inc.","Dow's 300-point rally led by gains for shares of Home Depot, Apple Inc."
2020-04-24,"It was a strong end to the week, though the S&P 500 was still on track for a weekly loss, as oil rallied again and tech stocks drove the major equity averages higher on Friday.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 added 1.39%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.09%  * The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.65%  * On light news flow, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was the Dow leader today, surging 5.17%.Another $484 billion stimulus package was approved earlier today, though that was a widely known event. Still, the cash for businesses is much needed, as highlighted by another round of grim economic data. Earlier today, it was revealed that orders for durable goods plunged 14.1% in March, the second-worst decline on record for that metric.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBroadly speaking, Friday was somewhat uneventful, a scenario investors weary of market whiplash will take. It was another one of those days where the novel coronavirus and earnings dominated the headlines. A mostly docile day got the Dow to 19 winners against 11 losers in late trading. Earnings RoundupBetween Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, three Dow components reported earnings. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was arguably the marquee member of that trio, with the semiconductor giant saying it earned $1.45 a share on revenue of $19.8 billion in the first quarter, easily beating consensus estimates of earnings per share (EPS) of $1.28 and revenue of $18.7 billion.  * 30 Consumer Stocks to Buy Once the Coronavirus Pandemic Passes The problem wasn't the quarter. Rather, it was Intel issuing downbeat second-quarter guidance of EPS of $1.10 on revenue of $18.5 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.19 on revenue of $17.97 billion. This is proof positive that Covid-19 is going to pressure second- and probably third-quarter results for a slew of companies.On that note, American Express (NYSE:AXP) traded slightly higher. The company's first-quarter results were decent due to strength in January and early February, but as was widely expected, as the coronavirus took hold of the global travel and leisure industry, American Express was crimped in the back half of February and all of last month.Again, that's a theme investors will have to deal with this coming quarter, likely into the third. Adding to the talk of a weakening economy, AXP boosted its reserves for bad loans by $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion, and that's saying something given the company's generally affluent clientele.Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the other Dow member delivering first-quarter results before the bell today,  and there wasn't much in the way of positive or negative surprises here, explaining why the stock closed lower in modest fashion today. Dividend TalkAnother negative effect of the coronavirus on markets is that an array of S&P 500  companies are cutting or suspending dividends this year. Dow component Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) could join that group next week, according to Bloomberg data.Fortunately, it's not all bad news on the dividend front as the same data set indicates dividend hikes could be coming from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as soon as next week. Boeing Bashed…AgainBoeing (NYSE:BA), the dominant name in bad news accumulation, was at it again Friday as the stock was the worst-performing name in the Dow.Today, it was not one, but two news items weighing on the downtrodden aerospace names. In no particular order, the company is expected to slash production of its 787 Dreamliner and announce massive layoffs when it delivers first-quarter earnings next week.Adding to Boeing's woes is increasing speculation that the company could have difficulty finalizing its acquisition of Brazil's Embraer. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOne green shoot to report today: a recent survey by the University of Michigan, the school behind the all-important consumer sentiment report, indicates that a majority of American consumers believe the coronavirus isn't a permanent situation (it's not) and while the survey indicates gloominess about the near-term state of affairs, it also shows consumers see a rebound coming when the virus abates.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-05-01,"As our country wrestles with the economic damage caused by the novel coronavirus in the first quarter, many investors are understandably charting their longer-term strategies. But according to Hiroyuki Ito, professor of Economics in Portland State's College of Urban and Public Affairs, the second quarter's trajectory depends on &quot;how much the world succeeds in curbing the spread of the virus.&quot; Given the uncertainties, bullish contrarians may want to go with a tried-and-true approach: purchasing high-quality Dow Jones stocks.Major blue chips have always enjoyed relevance regardless of the market cycle. Known for their stability and technical predictability, Dow Jones stocks can help mitigate any unexpected downfalls as you gear your portfolio for higher growth during bull markets. But in a downturn, these steady names are even more valuable.Typically, blue chips pay dividends, which allow you to accrue passive income while you wait out a storm. Additionally, Dow Jones stocks are levered to critical businesses. Therefore, they are likely to keep the red ink manageable as opposed to speculative growth companies, which can quickly raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels. You may even see an uptick in momentum, depending on the circumstances.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Further, the corporations that make up the Dow 30 usually dominate their industries. Thus, any consolidation effect that could occur during a bearish phase could end up benefiting Dow Jones stocks. Specifically, I'm targeting these ten names:  * 3M (NYSE:MMM)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * IBM (NYSE:IBM)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * Disney (NYSE:DIS)As with any other investment that has been deeply impacted by the coronavirus, caution is still the name of the game. Even with Dow Jones stocks, you don't want to get too comfortable. Take a modest position now, but make sure to have some ammo remaining for any dip-diving opportunities. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Although industrial giant 3M had obvious positive implications from the coronavirus -- as you know, they make the highly demanded N95 facemasks -- the first three months of 2020 weren't particularly pleasant for MMM stock. Along with the fact that neither consumers nor healthcare professionals could get reasonable access to 3M's personal protective equipment, the company faced accusations of selling their vital products to foreign entities.Some handwringing and President Trump's invoking of the Defense Protection Act appeared to have calmed tensions. Quickly, MMM stock responded with a robust performance so far in April. While these hiccups were not ideal from a PR perspective, the drama can't detract from the obvious.Previously, 3M was a lumbering, irrelevant organization. Now, they're one of the most critical. In fact, MMM stock has inserted itself into a national debate of restarting our core infrastructure. If so, that would be a big win for American industry, which is why you should keep 3M on your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy. Home Depot (HD)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Understandably, when the coronavirus panic first hit the U.S., many investors speculated on grocery firms like Kroger (NYSE:KR). Of course, it was a brilliant move as KR has enjoyed strong upside. But among Dow Jones stocks, Home Depot will probably benefit from a similar sentiment over the next few months.Just like Kroger shares, an investment in HD stock gives you exposure to an essential service. Obviously, most people are concerned about having enough food and water. But once that anxiety subsides, we quickly come to a stark realization: life's mishaps don't pause just because human societies are suffering from a pandemic.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy I'll give you a silly but pertinent example. When I thought I had my basics covered, that's when the bathroom lightbulb went out. I had spares, but I realized that for many people, incidents like these have caught them out. Therefore, even in a prolonged recession, I expect consistent demand to bolster HD stock. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com For most investments, including several Dow Jones stocks, the Covid-19 pandemic is just about the worst news that could happen. And I'm not suggesting that Johnson & Johnson was hoping for such an outbreak to occur. Nevertheless, I can't help but look at JNJ stock with some sense of cynicism. Without the coronavirus, we may be looking at Johnson & Johnson from a different lens.Obviously, the ongoing asbestos controversy has cast a dark cloud on JNJ stock. Last year in October, shares took it in the chin when Johnson & Johnson announced a voluntary recall of its baby powder product due to asbestos contamination. Also, shares have reacted wildly to the company's involvement in the drug addiction crisis.Today? When JNJ stock flashes across your screen, you're probably not thinking about any of these devastating controversies. Instead, you're thinking about the healthcare giant's many positives, including their over-the-counter medication portfolio that has allowed people with mild Covid-19 symptoms to recover. Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com As our own Tim Biggam argued, Walmart shares right now look &quot;tired and toppy,&quot; to use his language. Admittedly, I find it difficult to argue against that assessment. Plus, the fact that WMT stock is acting like this ahead of Walmart's earnings report doesn't inspire much confidence. But should shares tumble, you may want to consider adding the big-box retailer to your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy.As I mentioned near the top, Walmart may benefit from a consolidation effect. Again, as a big-box retailer, Walmart offers consumers everything. Therefore, in a prolonged recession, I would have concerns about specialty retailers. After all, why would you shop at multiple locations when you can get both your necessities and your discretionary items in one place?  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness That said, you want to exercise some caution with WMT stock relative to other Dow Jones stocks. Although I like the coronavirus lift, holiday sales were soft in 2019 for brick-and-mortar retailers. Thus, it's one warning sign to watch, especially if we enter a nasty recession. McDonald's (MCD)Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com Out of the Dow Jones stocks to consider for recession-proofing your portfolio, McDonald's is one of the more perplexing names. Especially with a pandemic-fueled recession, you wouldn't expect MCD stock to do well. For starters, customers must worry about how their food is handled, especially by low-income workers who feel they must work instead of calling in sick. Then there's the simple fact that it's much cheaper to cook your own food.At the same time, even in economic downturns, people need a respite from their day-to-day struggles. For some, that may mean downsizing their dining out budget to fast-food eateries. In that case, purchasing MCD stock on any dips may be a shrewd acquisition.Better yet, strong evidence exists for this approach. During the Great Recession, several fast-food restaurants saw an increase in sales. Therefore, it's reasonable that to believe that MCD could move higher, if only for the reason that humans are predictable. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com If you're thinking about literal consumption-based Dow Jones stocks to buy, you may want to check out Coca-Cola. Just like McDonald's, KO stock doesn't immediately grab you as the best investment to avoid a coronavirus-fueled recession. Plain old water is much cheaper. Plus, drinking too much soda is very bad for your health. Not to belabor the point, but excessive consumption can also cause the underlying health conditions for which Covid-19 is especially deadly.On the flipside, KO stock represents cheap escapism. During bull markets, people may have more expensive tastes for their celebratory occasions. Today, with money being much tighter, consumers will naturally cut back their expenses. But it's unlikely that they'll give up all frivolous pleasures in life.  * The 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Years Another point to consider about KO stock is that its underlying products are cheap pick-me-ups. As caffeinated drinks, Coca-Cola beverages offer a far less expensive alternative to iced coffee from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), for example. Thus, you don't want to ignore this icon if you're focusing exclusively on Dow Jones stocks. IBM (IBM)Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com Considering the damage that was inflicted on Dow Jones stocks by the Covid-19 pandemic, IBM produced solid results for its first-quarter 2020 earnings report. Against an earnings-per-share target of $1.80, Big Blue delivered $1.84. It also rang up $17.57 billion in revenue, which was a bit short of the $17.62 billion that analysts forecasted. However, the coronavirus impacted its growth opportunities.But that's not the reason why I'm bullish on IBM stock. As we put this ugly chapter behind us, there will be plenty of non-impacted earnings reports to dissect. Rather, the technology giant saw tremendous growth in certain segments even with the virus disrupting everything.According to an email sent to me by Tim Davidson from IBM Corporate Communications, &quot;despite the massive impact of COVID-19 in Italy, IBM's business grew there by 5 percent -- a remarkable performance that shows how clients turn to IBM in crucial situations for advanced technology and trusted data management and analysis.&quot;In times of trouble, people trust the technologies and innovations from respected brands. I couldn't think of a better reason to bet on IBM stock. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Historically, Dow Jones stocks have been levered to big, industrial names. But over the last few years, the index has incorporated much more relevant companies like Microsoft. What I like about MSFT stock is that while this security probably won't make you rich, it provides steady returns. Also, I love how the management team reinvigorated a software firm that was going stale.Despite this coronavirus pandemic, I think Microsoft's strengths shine through. For example, because of the nature of my profession, I would be dead in the water without the company's Software as a Solution platform. Yes, other business suites exist but whether you like it or not, the world runs on Microsoft. That's one viable reason to consider MSFT stock.  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Another is that the leadership team emphasizes constant innovation and competitiveness. As a prime example, they're making huge waves in the cloud computing space, giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fits. Also, the company offers Microsoft Teams as an intuitive teleconferencing alternative to Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). Nike (NKE)Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com Right now, I'm not a big fan of consumer retail names. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail segment suffered the worst hit in March. Within this category, the clothing and accessories segment was absolutely obliterated. Thus, you wouldn't expect much from Nike and NKE stock.But if you're a daring individual, you may just want to consider putting it in your prospective list of Dow Jones stocks. As Matt McCall recently pointed out, Nike has tremendous customer loyalty that is unparalleled within the athletic apparel industry. A great example is the Colin Kaepernick controversy. Typically, companies avoid scandalous players like Kaepernick because it's bad for branding. But Nike knew their audience and ran an advertisement featuring the polarizing figure.Initially, some conservatives pushed back against the apparel behemoth. However, NKE stock won out in the end, driven by strong customer response. I imagine if Nike can get away with a Kaepernick ad, the coronavirus may not be that much of a challenge. Disney (DIS)Source: chrisdorney.Shutterstock.com Fundamentally, when you stack up Disney against other Dow Jones stocks, it's hard to imagine a more embattled organization. Actually, the oil companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are much worse. But DIS stock is taking it on the chin in its underlying pivotal businesses.With movie theaters shut down due to Covid-19, it has unfairly lost hundreds of millions of dollars in box office revenue. Further, with stay-at-home orders, Disney's resort business is non-existent. Then, you have the fact that there are no professional sports. If Disney-owned ESPN wasn't already pointless, the coronavirus proved it in cruel fashion.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy Yet I don't expect this pandemic to be with us forever. When we finally reopen and the fear subsides, DIS stock could be a huge beneficiary of pent-up demand. It will take time, though, so be careful with this one.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-05-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Too many U.S. companies are building empires on the backs of low-wage workers. It’s a mistake to let it continue.      California, for one, is fighting back. It sued Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. in state court on Tuesday, contending that the ride-hailing companies violated a new state law by improperly designating drivers as independent contractors rather than employees to save on labor costs. The law in question is Assembly Bill 5, which requires companies to classify workers as employees unless they can establish that the work is outside the company’s usual course of business and that workers are free from the company’s control, among other factors. There’s a lot riding on the distinction. Employees are entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay and other benefits, whereas contractors are not. Multiply the difference in cost by millions of drivers and the savings add up to a huge competitive advantage. So it’s not surprising that Uber is doing everything possible to bolster the case that it’s not responsible for drivers. Since California enacted the law, Uber has experimented with letting drivers set their own fares to demonstrate their independence. Its chief lawyer even claimed that “drivers’ work is outside the usual course of Uber’s business.”Those efforts to disown drivers are laughable. Uber and Lyft are ride-hailing companies. Without drivers, there are no rides. Uber and Lyft also exert significant control over drivers, despite Uber’s assertion that it merely provides technology to “independent, third-party transportation providers.” The companies determine who has access to the technology. They dictate the kinds of cars drivers can use. They require vehicles to pass their detailed inspection. They impose an encyclopedia of terms and conditions on drivers concerning fares, tips and general conduct. Does that sound like technology or a boss? Aside from the fact that drivers are clearly employees by any reasonable application of California’s law, there are important public policy reasons why Uber and Lyft should be required to look after drivers. Labor is a big line item on many companies’ income statement. Those that neglect workers are able to undercut competitors, much the way Uber and Lyft are squeezing cab companies. And once they dispose of competition, it becomes difficult to dislodge them because they quickly amass market share and with it the power to dictate wages and discourage new entrants. What’s left is an industry with a small number of powerful firms in a sea of working poor.The retail industry is well on its way. Amazon.com Inc. accounts for 55% of the S&P 500 Retailing Index by market value. The second-biggest company in the index, Home Depot Inc., is a distant second at 14%, and the rest of the field is miles behind. Amazon’s hostile takeover of the retail industry wouldn’t have been possible without its army of low-wage workers. The median total compensation for U.S. full-time Amazon employees was $36,640 in 2019, according to the company, which is roughly half the amount realistically needed to raise a family in the most affordable towns in America. But good luck persuading Amazon to pay workers a living wage now that it has a firm grip on the retail industry. That’s a preview of life with Uber and Lyft if left unchecked.It’s not just drivers who have a stake in their employment status. If the question is left open, Uber and Lyft would have an incentive to relax oversight to fortify their position that drivers are independent. While it would undoubtedly give drivers more autonomy, it would also most likely mean loose standards for drivers’ qualifications, the reliability of their cars and the number of hours they can safely work in a day, all of which would endanger both riders and drivers.  Some will say this isn’t the time to take on ride-hailing companies. Uber announced on Wednesday that it would eliminate 3,700 jobs in response to the coronavirus shutdown, with more cost cuts to come. Forcing ride-hailing companies to absorb additional labor costs could result in further job losses, but there are ways to help workers during this downturn without compromising their future. Fiscal stimulus can be used to bolster workers’ incomes in the near term while keeping the pressure on ride-hailing companies. Otherwise, the longer ride-hailing companies are permitted to shortchange drivers, the harder and more costly it will become to secure drivers a fair deal.And if giving drivers the protections afforded to employees would sink ride-hailing companies’ business model, as some contend, then investors would be wise to acknowledge that reality before they absorb further losses. Uber’s stock is down 38% since its initial public offering last year and Lyft’s stock is down 64%. I like cheap rides and free two-day delivery as much as anyone. But if we continue to let companies take over whole industries by abandoning workers, everyone will eventually be poorer for it.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

Shares of Boeing (BA) and Walt Disney (DIS) are contributing about a quarter of the blue-chip gauge&apos;s intraday rally, as the Dow (DJIA) was most recently trading 243 points higher (1.","Boeing, Walt Disney share gains contribute to Dow's nearly 250-point rally"
2020-05-07,"Consumer stocks have been a mixed bag for investors in this bear market.On the one hand, consumer staples, which provide life's necessities, have held up far better than the broader market as Americans stock up for what could be weeks spent indoors. But consumer discretionary stocks - companies selling clothes, burgers and cars - have been every bit as bad as the S&P; 500, if not worse.But there are several consumer stocks to buy on both sides of the aisle now: staples that should continue to perform well as long as the outbreak keeps a grip on the country, as well as discretionary plays that have been knocked down into value status and have higher yields - and higher upside potential when the economy rebounds - as a result.Here are eight large-cap consumer stocks to buy for income and growth. These companies boast varied mixes of dividend and upside potential. Some of them are bounce-back plays, while others are steady Eddies that investors can hold to protect against additional market declines. However, all of them have seen their dividend yields become at least a little richer over the past few weeks.

2020-05-08,"In the center of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the question on income investors' minds is whether any stock can afford to pay its dividend. United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) stock can handle that load.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com For the March quarter, UPS had net income of $935 million, $1.11 per share diluted, on revenue of $18 billion.  That was higher than its quarterly dividend payout of $1.01 per share. The company also announced free cash flow of $1.6 billion, also enough to clear the dividend's cost.Analysts whined about the revenue mix, which was higher for residential than commercial deliveries, and terrible for international. But UPS opened for trading May 8 at about $93, and that dividend yield is about 4.3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Income Investors Take NoteAt a time when retired investors are reaching for yield in high-risk corporate bonds, the UPS dividend should be attractive. While common stock investors are always last in line for corporate obligations, behind bonds and all other bills, UPS proved this winter it can deliver results in all economic seasons.This has not made it a stock for all investors. Those seeking capital gains will see its down 20% so far in 2020. Those seeking growth will see that March revenue was just 5% ahead of last year. Analysts are updating their models to reflect UPS' slow, steady and profitable growth.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy NowUPS isn't coming away from the pandemic unscathed. Home deliveries are less profitable than bulk deliveries to business. First-quarter profit was down from a year earlier, even while revenue grew.UPS is also finding new ways to compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its network of UPS Stores means it has a physical presence that can even take Amazon returns. This will expand through an agreement to take packages from The Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK) chain of crafts stores, when retailing reopens.While longtime rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has gotten itself into trouble by picking fights with Amazon, UPS learned to adapt. I have speculated it's because FedEx is still led by founder Fred Smith, while UPS has recharged its management with outsiders from Home Depot (NYSE:HD), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). For them, Amazon is less an existential threat than a part of the business environment. A Trump Bump?UPS may also benefit from Trump's insistence that the U.S. Postal Service stop &quot;subsidizing&quot; Amazon and raise rates. Such a move would bring UPS more incremental business, cash with which to expand its own delivery network.During the current quarter, UPS drivers are hitting the road more, but making less for the company. That should change as stores and factories re-open over the next few months. UPS has also proven it can make money in a tough environment so that, if the lockdowns return, it is ready.Competition with Amazon also steeled UPS in the use of new technology. It is now delivering prescriptions to some senior centers using drones, in conjunction with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS). The pandemic is giving UPS the cash flow to move ahead in areas that had previously been theoretical. The Bottom Line for UPS StockUPS stock is not for everyone.In today's market it's the equivalent of an old-line industrial. It's a slow growth company with a steady stream of income.That means if you're looking for capital gains, look elsewhere. UPS' share price should recover as the pandemic retreats, but it will never be a high-flyer. It will continue to ride low to the ground.But at a time when high-flyers are out of fashion, with conservative investors doing triage on their portfolios against the virus' siege, UPS stands out at its current price. It will still pay you to own it, and that's saying something.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

Moreover, PYPL stock is far more attractive at this point than rivals Square (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com With e-commerce exploding, PayPal should get a lift as millions more customers utilize it to pay for their online purchases. And importantly, PayPal has heavy exposure to many of the large e-commerce businesses whose sales are currently booming. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are among the companies with huge e-commerce revenues that accept PayPal.While PayPal still can't be used as a payment method on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the biggest e-commerce player of them all, I think Jeff Bezos could decide to accept PayPal within a year or two. PayPal continues to expand. Soon, Bezos won't want to lose sales by continuing to refuse a partnership.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis exposure to huge companies should largely insulate PYPL stock from the bankruptcies of smaller businesses during the recession. That isn't the case for Square and Shopify, which earn a majority of their revenue from small and medium businesses. PYPL Stock Will Benefit From Market Share GainsPayPal looks poised to take significant market share from the large credit card networks, including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Of course, the e-commerce boom will contribute to that phenomenon. But I believe that, as the pandemic continues, many smaller businesses will start accepting PayPal payments alongside credit cards.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future When customers pay for products or services with credit cards, they often have to come fairly close to cashiers or whoever is carrying Square's payment machine. And to use credit cards, consumers have to press buttons on the same machine that many other people have touched.Of course, PayPal allows users to pay for products and services without touching a shared machine. Therefore, I believe that many businesses will look to accommodate consumers who are very worried about the virus by accepting PayPal as a payment method. Strong April ResultsAs most of the U.S. and Europe went into lockdown in April, PayPal's business soared.  In conjunction with its first-quarter results, PayPal reported that its net new active users had jumped 140% in April versus January and February.It also added 7.4 million net new customers in April, and CEO Dan Schulman provided guidance for &quot;15 million to 20 million net new active accounts [that] we anticipate adding in Q2.&quot;As the company continues to add new users, a virtuous cycle should be created. Specifically, as more users are added, more businesses will accept PayPal. And as consumers see that more businesses are accepting PayPal, more of them will sign up for the service. That cycle should accelerate over time. PayPal's Honey CatalystHoney, an app which PayPal acquired last year, automatically provides users with discounts and notifies them when the prices of items they're interested in drops by a certain percentage. Schulman believes that the data that Honey generates will be lucrative for merchants, and he thinks that the app will eventually be able to automatically purchase products for consumers when items fall to a certain price.Honey is already quite valuable for consumers because of its ability to automatically apply coupons. As a result, the app will likely spur many more users to join PayPal.If Honey can make automatic purchases at certain price points, PayPal will become even more valuable to consumers. And PayPal may be able to generate meaningful revenue by selling the data that Honey collects to merchants. Valuation and the Bottom Line on PayPalPayPal is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average 2020 earnings per share estimates, of 43. That's a bargain for a rapidly growing tech name like PayPal.Moreover, the company's actual forward P/E ratio may be meaningfully lower because, given its rapid growth recently, many analysts are probably underestimating its 2020 EPS. Square, by contrast, trades at a forward P/E ratio of 133.PayPal's shares trade at a trailing price-sales ratio of 9.4. In comparison, Shopify stock trades at a trailing P/S ratio of 48.Given PayPal's positive catalysts and relatively low valuation, investors should buy PYPL stock now.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

2020-05-15,"When it comes to Dow Jones Industrial Average stock 3M (NYSE:MMM), investors have been faced with their share of ailments off and on the price chart. But following a new sales report, will the old doggish trend in MMM stock remain the bears' best friend? Or will it mark new profitable beginnings for bulls? Let's take a closer look at what's going on with 3M right now.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Many stocks in today's market can point to the novel coronavirus as a source for challenges facing those companies in an unfolding socially distanced environment. Take a look at the grounding in airline giant Delta Airlines (NASDAQ:DAL) or the TKO in casino heavyweight Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) as two common victims. It's not pretty. That's not the entire story though.Many blue-chip stocks within the Dow Jones are adapting. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is one constituent whose price chart points at a company figuring out how to successfully service consumers through the coronavirus pandemic. And tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the market's largest publicly traded company, simply appears to be well-built for this unthinkable, disruptive socioeconomic shift. Unfortunately, 3M (and, by extension, MMM stock) is different.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the industrial conglomerate's well-positioned N-95 respirator mask success during the new pandemic and some spoils from other health-related business units, 3M's April sales dipped 11% from the year ago period according to a report released Thursday. Softness in other key market segments, including safety and industrial, consumer, transportation and electronics weighed on the company's total sales decline.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The news comes after 3M announced in late April it was withdrawing full-year guidance due to the pandemic. Management stated it will keep investors informed vis-a-vis monthly updates until a more accurate, longer-term forecast is possible. The first of these reports also appears to have been a surprise for Wall Street.MMM stock slid to its weakest levels since late March during Thursday's session. However, a rebound in the broader market from out-the-gate selling following back-to-back days of profit-taking helped lift the stock well off intraday lows to close down just 0.75%.But is 3M a pullback worth buying? MMM Stock Monthly Price Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewEarnings at the tail end of April saw investors bid up MMM stock by more than 2.50% and notch a two-month high. The action also established follow-through confirmation for a bullish monthly chart hammer candlestick formed during March's broader market correction. That's not all though.Technically, the hammer is well-supported by the 62% retracement level dating to 3M's 2009 financial crisis bottom. Also favorable, the candlestick's body completed narrowly above a long-term trend-line. It's the sort of evidence that makes the case for a meaningful bottom following a two-year long bear market. But a hard pullback over the past two weeks might raise a flag regarding the pattern's durability.A second look at 3M's monthly chart reveals the immediate post-earnings bid has yielded to another potential lower high pattern in MMM stock's existing downtrend. The rally high also failed rather quickly on an initial challenge of nearby resistance. It's not the sort of price action investors caught purchasing 3M's hammer are likely excited to see.The good news, if any, is 3M's stock is offering a pullback opportunity with solid risk versus reward characteristics. Shares are inside a support area from roughly $115 to $141 and above the trend-line, which held the body of April's hammer. Stochastics have also signaled a bullish crossover inside oversold territory.My advice for any would be buyers of 3M is to set a stop-loss beneath $129. This level minimizes dollar risk to about 5% as of Thursday's close. At the same time, relative to the recent high a return of nearly 20% is possible and skews the risk profile heavily in favor of buying stock. Moreover and to make sure an old and friendly doggish trend doesn't continue to rollover, this exit smartly pulls the plug if a bearish April pivot high is confirmed and 3M falls ominously inside the lower half of its hammer bottom.The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler's observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

2020-05-18,"Auto racing returned over the weekend, but that isn't the only reason the market looks like it could be off to a fast start Monday.Focus ahead of the opening bell turned toward bullish hopes around reopenings and possible progress on the vaccine front. Overseas markets rose across the board and U.S. index futures saw strength overnight, extending their gains on positive results from a Phase 1 COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA). Shares of that company leapt 27% in pre-market trading.It's exciting to see data like this but it's still very early in the process, so people might want to avoid getting carried away. Let's hope future results continue to look this good. A vaccine would be huge news and these data are an incredibly positive sign, but that doesn't mean this crisis would necessarily be over. It could also take a while before any vaccine is ready.The big gains in index futures based in part on this one small data set do show how eager investors remain to buy based on any positive news around fighting the virus. As we've said, the market is headline-oriented and seems ready to plow ahead on any signs of normalcy returning.Before the MRNA news, stocks had been rallying overnight based on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's interview on 60 Minutes Sunday. He gave a lot of assurances and sounded very confident about the economy.While Powell said a full economic recovery may not be possible until a COVID-19 vaccine is available, he added, &quot;In the long run and even in the medium run, you wouldn't want to bet against the American economy. The American economy will recover.&quot; Powell said if there isn't a second-wave outbreak, he expects the economy to start to rebound in the second half.Shopping Trip: Retail Dominates Earnings Calendar Americans didn't go shopping much in April, judging from last Friday's horrendous retail sales data. This week, investors could get a better sense of what the retail market might look like in the months ahead as major big-box companies prepare to report earnings.Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) dominate this week's corporate calendar, with WMT reporting tomorrow morning and TGT the morning after. Other key retailers that report in the coming days include Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN), Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL), and Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS).Also on the big box list are Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), which could provide insight on the demand for projects around those homes we're all stuck into some extent during the crisis.Friday's retail sales, which shrank more than 16% in April, gave some clues about where shoppers are congregating and where they aren't. The hardest-hit retail areas included electronics, clothing, sporting goods, and furniture. None of this arguably bodes well for department stores or the FLs and Nike Inc's (NYSE: NKE) of the world.However, non-store retail sales actually rose in April, which could be good news for WMT and TGT considering all the investments they've made in their internet platforms over the last few years. That said, higher labor costs and a shift in customer demand toward lower-margin items like food and paper goods might eat into profits for WMT and TGT. We'll have to wait and see.One thing to consider watching when WMT reports is the expenses side of things. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) said sales were great, but expenses were outrageous. The same thing is important to monitor with WMT. Are they spending more to support their operations amid all the current chaos? Also, when do they see normalcy returning?So many retail stocks report this week, so the question to consider is what is the true health of retail? We may have a better idea by Friday.View more earnings on WMTThis week isn't only about retail. Earnings from Deere & Company (NYSE: DE), Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) also hit the tape soon, providing a closer look into a cross-section of sectors including Materials, Information Technology, and Health Care. S&P 500 companies are on pace to see a 12.1% decline in Q1 profits, according to market data provider Refinitiv. The firm is bearish about earnings this quarter, seeing them down 42%.Cruel April Data Keep Coming The week that just ended wasn't anything to write home about, as major indices lost ground. Obviously, worries about soft retail sales and industrial production didn't help, though some market watchers are out there saying they think April may have been the worst of it for some of these metrics. That remains to be seen, as more April numbers await us with housing starts and building permits tomorrow (see more below).One glimmer of light came from Friday's University of Michigan report on consumer sentiment. The initial reading for May rose a bit from April, though it still remains down in the dumps, historically. The key takeaway, according to research firm Briefing.com, is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate. Concerns about financial prospects were most notable among upper-income households, which could be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending, Briefing.com noted.You could argue that the old week wasn't a total washout because the S&P 500 Index (SPX) made it back from lows below 2800 to close above a long-term support level near 2830. Still, it's technically a little frustrating that the SPX continues to have a lot of trouble plowing past a technical resistance zone of between 2940 and 2950, which has now held for several weeks.Powell's bearish speech last week didn't provide much in the way of traction for any bullish investors. It also didn't help that another potential economic stimulus bill appears to be running into trouble in Washington and that new worries about technology trade with China arose.Those China trade concerns hit the semiconductor sector pretty hard on Friday, and any sign of a cool-down there might be worrisome for the week ahead. It's big-tech, led in part by the semiconductors, that's helped keep the market running mostly higher over the last month. CHART OF THE DAY: SOLO FLIGHT: Crude futures (/CL-candlestick) had another strong week last week even as the June contract expiration approaches. This separates crude from some of the other most closely-watched commodities, including copper (/HG-purple line), which has barely risen over the last month. Sometimes copper and crude march together as both can reflect global demand trends, but copper came under pressure last week on concerns about growing supplies, among other things. Data Source: CME Group. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Banks Still Buried: After leading Thursday's comeback, big bank stocks took it on the chin Friday as inventors examined the latest round of disappointing economic data. The Financial sector remains one of the worst performers on the scoreboard so far this year, down more than 30%, as worries about defaults and low interest rates plague many of the key banking stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE: C).That said, it might be a bit early to count this sector out for the year, if only because many of the biggest banks came into this crisis with solid balance sheets and a record of cutting costs over the last few years. Also, many of these companies sport dividend yields that might start to look tempting for investors who increasingly seek yield in an environment where cash and bonds pay so little.Crude Energized: Getting a little overshadowed was a nice rise in crude prices over the last week and early Monday even as tomorrow marks the last trading day for CME June futures. It looks now like this contract is going to get put to bed with a few less fireworks than we saw for the May contract last month when the price fell below zero. Open interest was down to around 75,000 contracts by Friday afternoon for June CME futures, and prices were roughly even with the July contract. That implies, but doesn't guarantee, a smooth transition to July being the front month.Some of this might sound a little esoteric, but it definitely seemed to spook the stock market when May crude went off the board with all those headlines a month ago. That makes tomorrow's crude expiration a potential event to watch even if you never trade futures. Crude's strength could reflect growing Chinese industrial demand as that country continues the reopening process, analysts said.Sifting the Numbers on Housing: It's kind of a light data picture ahead, dominated the next few days by reports on the real estate sector. Housing starts and existing home sales could be interesting to check on, considering that mortgage rates are back near record lows and some real estate markets are reporting pretty vigorous interest from potential homebuyers despite the pandemic. April housing starts tomorrow could show whether that sector bounced back from a big drop in March. Building permits are also due tomorrow morning, a data point some analysts say is a good one to watch for a sense of how optimistic about the economy homebuilders might be.It's kind of fitting that HD earnings are on tomorrow morning's calendar just as investors are on the lookout for the latest housing market data. HD's stock has made an impressive comeback from the March lows as many investors started to look at the company as a &quot;stay-at-home&quot; firm that could be helped by people doing home projects when they had nowhere else to go. The HD stores stayed open during the crisis, which also helped. HD's guidance still calls for sharper revenue gains in 2020 than in 2019, so consider watching tomorrow for any updates on that.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-05-19,"U.S. equity futures turned slightly lower early Tuesday following Monday's strong showing. The market scored its best session in six weeks after a Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) trial boosted optimism for a potential coronavirus vaccine. The Dow and S&P 500 indices both saw their biggest one-day gains since April 8 while the Nasdaq posted its best rally since April 29. To the upside in premarket trading are shares of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) after the big-box retailer posted an earnings beat for its first quarter.

2020-05-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. fell as the cost of Covid-19 measures offset higher sales, tempering financial gains from renewed consumer interest in home-improvement projects.A pretax expense of $850 million to support workers reduced diluted earnings by 60 cents a share in the first quarter, Home Depot said Tuesday in a statement. Despite a gain in sales, total profit trailed Wall Street estimates, the chain’s first earnings miss since 2014.The results underwhelmed as investors anticipated robust growth for the company, whose stores were deemed essential and have stayed open during the pandemic. The stock has soared in recent as quarantined Americans spend more on fixing up their homes.The company left a lot of sales on the table by cutting back on promotions and operating hours during the quarter. That reduction in discounting showed up in transactions, which fell 3.9%. Still, the size of each purchase rose 11% on average, pushing total sales growth to the highest level in more than a year.Home Depot fell 1.8% to $241.02 a share at 9:58 a.m. in New York.Recent GainsThere were promising signs. Same-store sales growth accelerated to a double-digit gain in April and that rate has continued through the first two weeks of its second quarter, the company said. The metric increased 6.4% in the first quarter.“Early second-quarter sales are strong,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on a call with analysts. “We see that across geographies. Everything is lifting.”First-quarter sales rose in 17 of 19 geographic regions, with declines in the New York City and south Florida areas.Like many companies during the pandemic, Home Depot suspended its full-year forecast due to widespread uncertainty around Covid-19 and its impact on the broader economy.Home Depot likely saw softness in its pro business, aimed at contractors, due to shelter-in-place rules triggered by the pandemic, according to RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli. Recent credit-card transaction data pointed to Home Depot’s sales growing more than 10%, but those figures likely don’t capture all of the pro business, Ciccarelli said today in a note to clients.(An earlier version corrected the name of analyst in the final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Slides After Pandemic Costs Counter Sales Gains

2020-05-19,"Shares of Home Depot Inc.  fell 2.5% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the home improvement retailer reported a fiscal first-quarter profit that missed expectations, although revenue and same-store sales rose more than forecast. Net income for the quarter to May 5 fell to $2.25 billion, or $2.08 a share, from $2.51 billion, or $2.27 a share, in the year-ago period. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was $2.27. Sales rose 7.1% to $28.26 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $27.56 billion. Overall same-store sales grew 6.4% from a year ago, beating the FactSet consensus of 4.3% growth, while U.S. same-store sales rose 7.5% compared with expectations of a 4.0% rise.

2020-05-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s no surprise to hear that retailers’ online sales are surging through the coronavirus pandemic. But would you guess that for some of the biggest winners, it’s their physical stores that gave those sales a boost? Even as consumers grapple with stay-at-home orders and their own fears of contagion, a surprisingly large number are willing to pick up their digital orders at a store. Target Corp. on Wednesday said sales through its curbside drive-up option — shoppers order online, pick up at a store — increased 1,000% in April compared to a year earlier. More than 2 million customers tested out the drive-up feature for the first time, the big-box retailer said, and the volume was so strong that there were more orders collected that way in the first quarter than in all of 2019. Sales through Lowes.com were up 80% in the three months ended May 1, and more than half of those online orders were picked up in a store, the home-improvement retailer said on Wednesday. Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., which both reported results on Tuesday, observed the same trends. “It’s time we stop referring to our Supercenter pickup and delivery capability as online grocery because it’s becoming much more,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company’s earnings call. There are a couple of takeaways from this. First, it seems that for all the hand-wringing over the lasting impact to physical retail real estate from the pandemic, stores still have a role to play, when used appropriately. As skyrocketing demand snarled logistics networks and caused huge delays in deliveries, customers were willing to be flexible to get the items they needed. Practically speaking, there’s not a huge difference risk-wise between retrieving a box from your front porch and picking one up from the curb of a store. Having that option may have helped the likes of Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s capture sales from customers who were stumped by sold-out notices at online-only retailers or who previously did most of their shopping at a physical location. Notably, Walmart cited customers aged 50 years and older as a demographic that saw significant growth. Meanwhile, Women’s Wear Daily has reported that Amazon.com Inc. is exploring a potential deal with bankrupt retailer J.C. Penney Co. It's not exactly clear what the Internet giant's intention would be, but one possibility is that it could be a bid to add more options for online-order distribution such as curbside pickup.The nature of square footage may have to evolve; Target talked about the need to add more parking spots and storage space. And this model isn’t going to work for all retailers; those that didn’t have an effective digital strategy beforehand may be caught irreversibly flat-footed. Lowe’s Cos. CEO Marvin Ellison sounded audibly relieved that his company had invested in improving its e-commerce capabilities when it did. “What we’re seeing is that the customers simply want to shop the way that they choose to, and in the past, we couldn’t accommodate that,” Ellison said on Lowe’s earnings call on Wednesday. “When we started to get requests from customers for curbside, we put that up and going in three days. This time last year, it would have been impossible to do that because we didn't have the infrastructure.” There's reason to believe customer buy-in for curbside or in-store pickup will hold: 40% of drive-up customers at Target have made a repeat purchase. This puts the margin pressure that retailers faced in the pandemic quarter in perspective. Profitability at Target and Walmart was squeezed by both the types of items customers were ordering — food and essentials are less lucrative than more discretionary items like clothing  — and by the shift toward digital. But having the customers pick up their own orders is much more profitable than delivering the products to their homes. Online ordering may account for more than 17% of retail sales in the U.S. this year, up from 13.9% in 2019, according to GlobalData. If retailers can continue to convert a meaningful portion of that demand into pickup versus delivery, it will provide an offset to the inherently higher supply-chain operating costs of a digital model. Target customers that use its drive-up option for the first time also tend to spend more at the company overall than they did previously, the company said. Asked what kind of permanent changes he envisions in the post-pandemic world, Target CEO Brian Cornell said his “highlight and takeaway is stores are vitally important and stores will continue to play a really important role to America as we go forward.&quot; Who would have thought that a virus outbreak that's relegated so much of our lives to our homes would put such a premium on brick-and-mortar? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Here's how some of the Street's top analysts reacted to the reports.The Home Depot Analysts Piper Sandler analyst Peter Keith maintained a Neutral rating on Home Depot, price target lifted from $231 to $244.BofA Securities analyst Elizabeth Suzuki maintained at Neutral, price target lifted from $238 to $250.Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock maintained at Outperform, price target lifted from $245 to $250.Piper Sandler's Key Takeaways On Home Depot Home Depot reported a ""strong"" first-quarter report, highlighted by a comp growth beat of 6.4%, while comps accelerated to double-digits in May, Keith said in a note.The company saw some incremental expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also showed strong underlying expense leverage, the analyst said. Looking forward, Home Depot doesn't expect to report negative comps in any quarter in 2020 as it benefits from consumers spending less money on restaurants, travel and entertainment, he said. Piper Sandler's revised $244 price target is based on expectations for the company to establish itself as a beneficiary of increasing spending on home categories, even if the U.S. remains in a recession for the rest of the year, Keith said.A Neutral stance remains in place for valuation reasons, according to Piper Sandler. BofA Says Home Depot's Strong Comps Won't Last Home Depot's comp growth of 6.4% in the first quarter exceeded expectations of 5% as average ticket rose 11%, Suzuki said in a note. The company likely benefited from consumers ""being stuck at home"" and spending money on home improvement projects, the analyst said. Some of the purchases were likely pulled forward as more consumers return to work in the second and third quarters and any stimulus benefits will ""wear off,"" she said.The expectations for momentum seen in the first quarter are not likely to last moving forward, according to BofA. Raymond James: Doing More In A 'Tough Environment'Home Depot deserves credit for shifting a business of its size to serve customer needs, such as contactless curbside pickup, McClintock said in a note. The company is also heavily focusing on digital, and this will serve as a competitive advantage moving forward, the analyst said. The retailer did a good job at managing its expenses while simultaneously investing ""aggressively"" in its One Home Depot strategic initiatives and its workers, he said. ""Bigger picture, we believe HD is well positioned to outperform in what will likely be a tough environment over the next several quarters, and has a large share gain opportunity longer-term as independents fall by the wayside.""

There was ""a lot to like"" in the report, including an EPS beat, comp growth of 11.2% versus the Street's estimate of 4.1% and operating margin expansion of 206 basis points.2\. Lowe's has superior exposure to the do-it-yourself customer, who represents 75% to 80% of total sales versus Home Depot's 40% to 45%. By comparison, the Pro market was negatively impacted by social distancing requirements.3\. The online business saw an 80% year-over-year sales growth and it has plenty of room to continue expanding off its current low base.4\. Incremental COVID-related costs won't disrupt the long-term margin story after Lowe's already eliminated underperforming assets and made other strategic moves.5\. Demand for renovation products should remain a trend for the coming years.Lowe's Has Sustainable Momentum, KeyBanc Says Lowe's first-quarter momentum sustained into May, with a double-digit comp across all regions, Thomas said in a note.The retailer did choose to withdraw its outlook, although it kept a confident tone in its ability to improve gross margins and continue SG&A leverage, the analyst said. The company is considered to be ""one of the strongest retailers"" within KeyBanc's coverage given a compelling ""self-help story"" under CEO Marvin Ellison, he said.

But when it comes to financial heavyweight Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the jury is still out and trying to overturn that more bearish conviction. Let me explain the issues surrounding Bank of America stock.Source: 4kclips / Shutterstock.com Many investors can argue there's a very large disconnect between the stock market and economy right now. And understandably so. The broad-based, large-cap S&P 500 is up nearly 40% since its historic March 23 bear market bottom despite a still very real and problematic coronavirus.Has the market no sense of what's right and wrong? At the same time, shares of Bank of America are up 48%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore recently, Wall Street has seen fit to ignore polarized and sometimes violent nationwide protests in the wake of the senseless death of George Floyd. And those gains have the S&P 500 nearly wiping its hands clean of the Covid-19 driven sell-off.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing RestartsIs there no justice? Maybe not. More certain, there is that other branch of the government known as the Fed that's been so instrumental in the rally's success.The defiant and well-supported behavior is even more profound in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and other stocks near or even making fresh highs in recent days. But the separation of Main Street versus Wall Street gets even worse. The market's betrayal is showing up in CNN's multi-faceted fear-and-greed indicator.The sentiment tool analyzes extremes using options activity, safe haven and junk bond demand, market breadth, volatility and price momentum. A current reading of 62 in the indicator has just entered greed territory. It's also a full 180-degree swing away from the pandemic's correctly warned fearful lows.Nevertheless, while those warnings have been duly noted, the writing isn't on the wall for Bank of America investors. Bank of America Stock Monthly Chart  Click to EnlargeSource: Source: Charts by TradingView Despite Bank of America's outperformance since the March low, shares remain situated in their enduring position of relative weakness versus the broader market. But right now, the opportunity for the stock to continue its rally and make more of a bullish pattern impact is growing in our estimation.What has our interest as a buy is Bank of America's bullish stochastics crossover as shares begin to follow through off support after two months of inside candlestick consolidation work. That's not to say the situation is without any challenges.Front and center, shares are now challenging the 50% retracement level of the Covid-19 sell-off. There's also a slightly smaller and already broken uptrend dating back to 2016. That's potentially another layer of resistance just modestly above today's Bank of America stock price.Still, in a world where greed has been espoused as good and today's seemingly unthinkable bullish behavior is also at the low end of the ""overenthusiastic"" range, the argument for buying or continuing to hold Bank of America stock today makes sense. The Bottom Line on BACMy price target for Bank of America over the next several months is for shares to conservatively revisit their pre-coronavirus highs near $35. For a long-only position, without fully calling into question the integrity of the chart's bottoming pattern, I'd argue for a line in-the-sand and stop-loss beneath an eyeballed $22.85.Alternatively, and for like-minded investors, I'd make the case for having a great defensive team in your possession and put together a dynamic collar around a long stock position. Currently and with Bank of America shares near $26.50, the August $23 / $30 combination for ten cents of premium over shares looks about right.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article, but does maintain hedged positions in the SPDRs Financial ETF (XLF).The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler's observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

2020-06-11,"The fastest stock market decline in history has been followed up by one of the most rapid recoveries. Rallying on economic re-openings and a better-than-expected jobs report, the S&P 500 has basically recovered all of its losses for the year, while the Nasdaq topped 10,000 for the first time ever. Yet, investors need to be mindful of the potential risks ahead. US stocks tumbled today due to new concerns that the U.S. may be experiencing a second-wave reinfection of Covid-19 cases in certain states. So, where does the market go from here? One way to navigate all of the stock market uncertainty is to rely on a more comprehensive stock analysis.TipRanks offers a Smart Score metric that incorporates 8 unique market factors including analyst ratings and price targets, hedge fund activity, social media trends and other fundamental and technical factors to gauge a stock’s long-term growth prospects. After analyzing each factor, a single numerical score is generated, with 10 being the best possible result.Bearing this in mind, we used TipRanks database to find three stocks with a ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Score. We’ll see why these companies scored so highly, and what Wall Street’s analysts have to say about it.Burlington Stores (BURL)The first “Perfect 10” stock on our list is Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory. The company is an American national off-price department store retailer with 631 stores.Burlington’s first quarter operating results were decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the company’s stores were closed by March 22, and remained closed through the end of the first quarter. Adding to its difficulties is its lack of an online presence.Sales for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020 dropped a dramatic 51% to $798 million. Net income came in at a loss of $334 million, or $5.09 per share, compared to $78 million, or $1.15 per share, in the first quarter of last year.Still, Burlington has a lot to cheer about. The company re-opened about 400 stores by the end of May, which prompted an upward share price swing. Like several other players, Q1 was “tough” for Burlington, with store closures leading to a significant decrease in revenues and no e-commerce to offset it. However, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez thinks the space is set to gain from an increase in merchandise buying opportunities.As a result, Lejuez raised the firm's price target on Burlington Stores to $250 from $205 and has a Buy rating on the shares. This target implies shares could surge 22% in the next year. (To look at Lejuez’s track record, click here).The analyst consensus rating on BURL is a Strong Buy, based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock has a $231.15 average price target, which suggests a 13% growth potential from the current price. (See Burlington stock analysis on TipRanks)The Home Depot (HD)Next up is Home Depot. The company is the world's largest home improvement retailer with $110.2 billion in sales in 2019. It operates 2,291 stores that sell various building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and décor products to both do-it-yourself and professional customers.Home Depot has been performing remarkably well during the COVID-19 pandemic. People confined to their homes are keeping themselves busy with repair and home improvement projects.Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 reached $28.3 billion, up 7.1% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The gains were driven by a 6.4% increase in comparable store sales. However, COVID-19 related expenses caused earnings to decrease slightly for the quarter.The company’s strong operating performance amid COVID-19 has translated to a significantly better stock price performance than the broader market. Home Depot’s shares have climbed 28% over the last 52 weeks, compared with an 11% rise for the S&P 500.5-star Baird analyst Peter Benedict raised the firm's price target on Home Depot to $265 from $215 and has an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares. (To look at Benedict’s track record, click here)  According to Benedict, recent channel checks, Google Search Trends analysis, and accelerating industry sales data highlight stronger Q1 demand trends than originally expected. Seasonal and outdoor-related categories have been particularly robust, while bigger ticket categories such as appliances have remained surprisingly resilient.Turning now to the rest of the Street, Home Depot has a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. For the most part, other analysts echo Benedict’s positive sentiment, with 15 Buys and 7 Holds issued in the last three months. (See Home Depot stock analysis on TipRanks)NIKE, Inc. (NKE)Last but definitely not least is Nike. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of a healthy lifestyle. This sentiment was recently echoed by Nike CEO John Donahoe who said, ""Even more so, consumers around the world are recognising the need for an active and healthy lifestyle and sport is now more meaningful than ever.”Nike was able to buck the negative sales trend affecting consumer goods companies and deliver positive sales during the COVID-19 crisis. Revenues increased 5% to $10.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter. The results were driven by online sales gains that more than offset sales losses due to store closures.The company’s share price has almost doubled since March when it hit a 52-week low of $62.80, posting an impressive 24% gain over the last year.Cowen analyst John Kernan believes Nike’s expanding user base improves the connection with core consumers and offers a meaningful mix benefit to unit economics and gross margins.To this end, Kernan bumped up the firm's price target on Nike to $110 from $85 and has an Outperform rating on the shares. His price target on Nike indicates 14% upside potential. (To look at Kernan’s track record, click here).Wall Street agrees with Kernan’s view on Nike. Out of 22 analysts providing recommendations, there were 19 Buys and 3 Holds, so the analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy.

2020-06-22,"Increased hours of operation at distribution centers and open communication with drivers are the common denominators among three public companies that specialize in consumer goods and office products.Those and other attributes focusing on the driver experience earned The Home Depot, Whirlpool and HNI Corp. best-of-the-best honors in the FreightWaves 2020 Shipper of Choice Awards, sponsored by Transflo.The 2020 FreightWaves Shipper of Choice seal of approval is based on how shippers perform in each of three categories — Facilities, Efficiency and Availability — relative to their peers, based on a series of measurable and qualitative responses. (An additional Above and Beyond&quot; driver appreciation award was featured as well, based on stories plucked from social media that described shippers that went out of their way to take care of drivers and make sure they could do their job safely.)Shippers receiving recognition must first be nominated and then complete a certified survey conducted by the FreightWaves Research Group. The survey addressed operational data, hours of operation, communication protocols, dwell times, and overages/shortages/damages. Nominees were also judged by facility attributes that include availability of showers, bathrooms and break rooms for drivers.To win Best Overall, a shipper typically won one or more awards within those main categories. Office furniture manufacturer HNI Corp (NYSE: HNI) managed to snag all three.&quot;Our priority is providing our customers a great end-to-end buying experience, and a big part of that is the delivery experience,&quot; Eric Zillig, HNI's vice president of distribution and logistics, told FreightWaves.&quot;To be successful at that, we have to partner with high-performing carriers and high-performing drivers, and to maintain a relationship with them, we have to be easy to do business with and be a good partner — which is another way of saying you're a shipper of choice.&quot;Zillig said he tries to provide &quot;as large a window as possible&quot; for the roughly 30 carriers HNI works with for scheduling load pickups so that drivers can better schedule their workday.Last year, HNI created its own in-house driver app, Loaded with Pride, to enhance communication with drivers. Drivers can install the app on a phone or tablet to allow them to provide instant feedback on the delivery.&quot;We were looking for drivers to use the app to comment on our loading practices,&quot; Zillig said. &quot;In addition, we received good feedback around things like hours of operation and warehouses that were tough to get into. So we've been able to identify issues and come up with solutions.&quot;The world's leading major home appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR), which in addition to honors for overall winner took awards for Efficiency and Availability, has been a longtime proponent of shipper-of-choice awareness.&quot;It became a theme in the industry several years ago,&quot; Kara Hegg, Whirlpool Corp.'s manager of supply chain and logistics, told FreightWaves. &quot;Our team wanted to know how we stacked up against others and worked to figure out how to measure the perception. We collected data and focused on our biggest opportunities for improvement.&quot;With 12 factory distribution centers feeding into 12 regional distribution centers that in turn connect to the company's local distribution network for final-mile home delivery, securing trust with carrier and driver partners is critical for maintaining efficiency throughout the company's logistics network Hegg said.&quot;We work really hard on the relationship to understand what's important to our carriers. It is critical to be a good partner to ensure capacity isn't walking away from us.&quot;The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD), which also won in the Availability and Facilities categories, has been committed to being a shipper of choice. As part of its One Home Depot initiative, the company is investing roughly $1.2 billion in its One Supply Chain network. The investment &quot;is designed to continue to improve productivity and connectivity across our supply chain platforms to achieve the fastest, most efficient delivery capabilities in home improvement,&quot; the company stated.The retailer, which racked up $110 billion in sales in fiscal 2019, is investing in approximately 150 new facilities to drive speed and delivery reliability for customers, it stated.

2020-07-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Some new CEOs prefer to sit back for awhile, watching and learning while they plot their legacy. Others carry on their predecessor’s plans. And then there are those who waste no time making the job their own. New United Parcel Service Inc. CEO Carol Tome falls into the latter category.Thursday marked the first earnings day for new CEO Carol Tome, a former Home Depot Inc. executive and UPS board member who succeeded long-time leader David Abney in June. I’d say it was a respectable debut, but that somehow cheapens it. It was downright impressive. The presentation felt refreshing on many fronts. Tome (pronounced “Toe-MAY”) was able to combine a frank and hard-nosed assessment of UPS’s past spending habits with a bit of personality. She exuded confidence and competence, but she also made some jokes and it felt like she was really being herself. That’s not an easy thing to do as a woman in business; Tome is one of only about 30 female CEOs among S&P 500 companies.It helped that Tome had robust numbers to tout: Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were twice as high as analysts had anticipated at $2.13 a share. Profit margins soared in the international business as UPS added more flights at higher yields to meet a spike in demand for products out of Asia. But they also held up much better than might have been expected in a domestic segment that saw average daily volume surge by nearly 23% in the quarter as coronavirus-lockdowns spurred an  e-commerce frenzy among everyday consumers. Such deliveries tend to be less profitable because getting online orders to residences requires more driving and additional stops than business shipments.The margin resilience in the domestic segment is partly a reflection of surcharges and route limitations that both UPS and rival FedEx Corp. have imposed on deliveries for their busiest customers. Heading into the earnings call, my biggest question was whether that was going to be sustainable once the immediate surge in Covid-buying began to fade. As soon as Tome started talking, though, it was clear this was the beginning of a much deeper change. “It's all about becoming better, not bigger,” Tome said. For her, this means rethinking how UPS invests in its business,  taking a tougher stance with retailers on pricing and prioritizing higher-quality volume.She gave the example of the company’s fleet of Boeing Co. 747s. The company pressed those wide-body jets into service to help handle the large demand for products out of Asia with fewer flights in an effort to “sweat the assets that we have.” But when an opportunity recently became available to buy more of the jets, UPS passed. The planes would have created excess capacity that UPS then would have had to find volume to fill, likely at unattractive prices. “We have not gotten the returns that we should have delivered on some of the capital investments that we made,” Tome said. “We will get the network right before we think about investing more dollars’’ in it, she said.That’s bad news for Boeing and other aerospace suppliers who had been hoping demand from freight companies might mitigate malaise among commercial airlines with the pandemic bringing air travel to a crawl. But it’s great news for UPS shareholders who have long complained about a lack of visible payoff from the billions upon billions of dollars the company has shelled out in the name of making its network more efficient and profitable.The 747s are just the tip of the iceberg. UPS is rethinking all levels of its spending and only going to put money toward projects that customers actually want and will pay for. It sounds simple, but it’s easy for large operators with long histories to get stuck in old-school trains of thought. Tome pointed out that an initial review of UPS’s 400 to 500 different products found that roughly 100 weren’t selling and yet all the offerings — along with the salesforce, technology and financial infrastructure that support them — had stayed on the books.Once you have the right products, you can go after the right kind of customer. Tome is speeding up an effort to reduce the amount of time packages from small- and medium-sized businesses spend in transit in an effort to bring on more of those kinds of customers. “Why am I focusing on SMB?” Tome asked, referring to small and medium businesses. “Because the SMB customer values an end-to-end network and they pay us for it.” The implied contrast is to a customer such as Amazon.com Inc., which is more interested in negotiating discounts relative to its large amounts of volume. Every percentage point in sales retained among small business clients translates into $170 million of high-quality revenue, Tome said. “This is a big company to turn; you can't do it overnight,” Tome said. But she seems to have made a remarkable amount of progress in a very short time as CEO and the level of detail on her longer-term outlook for UPS’s network was staggering. It just goes to show what fresh eyes can do. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-08-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Business Roundtable, an elite organization representing influential chief executive officers, is calling for change everywhere except Corporate America’s payrolls.Millions of workers that big business employs are in a bad way. Their wages have been stagnant or in decline for decades. Many no longer earn a living wage – if they still have a job – and their struggle has fed, if not sometimes sparked, the protests sweeping the U.S.Last week, the Business Roundtable urged Congress to pass another coronavirus bailout “to alleviate the economic challenges millions of Americans are confronting,” including “targeted aid to struggling individuals and families that offer relief while also encouraging a return to work.” It has also issued statements recently about paid time off for voting, police reform and racial justice.Those are all worthy causes, but the group has done little about the one cause over which it has the most influence, if not outright control: workers’ economic insecurity.It’s an issue the Roundtable professes to care about. The group’s revised “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” released last summer and signed by 181 of its roughly 200 members, committed to serving all corporate stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers and communities. This was a strong break with the group’s traditions, upending a decades-old orthodoxy that corporations exist primarily to serve shareholders. “Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity,” the statement declared.What happens when hard work isn’t enough? There are a number of handy calculators, such as MIT’s and the Economic Policy Institute’s, that peg a living wage for a family of four residing in a small town at roughly $60,000 to $70,000 a year. That figure is considerably higher for workers living in pricey cities. Now consider that the average full-time production and nonsupervisory worker at an S&P 500 company earned just $41,442 last year, according to data compiled by the AFL-CIO.It’s not as if everyone in Corporate America is poorly compensated. Over the last decade, CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased more than $340,000 a year to an average of $14.8 million in 2019, according to the AFL-CIO. Wages for average workers at those same companies over the same period of time rose just $836 a year. That disparity is even more glaring at companies that furloughed workers this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The CEO of Burlington Stores Inc., for example, earned $35 million in 2019; workers there earned a median wage of $11,583. The CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. was paid $17.8 million; the company’s workers took home a median wage of $16,925.Let’s look at one of the most admired corporate giants, Amazon.com Inc. Its median total compensation for full-time employees was $36,640 in 2019, according to the company’s pay ratio disclosure. And Amazon’s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, is a prominent member of the Roundtable and signed its high-minded call to action last year.Amazon’s workers take home even less than the company’s median pay implies. Amazon annualizes compensation for employees who did not work the entire year without distinguishing between workers who left voluntarily and those who were laid off. It also includes the value of restricted stock the company grants them, which is typically worthless if workers don’t stay with the company for a specified period and meet certain performance hurdles. Restricted stock is nice, but it doesn’t put food on families’ tables.Amazon is far from alone. Walmart Inc. CEO Doug McMillon is also a Roundtable member and signed last year’s statement. The big-box retailer’s median worker pay was just $22,484 in fiscal year 2020, according to the company. You can add Target Corp.’s Brian Cornell, Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s Michael Hennigan, Home Depot Inc.’s Craig Menear and S&P Global Inc.’s Douglas Peterson to the list of Roundtable members with struggling workers.If the Roundtable wants to make a difference, its members should pay their workers an adequate wage. Had it done so earlier, efforts by Congress and the White House to craft another bailout wouldn’t be entangled by what we see as an irrelevant issue: wages.Legislators have let extended unemployment benefits lapse for America’s workers, with Republicans arguing that an extension of $600 a week in aid is a disincentive to work. Yet one of the core goals of the bailout is to support about 21 million unemployed Americans so they can afford basic necessities while Covid-19 ravages the economy. The only reason that skinflints in Washington can complain about benefits being higher than wages is because wages in our country are at shameful, rock-bottom levels. As long as companies insist on paying workers less than a living wage, adequate assistance will necessarily amount to more money.A recent Yale University study found no evidence that people receiving higher unemployment payments were less likely to return to work. Nevertheless, Republicans have proposed reducing supplemental unemployment insurance to $200 a week through September, after which total unemployment benefits would be capped at 70% of lost wages. Again: 70% of an already sub-standard wage isn’t adequate, particularly for workers in notoriously low-wage industries such as retail and hospitality that have been hardest hit by Covid-19.It’s not clear what the Roundtable can do about many of the social and political issues it has weighed in on recently. But its members can pay their workers better wages. Those employees get up and go to work every day like everyone else, and most of them are still falling well short of earning an adequate living.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

2020-08-11,"Home Depot (NYSE: HD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $276.93 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: NEUTRAL  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $300.00  * Volume: 974  * Open Interest: 20473 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-14,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.U.S. stocks continue to climb the wall of worry as earnings reports continue to come in across Wall Street. The big broad market news this week was that the S&P 500 almost set a new high, before a modest pullback on Thursday.That said, earnings season at the end of July certainly has been a contributor. Big beats from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) boosted both the S&P and the NASDAQ Composite in late July, and the momentum has continued this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn turn, earnings next week have the potential to keep that rally going -- or stop it in its tracks. The slate is led by the world's largest retailers. There isn't a better group to test the strength of the consumer in the U.S., and elsewhere.With tech stocks facing valuation concerns after leading the rally from March lows, the market might need broader optimism to keep driving higher. The companies reporting next week have the ability to drive that kind of optimism, or raise concerns about consumer spending that could lead more investors to question the impressive resilience of U.S. stocks.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Simply put, this looks like a big week. And with that in mind, here are the seven biggest earnings reports to watch:  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)  * Target (NYSE:TGT)  * TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX)  * Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)  * Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)So, let's dive in and see what to expect. Earnings Reports to Watch: Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Aug. 18, before market openThe importance of Walmart earnings to the market is obvious, as the company remains the country's largest retailer. And given its omnichannel strength, there isn't a better barometer of overall consumer confidence than Walmart.However, this is a big report for WMT stock as well. Currently just above $130, shares are facing resistance that has held repeatedly going back to April. The enormous rally in Amazon stock suggests that the market, for now, is pricing greater market share for Walmart's biggest rival (though Amazon Web Services admittedly is a factor as well).That said, Walmart's numbers need to show that it can keep pace in this unprecedented environment -- and that its massive brick-and-mortar footprint is an asset, not a liability. And there is a potential catalyst if the company can finally give details on its long-awaited &quot;Amazon Prime killer&quot;, Walmart+. WMT stock soared on reports of an imminent launch, but more recent reports suggest further delays.Overall, big numbers and commentary on Walmart+ suggest that WMT stock can finally bust through resistance. In turn, this suggests that Walmart could catch up with the sizzling online retail space. Anything less, however, and a retreat seems likely. Home Depot (HD)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Aug. 18, before market openHome Depot has a high bar to clear with its fiscal second-quarter report on Tuesday morning. Analysts are looking for a big quarter, with double-digit gains in both revenue and earnings. Meanwhile, HD stock is roaring into the release: it's now gained 28.6% year-to-date, and has doubled from March lows.That performance seems surprising. Indeed, I argued toward the end of last year that investors were underestimating the company's cyclical risk.That case looked prescient in March. But since then, the market has priced in faster growth on the thesis that the novel coronavirus pandemic will lead to an exodus from the cities, higher homeownership and thus, more demand for home improvement products and services. That's been enough for investors to look past possible near-term impacts from higher unemployment and negative macroeconomic growth.  * 5 Marijuana Stocks to Buy For A &quot;Blue Wave&quot; Election So, with HD stock now trading at 26-times next year's consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate, the company needs to support the bull case with a big Q2 report. Continued strength relative to rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), which reports the following day, would help as well. After this rally, investors seem unlikely to give the company a pass if revenue or earnings fall short of expectations. Earnings Reports to Watch: Sea Limited (SE)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Aug. 18, before market openWith the exception of a number of Chinese e-commerce plays, earnings next week are light on tech stocks. Sea Limited, however, creates an interesting test case for the sector -- particularly ahead of a number of releases from software companies in the coming weeks.SE stock, after all, has been perhaps the best stock of the last two years. It's rallied just about 1,000% since the beginning of 2019. Certainly, a few stocks have done better. But among mid- to large-cap names, SE stock has probably the best stock to own. Even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has gained &quot;just&quot; 415% over the same period.Unsurprisingly, though, that rally has created valuation concerns. SE stock has a market capitalization of about $54 billion, and trailing twelve-month revenue just above  $2.5 billion. The company also isn't profitable, or all that close, with analysts expecting an adjusted loss over $1 per share even next year. At the same time, as our Matt McCall detailed last month, it also has one of the best stories in the market.In short, SE stock is one of the archetypal growth stocks in this market. And with some of those names showing fatigue of late -- SE stock itself has pulled back 14% from the highs -- the response to Tuesday morning's release could be a harbinger of what's ahead for other dearly-valued names. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Aug. 19, before market openWalmart earnings are going to dominate the headlines in retail. But, for a number of reasons, Target's report actually looks like it might be more interesting.First, Target stock -- unlike WMT -- is racing into the release after breaking out of two months of range-bound trading to all-time highs. Secondly, Target's fundamental performance actually hasn't been that impressive of late.Most notably, Target's holiday numbers disappointed, with same-store sales rising just 1.4%. In turn, TGT stock dropped 8%. First-quarter earnings also declined, though the pandemic obviously pressured the second half of the quarter.  * 3 of the Smartest Defense Stocks to Buy Now To be sure, Target's digital business impressed, and it's on that business that investors are betting right now. Nonetheless, a third-straight quarter of soft performance likely will lead many of those investors to take some chips off the table. Earnings Reports to Watch: TJX Companies (TJX)Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Aug. 19, before market openInvestors have given TJX the benefit of the doubt. Despite significant pressure from the pandemic, and minimal online presence, TJX stock is down just under 5% so far this year.To be sure, the company's HomeGoods nameplate likely has helped. The bankruptcy of Tuesday Morning (OTCMKTS:TUESQ) should limit or remove competition in a number of markets. The same home improvement tailwind boosting HD and LOW likely is a factor, as well. Indeed, rival Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) -- an off-price pure-play which releases its fiscal Q2 numbers on Thursday afternoon -- has seen its stock drop 19% so far in 2020.That said, the performance of TJX so far this year sets up an important report on Wednesday morning, while Ross clearly has an opportunity to change the narrative surrounding its stock. But even for investors with no position in either company, the reports should be closely watched. After all, these are two of the best brick-and-mortar operators in the country. So if customers are willing to go back into stores, T.J. Maxx and Ross likely are near the top of the list.Therefore, good numbers from these retailers should bode well for smaller and/or more challenged retailers with earnings in coming weeks. But if TJX and Ross can't deliver, it will be tough to have confidence in offline performance from the rest of the industry. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Aug. 19, after market closeOne of the more interesting questions in this market going forward is: what price are investors willing to pay for quality? The answer so far has been: a higher one. Apple has hit a $2 trillion market cap, while Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) keep rallying. So if the investment case comes down to quality or valuation, investors continue to choose quality.That same trend has held for Nvidia, whose stock has more than doubled just since March. As a result, the stock trades for 46x next year's earnings. That's not necessarily a huge multiple by the current standards of tech, but it's an unprecedented valuation for a somewhat mature chip stock. And it comes despite the fact that Nvidia's earnings growth hasn't yet kicked into high gear after the crypto bubble burst in late 2018.That trading makes the response to Nvidia's earnings interesting for the space. And particularly, for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is blowing through valuation worries of its own. Overall, though, Nvidia also has a chance to cement its dominance of the sector. With Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunging after yet another launch delay, Nvidia is now the most-valuable U.S. semiconductor maker.  * 7 Penny Stocks That Will Struggle to Survive 2020 So, if the company can deliver a blowout quarter -- particularly in datacenter -- there will be no debate as to which is the better business going forward. And recent history suggests that alone can drive NVDA stock even higher. Earnings Reports to Watch: Alibaba (BABA)Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Aug. 20, before market openIt's a big week for Chinese e-commerce plays. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) kicks off the week with its Q2 release on Monday morning, and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) closes it on Friday before the open. In between, the company's dominant retailer reports.Interestingly, all three stocks have stalled out since the beginning of July. It's possible that the group has been hurt by a rotation into U.S. e-commerce names, as the likes of Amazon, Wayfair (NYSE:W) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) have soared after earnings.Political pressure may also be a factor, given continued sabre-rattling from President Donald Trump's administration, this time over TikTok.Whatever the cause, the Chinese plays certainly have the opportunity to catch up with their American counterparts with big releases next week.

2020-08-14,"Investors have pushed Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) stock returns well above the broader market this year, which is no shock given that consumer spending has surged in its home improvement retailing niche.  Lowe's will reveal in its earnings report on Wednesday, Aug. 19, whether those market share gains continued into the second quarter.

2020-08-14,"As a big picture investment idea, you can't do much better than Home Depot (NYSE:HD). As a hardware and home maintenance retailer, Home Depot is a needed commodity in any market, bull or bear. This resiliency underlining Home Depot stock has proven itself yet again during the novel coronavirus pandemic.Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com Sure, people flocked to Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stores when the coronavirus first struck and it made sense: you can't live without food, water, and convenient hand sanitizer packages.However, many of us - including yours truly - discovered that items that we necessarily can't eat nevertheless play a vital role in our comfort and in a real sense, our safety.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore, I haven't been surprised that Home Depot stock has steadily marched higher since its March lows. But ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, it's fair to consider the other side of the coin.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListYes, HD received a shot of relevancy during the peak of this crisis. As well, other potential crises - particularly the record-breaking hurricane season - should theoretically lift Home Depot stock. But back in March, people had more money to work with. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to exact a toll on our country, those collective funds have been negatively impacted.Further, the deadlock in Congress about extending pandemic-related relief to millions of desperate Americans raise concern, not only for Home Depot stock but for other retail names. At one point, many workers were making more money staying at home than they did actually working. Surely, this supported consumer spending.Now, without that vital support, a dark cloud hangs over the labor force. It's not as if every HD customer is well off. Unusual Housing Dynamics for Home Depot StockObviously, with a name like Home Depot stock, the security moves on major developments in the housing market. In this case, HD generally moves higher when it's a seller's market. This makes sense because higher home prices indicate greater demand, which in turn benefits HD's valuation.Of course, this trend has its limits. If there is too much demand, meaning that inventory is constrained, the shift toward HD wouldn't be sustainable. A classic example is the housing crisis which eventually led to the Great Recession.Further, between 2012 to 2018, the price of Home Depot stock shared a strong direct correlation with the monthly supply of houses in the U.S. (which the government measures as the ratio of houses for sale versus houses sold). In other words, as home supply increased (to reasonable levels), so too did HD shares.But from the beginning of 2019, we saw an abrupt change to this relationship. Instead of a direct correlation, we now have an inverse relationship: as one metric goes up, the other slides down. Nowhere is this new dynamic more evident than it is during this crisis.  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto In April, the housing supply ratio jumped to 6.8, a multi-year high. At the time, Home Depot stock averaged $218.53. Jump ahead to June and the housing supply is down to 4.7 and HD shares traded at $249.This tells me that demand for home furnishings, repair and remodeling is strong - with a dearth of inventory, what else are current homeowners going to do?Looking back at history, until the housing supply ratio reaches unsustainable levels, perhaps at ratios seen during the last housing crisis, the bullishness in HD stock will likely continue. Again, there's really nothing that prospective home buyers can do. Divisive Politics Can Be a Surprising CatalystStill, the big wildcard is the economy. Unless the U.S. government can get its act together and present viable solutions, we may face a catastrophe. You only need to look at the rising prices of precious metals to understand the fear investors have.As well, the political divisiveness isn't helping matters. But on some levels, it's a positive catalyst for Home Depot stock. Primarily, President Donald Trump has every incentive to throw anything and everything at the struggling economy. If it's sickly by election day, he's toast and he knows it.On the other hand, Wall Street seems to have a love affair with the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket. Thus, even if Trump loses, that could also be positive for HD stock.Given the strange dynamics of the new normal, I'd say that Home Depot looks good into 2021. And even if disaster strikes again, it's reasonable to have confidence in HD. It's been proven reliable during the worst of times and hopefully, this pandemic should prove no different.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. reported sales growth that was more than double the already brisk rate analysts had been expecting, but rising expenses meant flat margins in an otherwise standout quarter.Same-store sales rose 23.4%, sharply beating the estimate for an 11.4% gain from Consensus Metrix. Revenue of $38.1 billion also surpassed expectations. The gain was driven by both higher average customer checks and more transactions, meaning more shoppers bought from Home Depot in the quarter and they spent more every time they came in. Comparable sales in August are at similar levels to the past quarter, executives said on a call with analysts.In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said consumers “are spending less on travel and entertainment and restaurants and are spending more on where they’re spending most of their time -- which is the home.”But even though Americans have been opening their wallets on home improvement during the pandemic, the retailer has also faced higher costs to serve those customers. Selling, general and administrative costs jumped 26% in the quarter, with Morgan Stanley’s Simeon Gutman noting the company is spending more than anticipated on virus-related costs and benefits.Like many companies during the pandemic, Home Depot suspended its full-year forecast in May due to widespread uncertainty around Covid-19 and its impact on the broader economy.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. home construction starts increased in July by more than forecast and applications to build surged by the most in three decades, indicating builders are responding to robust housing demand fueled by record-low interest rates.Residential starts jumped by 22.6%, the most since October 2016, to a 1.5 million annualized rate from a month earlier, according to a government report released Tuesday. That compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 1.25 million and followed an upwardly revised 1.22 million in June.Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, increased 18.8%, the most since January 1990. The 1.5 million rate of permits topped the median estimate for 1.33 million and is now above the February pre-pandemic rate. An S&P homebuilders index rose in early trade, while the broader S&P 500 also improved on optimism about the economy.The housing market has been a bright spot for the economic recovery as low mortgage rates help make buying a home more affordable. The latest data highlight that rebound, while more recent figures suggest the trend will continue, with a measure of homebuilder sentiment jumping in August to match the highest on record.“Record low mortgage rates and demand from families looking for more space is fueling the market and is more than offsetting the downward influence of labor market turmoil,” Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, Inc., said in a note.Still, the housing market, as well as the broader economy, is not without its challenges. The jobless rate remains elevated and Congress has yet to pass a new stimulus package to support small businesses and the unemployed.The government report Tuesday showed single-family starts rose to a 940,000 annualized rate, the fastest since February. Multifamily starts, a category that tends to be volatile and includes apartment buildings and condominiums, surged 58.4% to a 556,000 pace. The monthly increase was the largest since January 2011.Single-family permits increased 17% to a 983,000 rate, the strongest since February. The number of residential projects authorized but not yet started also advanced, to 101,000 in July, the biggest backlog since the end of 2018.The resilient housing market and stronger home improvement spending was evident in Home Depot Inc.’s latest results. The retailer reported sales growth that was double expectations, prompting Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear to call the performance “record-breaking.”At the same time, builders may face some headwinds in the coming months as building costs increase. Lumber prices are at the highest on record and may keep climbing given millions of tiny beetles are destroying the world’s timber supplies. The beetles have already destroyed 15 years of log supplies in British Columbia, enough trees to build 9 million single-family homes.The government’s report showed starts rose in all four regions. In the South, new construction was the strongest since February, while starts in the Midwest improved to their best pace of the year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Housing Starts Surge by Most Since 2016 and Permits Climb

Walmart's dedication to building out its online ordering infrastructure served it well, with 2Q e-commerce sales up 97%.

Walmart's Sam's Club also saw a 60% increase in new members in the quarter, as America looks for bargains during the fiscal uncertainty of COVID. Home Depot also saw a massive increase in demand, with same-store sales in the second quarter up 23.4%, and the average ticket up 10.1%.

2020-08-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Long after the spring spike of pandemic-related pantry loading and panic buying, Walmart Inc. is still benefiting from all the ways Covid-19 has reshaped consumer needs and spending patterns. And yet, even as the mega-retailer unveiled another strong quarterly performance, the underpinnings of its results should serve as a wake-up call to Washington: More government stimulus is urgently needed because it was crucial to keeping consumers off the sidelines this summer.    Walmart  reported Tuesday that U.S. comparable sales rose 9.3% from a year earlier in the period ended July 31, far surpassing analysts’ estimates. The growth was powered by its e-commerce division, where sales jumped 97% from a year earlier, with both pickup and delivery options notching all-time high sales volumes. The robust growth also reflected a 27% increase in average ticket, or the total bill, as people consolidated their shopping into fewer trips.  While Walmart continued to see healthy growth in its grocery segment, an important component of its battle with Amazon.com Inc,  its strongest sales increases in the U.S. division were in general merchandise, with shoppers shelling out for sporting goods, gardening gear and electronics. Home Depot Inc. also appeared to benefit from consumers sprucing up their houses and yards, reporting a blockbuster 23% increase in comparable sales in the quarter. But at Walmart, even clothing – which generally has been one of the bleakest categories in the retail industry –  saw increased sales.  In earnings materials, Walmart cited the importance of government stimulus multiple times, saying it buoyed results at both its namesake stores and its Sam’s Club chain. The company said that consumers having that money in their wallets helped power sales in high-margin general-merchandise categories, meaning it supported both revenue growth and profitability. The company said “as stimulus funds tapered off, sales started to normalize.” For Walmart, “normalizing” still made for quite healthy business; executives said U.S. comparable sales were up 4% in July. But the implications here should be crystal clear. With soaring unemployment and the pandemic nowhere near under control, stimulus money was essential to keeping spending from drying up, and thus to keeping the bottom from falling out of the economy. Walmart deserves credit for managing well through a time of extreme volatility. This is evident in the fact that it managed to deliver an increase in gross margin in the quarter even as it fulfilled far more online orders. Walmart will likely continue to hold up reasonably well as long as this public health crisis remains. Household essentials and groceries will continue to be in high demand while people are stuck at home. The retailer also typically is fairly resilient in a recession, given that it is known for low prices.  But the pattern that it described – of consumers splurging in the early months of the quarter when they had stimulus money in hand, and retreating later – could be devastating for retailers that are more concentrated in discretionary categories such as apparel. Kohl’s Corp., for example, reported Tuesday that revenue fell 23% in the quarter from a year earlier. I shudder to think what its back-to-school and holiday results could look like if unemployment remains elevated and consumers don’t soon get some relief.  Walmart showed its operational and merchandising might in the quarter. But I hope Washington sees the results for what they are: a blaring alarm that it needs to do more to keep consumers afloat.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-08-18,"Close but no cigar--that's the summary of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) action Monday. Nice rally, but the SPX finished a few points shy of the record closing level of 3386. Some say the market might need a new catalyst to close above the old record. Well, this morning could have brought that in the form of very solid earnings from two of the biggest U.S. retailers--Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD). It looks like we'll have an opportunity here and the market could flirt with that record high at the open. A new high close for the SPX--if it happens--is always meaningful. However, some might say that's a little less true this time because part of it remains, where else can people go to put their money? Low rates and lack of yield anywhere else has steered many people into stocks, which probably isn't news to anyone after all this time.The &quot;new-high&quot; media coverage has been breathless, but is it warranted? After all, the SPX is just a number. For many, the larger issue is what a new high in the broad-based benchmark says about the state of the recovery, investor sentiment, and the look ahead to what will hopefully be greener pastures in 2021. Will we get there this week? Perhaps, but then what? Obviously, people are trading thousands of different stocks, not just the index, but caution could be creeping in at a higher level as the SPX approaches this area up around 3390, after bottoming below 2200 intraday less than five months ago. That didn't stop the Nasdaq (COMP) from notching another record high on Monday--its 33rd of 2020. With headlines focused on record highs, some investors might be worried about whether things have come too far, too fast. As we noted yesterday, a few technical indicators point toward overbought conditions.And then there are fundamentals. We might need a new fundamental catalyst to take things higher with earnings season just about over. Walmart, Home Depot Bring Home the Q2 Bacon WMT just crushed it, with earnings and revenue that easily topped Wall Street's expectations. One really amazing aspect of WMT's earnings came on the e-commerce side, which nearly doubled with a meteoric 97% rise in the U.S. during the quarter. U.S. same-store sales rose 9.3%, a huge amount for a company that's so well established.All this points to WMT handling the crisis very well with its online capabilities, curbside pickup, supply chain strategy, and product mix. It also might have benefited from being considered an &quot;essential&quot; business that was allowed to keep its doors open during the worst of the pandemic. The solid WMT quarter also might reinforce ideas that consumers weren't all in dire shape in Q2, despite so many people suffering job losses. The question is how the rest of the year might shape up for WMT and other big-box stores. WMT didn't offer guidance, and that might be why shares pulled back a bit after initially rocketing higher in pre-market trading. Their call is probably the place to check for investors who want to hear more about the outlook for retail.Home Depot (HD) was the other big retailer with impressive earnings this morning, and in its case, investors rewarded shares with 2% pre-market gains. Earnings and revenue easily exceeded the Street's expectations, and U.S. same-store sales rose an astonishing 25%. People have time--that's what it comes down to. People had an extra hour in their days thanks to not commuting, so it looks like they used it to start all those home projects they'd been putting off. Once earnings are out of the way, the &quot;dog days of summer&quot; could help volatility continue its retreat. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been tiptoeing toward the 20 mark in recent weeks, edging its way down as company news goes into a lull. It recently traded below 21.5, a level it last saw in February (see chart below). That being said, an absence of corporate and Fed news could leave more space for geopolitical noise to get peoples' attention.An Earnings Post-Mortem, and a Look at 2021 Optimism Earnings were better than expected in Q2, with about 83% of companies reporting a positive surprise, according to research firm FactSet. Still, the forward price-to-earnings ratios are out of whack vs. historic norms for just about every sector. This could be explained partly by the current low interest rates and the Fed's reluctance to raise them for what looks like years ahead. It also might be based on ideas that things could get better in 2021 as vaccines potentially come into use, though there's no certainty there, of course. A lot of analysts have basically washed their hands of 2020 earnings and have their eyes on next year's possible results. For calendar year 2021, analysts predict S&P 500 earnings growth of 26.5%, according to FactSet. If that's the case (and we're a long way from finding out) it could potentially help push valuations closer to what people are used to. However, it's not likely to take the P/E down too much. Right now, the forward 12-month price-to-earnings level is around 22, vs. the historic average of 15, FactSet noted. Even if 2021 earnings grow by FactSet's predicted 26%, P/E would be around 18, based on where the SPX is now. And that's if the SPX spends the next year marching in place, which investors know seldom happens. Long story short: It looks like the SPX has done a really good job over the last six months building in an optimistic scenario. However, if things don't go well with the pandemic, or if the U.S. election sparks controversy, or if China trade relations worsen, or if a whole bunch of other things happen, those overbought technicals might start looking like they had some merit. We'll have to watch and wait, but all of this is more reason investors need to be careful about their portfolio balances and not let any particular investment area get over-stretched beyond their individual comfort levels.CHART OF THE DAY: FEBRUARY IN AUGUST? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX--candlestock) recently traded under 22, a level last seen in February. That happens to be around the same time the S&P 500 Index (SPX--purple line) was at current levels, as well. Go figure! Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe Global Markets.

From Peak to Near-Peak: Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of the SPX posting its all-time high close of 3386. The index has been flirting with that mark the last week or so, which raises the question how did we get here? In other words, it might be helpful to look at which sub-sectors of the S&P performed best since the pre-pandemic high, and which did worst.It probably won't shock anyone to hear that over the last six months, the best two S&P 500 sub-sectors were Internet Retail (up 40.4%) and Technology/Hardware/Storage (up 36.6%). Companies in the gold business also did just fine in these times of concern, rising 36.1%. Air Freight & Logistics and Interactive Home Entertainment rounded out the top five, according to research firm CFRA. The worst performers included a 58.6% drop for Oil and Gas Drilling, and a 53% decline for Department stores. The department store sector comes into the spotlight this week as many retailers report earnings, so we'll see if the hard times continued as reopening got underway across much of the economy. Mortgage REITS, Textiles, and Airlines were the other worst-performing sub-sectors since February.Networking Opportunity? NVDA About to Report: Any list of the year's top performers so far has to include the semiconductor space, and few companies have done as well in the market as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the company--expected to report tomorrow after the close--were up 107% year-to-date as of earlier this week. In one sense, it's switched places with competitor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). Shares of AMD aren't exactly stragglers, of course, up 79% so far this year. However, last year it was AMD that went up triple-digits while NVDA investors had to settle for a mere double-digit gain.Basically, these and other chip stocks continue to benefit from people working at home. That includes many peoples' kids, stuck doing school remotely now that the academic year is underway. This raises the need for data, web services, and internet storage. A lot of other things are contributing to NVDA's market success, including excitement about the recent closing of an acquisition that analysts believe might help its networking capabilities and troubles at competitor Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). The company is also known as a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) business. GPUs are specialized electronic circuits used extensively by the video game industry and in some business applications.Caution Flag: One thing to keep in mind heading into NVDA earnings--something you often see for any company that's been going gangbusters in the market--is that any kind of miss, either on earnings and revenue or in a specific business area, might set NVDA shares up for some softness. The market is basically pricing in perfection from this company and the sector in general, and you can see how investors punish firms that don't meet expectations (check out INTC's plunge last month after earnings). If you've owned NVDA during this amazing rally, good for you. Just understand that although the company is doing well, the share price also reflects optimism for the future in a sector that's had its ups and downs lately.

2020-08-19,"Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) was one of several major retailers to report blowout second-quarter earnings this week, sending the home improvement stock soaring.Home Depot posted second-quarter EPS of $4.02 on $38.05 billion in revenue Tuesday. Both numbers topped consensus analyst estimates of $3.71 and $34.53 billion, respectively. Revenue was 23.4% higher year-over-year.U.S. same-store sales rose 25%, and Home Depot's average purchase amount was up 10.1%. It was the first quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth for Home Depot in more than seven years.Several analysts weighed in on the stock following the impressive print. Long-Term Tailwinds For Home Depot: BofA Securities analyst Elizabeth Suzuki said it's not too late to buy Home Depot shares to capitalize on the shelter-in-place environment.&quot;Although home improvement spending in the coming quarter may decelerate amidst sequentially declining government stimulus/unemployment benefits, we believe that the longer-term tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable,&quot; the analyst said in a Wednesday upgrade note. Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman said Home Depot is a best-in-class home improvement investment, adding that the housing market has structural, long-term tailwinds.&quot;In Q3, we assume comps moderate from mid-20s in the first two weeks of August to 20% in the last two weeks of August, followed by 13% in September and 7% in October,&quot; the analyst said. Home Depot's Market Share Opportunity: Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock said investors shouldn't be turned off by Home Depot's size given that the company still has meaningful market share opportunities.&quot;Bigger picture, we see Home Depot as the best-in-class retailer in an effective duopoly, one which should benefit from macro tailwinds for at least the balance of this year,&quot; the analyst said. View more earnings on HDKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas said trends in &quot;nesting&quot; industries remain strong.&quot;We believe HD's results bode favorably for the industry's 6-12 month outlook and align with our Nesting thesis that home spending will continue to take share of wallet from areas such as travel and entertainment,&quot; the analyst said. Home Depot Ratings, Price Targets: BofA Securities upgraded Home Depot from Neutral to Buy and raised the price objective from $290 to $330.

2020-08-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic has thrown the entire retail industry a curve ball. Target Corp., though, is among the elite players in the industry that knows what to do with a difficult pitch. The big-box giant recorded an eye-popping 24% increase in comparable sales from a year earlier, far higher than the 9% advance analysts had estimated and its all-time highest quarterly gain on that measure. Online sales soared 195%, including strong increases in its drive-up and pickup options. Meanwhile, comparable sales in its brick-and-mortar stores boomed 10.9%. Many shoppers have adapted to the Covid-19 era by gravitating toward stores where they can do one-stop shopping. In some cases, they may have been pushed in this direction initially by circumstance, when local mandates forced the closure of non-essential retailers. Others are consolidating their trips out of a preference to avoid crowds and protect their health. That change in behavior has clearly been a boon for Target. The retailer said Wednesday that it gained market share in categories such as electronics, where sales rose more than 70% from a year earlier, and apparel, where it notched “double-digit” sales growth. It is noteworthy that Target scored that strong clothing sales growth, along with a greater-than-30% sales increase in its home goods division, in the same quarter that Kohl’s Corp. —  which has similar price points but more specialized focus — saw revenue plunge 23%. Target’s average ticket — a measure gauging the sales amount per receipt —  rose 18.8% in the quarter, another clear sign that people are doing more big stock-up trips when they hit up the retailer’s stores and website. There are signs elsewhere of the shift toward consolidated shopping visits. When Home Depot Inc. reported blockbuster earnings results on Tuesday, executives said their research showed consumers were visiting fewer and fewer retailers, and they believed that pattern was resulting in increased interest on its website in categories such as home decor and textiles.This is not to say that Target is just passively benefiting from weird, unforeseen shifts in consumer behavior.  It has been laying the groundwork for the rise in e-commerce and curbside pickup for years, enabling it to meet the explosion in the trend amid the pandemic. The chain has methodically been rolling out pickup counters and drive-up lanes at its stores for retrieving online orders. The idea was that this format would prove popular with consumers because it could be speedier than doorstep delivery, and it would be better for Target’s bottom line than e-commerce models where it shipped packages to customers’ homes.  So when the pandemic brought on a crush of interest in drive-up and pickup orders as people tried to stay away from stores but wanted goods quickly, Target was relatively well-positioned to respond. Target said it added 10 million new digital customers in the first half of the year.  If it can make habitual shoppers out of even a fraction of those people, that bodes well for the long-term health of its e-commerce business. Target also has invested heavily in sprucing up its apparel and home offerings to make them more trendy, positioning that had already made it a credible challenger to the likes of Macy’s Inc. or TJX Cos.  That work certainly helped drive its sales growth in the quarter, as customers who might have needed to visit Target for household essentials would have seen a well-curated and well-designed selection of goods in these more discretionary categories.In a testament to the resilience of Target’s model, it managed to increase its gross margin in the quarter to 30.9% even as it plowed money into increased labor expenses necessitated by the demands of the pandemic. Target’s booming sales — and its ability to keep a lid on discounting —  were enough to offset that challenge to profitability. The pandemic has had a dramatic effect on major retailers, revealing the weak to be even more vulnerable than before and making the dominant ones appear even more untouchable. Target is certainly in the latter category, with this moment of massive upheaval serving to fortify, and even increase, its market share. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-08-19,"Shares of Lowe's Companies  rallied 1.6% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal second-quarter profit and sales that rose well above expectations, boosted by a consumer focus on the home, repair and maintenance activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2020-08-20,"The pandemic restricted people to their homes and many made the best of this opportunity by remodeling their homes and taking up pending home improvement projects. The recent blockbuster results of home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe’s clearly indicated the shift in consumers' discretionary spending from apparel buying and restaurant dining to home goods.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will place the two home retailers alongside each other to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity right now.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot, which operates 2,293 stores, benefited immensely from the rise in demand from DIY (do-it-yourself) customers as they took up deck building, painting, and home repairs amid the pandemic. Sales to Pro customers grew double digits.The company’s sales for the fiscal second quarter (ended August 2) rose 23.4% to $38.1 billion as overall comparable sales or comps surged 23.4% with US comps growing 25%. Notably, 13 of the company’s 14 merchandising departments generated double-digit comps while the kitchen and bath department comps increased by high single-digit.Strong sales drove a 26.8% growth in the EPS to $4.02, even as the company incurred $480 million in additional expenses amid the pandemic.Strength in several big-ticket categories, like, appliances, riding lawnmowers and Patio Furniture, was partially offset by softer sales in certain indoor installation categories, like special-order kitchens and countertops.Home Depot says it will continue to enhance its online channel. Sales through digital platforms surged about 100% in the second quarter supported by facilities like buy online and pick up in-store.The company now plans to open three new distribution centers in Georgia over the next 18 months to facilitate flexible delivery and pick-up options for Pro and DIY customers.Home Depot indicated that the momentum in comparable sales growth in the first two weeks of August was at levels similar to the second quarter. The company expects increasing demand from Pro customers as markets continue to reopen.On August 19, Merrill Lynch analyst Elizabeth Suzuki upgraded Home Depot to Buy from Hold and said that it is not too late to buy the stock. Suzuki raised the price target to $330 from $290.“Although home improvement spending in the coming quarter may decelerate amidst sequentially declining government stimulus/unemployment benefits, we believe that the longer-term tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable,&quot; the analyst opined. (See HD’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Home Depot stock has risen 29.5% year-to-date and an average 12-month price target of $309.90 reflects a further upside of 9.56%. The Strong Buy consensus for Home Depot stock is based on 17 Buys and 5 Holds.Lowe’s (LOW)          Like its larger peer Home Depot, Lowe’s also experienced impressive sales growth in the fiscal second quarter, in fact at an even higher rate. Lowe’s sales grew 30.1% Y/Y to $27.3 billion. Overall comps rose 34.2% with US comps growth coming at 35.1%. Online penetration grew to 8% of the top line with sales through Lowes.com rising 135%.Lowe's experienced an unprecedented growth of 20% across all its merchandise categories as customers spent more time at their homes due to the pandemic and focused on enhancing their homes, creating work and study space, and repair and maintenance projects. Pro comps growth in the second quarter was in the mid-20s but was outpaced by DIY comps.Lowe’s second-quarter adjusted EPS grew by an impressive 74.4% Y/Y to $3.75. Higher sales and margin expansion drove the bottom-line growth. Lowe’s, which operates 1,968 stores, incurred $460 million in COVID-19 related expenses, including incremental wages in the second quarter.To address the spike in demand for home improvement goods and boost its sales, Lowe’s plans to enhance its product offerings, simplify its stores and provide better services. The company is also investing in supply chain infrastructure and prioritizing omnichannel capabilities.Indeed, LOW plans to open 50 cross-dock delivery terminals, seven bulk distribution centers and four e-commerce fulfillment centers over the next 18 months.Lowe’s has a smaller exposure to Pro customers compared to Home Depot. The company intends to deepen its relationship with Pro customers through several initiatives, including the multi-year nationwide roll-out of a tool rental program. (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks)Lowe's did not provide any specific guidance due to the uncertain business environment but stated that the sales trends in July continued in August with strength across DIY and Pro customers.Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel reiterated his Buy rating for Lowe’s and raised the price target to $185 from $150.Nagel said, “For a while, we have highlighted Lowe’s as one of the most compelling larger cap names in our expansive coverage universe, owing to a favorable industry backdrop, limited price competition, and the efforts of new senior leadership to improve performance and ultimately narrow a long-standing operating gap between LOW and Home Depot (HD).”Following the results, all 21 analysts covering Lowe’s stock have a Buy rating, implying a unanimous Strong Buy consensus. Lowe’s stock has advanced 32% so far this year. An average price target of $166.24 reflects an upside of 5.03% over the next 12-months.Choosing between two good retailersBoth Home Depot and Lowe’s have proved their strength through their latest results. Unlike several companies who suspended dividend payments, both Home Depot and Lowe's continued to reward investors with dividends amid the crisis.Analysts expect continued strength in the home category to benefit these companies. But with the entire Street bullish on Lowe’s, it looks to be a better buy currently. Moreover, Lowe’s is trading at a lower valuation compared to Home Depot.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-21,"When I finished my last article about Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), I was wondering when PLUG stock would hit $20. And that was after I said it was ready to plow through $10.Source: petrmalinak / Shutterstock.com Well, I wrote about Plug Power on July 15. And at the time, it was trading around $9. That said, not only has it moved a buck higher over the past month, but it's also climbed to nearly $12.80 as of this writing -- within $1.55 of its 52-week high. You have to go back to 2008 to find a higher share price.Overall, Plug Power is riding the wave of alternative energy popularity. But, can it last long enough for PLUG stock to hit $20?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think it can, but it likely won't be until some time next year. And here's why. The Markets Are FrothyForbes senior contributor Rob Isbitts, whose day job is managing money for high net worth investors, recently discussed why the markets appear to be quite frothy and vulnerable to a correction.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now That said, Isbitts uses the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) to explain why he feels this way. As you're aware, the DJIA consists of just 30 blue-chip American stocks. In 2020, through Aug. 13, 10 stocks were in positive territory -- with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the way, all up more than 29%. Unfortunately, of the 20 stocks that are down for the year, nine of them are down more than 18%. I've always held the belief that if you have a 30-stock portfolio, over the long haul, you want 60% of them to make money.However, more importantly, you want the 18 stocks to deliver an average annualized total return that is double the average of the 10 losers. And overall, meeting this standard ensures market-beating performance.But, I digress. Isbitts believes non-tech names are going to start catching up to the performance of tech stocks. Then, reality is going to set in with investors coming to grips with the fact the rally was nothing more than a &quot;fingers crossed, Fed-liquidity-induced rally&quot; -- and that's when the current rally will likely come to an end. Now, I'm paraphrasing, of course, but you get the drift. The markets are looking good because individual pockets of the economy are delivering gangbuster results leading to supersized returns.As this relates to PLUG stock, it's up 309.2% year to date -- more than 50 times the return of the S&P 500. From a valuation perspective, Plug Power currently is trading at almost 15 times sales, about five times its five-year average. I'm as bullish on Plug Power's prospects as the next person, but that's a screaming signal PLUG stock has gotten ahead of itself. Sometimes, I like to say that quality companies grow into their valuations. And despite Plug Power doing a lot right in its goal to hit $1 billion in sales by 2024, it hasn't quite gotten to the point where valuation permanently detaches from reality. Meanwhile, that is probably the case for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), another innovator I'm bullish about. Therefore, if the markets correct over the final four-and-a-half months, you can almost be guaranteed; PLUG stock will fall back below $10. And if you genuinely believe in the long-term prospects of the company, like Warren Buffett, you should welcome this opportunity to buy more of its stock at a more reasonable valuation.  If Not 2020, When Will Plug Stock Hit $20?Not having a crystal ball, I would say some time in the second half of 2021. However, that will likely only happen if its share price remains in double digits. Any protracted retreat between now and the end of the year -- based on a market correction along with less-than-stellar quarterly results -- would make the wall of worry too difficult to overcome, in my opinion.Almost unanimously, those of us who've written about Plug Power for InvestorPlace in recent months has been optimistic about its prospects. About the only one to strike a defensive tone is Chris Lau, who argued in early August that investors should take profits before the stock falls back to earth:&quot;Without earnings, investors should still treat the stock as a speculative bet. Plug Power needs to reverse negative operating margins and post positive returns on assets. Until then, the stock will rely on analyst upgrades and deal news to move higher,&quot; Lau wrote. Additionally, Lau also mentioned that Plug Power has a history of selling its stock to raise capital when shares are popping, and analysts are raising target prices, something that's currently happening. He even points out that CEO Andrew Marsh sold $11.7 million in shares in early July. Usually, I'm not bothered by stock sales because people sell shares for all kinds of reasons. In this case, he exercised 1.17 million stock options -- most of which had an exercise price of $5.39 and a sale price of $10.01. Who can blame the guy? Two in hand is worth one in the bush.

2020-08-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The latest earnings season showed retailers of all stripes, not just e-commerce companies, have been winners in the pandemic. Amazon.com Inc. is reaping a windfall, as are emerging e-commerce stars such as Wayfair Inc. and Etsy Inc. But physical giants such as Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. and athleisure apparel company Lululemon Athletica Inc. have reported stellar earnings too. This is partly because fiscal relief passed by Congress has supported household incomes despite the rise in unemployment. But it’s also because, as Target's CEO noted, consumer spending that would have gone to in-person activities such as travel or dining has gone into buying physical products instead. The risk to these companies — and to investors who have sought refuge from the pandemic in their shares — is what happens once there's a vaccine and consumer spending shifts back to in-person activities. That normalization process will be good news for the economy overall but bad news for retailers that have benefited from this year's disruption.So many retailers have thrived in the pandemic that we can think of them holistically in a behavioral sense, rather than just dividing them into traditional themes such as e-commerce or home improvement. Recreation vehicle sales are up as would-be travelers see them as safer than airplanes and hotels. Swimming pool makers have benefited as people try to relax at home. Yoga clothes and athleisure are in, while business suits are out, as work-from-home employees prioritize comfort over office attire. For the most part, if you sell goods that still have utility while in-person gatherings are curtailed, if consumers believe it's safe to shop with you, and if you've had inventory to sell, then you're doing well. This won’t last forever. There may be some permanent shifts here; in the case of e-commerce, perhaps customers who previously wouldn't have shopped online in a certain category may continue to shop that way going forward. But a lot of this shopping will prove temporary once life gets back to normal. Consumers have fixed budgets, and a dollar spent on travel or dining is a dollar that can't be spent buying stuff online. And once you buy one RV or swimming pool you usually don't need another one.Another factor beyond wallet share is time share. When it comes to social media or streaming services, it’s understood that a minute spent on Facebook is a minute not spent watching television or Netflix. There are only so many minutes in the day, and people have to sleep, work, eat, and live their lives. The same applies to shopping. The pandemic has changed how we use our time. We can’t spend weekends with friends or family, or at restaurants or weddings, as much as usual. So it’s somewhat more appealing to go to a big-box store to get out of the house, or to spend more time shopping online, if only as a diversion. A Saturday morning not spent at brunch is a Saturday morning that can be spent shopping for outdoor furniture. That process will reverse after a vaccine.There’s a limit to how much things can move in the opposite direction; most people won't eat twice as many steak dinners in 2021 to make up for lost time in 2020. But it's possible that, once it's safe to do so, people will spend much more time on in-person activities than usual for a while. People may revel in doing things they previously took for granted. With two young kids, I'm already dreading the possibility of visiting a Disney theme park next year, knowing how many other families who didn't get their Disney pilgrimage this year will be fighting for the same reservations I will. Difficulties finding in-stock items or reserving a home contractor right now might be replaced by struggles to book restaurants and hotels a year from now.This could be a rude awakening for investors in retail stocks that have provided a measure of security in 2020. It's possible, perhaps even likely, that the two-year performance of these companies in 2020 and 2021 will exceed what anyone could have reasonably expected at the end of 2019. But from the standpoint of trends internalized by investors this year, performance next year could disappoint — particularly relative to companies involved in activities that have been suppressed in 2020 but could come back strong in 2021.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-08-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Best Buy Co.’s second-quarter sales increase was not quite as booming as those of its big-box store peers. But the consumer electronics giant still belongs in the pandemic-era retail winner’s circle because its growth was, in some ways, harder fought. The retailer reported Tuesday that U.S. comparable sales rose 5% from a year earlier, a far cry from the greater-than-20% growth reported last week by Target Corp., Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. As destinations for groceries and prescription medicines, the likes of Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. kept their doors open throughout the crisis. So, too, did the home-improvement heavyweights. Best Buy, however, moved to close brick-and-mortar stores in the early days of the pandemic, initially using them only for curbside pickup of online orders.   By the time the second quarter started, it had opened only a portion of stores, and customers had to make appointments. It gradually ramped up from there, with almost all stores open for shopping without appointments by late June. That means that for roughly six weeks of the quarter, it was relying solely on e-commerce and appointments to meet customer demand. While its digital sales soared, rising 242% from a year earlier, it makes sense that having brick-and-mortar shopping so restricted for a while kept a lid on total sales. For expensive items such as home theaters, many people are going to want to see options in-person before they buy. The company reported that in the final weeks of the second quarter, when stores had fully reopened, its sales were up 16% from a year earlier. Additionally, sales rose 20% in the first three weeks of the current quarter, though executives don’t expect growth to continue at such a blistering pace for the entire period. That detail about the slowing sales growth sent Best Buy shares down in pre-market trading from their record close on Monday. Best Buy, of course, benefited from fresh consumer needs and wants borne of stay-at-home lifestyles. As customers needed to build out work-from-home setups or remote learning stations for their children, it reported big sales of computers and tablets. The largest comparable sales growth came from its appliances category. This is a different pattern from the one in the first quarter, when a burst of video game purchases helped offset weakness in other lines of business. While the company said it experienced constrained inventory in certain categories, overall, it reflects well on Best Buy’s supply chain and inventory management strategies that it held up as demand shifted to different areas. Best Buy executives should certainly view its results with some measure of caution. Some of the sales rung up in the quarter could be attributed to demand that was just pulled forward. In other words, people who would have otherwise hung on to an old laptop until next year might have pulled the trigger on a new one this summer to work more efficiently from home. They should take comfort, though, in the fact that plenty of the increased demand is incremental business. If not for widespread work-from-home orders, people would never have bought some of the desktop computers, printers and scanners that flew off shelves this summer. If not for a dearth of events to keep them busy, they might not have sprung for a projector to watch movies. If not for extensive restaurant closings that are forcing more home cooking, they might not have purchased an extra freezer for the basement. Given that the unemployment rate is still soaring and Congress is deadlocked on additional relief for workers, it’s worth pondering how Best Buy would hold up if the economy remains weak. Matthew McClintock, an analyst with Raymond James, pointed out in a recent research note that the retailer’s assortment is much more resilient in a recession than it was in 2008 and 2009. Since then, the chain has made a big push into appliances, capturing market share that once-mighty Sears squandered. Replacing a broken dishwasher or refrigerator is not exactly a discretionary purchase, so being a bigger player in that category provides some measure of insulation for Best Buy. Plus, the categories it is better known for, such as computers, tablets and smartphones, feel less like discretionary purchases than they once did. Those items are essential for remote work and are communications lifelines when people are stuck at home.   All of that leaves Best Buy relatively well-positioned to ride out what is sure to be a choppy end of the year for the wider retail industry.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-08-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There's been a lot of talk about the U.S. experiencing a K-shaped recovery, with large companies and the rich recovering while smaller companies and lower-paid service workers struggle. But this divide also shows up in the way Americans are shopping. July personal spending data confirmed a simultaneous boom in consumption of durable goods such as cars and refrigerators and a depression in spending on services. This is the exact opposite of what happened in the 2008 recession. But such a durable-goods boom is unsustainable, whether or not we ever get a vaccine for the coronavirus. When it ends, markets might be in for a period analogous to 2015-16, when a slump in energy investment rattled global markets even as consumer spending and employment kept growing.Big tech companies have gotten much of the credit for the surge in equities since March, but this durable-goods boom has played a role too. It's why shares of home-improvement stores such as Lowe's Cos. Inc. and Home Depot Inc., appliance makers such as Whirlpool Corp., electronics retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc., and companies that sell home goods such as Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Wayfair Inc. have done so well. Large increases in the ISM manufacturing survey, a measure of business sentiment, are often seen as indicative of economies exiting recession or enjoying accelerating growth. We’re getting such readings now. Most U.S. economic activity and employment is in services. But the ups and downs of the business cycle are usually more apparent in the goods sector.There's no historical parallel, particularly in a recessionary or crisis environment, for a surge in durable goods spending occurring simultaneously with a slump in services spending. In the past, durable goods have outperformed services only after a recessionary slump in spending on such big-ticket items.This disconnect could continue for several more months. But the promise of rapid coronavirus tests, improved medical treatments and vaccines means there's a good chance these trends revert to somewhat normal levels by early next year. How will markets digest a rapid increase in services spending while durable goods spending goes from robust to tepid or worse?We have a recent example of an environment that was similar, if not identical, to what we might see over the next year or two. The plunge in commodity prices between 2014 and 2016 led to a slump in business investment around the world. Spending on commodity production and extraction — particularly oil — led to a drop in spending not just in those industries but also in the industrial supply chain supporting them. Some have called this a stealth recession that occurred even in the context of a growing U.S. economy. Credit markets seized up, as investors worried about losses on loans tied to energy investments. Stock markets experienced plunges and higher volatility, as equity investors worried about the signals from credit markets.It's easy to see a dynamic like this returning in 2021 or 2022, if and when consumers shift spending from durable goods back to services. Investors, seeing negative data on big-ticket items, may freak out, believing the newfound softness is a recessionary leading indicator. That might hurt stocks, even as the service economy normalizes and starts hiring by the hundreds of thousands per month. Reversing the unequal growth of the past several months will certainly be better for the economy in the long run. But there could be some anxious moments along the way, as a softening durable-goods sector and falling stock prices raise recessionary red flags that make investors overlook what is a natural part of economic normalization.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-09-01,"(Bloomberg) -- A strange phenomenon has emerged near Amazon.com Inc. delivery stations and Whole Foods stores in the Chicago suburbs: smartphones dangling from trees. Contract delivery drivers are putting them there to get a jump on rivals seeking orders, according to people familiar with the matter.Someone places several devices in a tree located close to the station where deliveries originate. Drivers in on the plot then sync their own phones with the ones in the tree and wait nearby for an order pickup. The reason for the odd placement, according to experts and people with direct knowledge of Amazon’s operations, is to take advantage of the handsets’ proximity to the station, combined with software that constantly monitors Amazon’s dispatch network, to get a split-second jump on competing drivers.That drivers resort to such extreme methods is emblematic of the ferocious competition for work in a pandemic-ravaged U.S. economy suffering from double-digit unemployment. Much the way milliseconds can mean millions to hedge funds using robotraders, a smartphone perched in a tree can be the key to getting a $15 delivery route before someone else.Drivers have been posting photos and videos on social-media chat rooms to try to figure out what technology is being used to receive orders faster than those lacking the advantage. Some have complained to Amazon that unscrupulous drivers have found a way to rig the company’s delivery dispatch system.In an internal email seen by Bloomberg, Amazon said it would investigate the matter but would be unable to divulge the outcome of its inquiry to delivery drivers. The company, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.Bloomberg reviewed photos and video of smartphones in trees outside Whole Foods and Amazon delivery stations. They show drivers approaching the phones and syncing them with their own devices, then sitting or standing nearby waiting for an alert about a route.An Uber-like app called Amazon Flex lets drivers make deliveries in their own cars. For many with other jobs, it’s a way to earn extra money in their spare time. But with joblessness rising and unemployment payments shrinking, competition for such work has stiffened, and more people rely on it as their primary income source. Adding to the pressure, fewer people are using ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, so more drivers have to deliver online shopping orders to make money. As a result, some Whole Foods locations have come to resemble parking lots at Home Depot Inc., where day laborers have long congregated to pick up home repair gigs.Unlike hourly employees who get paid even when work is slow, gig workers only get paid by the job. So securing a route through the smartphone app is the key first step to making money. Most Flex routes last from two to four hours and can be scheduled in advance. That system can be gamed as well. Drivers download apps on their smartphones that constantly monitor the Amazon Flex site and automatically take any routes that become available, as CNBC reported in February. Bloomberg reported similar use of apps by Instacart shoppers earlier this month.What’s happening at Whole Foods in the Chicago area is different. Drivers are competing for fast-delivery Instant Offers, which require an immediate response and typically take between 15 and 45 minutes to complete. Instant Offers are dispatched by an automated system that detects which drivers are nearby through their smartphones, according to two people familiar with the technology. When drivers see an Instant Offer, they have only a few minutes to accept the delivery or lose it to someone else.In an urban area with good cell tower coverage and plentiful WiFi hotspots, the system can detect a smartphone’s location to within about 20 feet, one of the people said. That means a phone in a tree outside Whole Foods’ door would get the delivery offer even before drivers sitting in their cars just a block away.The phones in trees seem to serve as master devices that dispatch routes to multiple nearby drivers in on the plot, according to drivers who have observed the process. They believe an unidentified person or entity is acting as an intermediary between Amazon and the drivers and charging drivers to secure more routes, which is against Amazon’s policies.The perpetrators likely dangle multiple phones in the trees to spread the work around to multiple Amazon Flex accounts and avoid detection by Amazon, said Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry consultant. If all the routes were fed through one device, it would be easy for Amazon to detect, he said.“They’re gaming the system in a way that makes it harder for Amazon to figure it out,” Sharma said. “They’re just a step ahead of Amazon’s algorithm and its developers.”One reason Flex contractors do this is to get around the requirements for being a driver, such as having a valid license or being authorized to work in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter. In such cases, someone who meets the requirements downloads the Flex app and is offered a route earning $18 an hour. He or she accepts the route and then pays someone else $10 an hour to do it, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.A Flex driver who has been monitoring the activity said the company needs to take steps to make sure all drivers are treated fairly.“Amazon knows about it,” the driver said, “but does nothing.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Drivers Are Hanging Smartphones in Trees to Get More Work

2020-09-04,"There's no need to hit the panic button on At Home (NYSE:HOME) even though HOME stock plunged in early September.Source: Shutterstock.com The fall came after the home goods retailer reported second quarter numbers that -- while very strong -- weren't strong enough to justify what had been a 384% rally in the stock in the three months leading up to the print.This is a perfectly natural, totally normal sell-off in a stock that's been red-hot. The sell-off just looks super big because the rally has also been super big. Indeed, if you back out and look at the big picture, HOME stock is still up 250% over the past three months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFocusing on that big picture, it becomes clear that the long-term growth narrative supporting At Home is very compelling, and that the numbers imply significant upside in the stock from here over the next 5 to 10 years.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks Ideal for Any Investor So don't stress this sell-off. Instead, embrace it. Buy the dip. Hold for the long haul.Here's a deeper look. Strong Earnings and HOME StockDon't let the huge sell-off in HOME stock fool you. At Home's second quarter earnings report was fabulous.In numbers:  * Net sales rose 50.5%.  * Comparable sales rose 42.3%.  * Store count rose 7.4%.  * Gross margins expanded 880 basis points to 38.1%.  * Adjusted SG&A dollars dropped 10.8% year-over-year, leading to SG&A rate compression of 900 basis points.  * Adjusted operating margins nearly quadrupled year-over-year to 24.6%.  * Operating profits rose 446%.Broadly, the quarter showed that At Home continues to win share in the burgeoning home goods retail market, thanks to physical footprint expansion, as well as the company's unique value prop as an all-in-one home goods superstore.This momentum isn't slowing down, either. While the company did not issue an official guide, management commented on the conference call that third quarter comparable sales trends to-date are in-line with Q2, so up about 40%.If the numbers were so great, then why did HOME stock sell-off?Because management already reported preliminary second quarter numbers back in late July, and the numbers turned out to be exactly what management said they would be. Investors who have been bidding up the stock ferociously over the past few weeks probably wanted those numbers to be better than the prelim numbers, and/or were looking for a strong Q3 guide.They got neither. So selling ensued.It's just near-term trading dynamics. Nothing to worry about in the big picture. Compelling Long-Term Growth NarrativeZooming out, the big picture, long-term growth narrative supporting At Home and HOME stock is very compelling.In short, the company has a unique opportunity to leverage its all-in-one, superstore shopping experience to nationally consolidate the fragmented U.S. home goods retail market.If you've ever remodeled your kitchen, spruced up your bedroom, or upgraded the patio furniture, then you know that the home goods shopping process is not simple. That's because the market is highly fragmented. Whereas companies like Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) offer an all-in-one, superstore shopping experience for buying consumer electronics and building materials, respectively, no such store exists in home goods.At Home has an opportunity to turn into that superstore for the home goods sector, and consolidate this retail category that is overly fragmented.That's because At Home has all the ingredients necessary to be a home goods superstore.The stores are massive. They average about 100,000 square feet, so on par with a Walmart or Target (NYSE:TGT) store. That's about 2X the size of your average Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) store and 4X the size of your average HomeGoods store.The product selection is enormous. Every At Home superstore has over 50,000 product SKUs. And the prices are cheap. The average price point at At Home is just $15.Leaning into its size, product and price advantages, At Home has a compelling opportunity to turn into the Home Depot or Best Buy of the home good sector over the next 10 years. Tons of Upside PotentialThe numbers imply significant upside potential for HOME stock in the long run.At Home exited Q2 with 219 stores.HomeGoods has 800+ stores. Bed Bath & Beyond has 1,000+ stores. There's tons of real estate growth potential here. Indeed, management thinks At Home can continue to grow its store base by ~10% per year to 600+ stores at scale.Each one of those stores does about $6 million in annual sales. Store level profit margins at the stores hover around 30%. The math there implies $3.6 billion in 2030 sales, and $1.1 billion in store-level profits.Taking out $250 million for corporate overhead, $150 million for depreciation and amortization, $40 million for interest expense and 20% for taxes, you're left with potential net profits in 2030 of over $500 million.A 20X multiple on that implies a potential future valuation for At Home of $20+ billion.This is a $1 billion company today. Bottom Line on HOME StockAt Home stock is one of my favorite long-term, small-cap growth stocks to buy for the next 5 to 10 years. The post-Q2 earnings sell-off does not change the long-term bull thesis. Rather, it's just the stock taking a breather after a torrid run higher.To that end, long-term investors shouldn't run from HOME stock here. They should embrace current weakness. Buy the dip. Weather the storm. And hold for the long haul.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley.

2020-10-07,"Shares of Home Depot (NYSE: HD) moved higher by 11.12% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Home Depot has.Home Depot's Debt Based on Home Depot's balance sheet as of August 25, 2020, long-term debt is at $32.37 billion and current debt is at $2.48 billion, amounting to $34.85 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $14.14 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $20.71 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Home Depot has $63.35 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.55. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In some ways, Prime Day is the same as ever – a concocted, hype-filled holiday for Amazon.com Inc. to lure more people to sign up for a membership. But the deals blitz is different in at least one key way this year: It’s a much more high-stakes affair for retailers that are not Amazon.  Timing is one reason. Prime Day has typically taken place in July, a fairly sleepy time of year for the retail industry. Amazon competitors have long tried to piggyback off the event with deals of their own, but if it didn’t work, it didn’t matter so much. Back-to-school and holiday shopping were still around the corner, offering ripe opportunities to win sales and customers’ loyalty. This year, though, Prime Day is serving as the kickoff to the holiday shopping season because the pandemic has the retail industry betting on an earlier-than-usual start to gift-buying. Big-name chains including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have been planning their discounts and inventory strategies accordingly, so losing to Amazon on Prime Day in 2020 effectively means getting trounced on one of the most crucial days of retail’s most crucial season. Unfortunately for rivals, Amazon is set up for a hefty Prime Day haul. The e-commerce giant may register $6.2 billion in U.S. sales on its website during the event, which runs through Wednesday, according to a forecast from eMarketer. For context, online sales for the entire industry on Black Friday last year were $7.4 billion, according to Adobe, and Cyber Monday sales were $9.4 billion. On average, daily online sales during last year’s holiday season were about $2.3 billion. Clearly, Prime Day represents a major shock to that pattern. It will likely pull forward sales that would’ve taken place later in the season – and yank some sales toward Amazon that might’ve gone to other retailers.   It doesn’t help that traditional retailers can’t count on their best competitive advantage against Amazon – their large fleets of physical stores – in the same way this holiday season. Typically, those environments provide important insulation against Amazon because many shoppers still genuinely like to touch or try on goods before buying them. Others view gift-buying as more of a social experience than an errand. But with continuing safety concerns related to Covid-19, even people who still love in-store shopping are, in many cases, going to do less of it this year. That means old-school retailers have no choice but to wage more of this year’s holiday battle on Amazon’s home turf. Their ability to win any online market share on Prime Day will be a key test of how well they will fare at that task over the next couple of months. Rivals are certainly working hard to answer Amazon. Best Buy Co.’s website on Tuesday is touting “Black Friday prices,” while Target’s is splashed with “Deal Days” discounts. Legacy chains, including Home Depot Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., are prominently highlighting their curbside pickup services – a way to distinguish themselves from the e-commerce behemoth.     No matter what, the retail industry is in for an extraordinarily difficult holiday season, given enormous uncertainty about consumers’ willingness to spend amid the public health crisis and economic slump, as well as uncertainty about what kinds of items they’ll opt to buy in this unusual environment. If Prime Day turns out to be the annual retailing muscle flex by Amazon that it is expected to be, it will only add to traditional retailers’ challenge. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-10-21,"Let’s cut straight to the chase. GrowGeneration (NASDAQ:GRWG) stock could be one of the best stocks to buy right now for huge gains in November and December.
The logic is pretty simple.
Pollsters and betting markets are saying that Joe Biden has a strong chance of winning the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. His running mate, Kamala Harris, said in the most recent VP debate that, if elected, she and Biden will federally decriminalize cannabis. Of course, this strongly implies that if Biden wins, federal legalization of cannabis will likely follow suit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
This will spark the long overdue cannabis boom in the U.S., as pot stocks roar higher. Perhaps none more-so that GRWG stock, since GrowGeneration is 100% levered to the U.S. cannabis market, is rapidly expanding its presence in that market, and has a robust long-term growth narrative that supports enormous upside potential.
So, with all that in mind, GRWG stock looks like a strong buy today.


					10 ESG Stocks to Buy for a Brighter Future				

Here’s a deeper look.

GrowGeneration Is a Long-Term Winner
The long-term growth narrative supporting GrowGeneration is quite compelling, and supports enormous upside in GRWG stock if the cannabis market in the U.S. scales.
In short, growing cannabis is not a straightforward, easy process. Most of the time, it requires a specialized process called hydroponics, which is basically just a soil-free way of growing cannabis (and therefore, an easier, cheaper and more scalable way of growing pot). Demand for hydroponics supplies will soar as the U.S. cannabis market matures and scales. But the current state of the hydroponics industry is not ready for this surge.
There are about 1,000 hydroponics stores in the U.S. The market is highly fragmented. There are no big brands. There’s zero consistency across markets. And online and omni-channel capabilities are limited.
That’s where GrowGeneration comes in.
Founded in 2014 in Colorado, the $840 million specialty hydroponics retail chain is trying to consolidate, optimize and modernize the cannabis supplies market, and ultimately turn into a modern, national go-to convenience store for cannabis growers. In other words, GrowGeneration is trying to turn into something like the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) for cannabis growing materials.
It’s an ambitious goal, especially since GrowGeneration operates just 29 hydroponics stores across 11 states today. But it’s also entirely doable, given that this is an entirely open market ripe for disruption and consolidation, and that GrowGeneration is attacking the market in an innovative and strategic way.
If GrowGeneration pulls this off, the company could be worth $3.5 billion one day — more than 4X the current market cap.
Thus, the long-term growth narrative supporting GRWG stock is quite compelling.
The Potential “Blue Wave” Catalyst
GRWG stock will take a big leap forward on its long-term growth trajectory if we get a supposed “Blue Wave” in early November — wherein Democrats sweep the White House, Congress and House of Representatives — because a liberal legislature would almost assuredly include federal legalization of cannabis within the next 12 to 24 months.
Is such a “Blue Wave” possible?
According to the experts, yes. FiveThirtyEight gives Joe Biden an 87% chance of winning of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, while betting markets put his odds at around 67% — which is the highest they’ve ever been. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats a 69% chance of controlling the Senate, and a 95% chance of controlling the House.
In other words, a Blue Wave has a greater than 50% of happening in November.
If such a Blue Wave happens, pot stocks will soar. GRWG stock will soar more than your average pot stock, largely because most pot stocks have robust Canada market exposure, while GrowGeneration is 100% levered to the U.S. market.
To that end, GRWG looks like a compelling buy ahead of what could be an enormous “Blue Wave” catalyst.

Simultaneous Geographic Expansion
Concurrent to the potential “Blue Wave” catalyst, GrowGeneration is geographically expanding its operations to give itself the best chance of accelerating growth in the event of federal cannabis legalization.
The company recently acquired Hydroponics Depot, an indoor and outdoor garden center in Arizona. This represents GrowGeneration’s first foray into the booming Arizona cannabis market, where recreational marijuana sales rose 20% from January to May 2020.
It’s quite likely that — in the event we get a “Blue Wave” in November — GrowGeneration accelerates its selective geographic expansion roadmap, on the idea that many new legal cannabis market will come online over the next few quarters.
In other words, the recent Hydroponics Depot acquisition could be the first in a long string of multiple acquisitions across multiple states — a stretch in which GrowGeneration could go from 29 stores across 11 states today, to 100-plus stores across 20-plus states by the end of 2021.
Of course, if that happens, GRWG stock will fly higher.
Bottom Line on GRWG Stock
GrowGeneration stock is a long-term winner, with two huge near-term catalysts on the horizon in the 2020 Election and potential accelerated geographic expansion.
Of course, that means that GRWG stock looks like a strong buy here and now. This stock could finish the year with a big bang.

""Moving to 2021, however, it's our expectation that the pendulum shifts back in favor of the Pro/DIFM cohort, which along with being significantly further ahead on its investment cycle should lend to better for Operating Margin dollar flow through for Home Depot relative to Lowe's,"" Grom said.Gordon Haskett is projecting Home Depot will report third-quarter EPS of $3 on 17.5% same-store sales estimates. Both numbers would beat consensus analyst estimates of $2.98 and 15.1%, respectively.For Lowe's, Grom is calling for EPS of $1.95 on same-store sales growth of 21.5%. Those numbers would be slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $1.91 and 20.1%.Benzinga's Take: Based on recent numbers from both Home Depot and Lowe's, investors can't go wrong with both names.Yet Lowe's may be the better social distancing play, while Home Depot could be a better long-term play on a return to normalcy.Latest Ratings for HD  DateFirmActionFromTo  Nov 2020Gordon HaskettUpgradesAccumulateBuy  Oct 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweight  Sep 2020OppenheimerDowngradesOutperformPerform    View More Analyst Ratings for HD   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Disney The Day It Bought Marvel Would Be Worth Today  * Bitcoin Bull Mark Yusko Calls The Cyptocurrency 'An Asset Most People Don't Understand'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. agreed to buy building products distributor HD Supply Holdings Inc., reuniting the home-improvement retailer with its former subsidiary more than a decade after they split apart.Home Depot will buy all outstanding shares for about $56 apiece, according to a statement Monday, representing a premium of about 25% over HD Supply’s closing price on Friday. With about 156 million shares outstanding, according to a filing, the offer is valued at roughly $8.7 billion. Including net cash, the deal has an enterprise value of about $8 billion, the companies said.The acquisition brings back together two companies that used to be under the same roof and will give Home Depot more exposure to the professional contractor side of the business. Like do-it-yourself repairs, that segment has boomed during the pandemic as Americans want to improve the homes they’re spending more time in.Shares of HD Supply jumped 24% at 11:56 a.m. in New York, and Home Depot increased less than 1%. HD Supply was up 11% this year through Friday’s close, while Home Depot rose 27% over that span.One of the largest industrial distributors in North America, HD Supply provides everything from bleach, to doors and ceramic tile to about 500,000 customers from 270 branches and 44 distribution centers, according to its annual report.HD Supply is “a good business with solid margins,” Chuck Grom, an analyst with Gordon Haskett, said in a note. The company has faced underinvestment in recent years, giving the buyer the opportunity to improve the business, he said. The tie-up could add as much as 33 cents a share to Home Depot’s earnings, Grom added.HD Supply has been slimming down, making it “a highly attractive asset in a compelling segment of the market,” RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in a note.The deal adds to the momentum for Home Depot, which along with rival Lowe’s Cos. was deemed an essential retailer early in the pandemic and remained open even as many stores shut down for months. The HD Supply transaction, to be funded by cash on hand and debt, is expected to be completed in Home Depot’s fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Jan. 31.Professional SalesProfessional customers currently account for about 45% of Home Depot’s sales, and HD Supply could help it cement its leadership position, said Drew Reading, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Though HD Supply has exposure to slower growth commercial end-markets, sales trends among pros continue to improve and may accelerate in 2021.”Home Depot sold the construction-supply unit to a group of buyout firms -- Carlyle Group LP, Bain Capital LLC and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC -- in 2007. That deal was initially valued at $10.3 billion including debt, but in the midst of the housing crash, it was scaled back to $8.5 billion. The chain then went public in 2013.Monday’s announcement comes about a week after Bloomberg News reported that Lowe’s had recently approached HD Supply and that the companies were in preliminary talks, citing people familiar with the matter at the time. The report also said it was unclear whether there were discussions with other suitors. Lowe’s subsequently said it isn’t in talks and doesn’t plan to pursue a transaction.(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.

2020-11-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Among the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, few have fared worse than hospitality. Tourism and business travel have stalled amid government-mandated lockdowns and fears of infection. Hotels got lumped in with restaurants and gyms as the locations most prone to the spread of coronavirus in a recent study conducted by researchers at Stanford University and Northwestern University. And yet, Home Depot Inc. just agreed to pay $8.7 billion to buy a company that gets a fifth of its revenue from selling maintenance products — think janitorial supplies, but also faucets and air conditioners — to hotels and resorts. The home-improvement retailer said Monday that it was acquiring HD Supply Holdings Inc. for $56 a share. That works out to $8 billion after adjusting for the target's net cash position. This is a reunion of sorts: the HD in HD Supply used to stand for Home Depot, which sold the business to a private equity consortium in 2007 for $8.5 billion.Since reemerging as a standalone public company in 2013, HD Supply has divested both its Waterworks storm and sewer supplies unit and White Cap construction materials business, selling them to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for a combined $5.4 billion. The White Cap sale closed in October, leaving HD Supply all-in on products used to maintain and repair living spaces.Facilities maintenance had previously been the company’s crown jewel, but the roles reversed during the Covid-19 crisis, with White Cap’s construction customers bouncing back fairly quickly. By contrast, the facilities-maintenance business’s biggest market is multifamily homes — another sector that was hit hard by the pandemic as a wave of unemployment pressured some residents’ ability to pay rent and a fear of infection made others more willing to make due with leaky faucets or running toilets. Hospitality is the next-biggest market, followed by institutional housing for the military and students and then health care, which in HD Supply’s case primarily means senior-living facilities rather than hospitals.“That sales vertical is actually our biggest unknown right now,” HD Supply Chief Financial Officer Evan Levitt said of the health-care operations at a September conference. “What's happening is a lot of folks are taking mom and dad out of these facilities for fear of them getting sick. And so, they are dealing with lower occupancy. Now offsetting that is, they're spending a fair amount of expense budget on infection control, cleaning materials. They're trying to keep the common areas safe, spending a lot on PPE. But they are deferring maintenance, deferring capital improvements and that whole industry is under a little bit of financial duress.”What’s interesting is that even with this backdrop, Home Depot is paying top dollar. The $56-a-share bid represents a 19% premium to HD Supply’s all-time high set in May 2019. It’s also more than 20% higher on average than the price analysts were expecting the company to reach on its own over the next year.The world is gearing up for a difficult winter with coronavirus hospitalizations on the rise and fresh lockdown measures in the offing, but there is reason for hope. Moderna Inc. said Monday that its Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis. This follows early results released last week that showed a separate vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE was more than 90% effective. That appears to be good enough for Home Depot. The HD Supply deal is the company’s largest-ever acquisition. Home Depot reestablished itself in the maintenance and repair products distribution market in 2015 with the $1.6 billion acquisition of Interline Brands Inc. But HD Supply offers a much larger network of distribution centers and delivery drivers. This will help Home Depot boost its appeal to the more lucrative professional contractor customers it’s been trying to court lately. Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom estimates the deal could yield $100 million in synergies, a good chunk of which would come from increased purchasing power for things like cabinets, blinds and appliances.They say that M&A is the best gauge of CEO confidence. If Home Depot CEO Craig Menear is willing to bet big on the future of hotels, senior-living centers and multifamily housing, maybe there really is a light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At the onset of the pandemic, consumers almost overnight adopted a new set of shopping rituals. Judging from two major retail earnings reports on Tuesday, those habits haven’t loosened their grip. Walmart Inc. reported that its U.S. comparable sales rose 6.4% from a year earlier in the quarter, far stronger than the 3.8% analysts expected. While traffic was down significantly, average spending per receipt soared 24%. That’s an indication that people are continuing to consolidate their shopping into fewer trips, likely reflecting pandemic-related safety concerns. Meanwhile, Walmart’s e-commerce growth clocked in at 79%, driven in part by services such as pickup and delivery, which notched triple-digit increases. The continued propensity for stock-up behavior was also evident in the strong results at Walmart’s Sam’s Club chain, where comparable sales were up 11.1% from a year earlier. The company said it saw “high teens” growth in the warehouse club’s fresh and frozen departments, as well as “low 20%” growth in the category that includes laundry and paper goods. With its large pack sizes, it makes sense that Sam’s would be a beneficiary in a moment when shoppers are trying to make less-frequent store visits.  Meanwhile, analysts had expected a 17.4% increase in comparable sales at Home Depot Inc., a figure that would’ve represented robust growth, but would have been a slowdown from the booming 23.4% surge it recorded on this measure in the second quarter. Instead, the big-box home-improvement chain reported a blockbuster 24.1% rise in comparable sales, as consumers who are stuck at home continued to splash out on remodeling and decorating projects to make their nests a bit more comfortable. These earnings reports are a snapshot in time for a period that spanned August through October. But public health conditions are changing in a way that only seems likely to intensify the behaviors that fueled these companies’ strong quarters. With new cases of Covid-19 raging across the country, local restrictions on restaurants and other businesses appear poised to tighten again, forcing people to double down on dining in and entertaining themselves within the four walls of their homes.   Even before this latest wave of the pandemic, surveys showed that consumers planned to spend less on travel this holiday season. That – along with months of scant opportunities to buy things like concert tickets or sporting events – frees up space in shoppers’ budgets to spend in other categories. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on a Tuesday conference call that in his own family, they’re looking forward to “some sense of joy and normalcy” at the holidays despite a smaller gathering, adding, “I think we’ll see that play out as it relates to consumption patterns in the U.S. and beyond.” I suspect consumers will try to create that feeling of the Before Times by springing for lavish holiday dinners, splurging on big-ticket gifts and going all out with holiday decor. All three of those patterns could benefit Walmart, and the second and third could benefit Home Depot. It’s notable that Walmart and Home Depot don’t expect these conditions create a clear glide path for them in the near-term. Neither company issued guidance today, suggesting they still anticipate significant volatility in the coming months. They are right to gird for uncertainty: The Commerce Department’s retail sales report for October, also issued Tuesday, showed sales rose at their slowest pace in six months, a potential warning sign that shoppers — especially those who are unemployed or furloughed because of the pandemic — are starting to rein in spending as Congress has failed to step in with a new stimulus package to help them. There are other unknowns around this very unusual year. The retail industry has made a concerted effort to pull holiday sales forward into October amid the pandemic in order to prevent unsafe crowding in stores and bottlenecks in their e-commerce operations. It’s hard to know how much of the strength these chains saw in October was a result of these efforts, which might in turn make November and December sales a bit lighter.  The upbeat news about vaccines in recent weeks have made it easier to envision a not-so-distant future in which the pandemic doesn’t loom so large in Americans’ everyday behavior. For now, though, these earnings reports are a reminder that the public health situation shapes nearly every spending decision — and, in turn, which companies are holding up best.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Dunoyer said that even though the Astra-Oxford vaccine differs from the other two, which use messenger RNA technology, they all target the same spike protein that lets the virus enter and infect healthy cells.Astra has taken steps to minimize the impact of the vaccine on cash flow because it has committed to delivering the vaccine at cost during the pandemic, Dunoyer said.Workers Want to Be at Home, Just Not Every Day (8:45 a.m. NY)Office employees are getting used to the perks of telecommuting, and expect it to continue even after the pandemic ends, but most aren’t ready to abandon the office entirely, according to a survey by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

In the week ending Nov. 17, 37,706 infections were confirmed, down from 43,621. The number of reported hospital admissions also fell. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Health Minister Hugo de Jonge are set to host a press briefing later on Tuesday.U.S. Retail Sales Rise at Slowest Pace in 6 Months (8:30 a.m. NY)Home Depot Inc., the Atlanta-based home-improvement retailer, reported quarterly sales that surpassed analysts’ expectations as consumers keep shifting spending to household renovation projects. The company also reported higher costs and said it will spend $1 billion to boost annual compensation for hourly front-line workers.Walmart Inc.’s sales also surged past estimates as consumers continued to flock to the essential retailer for carts full of groceries, pharmacy items and at-home entertainment.Separate figures showed that U.S. retail sales rose in October at the slowest pace in six months, suggesting consumers are becoming more hesitant amid a lack of fresh federal stimulus.Independent Hotel Owners Band Together (7:55 a.m. NY)A group of independent hotel owners is forming a “rebel alliance” to survive the pandemic and prevent their properties from getting swallowed up by the likes of Marriott International Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.The group, led by Pebblebook Hotel Trust, is launching Curator Hotel & Resort Collection, a new company that aims to reduce costs on everything from bed linens to credit card processing.Austria’s Partial Lockdown Shows Impact (7:47 a.m. NY)While Austrians experienced the first day of stricter measures, softer rules imposed two weeks earlier showed some results. The 7-day incidence fell for the fourth consecutive day, and recoveries reported on Tuesday outpaced new cases for the second time since early October.Still, the incidence per 100,000 remains above 500, and hospitalizations and ICU usage are at record levels. The tougher rules are planned to last until Dec. 6.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",N.Y.

2020-11-17,"Shares of Home Depot (NYSE: HD) moved lower by 2.02% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Home Depot has.Home Depot's Debt According to the Home Depot's most recent financial statement as reported on August 25, 2020, total debt is at $34.85 billion, with $32.37 billion in long-term debt and $2.48 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $14.14 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $20.71 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Home Depot's $63.35 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.55. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Home Depot Inc. shares declined after the home-improvement retailer reported higher costs and a plan to spend $1 billion to boost annual compensation for front-line hourly employees.While same-store revenue, a key gauge of performance for retailers, rose 24% in the quarter ended Nov. 1, that also brought higher expenses. Cost of sales, a measure of what the company spends to generate each sale, was up 24% from a year ago, according to the statement. Part of that is due to protective gear for associates and constant cleaning of the stores.The Atlanta-based retailer has broadly benefited amid the pandemic of 2020 as consumers divert spending that would have gone to travel and entertainment to improving their homes. Unlike other retailers, like Walmart Inc., that are reporting fewer transactions but larger tickets, Home Depot is seeing gains in both metrics. That means shoppers are placing more orders and they’re also buying more every time. Analysts expect the home improvement trend will continue as winter sets in and Americans are forced inside.One challenge, however, to Home Depot’s business could be within its pro unit, which caters to professional contractors and builders. If the pandemic worsens and further lockdown measures are imposed by some states, that part of the business may taper off, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in a note.Home Depot is already doubling down on that business: It announced on Monday it would buy building products distributor HD Supply Holdings Inc., reuniting the two companies after they split apart more than a decade ago. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said he is confident the acquisition will let the company tap into the highly fragmented market for maintenance and repairs that he said is worth $55 billion.Company executives said the pro business unit is posting the strongest growth it has seen all year.Home Depot shares fell as much as 2.9% in in New York trading. The retailer’s shares had risen 28% this year through Monday’s close, outpacing the S&P 500 Index.In order to prevent crowds from accumulating during the pandemic, the home-improvement retailer started offering its Black Friday sales earlier this year and pushed them online as well. That should position it well during the winter months, generally a slower time of year for improvement chains.“Looking ahead, we believe Home Depot will have a healthy final quarter. The home continues to be the focal point as we enter the holidays,” Saunders said. Still, “spending will need to compete with a wider array of activities, including more travel, food and gifting. This could take the edge off growth -- but only to a marginal extent.”(Updates shares and adds details from conference call.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Shares Fall After Expenses Climb Alongside Sales
2020-11-17,"Shoppers flocked to two of the country's largest retailers last quarter, but evidently, that's not enough to push stocks higher after yesterday's vaccine-led rally.Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) earnings both looked really impressive, and WMT shares gained some ground in pre-market trading ahead of the opening bell. HD shares fell, however, and major stock indices were in the red early on. This could reflect buying interest drying up a bit following record closes for the major indices yesterday, though it doesn't necessarily change the overall positive tone. Pandemic-related anxiety also could be a factor in the weakness this morning. WMT continues to thrive in the stay-at-home economy, and nothing tells the story better than its 79% jump in Q3 online sales. They've really become a full-fledged e-commerce competitor over the last few years, and all their work to do that paid off once the pandemic hit. Other numbers also looked good, with WMT beating Wall Street's projected revenue and earnings pretty easily. Revenue rose 5.2% from a year ago and same-store sales climbed more than 6%, both very impressive considering the recession and virus-related shutdowns. However, growth was a bit slower than the previous quarter, which makes sense when you consider that in Q2 WMT was often the only game in town due to its huge online business and many competitors being shut down or limited due to the pandemic. In Q3, WMT had more competition. Despite all that, shares barely gained in pre-market trading, maybe a reflection of the fact that WMT shares have already climbed more than 50% from the March pandemic-related low. In a way, you could argue the strong quarter was built into the stock price.The same might be true for HD, which also beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue projections but saw shares slip in the pre-market hours. One possible explanation for the weak stock price action could be HD's plans to spend more on employee wages. Another might be ideas that the company can't sustain the current pandemic-related momentum where so many people are focused on home renovation projects because they're spending more time around the house. Tesla Listed, Walgreens And CVS Listing In other corporate-related news, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) will join the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on Dec. 21, a milestone the company's investors have been eagerly anticipating. Shares jumped 13% in pre-market trading. It may sound symbolic, but joining a major index can actually be pretty good news for a stock because many fund managers will now need to add shares to their portfolios if they're trying to match S&P 500 performance. Things weren't so good on the retail sales front back home in October. They rose only 0.3%, the government said Tuesday, lower than the 0.5% average Wall Street estimate. Stocks fell further in pre-market trading when investors saw that number. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) both got pounded in pre-market trading after Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced it would enter the pharmacy business. When you think about it, this AMZN announcement might be one thing keeping WMT shares from making a big move higher on earnings. While stocks are lower this morning, it's amazing this wall of worry stocks have climbed to new record highs. All through the rally, you continue to hear talk of why the market should be under pressure, but buyers continue snapping up shares.Another First, This Time For The $DJI Another week, another record close for the major indices. That's how Monday ended after the latest vaccine news, and this time the record makers included the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) as well as the S&P 500 Index (SPX). For the $DJI, it was the first record close since February, and that's actually pretty significant when you think about it. Why? Because the $DJI, unlike the SPX or the Nasdaq (COMP), isn't so dominated by Tech and mega-cap Communication Services stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). Also, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) swings less weight in the $DJI than it used to because of its recent split. Instead, the $DJI has major exposure to the big Financial, Energy, and Industrial companies like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), and 3M Co (NYSE: MMM). A lot of these ""old line"" behemoths had huge days Monday on reopening hopes, including BA and CVX.Energy, which led all S&P sectors last week, started the new week with another scoreboard topper as it rose an amazing 6.6%. Compare that to Info Tech, once the darling of the ""stay at home"" set, which rose less than 1% Monday. That's a pretty good example of current sentiment, which seems to favor the reopening trade over those big Tech firms. It's not like FAANGs are having a bad time, they've just been a bit subdued lately.=Despite Stock Rally, Bond Yields Subdued Risk-on was the mood Friday and Monday. Not so much this morning. Bonds are up, gold is up, and volatility is up. When you see those headlines, it often isn't good news for stocks.Consider keeping a close eye on fixed income. The 10-year yield clawed its way back above 0.9% Monday, but didn't gain as much energy from the vaccine news as some might have thought it would. This could reflect continued caution and less enthusiasm about a possible stimulus before the end of the year. The sad headlines about rising virus cases could also be putting a ceiling on yields, and if bonds are getting a bid, that possibly means less money moving into stocks.Though Tech was a laggard Monday, it's worth noting that semiconductor stocks had a nice session. They appeared to draw support from reports that Taiwan Semi is expanding production capacity to meet high demand from chip companies, according to research firm Briefing.com. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gained 2.5%. It's interesting to see that the SOX has risen nearly 8% over the last month even as the S&P Technology (IXT) sector has fallen 1.2%.The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) fell below 23 on Monday, an important technical support level and near the August lows below 22. However, it was up at one point despite the SPX rally, an odd situation that deserves a close look if it happens again. If you see VIX rising in a session when stocks are also up, it might be a bearish signal for stocks. We've seen a stronger VIX hoist a red flag several times over the last year,  though past performance isn't necessarily a future roadmap. VIX futures ticked up slightly early Tuesday but stayed below 25, so nothing too worrisome. Good News Out Of Asia One thing we didn't mention here yesterday amid the vaccine euphoria but which also deserves some attention is really nice economic data from Asia. Chinese investment and consumer spending grew at faster year-over-year rates in October than the month before, while industrial production stayed solid. Retail sales, which investors might want to watch closely for clues about Chinese consumer sentiment, rose 4.3% in October from a year ago, up from 3.3% in September but a bit lower than analysts had expected. Meanwhile strong Japanese growth data added to confidence the economy is recovering there. Japan's economy grew at a 21% annual pace in the last quarter, the first quarter of growth in nearly a year. While China seems to be much further out of the woods on COVID-19 than we are across the Pacific, it's encouraging to see how quickly its economy was able to recover. Maybe that suggests something similar here once those vaccines start to become available, hopefully over the coming months. At least that's what investors seem to be banking on lately.CHART OF THE DAY: EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY. Value stocks have been kicked around for a long time, but now they're starting to emerge from the shadows a bit. This year-to-date chart of the Russell 1000 Value Index (RLV--candlestick) vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RUI--purple line) shows the growth index still...well, growing, but value is also enjoying some decent interest over the last two or three weeks. We'll see if that continues. Data sources: FTSE Russell. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  State of Employment: Some economists think more U.S. employment woes could be ahead. Why? Fiscal struggles for state governments in the wake of the recession that could trigger more layoffs, economists told the Washington Post. One reason the 2008 recession took so long to recover from, they said, is soft tax revenue during the downturn that upended state budgets and caused states to slash payrolls. There's recently been another dramatic fall in tax revenue, and lack of federal support as stimulus talks drag only makes the plight worse for many states. Current public sector weakness, economists warned, could mean it takes longer for the economy to dig out of the COVID-19 recession and for the unemployment rate to return to prior levels. The Fed has telegraphed plans to keep rates at current levels near zero until employment recovers, and getting back there could be more difficult considering the public sector struggles. It might behoove investors to keep a close eye on the government jobs section of the coming November payrolls report. In October, government employment fell by 268,000. A lot was driven by a drop in temporary 2020 Census workers, but job losses also occurred in local government education and state government education, the Labor Department said. Several Fed speakers are on the calendar this week, so consider watching headlines to see if they have anything new to say about the job situation. Amid Vaccine Euphoria, Drug Progress Also Seen: Even as vaccines dominate the news, don't necessarily count out antiviral drugs making another contribution to the fight against COVID-19. Data from Merck & Co., Inc.'s (NYSE: MRK) clinical trials of its antiviral could be available in the next couple of months, MRK told the media toward the end of October. This drug could treat mild forms of the disease or perhaps even be used prophylactically.And last week, The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had issued an emergency use authorization for Eli Lilly And Co's (NYSE: LLY) monoclonal antibody therapy to treat mild to moderate coronavirus infections in adults and children. The single antibody treatment, called bamlanivimab, is the first monoclonal antibody to be authorized for use in treating coronavirus. The idea is to kick-start an immune response against infection, CNN reported. Some advantages for COVID-19 drugs is that they likely won't face some of the challenges a vaccine does, including possible anxiety among some people about getting vaccinated and the logistical issues around transportation and distribution (some vaccines have to be kept at incredibly cold temperatures). Many analysts say a vaccine would likely be the gold standard to let society get back toward more normalcy. But treatments that make it easier and quicker to recover from COVID-19 also help things return to normal and potentially save lives. Expert Opinion on Vaccine: This isn't a medical column, so it's important to turn to the experts if you want to assess Moderna Inc's (NASDAQ: MRNA) vaccine results and possible impact. According to at least one expert, it looks like the company hit the ball out of the park. Dr. Robert M. Wachter, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, tweeted Monday that the MRNA results prove Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) results were no fluke and indicate that scientists targeted the right ""spike protein"" in the virus. Those are the clinical takeaways. Perhaps more important if you're an investor, Wachter also listed a logistical point: MRNA's vaccine will make distribution easier due to no need for a special freezer. ""If all goes right, both companies will be churning out vaccines by early 2021,"" Wachter wrote. Best of all? Back to ""normal by late '21 is possible,"" he added.

2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Target Corp.’s third-quarter sales show that pandemic-driven shopping is still surging heading into the holidays.Comparable sales including e-commerce, a critical gauge of success for retailers, jumped 20.7% from a year earlier, the retailer said Wednesday in a statement. That’s almost double the estimate of 11.6% growth from Consensus Metrix, although down from 24.3% in the second quarter. Profit and gross margin also exceeded estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The results were “exceptionally strong,” Chuck Grom, an analyst with Gordon Haskett, said in a note. “It’s clear that Target is not only gaining new customers but also retaining them, which will be critical as we move into 2021.”Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said that Target is capturing market share as more shoppers use the company’s website and in-store pickup options. The Minneapolis-based retailer is seeing growth in categories such as electronics, home decor, apparel, and food and beverages, and executives said they see shopping continuing right through the end of the holiday season.“Home continues to be a focal point,” Cornell said during a call with media. “With all that time at home, guests are cooking more and replacing home decor.”The shares rose 2.8% to $167.64 at 9:44 a.m. in New York, reaching new all-time highs. Target climbed 27% this year through Tuesday.Echoing what fellow big-box retailers Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. reported on Tuesday, Target said customers are buying more when they’re shopping with basket size up 15.6% in the quarter. Unlike Walmart and Home Depot, which reported higher spending on fewer visits, Target said store traffic actually grew in the three months ended Oct. 31.Margins were helped by fewer price markdowns, although that was partially offset by costs related to the company’s push into e-commerce. The cost of sales, meanwhile, jumped 20% in the period -- a reflection of the price that companies are paying in 2020 for protective gear and more frequent store cleanings.Like other retailers upended by Covid-19, Target has been using its stores more as mini distribution centers for its booming digital business to better fulfill online orders. The company also remains bullish on its small-format store strategy, and says during an earnings call that it has room to boost sales per square foot: The average is in the high-$300 range, but some locations do more than $500.Holiday PreparationsAs the critically important holiday period hits the U.S., the industry is bracing for a shopping season that looks drastically different than previous years.Target, which will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, is relying more on e-commerce this year. Retailers have started advertisements earlier than ever to limit store crowds, while taking additional measures like limiting customers who shop in person, and adding pickup parking spots. Target began its holiday sales more than a month ago -- but it doesn’t believe the drawn-out shopping season will leave December barren.Cornell said he expects holiday sales to be strong, especially in categories like toys and electronics.“It’s important to be able to celebrate the holidays in some way,” Cornell said. Consumers “have started to shop earlier, but they still have a very long shopping list they have to fulfill.”Target still isn’t back to it’s pre-Covid inventory levels, and may face in-stock pressure as consumers continue to stock pantry shelves. As for 2021, the retailer is unable to provide a forecast. Next year “doesn’t get any clearer” because of the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said on the earnings call.(Updates shares in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Target’s Sales Soar Ahead of Crucial Holiday Shopping Period

2020-11-18,Home Depot shares slipped 2.54% Tuesday despite the home improvement retailer reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings.,Home Depot Slips Despite Topping Wall Street Forecasts
2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Lowe’s Cos Inc. slumped after reporting third-quarter earnings that narrowly missed analysts’ expectations, underscoring rising costs at home-improvement retailers that also hit rival Home Depot Inc.Earnings per share came in at $1.98 at Lowe’s, excluding some items, while analysts anticipated $2, on average. That’s the first time the company has missed on that metric since the period ended May 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlook for the current quarter also fell short of some estimates.The drivers for the underperformance were expenses due to store revamps and Covid-19-related expenses.At the same time, sales at Lowe’s and Home Depot have greatly benefited from being deemed essential retailers during the pandemic, buoying their stocks since the onset of the health crisis. With better-than-expected performance now a given for investors, Wall Street is focusing on costs, and, to a certain extent, a slowdown in sales growth compared with the peak of the summer season.“This will be a classic situation of very strong fundamental results, but short of investor expectations,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Lowe’s shares fell as much as 6.6% in New York trading. The stock had risen 33% this year through Tuesday’s close, one of the best performers on the S&P 500 Retailing Index this year.High DemandSame-store sales, a key retail metric, climbed 30.1% in the quarter ended Oct. 30, outpacing the 23.4% average estimate, but slower than the 35% increase in the previous quarter. By comparison, Home Depot on Tuesday reported a 24% gain in the period ended Nov. 1.Lowe’s is trying to maintain its expanded consumer base this holiday season by selling more gifts. Comparable sales are expected to gain as much as 20% in the fourth quarter, traditionally a slower time for home-improvement retailers. On a call with analysts, executives said furniture has been a strong category for the company.The downside is that adjusted operating income as a percentage of sales -- or the profit margin -- is expected to be flat, with investment in the supply chain another factor adding to expenses. And adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. The midpoint falls slightly short of analysts’ estimates, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Lowe’s is refurbishing stores partly to help customers at the pro business, which supplies professionals like contractors. It’s in the spotlight now that rival Home Depot announced plans to buy building products distributor HD Supply Holdings Inc., a big operator in the segment. Lowe’s said its pro business grew more than 20% in the most recent quarter and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said in an interview that the retailer still has a great service to offer them.Core BusinessBut rather than expand in adjacent markets, the chain has a multi-year plan that’s focused on improving its core business, which includes brick-and-mortar stores, its website and supply chain and technology.“Once we get past that life cycle, we’ll start to look at other more strategic investments and acquisitions, but for now we’re laser focused on the core,” Ellison said. “We think our greatest return will come from that.”Lowe’s will host an investor day on Dec. 9 to discuss future growth opportunities.(Updates share trading and adds detail from conference call in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Lowe’s Slumps After Missing Estimates as Expenses Pile Up

Our stance may sound a little odd considering the stellar performance in the major indexes over the last few days as investors have rejoiced at the good news about Covid-19 vaccines.
However, although we are excited about progress toward an end to the pandemic, retail sales numbers this week show that some of the support for the market is eroding in other areas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Retail Sales
We had a few big retail reports this week, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) on Tuesday. Both companies exceeded expectations, but warned about future demand. The U.S. Census Bureau also reported month-over-month retail spending for October on Tuesday, which missed growth estimates by 40%.
As you can see in the following chart, retail spending took a big hit when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in the first and second quarters this year. On the surface, the chart seems to imply that consumers have made up the losses and spending growth has continued, but that is only half true.
Source: Advance Real Retail and Food Service Sales — Chart Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

	
Since spending started to rise again in May, the U.S. economy is still down $51.3 billion in spending that would have otherwise happened.


					8 Tech Stocks That Could Benefit from a Biden Presidency				

The pandemic created a deficit of a little over $75 billion, to put this in perspective.
During the 2008-2009 recession, the deficit in consumer spending grew to nearly 10 times that size, so we aren’t worried about a collapse of the economy at this point, but the slowing rate of growth means significant gains in the market are less likely in the short term.
We still plan to keep some exposure to the retail sector, but we will continue to focus on companies that are likely to do well if lockdowns and other restrictions become common. Those pandemic risks are some of the reasons we are still very bullish on our positions in Chegg (NYSE:CHGG), Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).
Stimulus
The drama following the vote has distracted investors from the 900-pound gorilla in the room — another round of stimulus. Both Republicans and Democrats seem to favor a stimulus bill, but the amounts range from $500 billion to $2.2 trillion.
With many unemployment benefits due to expire next month, this could be the issue that makes or breaks the market this year.
At this point, we feel that some stimulus package passing by January is very likely. However, we are concerned that the amount of stimulus that passes both houses of Congress will miss the amount the market has “priced in.” We agree with Deutsche Bank analysts that the baseline assumption is probably in the $750 billion range, which makes the risk of a big disappointment a little less likely, but still an issue to consider.

In our view, this uncertainty will keep basic-materials stocks, equipment makers and most financial stocks in a range-bound market.
Although we regret that there might be some opportunity cost if we are called out on our Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) covered calls next week, the timing for reducing our exposure to the financial sector is about right. The fact that we’re getting out of the trade with some excellent profits from our many covered calls will help soothe any pain.
As you can see in the following chart, although energy stocks have enjoyed a nice rebound this week, the sector, as represented by the SPDR Energy Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE), is approaching the shoulders of the “head-and-shoulders” pattern that sent the fund to its lows in October.
Source: Daily Chart of the SPDR Energy Sector ETF (XLE) — Chart Source: TradingView

	
From a technical perspective, we think sectors like this are at resistance and will underperform unless the stimulus is much larger than expected.
The Election
As we mentioned previously, the post-election court fights and the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and press conference accusations of fraud have probably distracted many investors from other issues facing the market. That is entirely understandable, and we have been asked a lot of questions about potential risks this might create for the market.
At this point, the court cases seem to be losing steam as more of them fail and vote recounts in Georgia and audits in Pennsylvania reached their completion.
We stand by our comments we made on Oct. 28.
Uncertainty around a presidential transition is rare, but it happened with Bush v. Gore in 2000. The market survived.
In the 2000 presidential election, the market was already in decline, and the uncertainty didn’t help. But traders assumed the U.S. government’s institutional strength would keep things stable. We believe something similar is happening this time. We expect that any remaining uncertainty about the election will be resolved before the Dec. 8 “Safe Harbor” deadline ahead of the meeting of the electoral college.
The Bottom Line
As we mentioned last week, now that the major indexes have exceeded their prior highs, we think there will be some temporary profit-taking where prices may retrace a little or trend flat. If the S&P 500 declines in the short term, we recommend watching 3,400 as support. If that level holds, we would likely want to add more bullish exposure to the portfolio.
American Thanksgiving is next week, and it is usually a slow one for the market, which is good because it gives us some breathing room to get ready for the employment report for November that will be released on Dec. 4.
A slow week is usually good for option sellers like us because we can be pickier about our entry and exit prices.

2020-11-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Like just about everything else in 2020, Black Friday is not going to be normal. The annual shopping bonanza, usually typified by scenes of long lines and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds hunting for discounts, will be more restrained amid the resurgent pandemic. But sparse crowds this time shouldn’t necessarily be cause for concern for retailers – especially given a late-cresting wave of optimism about how the broader holiday season will shake out. Typically, retailers want their stores teeming with shoppers over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. This year? Not so much. To allow for social distancing, Walmart Inc., for example, has said its stores will allow 20% of their typical capacity on Black Friday, while Target Corp. will set limits on store by store. Most big chains will remain closed on Thanksgiving, a day that attracted 37.8 million in-store shoppers last year.Read more: How Retailers Should Prep for Weird Black Friday: Sarah HalzackBut a quieter Black Friday shouldn’t sting too badly if retailers’ other seasonal strategies are working out according to their plans. They began pummeling shoppers with Black Friday-like discounts ahead of the usual schedule. If that worked, then it shouldn’t be too concerning if crowds are thin this weekend. Retailers have also invested in their e-commerce operations, often by launching or building awareness of curbside pickup options, to make up for some of the lost in-store sales. Perhaps the best news for retailers ahead of this unusual Black Friday is the trail of recent breadcrumbs about consumers’ willingness to spend despite a raging pandemic and gloomy economy. Several retailers have delivered gangbusters earnings reports in recent days, including Best Buy Co., which said Tuesday that its 23% increase in third-quarter comparable sales was its best result on that measure in about 25 years. That followed similar blowout results from Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. last week.While there had been concern about how consumers would behave when their stimulus checks ran out and supplemental unemployment benefits ended, Walmart found its sales accelerated in September and October after a slower August. Home Depot executives said sales of Halloween items were strong, suggesting that, despite fewer parties, shoppers were looking to buy items to help them get in a holiday spirit. Lowe’s Cos. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. reported strong sales, a sign that the spending on nesting that was ushered in by the pandemic has continued in full force. Read more: Amazon Prime Day Adds to Retailers’ Scary October: Sarah HalzackOf course, those earnings reports are a snapshot in time for a period that for most retailers ended around Oct. 31. Since then, cases of Covid-19 have exploded, and the CDC has advised Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving. Several months ago, I thought such volatile and frightening conditions would send shoppers to the sidelines. My logic was: Why buy gifts for people you might not be able to see? Why buy new place settings for a Christmas dinner that may not happen? It turns out, that isn’t the calculus many shoppers are making, at least so far. Instead, based on consumer surveys and recent executive remarks, it appears that a sizeable group of consumers are plowing the money they would’ve spent on air travel, theater tickets and restaurant meals into skin cream, mattresses and all sorts of goods. You might say they’re engaging in retail therapy – soothing their pandemic sorrows with stuff.  On Monday, the National Retail Federation said it expects a 3.6% to 5.2% holiday season sales increase, which, especially at the upper end of the range, would constitute quite healthy growth. The trade group’s chief economist said in a press release the upbeat figure takes into account a “psychological factor” in which shoppers decide they “owe it to themselves” to splurge. The NRF’s outlook is sunnier than forecasts that came earlier in the fall, reflecting recent flashes of shopper resilience. While retailers’ holiday season prospects look better than they did a couple of months ago, investors shouldn’t overdo it. (Sending shares of Macy’s Inc. up 15% on Monday, for example, smacked of getting carried away.)  The worsening Covid-19 situation could bring new local restrictions that force a fresh round of store closings, or could cause people to voluntarily stay at home. Certain types of retailers, especially department stores, will find it harder than others to get a piece of the spending pie. And while foot traffic is vastly better than at its trough, it is nowhere near normal. These conditions could end up dealing a devastating blow to the malls and chains teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. But shoppers will be seeking some semblance of normalcy or indulgence, and retailers will benefit if they can provide it – whether in the form of a Nerf gun, a diamond necklace or a fancy Christmas roast. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-11-30,"Home Depot (NYSE: HD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved down to $272.98 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-18  * Strike Price: $270.00  * Volume: 363  * Open Interest: 1411Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Home Depot: Q3 Earnings Insights  * A Look Into Home Depot's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-30,"(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders have prompted many to re-think their relationships. In the case of industrial distributor HD Supply Holdings Inc., lock-down restrictions pushed it back into the arms of Home Depot Inc. 13 years after the two divorced.The $8.7 billion acquisition propelled North American building materials deals to an all-time high of $15.2 billion, and several more transactions are expected before the year ends. The previous record of $10.27 billion was set in 2007 at the peak of the pre-crash housing boom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The deal announced this month reverses Home Depot’s 2007 sale of HD Supply to a group of buyout firms and gives the Atlanta-based chain -- already with legions of do-it-yourself customers -- greater access to professional contractors. Business in both categories has been buoyed by families decamping from cities to buy larger homes in suburban and exurban areas, as well as by remodel projects to accommodate work-from-home living.“Typically building products investors are skeptical of deals in adjacent markets, and most of the high-profile adjacent transactions have received, at best, mixed reviews from the street,” Matt McClure, managing director and global co-head of industrials at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an interview. “However, in the current environment, adjacent deals have been well received.”More than 50 million homes in the U.S. are more than two decades old, according to the research company Statista. A shift toward suburban living by millennials, now the largest segment of the population, is set to create a multi-year cycle of increased dealmaking in the sector as homeowners embark on bathroom and kitchen remodels and other large projects, in addition to the smaller, cosmetic fixes required by aging structures.“We’re seeing the largest volume of consumer-facing building products deals in at least a decade, with momentum that we expect to carry on well into next year,” Frank Sellman, managing director at Moelis & Co., said in an interview. “Quarantine demonstrated the benefits of larger, single family homes with extra space at a time when America’s largest demographic is beginning to form families.”Home Depot follows in the footsteps of Builders FirstSource Inc. and BMC Stock Holdings Inc., which announced an all-stock merger in August in a deal valued at $2.46 billion. That deal will create one of the largest suppliers in North America, with $11 billion in combined revenue, generated across more than 500 sites, according to a statement.Clearlake, DimoraFinancial sponsors are looking for opportunities for consolidation to create scale amid the surge, too. Clearlake Capital Group agreed to buy Dimora Brands from the Jordan Co. last week, after buying Primesource from Platinum Equity earlier this month. Clearlake co-founder and managing partner José E. Feliciano and partner Colin Leonard said in a statement that they would “continue executing a consolidation strategy in this highly fragmented market.”A representative for Clearlake declined to comment beyond the statement as to whether it intended combine Primesource and Dimora or execute separate buy-and-build strategies.More opportunities for expansion are possible with transactions that could be completed this year. They include Specialty Building Products and Hillman Group Inc. being sold by buyout firms Madison Dearborn Partners and CCMP Capital respectively, according to people familiar with those situations. Such deals, which would add another $3 billion to the year’s total, are becoming more expensive for buyers.“Branded building products that consumers care about are outperforming,” said McClure, whose team advised HD Supply on deal with Home Depot.Azek UpliftThe uplift in valuations was reflected in Azek Co. being taken public in June by Ares Capital Management and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. Azek had posted a loss of $5.8 million for the six months ending March 31 and had a debt load of more than $1 billion. Still, it upsized its initial public offering and priced the shares above the marketed range to raise $879 million including so-called greenshoe shares.The Chicago-based company’s opening valuation of 19 times forward earnings already made it an outlier in industrial listings. With its shares up 49% month since the IPO, Azek has been touching highs close to 30 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc. and Masco Corp., two publicly traded peers, are also getting valuation premiums relative to historical averages.Suppliers focused on the commercial sector are witnessing the inverse of the exuberance for the residential market.Commercial Unclear“The lack of clarity regarding the mix of office against working from home has deterred investment in new building and large scale renovation of office and retail units,” Moelis’s Sellman said.Few commercial deals are expected in the near term, with only those assets viewed as best in class, such as Firestone Building Products, expected to trade hands.Residential construction-oriented assets will continue to be an investment focus, said Rocque Lipford, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s global co-head of basic materials whose team represented Home Depot on the HD Supply deal.“There is some chance future repair and remodel spending was pulled forward into 2020 but it’s likely the increased demand for single family homes is here to stay into 2021,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Home Depot Deal Raises Buildings Materials M&A to Record Height

2020-12-10,"(Bloomberg) -- New York City is stepping up pressure on Walmart Inc., McDonald’s Corp., Nike Inc. and almost two dozen other major companies, asking them to release workforce data on race and gender or face a shareholder vote next year. The 24 companies, which also include Ford Motor Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and Home Depot Inc., ignored a request in July from the city to release private data they give on race and gender to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, New York Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement Thursday. The reports give critical insight into workforce demographics at the biggest corporations across several different employment classes, including top management.The proposal is being spearheaded by Stringer and the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers Retirement System and the Board of Education Retirement System. If the companies don’t agree to disclose the data, their shareholders will be asked to vote on nonbinding proposals requiring disclosure at their next annual meeting. “Racism must be fought with concrete action, not corporate slogans,” Stringer said.The initiative is part of a broader push to increase workforce transparency and diversity at companies that have voiced support for equality after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the disproportionate death rates of minorities from Covid-19.  Some companies refuse to publicly disclose the EEOC forms because they see the data categories as too general and not specific to the unique aspects of their workforces. 3M Co. said it would release a new diversity report in 2021 that includes its EEOC form. Boeing Co. said it had no plans to release its EE0C form, but said it was “committed to increasing transparency by publishing our representation annually starting in 2021."" International Business Machines Corp. also said it wouldn’t release the data, while Kraft Heinz Co. declined to comment. Charles Schwab Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. said they are reviewing the request. Home Depot said it hasn’t announced plans to make the form public.A Bloomberg analysis in October found that only 25 companies in the S&P 100 were willing to release the so-called EEO-1 forms to the public. The reports are considered the gold standard for diversity disclosure because they are submitted by all companies with 100 or more employees, using the same rules and format. There’s little or no added cost to release them to the public. Morgan Stanley, which was on the initial New York City list, released its EEOC data in late November as part of its first-ever diversity report. Large money managers also are exerting pressure on corporations. State Street Global Advisors, which manages about $3 trillion, in August said that it will ask companies for information on their goals for racial diversity, while Calvert Research and Management, one of the oldest and biggest socially responsible fund managers, in June said it will make a greater push for companies to disclose diversity data. Nasdaq Inc., meanwhile, will require all listed members to add at least one diverse board member and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will no longer do initial public offerings of companies without a diverse member on their boards.(Updates with quote from Scott Stringer in fourth paragraph. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",NYC Steps Up Pressure on Major Companies to Release Diversity Data

Since then, tech has been hot, while sectors like solar and electric vehicles have posted stunning and quick rallies.
To some extent, the easy money in short-term stocks probably has been made. The U.S. and the world are approaching a return to normalcy, even if progress will remain uneven.

Great Short-Term Stocks: Alibaba (BABA)

BABA stock has been pummeled by bad news over the past month or so. The initial public offering of Ant Financial, in which Alibaba has a one-third stake, was suspended after the Chinese government stepped in. That same government a few days later issued antitrust guidelines that seemed to target Alibaba and other “big tech” companies in China.
As a result, and despite a strong fiscal second quarter earnings release in early November, Alibaba stock has pulled back 17% from late October highs.
But we’ve been here before. Investors often have become nervous about BABA and other large-cap Chinese stocks, for a number of reasons. Whether it’s the “trade war” or political risk, Alibaba seemingly always has a short-term obstacle to clear. Even before the company went public in 2014, investors were convinced that the Chinese economy was headed for a “hard landing.”
Each time, BABA has powered through. It’s hard to see why this time will be different. The negative headlines will fade. Attention will turn to the new administration in the U.S., and an almost staggeringly cheap valuation for Alibaba, which now trades at just 21x forward earnings. Simply returning to late October levels suggests 20% upside, making BABA stock one of the better short-term stocks to buy.

Famed investor Joel Greenblatt is well-known for targeting spin-offs, in which a company separates one of its businesses as a new, publicly traded company. Spin-offs usually are executed to allow investors direct ownership of the more attractive business, which supposedly “unlocks value” as the standalone entity can better prove its worth.
That logic, however, usually leads shares of the less attractive company to plunge. After all, shareholders now can own the segment they wanted all along. They can, and usually do, dump the part of the business that (again, by this logic) supposedly was depressing the valuation of the combined company before the spin.
As Greenblatt and others have noted, that often creates a somewhat counterintuitive opportunity. The better business often rises too far; the weaker business gets too cheap.
That might be what is happening with Aaron’s at the moment. The rent-to-own retailer actually was the company spun off, with the remaining company renamed PROG Holdings (NYSE:PRG). AAN stock initially traded at $30; it’s below $18 barely a week later.

There are challenges for Aaron’s, which is dealing not just with the novel coronavirus pandemic but a multi-year record of weak same-store sales. But down more than 40%, this seems like a classic spin-off opportunity, and one that should grab investor attention sooner rather than later. That makes AAN stock one of the best short-term stocks, even if the longer-term outlook remains cloudy.

Foley Trasimene Acquisition (WPF)
Source: Shutterstock

	
SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, have been the best short-term stocks of 2020, and perhaps ever. SPACs disrupt the traditional IPO process, allowing a private company to merge with an already-public company instead of listing its own shares.
Some of the biggest winners of 2020 — DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR), to name just two — used SPACs to go public. Most others at least have seen a nice “pop” from a pre-merger price usually around $10.
Foley Trasimene Acquisition hasn’t yet picked a target. But it’s a good bet it will soon, and that WPF stock will rally on the news. The SPAC is led by William Foley, who has made investors billions in stocks like Black Knight (NYSE:BKI), Cannae Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) and many others. Foley’s second SPAC, Foley Trasimene II (NYSE:BFT), has rallied more than 20% in just a few sessions after agreeing to merge with payments platform Paysafe.
Foley Trasimene thus seems due for a deal of its own. Given Foley’s track record, it seems likely the market will like that deal as well. WPF already has been bid up toward $11 in the wake of the Paysafe deal, but the track record of Foley himself and SPACs as a whole suggests there should be more upside ahead.

Malibu Boats (MBUU)

Many of the short-term stocks investors might consider are those that have seen a sharp dip. MBUU stock is not one of those stocks.
In fact, MBUU has held up reasonably well over the past few months. Like a number of cyclical stocks, it plunged in March and into early April. But as investors realized the pandemic would lead to higher purchases of big-ticket products like boats and recreational vehicles, Malibu better than tripled from the lows.
There’s room for another rally from here. Its valuation is attractive, at 11x forward earnings. Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) sees higher demand continuing into 2021, at least. And Malibu has outperformed not just Brunswick, but smaller rivals like Mastercraft Boat Holdings (NASDAQ:MCFT) and Marine Products (NYSE:MPX).


					9 Stocks to Buy for a Divided Government				

In other words, there’s a long-term story here. But there’s a short-term case as well. Malibu is coming off a strong quarter last month, which included its own bullish outlook for demand. The chart looks favorable, with MBUU stock consolidating over the past few months, and now building up steam to challenge resistance. At some point, the stock is likely to break through, and then break out.

Home Depot (HD)
Source: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com

	
From a long-term perspective, I’ve been skeptical toward, and mostly wrong about, Home Depot stock. From a short-term perspective, however, there seems a strong case for a rally.
After all, HD stock surprisingly has struggled of late. It has gained less than 3% over the past six months, significantly underperforming the broader market. A recent pullback led the stock to touch a five-month low this week.
It’s likely that investors are somewhat nervous about 2021 performance. Huge growth this year — same-store sales rose a stunning 24% in the fiscal third quarter — sets up tough comparisons next year. The pandemic may well have pulled forward demand as well.
But at this point, HD stock seems likely to once again get the benefit of the doubt from the market. And the long-term outlook should be improving. Elsewhere in the market, investors are pricing in an exodus from urban areas to the suburbs, and from apartments to homes. Both trends should provide a multi-year boost to Home Depot results once the difficult comparisons are lapped.
Simply put, Home Depot seems like a pandemic winner, but it hasn’t been treated as such lately. It’s possible that valuation concerns are a factor, but assuming the market holds up, the negative trend seems likely to reverse in the not-too-distant future.

Array Technologies (ARRY)
Source: Shutterstock

	
Solar stocks have sizzled this year. The Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) has gained 173% year-to-date. Some of the best short-term stocks of late have come from the sector. Meanwhile, IPOs are hot, with Doordash (NYSE:DASH) the latest new issue to see overwhelming demand.
And yet ARRY stock has flatlined. The manufacturer of trackers for solar installations closed its first day of trading at $36.45. It sits at almost exactly the same level at the moment.
That seems likely to change. ARRY stock seems to have found a bottom in recent sessions after falling from $50 to $35. Its valuation is not terribly onerous, at 41x forward earnings, given the growth potential and valuations elsewhere in the sector.

IPOs usually see quite a bit of volatility as investors try and parse the impact of lock-up expirations, and a low float magnifies the impact of trading. ARRY has seen that volatility so far, but it’s important to remember that volatility can cut both ways. There seems to be too much optimism behind similar stocks for ARRY stock to struggle for too long.

Salesforce (CRM)
Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com

	
Investors apparently did not like Salesforce’s acquisition of Slack (NYSE:WORK). CRM stock declined more than 8% the day after the deal was confirmed. That followed weak trading heading into the official announcement. CRM stock now sits at $220, down 15% in a month and off 22% from its 52-week high.
In fact, the last time Salesforce stock traded this low was on Aug. 25. After that day’s close, Salesforce delivered one of the best earnings reports you’ll see from a mega-cap company. CRM stock rallied 26% on the news.
Yet investors now can buy the stock essentially at the pre-earnings price. That seems like an opportunity. The Slack deal may have been expensive, but the cash-and-stock deal still had a valuation of roughly $28 billion (and actually less at the current CRM stock price). Salesforce has lost nearly $20 billion in market capitalization just since the deal was announced.
This seems like a massive overreaction, with investors focusing on the deal and ignoring both the blowout quarter and Salesforce’s long history of success. Without exaggeration, this is one of the best companies in history, and CRM one of the best stocks. At some point soon, investors will remember that, even if sentiment toward the Slack deal takes some time to reverse.

Big Lots (BIG)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com

	
Discount retailer Big Lots has done basically everything right this year. Earnings have been impressive. A sale-leaseback agreement on its distribution centers raised capital and unlocked value.
To some extent, the market has rewarded the progress: BIG stock has gained 60% so far in 2020. But of late, investors have shrugged. Another strong report last week actually sent the stock down 11%.
There’s a case for a reversal. The chart looks favorable, with support holding yet again around $45. Its valuation remains attractive, with BIG trading at less than 8x forward earnings. Execution has improved, and Big Lots finally seems to be finding its niche in a crowded discount space.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

Retailers always are dangerous, and a “second wave” of the pandemic could hit holiday results and investor sentiment. Still, there seem plenty more reasons to buy BIG then to sell it, which suggests the post-earnings selloff is an opportunity, not a warning.

Accel Entertainment (ACEL)
Source: Shutterstock

	
Even with the pandemic’s resurgence, investors have been bidding up “return to normalcy” plays. Cruise operators and airlines, to name just two sectors, have rallied nicely in recent weeks. Progress in the race towards a vaccine has led investors to look forward to better times.
ACEL stock should be a beneficiary. The distributor and installer of VLTs (video lottery terminals) has seen its 2020 results collapse amid shutdowns in Illinois, its home market. As bars reopen, revenue should bounce back. Yet the stock hasn’t received the same credit; it continues to trade sideways, and is down 22% so far this year.
That should change, and perhaps in a hurry. Online gambling stocks have soared in part because of a belief that more states will legalize more types of gambling to raise revenue. At some point, investors should realize that thesis applies to VLTs as well.
In other words, there are two trends that ACEL is missing out on right now. Only one needs to be applied for ACEL to find a rally.

Polaris (PII)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com

	
The case for Polaris stock is similar to that of Malibu Boats. Polaris has a boating division, though it’s better known for its motorcycles and ATVs (all-terrain vehicles). Across the board, Polaris’ end markets should be posting growth that extends in 2020 at least.
But Polaris too could benefit from the same urban exodus that is expected to help the housing market and the likes of Home Depot. More room should mean more “toys.” As one of the biggest and best manufacturers in the world, Polaris is an obvious beneficiary.


					7 Retail Stocks Getting Coal This Year				

Yet PII stock hasn’t budged for some six months, even as housing market trends confirm the tailwinds behind the company. Better-than-expected economic data should provide another boost. There’s seemingly too much good news here for PII to end the year in the red; yet the stock at the moment is off more than 7% in 2020. Perhaps it takes until next year, but there’s no reason Polaris stock can’t post a big rally in a hurry.

2020-12-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic delivered a core-shaking shock to the consumer-goods industry, abruptly reshaping what people were buying where they were buying, and how they were buying. For some companies, it has led to deep damage that is still fully revealing itself. For others, it has created opportunity.As 2020 comes to close, it’s worth reflecting on these changes and where they have left the sector heading into 2021. Here, 10 charts tell the tale:Toilet paper on a roll. As the reality of the pandemic came into focus for consumers in mid-March, the grocery business was gripped by a wave of pantry-loading that resulted in massive spikes in sales of certain products — and eventually, empty shelves. In a single week in March, sales of liquid hand soap soared 320% from a year earlier, while purchases of frozen meat climbed 132% and sales of toilet paper surged 236%. Hand sanitizer, meanwhile, was in such demand that year-over-year sales skyrocketed more than 1,000% in each week from early May to early July. Such extraordinary jolts of buying fever scrambled the consumer products industry, with brands taking steps such as bringing on third-party manufacturing partners and dropping less popular items to focus on the production of top sellers. Although demand has retreated from the frenzy of the early days of the pandemic, sales of consumer packaged goods have still held above last year’s levels. With widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines months away and many people still spending a large chunk of their time at home, strong sales in this category are likely to continue.Online grocery carts fill up. Before the pandemic, grocery was something of a final frontier in e-commerce, remaining mostly untouched by retail’s digital transformation. Even though supermarkets and big-box stores were able to stay open throughout spring lockdowns, masses of shoppers decided to try online grocery shopping — include curbside pickup — for the first time or began doing more of it as a safety precaution. Some consumers will go back to their old, store-centric routine after the crisis is over, but many will stick to their new shopping habits. Years from now, this will be remembered as a tipping point for adoption, and one that significantly altered the showdown between Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co.Big tickets. As customers adhered to social-distancing guidelines, they packed their spending into a limited number of stock-up trips and skipped the in-between, fill-in stops. This behavior is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the results of Walmart’s U.S. business, where declines in transactions, a proxy for traffic, have been more than offset by a boom in ticket, or the average amount spent per order. Relatedly, this unusual year brought changes in conversion, or the rate at which shoppers go from browsing to buying. When consumers set foot in a store in this environment, their intent to buy something was quite strong. That’s why, for example, there was such a disparity in the decrease in foot traffic recorded over Black Friday weekend — down 42% from last year, according to RetailNext — and the drop in brick-and-mortar sales, which was only 24%.Stuff Rules. Millions of Americans lost their jobs or experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic, a dynamic that threatened to decimate retailers’ sales. That’s not how things played out, though. While some consumers have moved to the sidelines amid the economic gloom, others are redirecting the dollars they might once have spent on plane tickets, hotel stays or movie tickets toward retailers, perhaps to buy a new big-screen TV or home-gym equipment. The fact that consumers have had so few options for spending on experiences has made the retail industry’s recovery easier. The tables will likely turn when vaccines are distributed widely and pent-up demand for travel and other services is unleashed. Spending Shift. Social distancing and lockdowns rearranged our lifestyles and in doing so, rechanneled our demand. The result: sales for some products froze up and caught fire for others. It was a bleak year, of course, for purchases of dressy clothes and lipstick. But there was softness in less-obvious places, too: ConAgra Brands Inc. said demand for edible seeds declined when baseball seasons were canceled, while Mondelez International Inc. said chewing-gum sales fell as social outings dwindled. At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth. As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Home Depot earned $6.07 billion, and sales totaled $38.05 billion in Q2.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Home Depot posted an ROCE of 3.16%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on HDReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.In Home Depot's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Insight Home Depot reported Q3 earnings per share at $3.18/share, which beat analyst predictions of $3.05/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For January 13, 2021(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Dividend stocks are seen as a safe, boring play on safe, boring companies. However, this association is often undeserved. Many companies that pay dividends to shareholders also generate strong growth. They are strong enough to easily able to return cash to investors each quarter, while continuing to invest aggressively into themselves for growth as well. It’s the best of both worlds. 8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal Here are 3 dividend stocks to buy for yield and growth:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Home Depot (NYSE:HD) Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) The following dividend stocks have market-beating yields, plus the potential to raise their dividends at a high rate in the years ahead. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD) Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Home Depot has generated excellent growth over the past several years as it benefited from the booming housing market. Over the past decade, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, consumers invested more of their dollars into home renovations. The coronavirus pandemic only accelerated this trend, as consumers were forced to spend much more time at home. As the world’s largest home improvement retailer, Home Depot has benefited greatly from these trends, as annual sales now exceed $100 billion. Home Depot’s growth only increased even further in 2020, despite the weakness in the broader economy. In the third quarter of 2020, Home Depot’s revenue grew 23% to $33.5 billion. Sales per retail square foot rose by 23%, while comparable sales (measuring sales at locations open for at least one year) increased 24%. Earnings-per-share increased 26% for the quarter. The company has done an excellent job responding to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, investing heavily in its own e-commerce platform. This has helped Home Depot continue to grow amid the changing landscape toward online shopping, while so many other physical retailers have struggled to adapt. Last quarter, sales leveraging Home Depot’s online channels increased roughly 80% year-over-year. Shareholders have benefited from this growth through strong increases to the dividend in recent years. The company managed to raise its dividend by 10% last year, even in a very difficult climate for the U.S. economy. Home Depot has paid a dividend for over 30 consecutive years, and has increased its dividend for more than 10 years in a row. Home Depot is a Dividend Contender with a current yield of 2.2%. Amgen (AMGN) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Amgen is a major U.S. biotech, with a market cap of $138 billion. The best biotech stocks are known for rapid growth, and Amgen is no exception. In the past five years, the stock has generated annualized returns of 13% per year including dividends. Its strong returns to shareholders have come from its impressive growth. Amgen is an industry giant that produces therapies specifically addressing cardiovascular disease, oncology, bone health, neuroscience, nephrology, and inflammation. 2020 was another year of growth for Amgen, despite the lingering headwind of the global recession amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company reported fourth-quarter and full-year operating results on February 2. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 7% to $6.6 billion driven by volume growth, which more than offset pressure from lower selling prices. Volumes grew 13% indicating strong demand for the company’s products, led by Otezla, MVASI, and Repatha. Adjusted earnings-per-share increased 5% for the quarter. For the full year, total revenue increased 9% to over $25 billion, while adjusted earnings-per-share increased 12% to $16.60 in 2020. Free cash flow increased 16.5% to $9.9 billion last year. Amgen’s competitive advantages include its strong pharmaceutical assets as well as its robust pipeline. Amgen spent 17% of its 2020 revenue on research and development expenses, to invest in a replenished pipeline. As a result, it has a well-stocked pipeline to fuel its future growth. Its investments in R&D and its product pipeline will fuel the company’s future growth. Due to the company’s strong growth and excellent cash flow generation, it has the ability to pay a hefty dividend and raise the payout each year. Amgen currently yields 3%, which is approximately double the average yield of the broader S&P 500 Index right now. Amgen also generates a high level of dividend growth. It increased its dividend by 10% for the 2021 first quarter payout. 8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal Over the past 5 years, the company has increased its dividend by an average of 12% per year. As a result, Amgen is an attractive combination of dividend yield and growth. BlackRock (BLK) Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers in the U.S., with a market capitalization of $110 billion. BlackRock and BLK stock have benefited greatly from the shift to exchange-traded funds. For the past several years, an increasing number of investors have taken their money out of costly mutual funds which often carried high annual expense ratios of 1% or more, plus additional fees. Instead, many investors have flocked to the convenience and cost savings of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. BlackRock has grown alongside this trend, as it is one of the largest ETF sponsors with its iShares products. Assets under management have continued to grow due to the ongoing popularity of ETFs. At the end of 2020, BlackRock’s AUM reached $8.68 trillion. Last year the company saw $391 billion of full-year total net inflows, reflecting 5% organic asset growth. 2020 was another year of strong growth for BlackRock. In the fourth quarter, average AUM and revenue each increased 13% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings-per-share increased 22%, due to revenue growth as well as share repurchases. For the full year, revenue increased 11% to $16.2 billion while adjusted EPS increased 19% to $33.82. The trend towards index funds and low-cost ETFs shows no signs of slowing down. For this reason, investors can expect continued growth for BlackRock. The company is also shareholder-friendly as it shares its growth with shareholders. The stock has a current dividend yield of 2.3%, and the most recent quarterly dividend payment was a 14% increase from the previous dividend payout. Over the past five years, dividends have grown at a compound annual rate of 12.5%. With a 2020 dividend payout ratio of 43%, BlackRock has plenty of room to grow dividends at a high rate moving forward.

2021-02-19,"Home Depot (NYSE: HD) stock has barely kept pace with the market's rally over the last year, even losing ground to peers across the retailing industry.  Let's look at some key trends to watch in Home Depot's report, set for early on Tuesday, Feb. 23.  The pandemic has sped growth in the home improvement and home furnishings niches, and Home Depot wasn't left out of that rally.",Home Depot Earnings: 3 Trends to Watch
2021-02-19,"Real estate firm Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ: Z) recently reported a great quarter, exceeding the company’s own outlook and sending its shares up by double digits. “Homes are flying off the shelves,” CEO Richard Barton told CNBC in an interview. Which could be great news for Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) and Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE: LOW) as those two home improvement retailers prepare to issue earnings reports of their own next Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, the old saying goes, and the booming real estate market has investors optimistic that the home improvement sector can continue to benefit. Home sales rose 5.6% last year to the highest pace since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). If 2020 was the year it felt like everyone was moving to larger homes for more space where they could hunker down with their families, then 2021 might be the year when those same home buyers look around at the four surrounding walls and start thinking about what they don’t like and how to change it. If that’s the case, HD and LOW are perfectly positioned thanks to all they’ve been doing. However, both companies will soon be comparing earnings with their 2020 results, which benefited from the pandemic. That means some analysts think further earnings gains might be a bit more limited as 2021 proceeds, a possible reason why shares of both companies are about as flat lately as that kitchen counter you’re planning to install. Comeback Kid And The Old Veteran LOW has been on the comeback trail as the momentum player the last few quarters, posting several strong earnings results in a row. HD has been more of the rock-solid old hand (see chart below). FIGURE 1: LOW SHARES WAY AHEAD OF HD. This one-year chart of Lowe’s (LOW—blue line) vs. Home Depot (HD—purple line) shows LOW running way ahead of the S&P 500 Index (SPX—candlestick), while HD has lagged vs. the SPX. Shares of both HD and LOW have been a bit on the flat side over the last three months as some investors wonder if the best pandemic sales might be behind the companies and worry about tough comparisons ahead. Data sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, NYSE. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Where they both compete heavily is for business from small contractors, the people you hire to build a new bathroom or kitchen. Recognizing that, both stores—HD in particular—have reached out to the on-the-go retail shopper and small contractor with more pick-up and delivery options during the pandemic. For instance, HD recently made it easier for small contractors to park near the stores to ease logistics. With both companies’ earnings reports, the makeup of sales growth and projections will likely matter to investors. They may tolerate weakness in the “do-it-yourself” category as long as there’s positive news from the professional segment. Stocks Diverge As Lowe’s Gains Ground The two companies may be benefitting from the same tailwinds, but their stocks haven’t flocked together. LOW is up 43% over the last year, more than double the S&P 500 Index (SPX). HD, however, is up just 14%, trailing the SPX. Of course, it’s not totally an apples-to-apples comparison. HD, with a market-cap of nearly $300 billion, is more than twice the size of LOW. Also, HD has twice the dividend yield of LOW, meaning investors have benefitted in other ways from owning it besides direct market gains. (Though it’s important to note that dividend continuance is never guaranteed). Last month, HD got an upgrade from a Guggenheim analyst, who said company spending should slow later this year and help margins. Guggenheim also thinks HD might begin to repurchase shares at some point this year. That, along with higher margins, a healthy housing market, and success with consumers it attracted during the pandemic, leaves the analyst confident about Home Depot “re-establishing the path to high-single-digit EPS growth,” Barron’s reported. HD hasn’t stood still. Last November, it announced an agreement to acquire HD Supply Holdings, Inc., a leading national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products in the multifamily and hospitality end markets. At the time, HD said it expected the $8 billion acquisition to accelerate sales growth and be accretive to earnings in fiscal 2021. Analysts say this positions HD well in a $55 billion market. Listen for potential updates on this deal during HD’s call. It’s also potentially a shot across the bow at LOW, which is also trying to position itself in the so-called “professionals” market, meaning those small contractors we talked about earlier, not just do-it-yourselfers. Lowe’s And Home Depot Earnings And Options Activity When Lowe’s releases results ahead of the bell on Feb 24, it’s expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.20, vs. $0.94 the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $19.33 billion according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is expected to be up 20.6% year-over-year. Options traders have priced in about a 4.4% stock move in either direction around the upcoming earnings release Implied volatility was at the 18th percentile as of Thursday morning. Looking at the Feb. 26 options expiration, calls have seen activity at the 180 strike, while put activity has been light, with a concentration at the 172.5 strike. +++++++++++++++++++++++++ Home Depot—which reports ahead of the open on Tuesday, Feb 23—is expected to report adjusted EPS of $2.59 vs. $2.28 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $30.56 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is expected to be up 18.5% year-over-year. Options traders have priced in about a 2.8% stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release. Implied volatility has been muted—at the 9th percentile as of Thursday morning. Looking at the Feb 26 options expiration, put activity has been relatively quiet, with small concentrations at the 250 and 265 strikes. Calls have seen a bit more activity, particularly at the 290 strike.

Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Can Q4 Sales Growth Match A Sizzling Q3? HD had an amazing Q3, with sales up 24%, but the stock sagged lately. Some analysts worry that HD (and, to some extent, LOW) won’t be able to sustain 2020 levels of growth once the pandemic recedes. One thing investors may want to listen for on the calls is what executives have to say about the rest of the year. HD has shied away from providing a full-year outlook, at least so far. Will that change? Another thing HD investors are watching is expenses. The company charged ahead as a good corporate citizen last time out, announcing that some of the temporary employee compensation programs it started during the pandemic will become permanent wage increases. That means around $1 billion in additional expenses per year. It’s hard to fault a company for supporting its employees during these tough times—in fact, it’s worth a salute. But in dollars and cents terms, that might be one factor taking a small bite out of earnings growth. Last time out, LOW delivered a slight disappointment with Q3 earnings. Its outlook came in a little short of Wall Street analysts’ expectations, hurt by higher costs and rising expenses in its e-commerce platform. Same-store sales did rise 30% year-over-year for LOW in Q3, so that could be a level to watch in Q4 to see if the momentum carried over. There was no sign of a slowdown in the housing market at the end of last year, which is why some analysts remain optimistic that LOW and HD could report strong sales growth again in their Q4 results. Another thing to listen and look for when the companies report is how their executives see things playing out if there’s another government stimulus. Political chatter in Washington is that a $1.9 trillion stimulus, which would include $1,400 checks to many Americans, is likely to pass Congress and be signed by President Biden next month. A stimulus that sent $600 checks took effect in December, and January U.S. retail sales jumped 5.3%. So evidently, those checks are getting spent. More checks to consumers could potentially wind up being more money in the bank for retailers like HD and LOW. The equation gets even better if the economy continues to recover from Covid. One near-term worry, however, is how the frigid February weather across much of the U.S. might affect sales for big retailers. Early indications point to a bit of a slowdown, especially in states like Texas that were hard hit by the storms and not used to digging out of snow. Of course, if the snow and ice damaged homes, that’s another potential opportunity for the home improvement business.

2021-02-23,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 123.8%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Home Depot Struggles: One company that has been a solid investment in the past five years is home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD). Home Depot is one of countless brick-and-mortar retailers that have thrived in the face of online competition from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in recent years. The downturn in the U.S. housing market hit Home Depot hard back in 2008 and 2009, forcing the company to issue aggressive layoffs and close 54 stores. Fortunately, a leaner Home Depot was then positioned to thrive in the 2010s. Under CEO Craig Menear’s leadership, Home Depot consistently reported same-store sales growth that outpaced not only the rest of the retail sector, but also top competitor Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE: LOW) in the past five years. Americans stuck at home in 2021 poured money into home improvement projects, sending Home Depot’s sales numbers into record territory. At the beginning of 2016, Home Depot shares were trading at around $130. Home Depot dropped as low as $109.62 in early 2016. Fortunately, that level would mark the stock’s low point of the past five years as Home Depot consistently put up impressive same-store sales growth numbers. The stock broke $200 for the first time in early 2018, hitting $215.43 mid-year before pulling back. Home Depot bounced at $158.09 in late 2018 and was back at hew all-time highs by summer 2019. Related Link: ,000, 5 Years Later: Walmart Stock A Beacon For Investors Home Depot In 2021, Beyond: Home Depot took a big hit along with the rest of the market in March 2020. The stock dropped as low as $140.63, rebounding a new all-time high of $292.95 in mid-2020. Since then, the stock has pulled back to around $278. Home Depot investors who bought five years ago and held on have generated a solid return on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in Home Depot stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $2,582 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting new highs for Home Depot in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 29 analysts covering the stock is $312, suggesting 12.2% upside from current levels.

2021-02-23,"Home Depot Inc. delivered better-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter as the home improvement retailer saw an increase in the number of customer transactions along with higher average ticket size of purchases during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the outperformance, shares of Home Depot (HD) dropped about 2.5% in Tuesday’s pre-opening trading session. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.65 during the fourth quarter, which came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of $2.61. Revenue increased 25.1% year-on-year to $32.3 billion topping analysts’ estimates of $30.66 billion. Sales grew as the number of customer transactions in 4Q jumped 12.8% to 416.8 million year-on-year. Average purchase ticket size also increased to $75.69 from $68.29 in the year-ago period. For fiscal 2020, the company generated sales of $132.1 billion, up from the $110.2 billion posted in 2019. Diluted earnings per share came in at $11.94 versus $10.25 in the comparable year-ago period. Home Depot CEO Craig Menear said, “Our ability to grow the business by over $21 billion in fiscal 2020 is a testament to both the investments we have made in the business as well as our associates’ unwavering commitment to our customers.” While the company did not provide any guidance for 2021, its Executive Vice President and CFO Richard McPhail commented, “If the demand environment during the back half of fiscal 2020 were to persist through fiscal 2021, it would imply flat to slightly positive comparable sales growth and operating margin of at least 14 percent.” (See Home Depot stock analysis on TipRanks) Home Depot also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.65, representing a 10% increase over the previous dividend. Last month Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and maintained a price target to of $310 (12.4% upside potential). Forbes cited “The HD Supply acquisition, recent $3 billion debt offering by the company and a more moderate valuation which stands in contrast to the stock’s historical premium.” The rest of the Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 6 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target of $311.80 implies about 13% upside potential from current levels.

2021-02-24,"The king of do-it-yourself retail reported its latest quarterly figures on Tuesday and investors reacted on earnings beat by trading down the stock. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) benefited as the pandemic and a strong real estate market bolstered home improvement sales. But the retailer did not provide an outlook due to the uncertainty revolving around the global health crisis and its implications for consumer spending Q4 earnings report The company generated $32.3 billion in sales, marking a 25% improvement over the year-ago quarter as consumers shopped early and spent more on holiday décor in an effort to gain some degree of normalcy. Comparable sales climbed by nearly the same percentage. As for the bottom line, net profit was 16% higher at $2.9 billion, or $2.65 per share. Both headline figures topped analyst estimates of $30.7 billion in sales and a per-share net profit of $2.61. The reported growth is in line with what Home Depot reported during the second and third quarter as it benefited from keeping doors open as an essential retailer. As for fiscal 2020, $240 million was devoted to Covid-related operational costs and as long as the pandemic lasts, Home Depot expects about $250 million of Covid-such operating expenses on an annual basis to cover personal protective equipment for employees, additional cleaning and paid leave for employees who get ill. Home Depot did not offer any guidance given the uncertainty related to the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its influence on the consumer. New trends Customers spent more when they visited the company's stores or its website with the value of a customer's average purchase rising nearly 11% compared to the previous year to $75.69. Sales per square foot jumped 24% to $528.01. Many customers purchased big-ticket items as transactions over $1,000 were up by about 23% on a YoY basis. Digital sales skyrocketed about 83% in the quarter compared to 2019's fourth quarter. As for the year, they grew about 86%, with about 60% of online orders fulfilled through the store. By adding online workshops, Home Depot expanded its audience and boosted the engagement of its existing consumers. Before the pandemic, it had an average of five in-store workshops per month which expanded to 40 online workshops per month that were live-streamed. Consumers About 45% of Home Depot's sales come from pros, such as plumbers, electricians and contractors which is a higher percentage than its rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) which gets up to 25% from that segment. Home Depot is looking to build on that advantage as it acquired HD Supply Holdings at the end of last year in a deal valued at $8 billion. As during previous quarters, the world's largest home improvement retailer continued to benefit from a DIY customer base that is effectively trapped at home much of the time and eager to make those homes as comfortable as possible or even add features to them. The big retailer became an obvious go-to place for materials, tools, and even furnishings during the pandemic. Outlook With the pandemic seemingly receding and consumers being able to return to travel and leisure activities, it's unlikely that the giant will post similarly impressive growth numbers with that pullback in spending. But Home Depot will continue to invest in integrating its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar business, with capital expenditures targeted at about 2% of sales in the undergoing year. By continuing to invest, the company hopes to attract new customers, especially millennials who are buying and fixing up their homes.

2021-03-05,"Speculators buy tomorrow and sell today. Investors can get bargains if they believe in yesterday. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) provides a good example of this market principle. HD stock ran up from a pandemic low of $152 last March to a high of $286 in August. They then bounced around for months before falling 11% in the last month. Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The catalyst? Record earnings and a dividend increase. Sales for the fourth quarter were $32.3 billion, up 25% year-over-year, at scale. Net earnings per fully diluted share rose 14%, to $2.65. The dividend was hiked 10%. Speculators responded with sell orders. They were taking profits. Investors who waited out this process and walk in today, however, can get a dividend yielding 2.56% over the next year and a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.8.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why They Sold Traders and speculators like bright shiny objects. A year ago, when we were locked inside our homes for the first time, Home Depot was a bright and shiny object. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Those promises have been fulfilled. As Placer.ai noted in a February report, on Home Depot and its rival Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), Home Depot visits were up 22% year-over-year in January. They have been up by double digits for every month since last May. The stock charts tell a different story. The performance of Home Depot shares began trailing the S&P 500 average in December. That underperformance has only accelerated this year. Since the start of 2021, Home Depot is down nearly 7%. Those who took profits ran to today’s bright and shiny objects. SPACs, electric car plays, fintech, and Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) are as hot today as Home Depot is cold. Why Investors Buy This provides a great opportunity for baby boomers to secure their retirement. The pandemic has created permanent changes in housing and office patterns. Most knowledge workers are no longer interested in going back to the office. Office leases are being allowed to expire. Homes need to expand, however, to accommodate the new home office. Better use must be made of the remaining space. This means a lot of work, not just for consumers, but for builders and contractors. Projects will have to be redesigned, and existing office space repurposed. For retailers like Home Depot, meanwhile, the spring quarter is Christmas. Planting season is profit season. Projects dreamed of in the cold become reality when it gets warm, and hopefully before it gets hot. HD stock is selling for barely half the average S&P stock’s price to earnings ratio, which is over 38. The Shiller ratio, which is adjusted for inflation, is 34. While stock chartists see Home Depot stock going lower over the short, medium, and long terms, analysts at Tipranks have a more upbeat view. Nine out of 10 say buy it. Their average one-year price target of $315 is 27% ahead of where the stock trades now. The Bottom Line On HD Stock The peak of the baby boom, in the mid-1950s, is retiring over the next few years. I was born in 1955. I’m feeling a little cranky and creaky myself. Here’s how to get your kids to pay for those cruises, weekend getaways and even those long-term care homes you’ve been dreaming of. Now is the time to buy Home Depot. Take the 2.5% dividend, watch the growth from changing housing patterns, and relax. This is the difference between trying to get rich quick and getting rich slowly. Buy great companies when they’re down and let time work its magic for you. At this time five years ago Home Depot sold for $126 and sported a dividend of 69 cents. Now it’s at $248 with a dividend of $1.65. Getting rich slowly is the key to a comfortable retirement.

2021-03-05,"Shares of hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) have been hammered amid the recent tech sector meltdown, as a sharp rise in long-term yields has put significant downward pressure on growth stock valuations. From its early February highs, PLUG stock has lost almost half of its value. Source: Shutterstock That’s a steep drop in a stock that has very strong fundamentals. It’s also a great buying opportunity that will pay off handsomely in the long run. To be clear, I’m not saying PLUG stock will reverse course right now and surge back to $70. The tech sector selloff is a bloodbath, and bloodbaths like this tend to take some time to shake out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But, what I am saying is that Plug Power is a disruptive innovator with huge long-term potential, and that relative to that long-term potential, PLUG stock is significantly undervalued today. Indeed, my numbers say shares are worth close to $60 today. The Amazon of House: This Stock Is Like Buying Amazon in 1997 That means that if time is on your side, PLUG stock looks like a great buy at currently depressed prices. Silicon Valley Whiz Kid Reveals #1 Tech Stock in America Here’s a deeper look. PLUG Stock: Hammered on Short-Term Fears PLUG stock has been hammered over the past few weeks because of fears related to a sharp rise in long-term bond yields. The basic thinking is that, as long-term yields rise, equity valuations will correct lower, because stocks and bonds are competing investment vehicles, so as bond yields rise, the required rate of return on stocks rises, too. That thinking makes a ton of sense. And if yields were to rise forever, then I’d say growth stocks like PLUG stock will keep plunging. But yields aren’t going to rise forever. Instead, it looks like the 10-Year Treasury yield will max out around 2% over the next few years. Here’s the thinking. Historically, the 10-Year Treasury yield has very closely tracked the sum of the 3-Month Treasury yield (a proxy for inflation which the Fed controls with its target interest rate) plus real GDP growth. This relationship is unmistakably strong. Importantly, the 10-Year yield has historically never surpassed the 3-Month yield plus real GDP growth unless during a time of significant economic contraction (and therefore, negative GDP growth). Click to EnlargeSource: St. Louis Fed The Fed has reiterated multiple times that they will not move on interest rates anytime soon. Thus, the 3-Month Treasury yield will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. Real GDP growth is expected to jump to 4% this year in a sharp “bounce-back” year. But normalizing out for Covid-19 noise, real GDP growth in 2022 and after is expected to hover around 2%. Thus, normalized, the 10-Year yield should settle around 2% and remain there for most of 2022 and 2023. We are at 1.5% today. By my math, then, yields have another 50 basis points to go over the next 24+ months. That’s a slow and steady grind higher. To that end, I think we’re close to the end of the surge in long-term yields. Once the bond market calms down, I fully expect growth stocks like PLUG stock to bounce back. Plug Power Is Still Leading the Hydrogen Revolution Ignoring interest noise for a second, Plug Power is still leading the multi-trillion-dollar Hydrogen Revolution. The world is pivoting toward clean energy. By 2050, we will live in a world powered end-to-end by renewable energies. One of those core energies will be hydrogen, since it has certain innate scientific advantages from being the lightest element in the universe that render it the most cost-efficient clean energy solution in end-markets where dense, always-on batteries that last forever are particularly useful (think forklifts, long-haul trucks and power for data-centers). Plug Power is the leader in hydrogen. The company has been in the game of making hydrogen fuel cells for decades now. Over that time, the company has proprietarily developed the industry’s highest-performing and lowest-cost hydrogen fuel cells. Plug Power is currently applying these industry-leading fuels cell to the materials handling end-market, where they are powering Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) forklifts. But, more excitingly, Plug Power is is the early stages of applying this tech into much bigger end-markets, like green hydrogen generation, consumer autos, long-haul trucking, stationary, and more. Plug Power has already and will continue to find great success in these expansion efforts. That’s because all these end-markets required core HFC technology, and Plug Power has the best core HFC technology in the world. To that end, Plug Power is morphing into the technological backbone of the entire Hydrogen Economy. I wouldn’t be surprised if, by 2030, thousands of forklifts, trucks, data-centers, and ships are powered by Plug Power’s technology. Of course, all that means is that the fundamentals underlying PLUG power stock remain robust. This is still an innovative disruptor with enormous long-term growth potential. Plug Power Stock Has Big Upside Potential I cannot tell you exactly when the selloff in Plug Power stock will end. But, what I can tell you is that — even after factoring in higher rates — Plug Power stock is significantly undervalued relative to the company’s long-term earnings growth potential. By 2030, I see Plug Power’s technology powering big segments of the global economy. I imagine the company will dominant the materials handling market, and have sizable market share in the stationary and long-haul trucking end-markets. The company will also be a big player in green hydrogen production. Calculating the potential in all those end-markets, I see Plug Power’s revenues eclipsing $10 billion by 2030. EBITDA margins should, at scale, settle around 30%, given the company’s favorable pricing power thanks to its huge HFC tech lead. With those inputs, my valuation model outputs a fair value for PLUG stock today of about $60. That’s way above where shares trade currently. To be clear, PLUG stock may not rebound back to those levels right away. But the fundamentals eventually and inevitably always win out. Thus, whenever this stock market bloodbath does end, I do think Plug Power stock will surge higher. Bottom Line on PLUG Stock The tech sector meltdown has created multiple great buying opportunities for long-term investors. PLUG stock is one of the best stocks to buy amid this meltdown. But it’s not the best growth stock to buy on the dip. Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company that reminds me of a young Amazon. Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent. Which stock am I talking about?

2021-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with a premium service that lets customers opt to have furniture or appliances assembled as soon they arrive at their homes, according to people familiar with the plan.The move, if adopted widely, would help the world’s largest online retailer compete more effectively with Wayfair, Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe’s -- which all offer similar options.Amazon is planning to introduce the service in Virginia and two other markets, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. The company currently offers scheduled delivery of big items -- like bunk beds and treadmills -- to a particular room in a shopper’s home. But customers are often disappointed when delivery people drop off the purchases unassembled in big boxes.Amazon declined to comment.Wayfair shares fell by almost 4% before recovering some of their losses. Amazon was mostly unchanged.The new service requires drivers to unpack and assemble the items, remove the packaging and take the item back on the spot if the customer isn’t satisfied, according to a presentation reviewed by Bloomberg. Previously, customers had to schedule a different contractor to come to their home at a different time to assemble the product, assuming the service was even offered in their location.A training video shows the delivery of a bed and mattress set, as well as a sofa and ottoman, which are fairly simple to assemble. Drivers could be trained to install appliances like washing machines, dryers and dishwashers, according to one of the people, posing a specific threat to Home Depot Inc., Lowe’s Cos Inc. and Best Buy Co., which also sell appliances with installation services.The new offering simplifies the existing Amazon Home Services, which is available in a limited number of cities and lets customers hire contractors through the website to assemble furniture or install ceiling fans and wall-mounted televisions. The new service is designed to make delivery more convenient, cheaper and easier for Amazon to manage, one of the people said.Drivers who hang out in online chat rooms are already balking at the new service. Concerns range from insufficient training to worries that Amazon will hold them to unreasonable job completion times. One driver in Virginia, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing his employer, said the company isn’t taking into account cluttered homes with narrow stairways, which can prolong how long it takes to make deliveries. Some colleagues fear catching Covid-19 because customers tend to hover over them when they drop off packages, he said.Demand for bigger items like desks and office chairs spiked during the pandemic as millions retreated to their homes. Shoppers also became more comfortable buying big-ticket items online that they previously preferred to purchase from a store where they can lie on beds or sit on sofas.Online sales of furniture and housewares jumped 41% in 2020 to $36.1 billion, according to Coresight Research. Sales are expected continue to grow this year, albeit more slowly, to $37.3 billion. The surge in demand for big items created delivery logjams and weeks-long delays, creating an opportunity for Amazon to bring its reputation for quick delivery to the sale of bigger items like furniture.The Seattle-based e-commerce giant has struggled to match the runaway success of Wayfair, which supplanted Amazon in 2019 as the biggest online home-goods retailer in the U.S., according to 1010Data. Amazon has its own private-label furniture brands and in 2019 launched the virtual reality shopping feature Showroom that lets shoppers see what furniture would look like at home.(Updated with company comment, drivers reaction.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Plans Furniture Assembly Service to Catch Wayfair

2021-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- It was supposed to be a temporary buffer -- more than $1 trillion of debt taken on by U.S. companies last year to ride out the economic devastation caused by Covid-19.But with the economy rebounding and interest rates still near all-time lows, it’s becoming increasingly tempting for corporations including Home Depot Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to spend those cash cushions on acquisitions and dividend hikes. In many cases, they’re now borrowing more.The risk is that unfettered access to cheap debt -- even for less creditworthy companies -- will ease the pressure on executives to pay down their liabilities. That could extend a decade-long trend of swelling corporate debt levels, increasing the chances of a greater reckoning once interest rates rise or the next time capital markets seize up.“Today’s liquidity becoming tomorrow’s leverage is going to be the story of 2021 for at least some companies,” said David Brown, co-head of global investment grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman, which has $405 billion in assets.Rising CashTotal debt loads for U.S. companies outside the financial industry rose 10% in 2020 to $11.1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve, in part because lower interest rates have made it less burdensome for many companies to shoulder more debt. So far, corporations have largely been hoarding the money rather than spending it. Non-financial companies in the S&P 500 index that reported results before March 31 had about $2.13 trillion of cash and marketable securities on their books in the most recent quarter, up more than 25% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.But that’s likely to change, according to strategists at Barclays Plc. With the U.S. giving Covid-19 jabs to more than 3 million people a day now, and the economy showing signs of a resurgence as more consumers feel safe to go out and spend, companies are likely to be more aggressive in deploying cash.That’s likely to show up in the form of dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions, capital expenditure, and debt repayments, Barclays strategists led by Shobhit Gupta wrote in a report on Friday. Their analysis of comments on company conference calls shows that more management teams have been talking about making one-time dividend payments in recent months, and have been discussing buying back shares. The volume of acquisitions has also been growing.Generally, companies with higher credit ratings, in particular those at least four steps above junk, are likely to feel comfortable maintaining higher debt levels, the strategists said. Those with lower grades are more likely to pay down obligations.Home Depot sold $5 billion of bonds in March 2020, saying soon after that it wanted to make sure it had enough cash to tide it over during the pandemic. Then in January it borrowed $3 billion more for its acquisition of HD Supply Holdings Inc., its former subsidiary serving professional contractors. In February, the retailer said it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 10%. Meanwhile, total debt jumped by about $5.8 billion over the company’s fiscal year.Higher EarningsInvestors don’t always get hurt when a company boosts its borrowings. In the case of Home Depot, its earnings have risen alongside its liabilities, as the pandemic has spurred house-bound people to fix up their properties.The retailer prepaid $1.35 billion of bonds in March, and credit-rating firms aren’t looking at downgrading the company, which is ranked five steps above junk by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. But analysts have said the boom in home improvement may fade in the coming year as people finish their projects and spend more time outside the home as the pandemic eases.Most money managers viewed companies’ extra debt as being short-term. Verizon said in April 2020 that it was issuing notes to boost its cash levels, describing the move on a call with investors as a step to help it “manage through the impacts of the Covid pandemic.”Then last month it sold more than $30 billion of bonds in multiple currencies, swelling its total debt to a record high in the process, to help finance purchases of 5G spectrum. The company views the rise in leverage as a temporary move to fund a strategic asset that positions the company for growth, according to an emailed statement from Treasurer Scott Krohn in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg.“For many industries, this liquidity was supposed to be temporary,” said Terence Wheat, senior portfolio manager of investment-grade corporate bonds at PGIM Fixed Income, who declined to comment on any specific corporation. “Now some companies may use it for acquisitions rather than paying down debt.”Lower PenaltiesCorporations are borrowing more now for the same reason they’ve been boosting debt levels for years: because they can. The average yield on an investment-grade corporate bond was just 2.2% as of Monday, far below the mean of the last decade of around 3.17%, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data.And companies are finding that adding on more debt doesn’t necessarily hurt them much. The penalty for a ratings downgrade is generally minimal. A corporation in the BBB tier, or between one and three steps above junk, pays about 0.47 percentage points more yield than companies in the A tier, or four to six steps above speculative grade, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. That’s close to the lowest difference in a decade, and according to Barclays strategists, reflects the fact that insurance companies have been buying more BBB debt.That shrinking penalty may be why more than half of investment-grade corporate bonds by market value are in the BBB tier, versus just 27% in the early 1990s. Typically, most investment-grade companies can choose to pay down debt and merit higher ratings if they wish.“Companies have chosen to lever up,” said Richard Hunter, global head of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings. “The wild card is going to be companies’ choices now.”Acquisition Time?For some North American companies, buying competitors looks like a good use of cash, as it can allow them to boost future earnings. Canada’s Rogers Communications Inc. said last month that it plans to acquire Shaw Communications Inc. for $16 billion. Its debt levels are expected to rise to more than five times a measure of earnings, a leverage ratio commonly associated with junk credit ratings. But the company said it plans to delever to a ratio of 3.5 times over the next three years.Rising profits for companies have helped make their debt levels look less worrisome by at least one measure. The ratio of corporations’ earnings to their interest costs has been climbing for the last few quarters, signaling they have more income available to pay their debt. For investment-grade firms in aggregate, that ratio is now better than it was pre-Covid-19, while the metric for junk-rated companies has almost returned to levels before the pandemic, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.High cash levels at companies make indebtedness look lower now by some measures. Net leverage, which subtracts cash from debt and compares that net debt level to a measure of earnings, is near pre-Covid-19 levels for both blue chip companies and riskier speculative grade corporations on average. Total leverage, which doesn’t subtract out cash, remains significantly higher that it was pre-pandemic, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of the investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond Bloomberg Barclays indexes.If companies keep spending their money instead of paying down debt, net leverage will rise, said Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence.“Ratings agencies have become comfortable with higher and higher leverage, thus companies are more and more happy to take advantage of it,” Hebert said. “There’s an incentive to hold leverage at elevated levels because there’s no real mechanism that’s punishing you.”(Updates with detail on insurance company demand in paragraph 16)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",A $1 Trillion Liquidity Surge Is Morphing Into a Leverage Boom

2021-05-19,"Home Depot (HD) delivered solid first-quarter results, boosted by increased demand for home renovations and construction. Net sales were up 32.7% to $37.5 billion, affirming a strong start to the year. The increase came as the home improvement supplies company benefited from strategic investments and strong demand for home improvement projects. Global comparable sales were up 31%, and comparable sales in the U.S. surged 29.9%. Net earnings nearly doubled, coming in at $4.1 billion or $3.86 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $2.2 billion or $2.08 per share reported in the same quarter last year. Diluted net earnings were up 85.6% year-over-year. “I am proud of the resilience and strength our associates have continued to demonstrate, and I would like to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to our customers,"" stated Craig Menear, Chairman, and CEO. Home Depot ended the first quarter with 2,298 retail stores spread across the United States, Canada, Guam, Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (See Home Depot stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the Q1 financial results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel has reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. According to the analyst, normalization in spending trends as COVID-19 effects subside could continue to weigh heavily on sales and growth at the home improvement company. Nagel believes investors should be cautious, as Home Depot's comparable stores are facing significant challenges. “We look very favorably upon today’s report from HD and view the company's recent sales and profit strength as another clear signal of underlying operating prowess at the chain and of management's ability to capitalize well on continued COVID-19-related upheaval in the broader consumer landscape,” Nagel wrote in a research note to investors. He continued, ""We recommend clients remain on the sidelines with HD, at least for now, particularly as comparisons for the chain are turning significantly more challenging."" Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $351.21 implies 10.9% upside potential to current levels.

2021-05-22,"Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. The past week's bullish calls included a new Warren Buffett stake and a big-box retailer. The iPhone maker, a pot stock and a video streaming leader were among the bearish calls seen. Investors began last week in wait-and-see mode, despite the strong earnings reporting season so far. While the week's results from the big boxes largely were much better than expected too, weakness in the markets remained, due in part to cryptocurrency uncertainty and signs of inflation and a weaker dollar. Then came more hawkish than usual commentary from the Federal Reserve. But the markets lifted afterward, including the sluggish tech sector, while rising commodities prices took a breather. The waning buy-the-dip mentality had found new legs late in the week. So, despite earlier weakness, the big three U.S. indexes were little changed by Friday's close. Specifically, the Nasdaq was up fractionally and the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 were down fractionally. The week's notable corporate news included a major media merger, the much-anticipated launch of an electric vehicle and two technology titans at loggerheads. There was even new clarity on the need for COVID-19 booster shots and some good news in the art world. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.
