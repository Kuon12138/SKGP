There was another Kumbaya moment for fintech and big banks at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, as leading execs from PayPal and Mastercard espoused the benefits of everyone coming together to work for a greater payments system.  “The role banks play I think is really critically important,” gushed PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready, describing the “massive amount of interest” companies like his have in partnering with banks so they can collectively “move much more quickly”.",[$$] Banks and fintechs remain divided on payments despite public love-in

Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) did more than its fair share of the damage, losing 9.1% on the heels of a disappointing quarterly report that pointed to more trouble in China. Tech titans Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) took on even more water though, falling 8% and 13.8%, respectively, after Nvidia issued a warning that the earnings report due in mid-February would be worse than expected. Once again, slack demand from China is the culprit.

Not every name lost ground on Monday though. Pot stocks were broadly up again, as their secular bull market carries on.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Monday's stumble, in some regards, was exactly what the market needed in that it separated the winners from the losers and the excessively risky names. It will take some more time to see those divisions better defined, but the stock charts of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) look like they'll come out on top as the dust continues to settle.

### PayPal Holdings (PYPL)

The last time we looked at PayPal Holdings back on Jan. 10, it had broken out of a converging wedge pattern in a bullish direction. But, it wasn't an ideal breakout in that the move had left behind some partial gaps.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



The concern wasn't unmerited. Although PYPL drifted higher the next few days, it drifted lower after that. The bears failed to capitalize on the opportunity, however, setting up the next stage of the breakout move. That move became even more compelling on Monday.

  
Click to Enlarge • The key here is the shape of yesterday's bar after Friday's push above resistance around $93.30. The profit-takers peeled back a little from that brief brush with new 52-week highs, but the bears still aren't choosing to take their shot.

• Broadly speaking, the rebound move that has taken shape since late December has seen more volume on bullish days than bearish days.

• Still, while the stage may be set, it's the next move back above $93.30 that will clear all of the last hurdles and have a good shot at turning months' worth of consolidation into a long-lived breakout.

### Micron Technology (MU)

Our last look at Micron Technology was the same day we took our last look at PayPal Holdings … Jan. 10. And, in a very similar sense, the two are teasing would-be buyers with a breakout thrust. The situations and triggers, however, are notably different.

  
Click to Enlarge • A little more than two weeks ago, MU was struggling to break above the purple 50-day moving average line. That finally happened on Thursday though, and on plenty of volume.

• Not surprisingly, however, the gray 100-day moving average stopped the rally effort on Friday, and remained a technical ceiling yesterday.

• Still, the stock's trading above the falling resistance line that guided Micron shares lower for the better part of 2018. The momentum it needs is already in place, and it would be surprising if MU didn't break above its 100-day moving average line.

### Western Digital (WDC)

Finally, Western Digital -- indirect and direct rival to Micron -- is moving in a similar path as Micron shares are, and hold a similar opportunity for newcomers. In fact, Western Digital has many of the same make-or-break levels in front of it.

  
Click to Enlarge • WDC cleared its purple 50-day moving average line at $41 on Friday, but perhaps with a little too much zeal. The strong open led to a close below the opening level, meaning Monday's action got going on the wrong foot.

• Nevertheless, though, the bears were in charge early yesterday, Western Digital mustered a nice intraday turnaround to gain 2% yesterday … bullishness on a day when the over market ended in the red.

• The breakout trigger here again is the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray, at $47.61. The buyers only had to touch it on Friday to start selling again, though the second (and even third) touch of a resistance line can yield a different outcome if the pacing is right.

2019-01-29,"Roughly a week ago, payments middleman Square (NYSE:SQ) launched a debit card designed specifically for merchants who are already using its platform. SQ stock jumped on the news, and understandably so. Backed by Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the card gives small businesses immediate access to funds that they might otherwise have to wait days to use.

The marketability of the card is clear. Even if it can only be used by Square's current customers, certainly most of them will be interested in the offer; waiting for funds to clear can hurt small businesses over time.

But the new Square Card's real strength lies in the fact that it's a piece of a puzzle for SQ stock that's not yet complete, but soon could be.

### Square Card Will Be an Easy Sell

Square Card is another shot at Square's rival, Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), which has taken similar -- though not identical -- initiatives. With Square Card, Square's customers will be able to immediately access the payments made to them. without paying a fee. Prior to the launch of Square Card, merchants could immediately access payments made to them, but they had to pay a 1% fee to do so.

Moreover, Square merchants who use their Square Cards to buy goods and services from other Square merchants will receive a 2.75% rebate on those purchases.

In simplest terms, the payments company is developing its own ecosystem…. one that Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev believes plugs the company into a total addressable market of $50 billion. Dolev, however, thinks that Square Card will only increase Square's revenue by $2 million to $7 million within the next couple of years.

More than that, though, adding another feature to the list of benefits offered to merchants will certainly inspire more companies to consider using Square's services. Over time, the card should help Square increase its customer base, ultimately raising Square's bottom line and boosting SQ stock.

But that's not the only reason that the current and would-be owners of Square stock should celebrate Square Card.

### Another Piece of the Puzzle

Square Card is a debit card that effectively allows merchants to bypass traditional banks. But the debut of the new product may only be a stepping stone to SQ becoming a full-blown bank.

If the idea sounds familiar to longtime fans of SQ stock, there's a reason for that. SQ filed paperwork to become a true bank, with insured deposits, in September 2017. Square was aiming to become a government-approved bank primarily because it wanted to provide loans and credit that small businesses generally aren't able to get from their local banks.

SQ withdrew that application in July of last year, but the idea never really went away, and in December of last year, Square refiled the application.

If the application is approved -- and there's no clear reason it wouldn't be -- Square will become a one-stop solution for merchants, allowing Square's customers to avoid dealing with conventional, local banks altogether.

### The Bottom Line on SQ Stock

Although Square already facilitates loans, it only does so by referring customers to Utah-based Celtic Bank.

But facilitating loans is not a big business for Square. Securing its own bank charter would allow SQ itself to become a lender, which is a more profitable role. With more potential earnings on the table, Square would certainly more intensively market its loans. And, since two million merchants are already using Square to accept customer payments, SQ has two million potential customers to whom it can easily market its loans.

All of Square's customers would likely understand the benefit of having real-time access to payments via a debit card.

The valuation of SQ stock certainly isn't low, but there's more than enough growth in store to keep the long-term rally of Square stock going.

The payment services provider said that for its first quarter of its fiscal 2018, it brought in GAAP net income of $584 million, or 49 cents per share. This figure is down from the company's $620 million, or 50 cents per share from the year-ago quarter.

PayPal added that its revenue for the quarter came in at $4.23 billion, beating the $3.69 billion from its fourth quarter of its fiscal 2017, marking a 14.6% surge compared to the year-ago quarter. The online payments pioneer added that it saw $164 billion in total payment volume flow through its network, ahead of the $131 billion from the year-ago quarter.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The company did disappoint with its first-quarter guidance as it sees earnings for the period reaching roughly 66 cents to 68 cents per share, while analysts see this figure as being 68 cents per share. PayPal also sees its revenue for the quarter in the range of $4.08 billion to $4.13 billion, below the $4.16 billion that analysts call for.

PYPL stock was plummeting roughly 5.1% after the bell on Wednesday as the payment services provider posted its quarterly report for its latest period, which missed estimates. Shares had increased about 1.4% during regular trading hours in anticipation of PayPal's results.

Investors are shifting from a fear of losses to a fear of missing out, jumping on the boat even after big moves higher. Let's look at some of the biggest top stock trades for Friday.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #1: Microsoft

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are in a precarious spot now after failing to rally on earnings. It's trading smack in the middle of its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are all within about 60 cents of each other.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 5 Dividend Stocks to Help You Through the Market's Mayhem 



It's got downtrend resistance just above and support in this $100 to $103 region just below. If tech stocks continue higher and the Nasdaq holds up, it's hard to imagine that MSFT will break below support. Below $100 and my concerns would rise, though.

Over resistance, and Microsoft could fly to its prior highs.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #2: Facebook

Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are surging -- finally -- up almost 12% following its better-than-expected earnings results. FB stock was consolidating nicely below $150, which were the March/April lows from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

With Thursday's move, shares are erupting over this mark and are now pinning near the 200-day moving average. If it can't hold the 200-day, it will likely serve as temporary resistance.

However, given how much pressure FB has been under over the past few quarters, a continued move is certainly not out of the question. I find it worthwhile to mention that today's high perfectly kissed the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the July highs to the December lows. If FB pulls back and/or consolidates, look for the 38.2% Fib to buoy it as well as uptrend support (purple line).

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #3: PayPal

Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are pulling back slightly on the day, contrary to what the bulls were hoping for when PYPL reported earnings. However, it's holding up over the backside of prior downtrend resistance and is a great company.

I like this one from the long side, with prior downtrend resistance, the 50-day and the 200-day moving average all just below. Investors buying on Thursday, or Friday on another slight decline, can use the $84 level as their stop-loss.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #4: Visa

Visa (NYSE:V) has a similar -- albeit not identical -- chart to Microsoft. The main difference is that V doesn't have as much support below it. On a day where MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is running, V is under pressure following its earnings results.

Keep it simple: support rests down near $130 and V will need to close above $138 to trigger a breakout. This one has a great long-term story and investors should feel comfortable nibbling a longer-term position down here.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #5: Raytheon

Shares of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) are down slightly, falling about 4% after reporting earnings. But this one has come up quickly from its recent lows and is also a high-quality company.

I like RTN -- although perhaps not as much as a few other in-favor stocks at the moment -- particularly if it's able to hold its 21-day and 50-day moving averages. If so, a continued rally is not out of the question. Over time, it may even make its way back up to the $185 to $190 level.

Below $160 and RTN would raise a red flag for me, but if I am a short-term investor or long-term trader (however you want to think about it) I would not be all that disappointed with Thursday's fall following its big rally.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 

Source: Shutterstock From a headline perspective, the quarter wasn't very good. Earnings topped expectations, but revenues were simply in-line with estimates. That's a shocker for this company. PayPal normally beats on both the top and bottom line. Indeed, this is the first time in two years that PayPal didn't report a double-beat quarter. Also, the first quarter guide came in light of expectations, heightening investor concerns that slowing global economic growth is weighing on PayPal. 

All in all, a glance at the headline numbers makes the drop in PayPal stock seem obvious and warranted. But a closer look reveals that this dip is a buying opportunity.

The core trends underlying PayPal stock remain robust, and the fourth-quarter report affirmed that. Total payment volume growth, engagement growth, revenue growth and margins were all stable in the quarter. Meanwhile, account growth and Venmo volume growth actually accelerated higher in the quarter. Plus, the guide next year calls for continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion, while management said on the conference call that &quot;economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate.&quot;

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Overall, PayPal's quarter wasn't bad. At all. Instead, it was business as usual -- and business as usual projects to be the norm in 2019, as well. So long as business as usual persists, PayPal stock will remain on an uptrend and dips will be buying opportunities.

### Underlying Growth Trends Remain Favorable

It's easy to look at PayPal's quarter, see that a 30-forward-multiple stock didn't double-beat expectations and write off the sell-off in PayPal stock as an overvalued stock suffering from a slowing growth trajectory.

But that isn't what's happening here.

PayPal's growth isn't really slowing at all. Total payment volume growth in the quarter was 25%. This figure has run in the 20% to 30% range for several quarters now, so the fourth quarter's 25% mark is very normal. Also, fiscal 2019 total payment volume growth is projected to be 25% -- again, a very normal number for this company.

Engagement growth was also stable in the quarter at 9%, while adjusted revenue growth was also stable at 21%. Next year, adjusted revenue growth is expected around 20%, implying year-over-year stability. Margins also held largely stable in Q4, and are expected to gradually expand in 2019.

Elsewhere, growth rates actually improved. Account growth accelerated to 17% in the quarter, from a 10-15% range that the metric had been stuck in for several quarters. Venmo volume growth also accelerated to 80%, after being stuck at 78% for two consecutive quarters.

Overall, the underlying growth trends at PayPal remain healthy and vigorous. Moreover, management projects those trends to remain healthy in 2019, thanks to a still-favorable economic backdrop. As such, 2019 will be business as usual for PayPal.

Business as usual has led to PayPal stock more than doubling over the past three years. It should lead to similar big gains over the next several years.

### Valuation Lends Itself to $100 Prices Soon

The post-earnings sell-off in PayPal stock has dragged the stock price down below $90. The stock won't stay there for long. Within the next several months, PayPal stocks should rise toward and above $100.

The math here is simple. PayPal has been a consistent adjusted revenue-grower in excess of 20%. This year is expected to be largely more of the same. Growth will inevitably slow over the next several years thanks to the law of large numbers. But, secular growth drivers in e-commerce and mobile commerce will keep growth healthy over the next several years. Thus, this is easily a 15% revenue grower that could hit $36 billion in revenue by fiscal 2024.

During that stretch, margins will expand gradually with scale, but will remain largely within the 20-25% range. Gradual margin expansion on top of big revenue growth should propel EPS towards $7 by fiscal 2014. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings.

Based on a 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2023 price target for PayPal stock is $175. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target just shy of $120.

### Bottom Line on PYPL Stock

The growth trends underlying PayPal stock remain favorable, mostly due to resilient economic growth and continued expansion of e-commerce and mobile commerce. So long as these growth trends remain favorable -- and the valuation remains reasonable, as it does today -- PayPal stock will trend higher, and dips are nothing more than buying opportunities.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



With that in mind, here are five of the best fintech stocks to invest in now.

### PayPal (PYPL)

A key Silicon strategy is to disrupt massive industries. While this can result in enormous profits, it is extremely tough to pull off. There are some industries that are quite resilient, such as financial services.

In light of this, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has taken a collaborative approach. Part of this has been about integrating many types of payment options, which is what customers prefer. But there has also been an aggressive focus on forming strategic alliances. A prime example is a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to get a piece of the unbanked market segment.

For the most part, PYPL's strategy has worked extremely well. In the latest quarter, the net new active accounts increased by 9.1 million to 254 million and the transaction volume jumped by 27% to 2.5 billion. A major driver for engagement has been from mobile devices.

Another strong catalyst for PYPL stock is Venmo, which provides peer-to-peer payments services. Note that the app is a must-have for the Millennial generation. From 2016 to 2018, the total payment volume has gone from 3.2 billion to 16.6 billion.

While still early, PYPL is seeing lots of traction with monetization, with 24% of the user base participating. In fact, Venmo is likely to be a strong lever of growth in the coming years.

Finally, PYPL has a rock solid balance sheet. There is currently about $10.5 billion in liquid assets. In other words, the company has the resources to engage in aggressive M&A to further bolster its strong fintech platform.

### Intuit (INTU)

Founded in 1983, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a pioneer among fintech stocks. The company started off with simple check-balancing methods. But since then, INTU has expanded into lucrative categories like small business accounting and personal/business taxes.

These segments certainly generate substantial amounts of data, which allows for interesting use-cases. One example is QuickBooks Capital. It is a lending service that uses Intuit's accounting data to make loans. Because of Intuit's data advantage, about 60% of customers have obtained approvals for loans that would generally be deemed &quot;un-lendable&quot; by traditional financial institutions. The loss rate is also less than half the industry average.

It's also important to note that INTU is bolstering its market opportunity by moving beyond its small business focus. Just look at QuickBooks Online Advanced. This is for the mid-market category (where the employee base ranges from 10 to 100). The market size in the U.S. is about 1.5 million.

In light of the innovation and diversified business assets, it should be no surprise that INTU has been a consistent grower. From 2010 to 2018, revenues have more than doubled to $6 billion.

### Envestnet (ENV)

Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) develops sophisticated cloud-based technologies for financial advisors, such as independent providers and small- or mid-size firms. EVN's software provides a full suite of services for front, middle and back office needs.

The company has built a solid base, with about 93,000 advisors (up 5% in the latest quarter). There are over $2.8 trillion in assets and more than 10 million investor accounts on the system.

One of the attractions of ENV is its open architecture. For the most part, the company strives to provide as many options for its advisors as possible. Note that there are over 18,000 products and more than 20,000 data sources.

ENV is also poised to benefit from a secular trend in the financial services industry, as more advisors transition from commissions to fee-based compensation. According to Cerulli, the amounts are expected to go from $9.7 trillion in 2017 to $16.7 trillion in 2021.

Source: Lending Tree 

### LendingTree (TREE)

LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) operates an online marketplace for consumers to purchase financial services. The company has over 500 partners in its network, covering areas like mortgages, insurance, personal loans and credit cards. There is also a plethora of content and tools, such as for getting free credit scores.

A critical part of building this platform has been aggressive M&A, such as for ValuePenguin, QuoteWizard, Student Loan Hero and Valore (since 2016, there have been a total of $680 million in transactions). These deals have not only provided top-notch technology but footholds in key growth markets.

The result is that the revenue base has become much more diversified. During the past five years, the mortgage concentration has gone from 80% to only 20%. No doubt, this has been important as the mortgage business has come under pressure during the past year or so.

Going forward, the growth story looks to be intact. For this year, the company projects revenues to increase by 29% to 34% or from $990 million to $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range from $195 million to $205 million. Then again, TREE continues to benefit from major secular trends as financial institutions allocate more resources to digital platforms.

### Global X FinTech ETF (FINX)

If you do not want to pick individual fintech stocks to invest in, then you can invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the fintech markets. And a good choice is the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX), which has about $288 million in assets.

The fund includes 37 stocks that have an average market cap of $9.4 billion. The top five holdings include PYPL, Square (NYSE:SQ), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), SS&C Technologies Holdings (NASDAQ:SSNC) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). What's more, about 30% of the portfolio companies are based outside the U.S.

In terms of the themes for the FINX ETF, they are fairly broad. They are P2P/marketplace lending, enterprise solutions, blockchain/cryptocurrencies, crowdfunding and personal finance software/automated wealth management.

The fund has an expense ratio of 0.68% and no dividend yield.

Source: Mike Mozart via Wikimedia (Modified)

OK, this still represents less than 1% upside from the current value! But then again, his prior target -- which was at $172 -- really had to be updated.

According to Weiss, he believes that INTU stock should benefit from growth in QuickBooks and TurboTax, which should remain in the growth phase for some. He points also out the company's strong competitive advantages and the ongoing innovations in the product lines.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While all this is true, I think Weiss should be much more bullish on Intuit stock. The company represents a compelling play on the fintech market. In fact, for a recent post for InvestorPlace.com, I included Intuit stock as one of my five top picks in the category. Some of the others include PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) and LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE).

So here's a look at Inuit stock:

### Intuit Stock: Franchise Power

Much of the revenues for Intuit come from TurboTax and QuickBooks.  Keep in mind that the company has been the dominant player in each of these categories for more than two decades.

  * The 9 Best Stocks to Invest In During a Manic Market 



A key has been an obsessive focus on the customer, which has led to ongoing innovations. For example, in the case of QuickBooks, one of the recent features is one-day payments. There has also been the launch of an advanced version that is geared to the midmarket.

Next, the TurboTax business (this also includes the Mint personal finance offering) remains a major cash cow.  In fiscal 2018, the revenues from this segment came to $2.52 billion and the operating income was $1.596 billion. This is the kind of margin -- at 63% -- you'd see with a monopoly!

Yet TurboTax continues to show steady improvements. Perhaps the most notable example of this is TurboTax Live, which is a service that has CPAs and Enrolled Agents review tax returns. The result has been a 19% increase in tax filer confidence.

### Data, AI and INTU

A valuable asset for INTU is its enormous data set. And yes, the company has been finding ways to leverage this. Look at TurboTax. Over the years, the company has gained consent from 25 million users to use their data to get offers for better rates and loans, which has meant a 9X conversion rate for partners.

QuickBooks has been effective as well. A good example is the move into providing loans to small businesses. Because of improved underwriting capabilities -- especially with access to company books -- 60% of loan approvals would be considered &quot;un-lendable&quot; by traditional financial institutions. Yet the loss rate is half the industry average. Oh, and 39% of customers apply for a second loan.

Finally, INTU has made strides with AI, as seen with QB Assistant. While still in the early phases, it has already processed over 1.5 million questions.

### Intuit Stock: Market Opportunity

Even though Intuit was founded back in 1983, the company still has much room left for growth. It certainly helps that the company has found ways to extend its platforms, such as with its Self-Employed app. It targets the fast-growing market for the so-called gig economy.

In Intuit's existing market segments, the company has 42 million consumer customers. But the company estimates the opportunity is at a whopping 175 million. As for small business and self-employed category, INTU's base is close to 7 million. Yet the opportunity is roughly 215 million. And looking at the potential spending of both segments, it comes to about $33 billion. By comparison, the annual revenues for INTU are about $6 billion.

2019-02-11,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has outperformed the stock market and most other names since tech stocks' Christmas Eve lows. Square stock is up more than 40% from its lows and is now consolidating nicely near $70 per share.Square is far from perfect, though. The stock is much more volatile than the broader market and is susceptible to large moves in both directions. With the market teetering on a potential pullback ( it has risen some 15% from its December lows and is rapidly moving towards its 200-day moving average), Square stock could either be a pillar of strength or a weak link in the chain. Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)If investors eliminate their emotions and rely on unbiased logic, they have a chance to profit from SQ stock. So let's look at the charts a bit before diving into a wider overview of Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months  Trading Square StockSQ is holding up relatively well, particularly with the overall markets under some pressure after a big, multi-week rally. So far, SQ stock is staying above its 200-day moving average, which is near $69. This appears to be a rather key level when it comes to Square stock. The 200-day was resistance about a month ago, but once Square pushed through the 200-day, this level became support.Furthermore, short-term, uptrend support (depicted by the blue line on the chart above) comes into play around $69 as well and follows the 200-day moving average pretty closely. On a slightly deeper pullback, the risk/reward of Square stock would be solid for bulls.For bulls who are already long, a close below this area gives them a way to reduce their risk. If Square stock temporarily breaks below $69 and recovers in the same day, I would be much more likely to consider taking a long position in Square stock. That scenario would signify that the support of Square stock temporarily gave way, and that bulls responded by buying the shares with enough force to get them back over the key level of $69.So what happens if SQ falls below $69? If that happens, $65 is on the table. That's about the level where trend support (depicted by the black line) and  the 50-day moving average come into play. If $69 holds, becoming support, look to see if Square stock moves over $72 to $72.50. That area is both short-term, downtrend resistance and the 100-day-moving average. If Square stock climbs above $72.50, it could retest its recent highs near $78.Know your levels and let the price action guide your actions. Don't fight what the stock price is doing. The Bottom Line on SQ StockSquare is not cheap and never really has been. However, investors counter the valuation argument with a few observations.Their first contention is that Square could be a takeover target for banks and/or payment processing companies. Perhaps the recent massive deal between SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) and BB&T (NYSE:BBT)will kick M&A in the financial sector into high gear.Presently, Square stock is valued at just under $30 billion. It's also got a surprisingly resilient balance sheet. SQ has total assets of almost $4 billion versus total liabilities of $2.8 billion, while the company has less than $1 billion of total debt.SQ is not on the list of stocks with the strongest balance sheets, but I was surprised that Square wasn't more leveraged. The fact that SQ has positive cash flow also makes Square stock more attractive.The bulls' other argument is the company's  growth. Square will report its earnings at the end of February, and analysts expect the company to report strong, full-year growth. On average, analysts expect its sales to surge 60% to $1.58 billion and predict that its earnings will balloon 70% to 46 cents per share.As mentioned earlier, the valuation of SQ stock is high; the shares are trading at 156 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. But it's not easy to find companies that are  growing as quickly as Square. In 2019, the average estimate calls for a further 43% expansion in sales to $2.25 billion and projects that its earnings will grow 52% to 70 cents per share.SQ stock is still expensive, as it's far more costly than its peers like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). But growth investors won't mind its high valuation as long as its management continues to deliver.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-02-13,"Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock, like the broader market, have rallied sharply off the late December 2018 lows. Unlike the broader market, though, this stock is breaking to fresh all-time highs and looks to continue its upside trajectory.As much as the stock market as a whole has largely traded in tandem over the past few months, i.e. up-days saw most stocks lift while down-days saw most stocks sell off, as I look deeper into 2019 I think this will be much more or a stock picker's market. Yes, we will see awesome and tradeable swings in the broader stock indices in 2019 I believe, but we will also see more separation between stocks that are in true growth phases versus others that are more exposed to the business cycle.Online payment systems such as those services that PayPal provide, in my eye, remain in a raging bull market from a business perspective.

2019-02-22,"It seems little can stop PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and PayPal stock.Source: Shutterstock Thanks to the rise of digital payments, PayPal may finally be realizing its true potential more than 20 years after its founding. PayPal stock has steadily risen as the number of markets in and methods of digital payments grow in both the U.S. and abroad.Despite PayPal's disappointing earnings report,  PYPL stock quickly rebounded above its pre-earnings levels. Such a recovery shows that growth, rather than news, will serve as the driver of PayPal stock for the foreseeable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PayPal Stock Recovered Quickly From Its Disappointing EarningsPayPal stock looks poised to break out again. The stock fell in trading following its Jan. 30 earnings report. While PayPal's earnings beat expectations, Wall Street was disappointed by its revenue that merely met estimates, as well as its Q1 guidance.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns However, traders quickly got over their disappointment. The stock recovered to its pre-earnings level within a week. Now PayPal stock trades at around $95.50 per share, just shy of its 52-week high.Fundamentals also indicate that PYPL stock could move higher. The forward price-earnings ratio of PYPL stock stands at 27.2. That seems reasonable, considering that analysts on average expect the company's profit to increase 19.4% this year and 20.8% in 2020.And PYPL will indeed grow, greatly benefiting PayPal stock in the process. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman predicts that digital payments will become a $100 trillion market. So far, Schulman estimates that they have reached about 1%-2% of that level. PayPal Stock Versus SQ StockPayPal has had to play catch-up with Square (NYSE:SQ) in some respects. When PayPal was owned by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  Square came in and took the lead on smartphone-based payments.To this day, Square is ahead of PYPL in features that go beyond payment processing. However, not all sellers need additional systems. Moreover, the massive growth of online payments leaves room for both companies.PayPal stock also appears better-positioned to benefit investors than SQ. Square's growth rates will exceed 50% per year for the foreseeable future. However, SQ trades at almost 110 times its forward earnings. PayPal's top line is only expected to increase about 18% in 2020 versus 2019. Still, the forward price-earnings ratio of PayPal stock  is only 27.4, making it a much better buy, with lower risk, than SQ stock. Digital Wallets And Foreign Markets Will Drive PayPal's GrowthPYPL will also benefit from other growth engines. Its digital wallet, Venmo. has opened up a new market for it.Venmo competes with Zelle, a digital-payment network owned by a number of banks, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). However, Zelle tends to focus on larger, less-frequent transactions, while Venmo focuses on a larger number of smaller purchases. Venmo can also be integrated with one's social network, a feature that's particularly appealing to millennials. The number of payments processed by Venmo surged 80% year-over-year.Additionally, PayPal has also made moves into China, Japan, and India. In India, PayPal has earned a profit since it entered the market in November 2017. It faces competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in India.Despite this competition, PYPL feels optimistic that it can become the leading digital- payment processor in India. Worth just  $200 million in 2017, India's digital-payments market should be worth $1 billion by 2023. Bolstered by a population of 1.3 billion that's growing increasingly wealthy, the Indian market has tremendous potential for PYPL. Final Thoughts on PayPalPayPal's growth catalysts should enable PYPL stock to advance by large amounts for years to come. PYPL has moved little in the last week, and it's barely higher than the $93 per share level it first reached in September.However, quarterly reports and Wall Street analysis all affirm that the company's growth remains strong. More people continue to make online payments more often, and online payments continue to transform the way the world spends money. The fact that PYPL is  helping to lead this trend  bodes well for the performance of PayPal stock in the months and years ahead.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-02-26,"While the overall markets have been mostly in an uptrend this year, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been anything but. Rather, it's been a wild ride. TSLA stock began the year by hitting roughly $350 in January before plunging to $285 by the month's end. Elon Musk & Co. would see a nice bounce back to $322 in February, but it would not last long. Tesla stock is currently trading hands at $297.But hey, this kind of volatility is typical. And it probably will not change any time soon. Despite all this, I'm still a cautious bull. In the near term, there are some potential catalysts for TSLA. Keep in mind that the company plans to begin selling the Model 3 in Europe and China in the next few months. We should also get some details on the Tesla Y crossover.Of course, on a long-term basis, the company has opportunities for substantial growth. Just look at artificial intelligence (AI). Because of the large number of vehicles on the road, Tesla is continuously building a valuable database -- and its computer systems are getting smarter and smarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the meantime, the company continues to post profits and has $3.7 billion in the bank. While all this is great, Tesla stock still faces considerable risks. According to Elon Musk, the company came close to imploding last year; and such dire circumstances seem like a quarterly occurrence for the often-beleaguered automaker.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market So for investors looking at Tesla stock, it's a good idea to think about the potential landmines. (And yes, there are many.) Some of these landminds are especially treacherous. See for yourself: Risks to Tesla Stock: Musk DramaMusk has one of the best track records in tech. In the mid-1990s, he founded Zip2 and sold it for more than $300 million. Then he launched PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which revolutionized digital payments. And yes, he would eventually put together SpaceX.While Musk is certainly brilliant, he can also be unpredictable. Last year's ill-fated attempt to take his company private is an example of this. It resulted in penalties from the SEC, which included revamping the board.Musk's mercurial personality could ultimately lead to even worse consequences, though. Keep in mind that there has been significant turnover in the executive suite, which could hamper growth. Some of the latest departures include Tesla's in-house counsel and chief accounting officer. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than 50 executives have left the company during the past two years. Risks to Tesla Stock: Quality and ScaleProduction has been one of the biggest issues for TSLA stock. Let's face it, the company's cars are highly complex and require sophisticated processes. The company has also been hamstrung because of a lack of sizeable production capacity.True, Musk has done a tremendous job in improving things. But it seems like a good bet there will be ongoing challenges as volumes ramp up.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Note that Consumer Reports recently nixed its recommendation of the Tesla Model 3 because of reliability and quality problems. Of course, Musk quickly responded, indicating that the problems have been resolved. Yet he has certainly been prone to making statements that have proven to be overly optimistic. Risks to Tesla Stock: CompetitionGoing mainstream is a herculean task in the auto industry. It has meant the destruction of many startups. Tesla has beaten the odds.But as time goes by, it will get tougher as the competition grows more intense. In the next couple years, the market will see a flood of EV offerings from operators like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY), Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) and Nio (NYSE:NIO). Oh, and tech operators like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo will certainly continue to gain traction with autonomous vehicles.In fact, there are already signs that TSLA is getting antsy about the competition. For instance, Tesla plans to provide an option for consumers to lease its vehicles, and the company has also reduced the price of the Model 3. Price cuts aside, Tesla's Model 3 is still above the $35,000 mark Musk promised (and really, needs) to win over the mass-market consumer.Considering that it's about to find itself outclassed in everything from cash to brand loyalty, Tesla stock is currently stuck between a rock and a hard place.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-02-26,"Calendar 2018 was a big year for initial public offerings, or IPOs. The number of IPOs in 2018 rose more than 20% year-over-year to nearly 230, the highest mark since 2014 and the third highest mark over the past ten years.Yet, there's reason to believe that 2018 was just the beginning of a multi-year IPO boom. Here's the thing about the IPO market: it runs in cycles. Multiple consecutive years of low IPO volume are followed by multiple consecutive years of high IPO volume. From 2015 to 2017, we had three years of below-average IPO volume. Calendar 2018 broke that trend with 200-plus IPOs. History tells us that 2019 and 2020 should be more of the same.Indeed, calendar 2019 should be one for the record books in the IPO market. The list of potential 2019 IPOs is long, diverse, and includes some of the biggest and fastest growing private companies. Those companies promise to make an unforgettable splash when they go public later this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore than that, I think many of these IPOs will be extremely successful. The batch of companies going public this year include the batch of companies that were birthed out of the Financial Crisis a decade ago. They are disruptive and innovative, and cut from a different cloth than current public companies. Most importantly, most of these companies are employing coordinated economic principles to give power back to the people, and in so doing, are aligned with the biggest trend of the century.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market As such, not only does the 2019 IPO market project to be one for the record books, but it should also yield some big winners. With that in mind, let's take a look at a list of seven IPOs that investors should be excited for in 2019. UberAt the head of this list is Uber, the ride-sharing company which has already entirely disrupted the transportation industry.Investors should be excited about the Uber IPO because this company has truly optimized transportation services, and in so doing, has established a massive driver base which will be hard for anyone else to replicate, and from which multiple valuable business opportunities can be created. In a nutshell, Uber is the quintessential coordinator. Before Uber, transportation services were performed by the few (namely, taxis). Uber democratized the supply of transportation services, and said anyone with a car can now perform this service, creating a surge in supply. Uber coordinated that supply, so that it would satisfy demand-side expectations. Net result? Supply caught up to robust demand, price points fell, and convenience went up. Uber won.Now, Uber has a driver base that numbers several million globally. Uber can use that unparalleled driver base to optimize price and convenience in other transportation-related industries, such as delivery and last-mile logistics. The sum potential of all these industries numbers in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and potentially even in the trillion dollar range if Uber wins the race to self-driving. As such, while Uber's rumored $120 billion IPO valuation may drop some jaws, it's worth it. LyftUber isn't the only ride-sharing company going public in 2019. In fact, before Uber ever hits public markets, its competitor Lyft should have already spent a few months on Wall Street.Lyft is planning to launch its IPO roadshow in mid-March. That means that by the summer of 2019, Lyft should be a publicly traded company. That's exciting news. Much like Uber, Lyft is a quintessential coordinator who has helped democratize and coordinate supply in the transportation industry to meet robust demand. In so doing, Lyft has huge opportunities in front it to not only become a solid second player in the ride-sharing market, but also the number one or number two company in a plethora of other transportation-related markets.  * 5 Clinical-Stage Biotech Stocks to Buy The attractive thing about the Lyft IPO is that the valuation is rumored to be under $25 billion. That is just a fraction of Uber's valuation. To be sure, Uber is much bigger than Lyft in terms of total revenues and rides. But, Lyft is supposedly growing much more quickly than Uber, and the company has largely avoided negative press (much unlike Uber). Consequently, investors should be excited about the upcoming Lyft IPO, given its discounted valuation relative to Uber and that the company is apparently gaining share in ride-sharing. AirbnbThe coordinated economy hasn't just hit the transportation industry. It has also hit the accommodations industry, thanks to Airbnb, who also projects to go public in 2019.Much like Uber, Airbnb has become a quintessential coordinator. Before, accommodation services were provided by the few (namely, hotels). Airbnb democratized supply in that market, and said that anyone who has an extra room or living space can rent it out for accommodation purposes. Supply surged. Airbnb coordinated that supply to satisfy demand-side expectations. Consequently, supply caught up to demand, prices fell, and convenience rose.Much unlike Uber, however, Airbnb doesn't have any big second competitor that is also set to IPO in 2019. Thus, the competition landscape for Airbnb is quite attractive for the foreseeable future. Also, Airbnb is in an optimal position to jump into other accommodation-related industries, like the travel and car rental industries, meaning the long term opportunity here is quite large. PostmatesFollowing in the footsteps of Uber, Postmates took those same coordinated economy principles and applied them specifically to the delivery process.While you may be inclined to compare Postmates to food-delivery services including UberEats and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), that's not entirely accurate. Postmates will also deliver items from local stores such as groceries, alcohol, and other items-making for a nice moat. (Though for these other items, they may eventually have to compete with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is no joke for any company, but for now, same-day delivery isn't widespread and it isn't under an hour or so wait time.) But the (prepared) food-delivery market will be really big one day (like $100 billion-plus big), and Postmates is maintaining steady double-digit market share. Plus, the current valuation on Postmates is reasonable ($1.85 billion).  * 6 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Thus, in the big picture, Postmates is a solid growth company in a big growth industry. There's some competition, but the valuation reflects those competitive risks, and is actually quite attractive considering the market growth potential. As such, the Postmates IPO is one to watch for later this year. PinterestThe last big social media app to IPO was Snap (NYSE:SNAP). That didn't go too well. But, there's reason to believe that the next big social media app to IPO, Pinterest, will have a different outcome.Snap struggled for three reasons. The user base fell flat, engagement proved difficult to monetize, and margins were weak. Pinterest won't have those problems. The platform has about 250 million monthly active users, and is growing that base at a fairly consistent 50 million new users per year. Also, given Pinterest's curation focus, data indicates that engagement on the platform can be very easily monetized, as consumers are already using Pins to influence purchasing behavior. Perhaps most importantly, Pintrest's gross margins are north of 45%.All in all, Pinterest looks positioned for big success on Wall Street. User growth is healthy. Engagement is easily monetized. Margins are high. There's a lot to like here, meaning that Pinterest stock will likely have a much better start on Wall Street than Snap stock.Pinterest filed for IPO at the end of last week, seeking a valuation of at least $12 billion. SlackIf you thought social networking was exclusive to the personal level, think again. Enterprise social networking, or ESN, is a rapidly expanding industry, and at the heart of all that growth is Slack, yet another company set to IPO in 2019.One aspect of the cloud tech boom is the growing demand for enterprise cloud solutions tailored to addressing intra-business communication and workflow needs. ESN is the market which addresses those needs, as it includes a portfolio of platforms which allow for seamless intra-business communication and workflow sharing. The most popular of those platforms is Slack, which has gone from 365,000 daily active users to 10 million daily active users in just four years. Indeed, some say Slack is the fastest growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) company ever.  * 4 Top Marijuana Penny Stocks to Take Seriously in 2019 Going forward, there are two important things to note here. One, demand in the ESN space will only continue to grow. Two, Slack has beaten out competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in this space. As such, Slack has a proven ability to beat top-quality competition in a big growth market. That positions the company for robust growth for a lot longer, which roughly translates into Slack stock doing well on Wall Street.  PalantirPeter Thiel is an important and impressive guy. He co-founded PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and was the first major outside investor at Facebook. Now, his latest venture, Palantir (which Thiel founded in 2003), is set to go public in 2019.At its core, Palantir provides solutions which enable companies of all sizes to make sense of big data. This is a very important service. Big data is of increasing importance when it comes to enterprise decision making. But, the quality of insights device from big data relies on the quality of analysis done on that big data. That's where Palantir excels -- providing the best of the best analysis on such data.The long-term outlook for Palantir looks good. So long as data becomes increasingly important, Palantir's services will have growing demand. The only big concern is competition. But, this market projects to be so big one day that it will support multiple players at scale. Consequently, the Palantir IPO should be successful.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long GRUB, FB, and PYPL.

2019-02-28,Investors should remember that Square sandbags its guidance for easier earnings beats.,"Square&apos;s Guidance Spooked the Bulls, but I&apos;m Not Selling"
2019-02-28,"This morning, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock initially dropped before quickly reversing course. The payments processors reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely above expectations, but included a mixed guide. Investors were initially disappointed by a weak Q1 profit guide. But they shrugged that off, and instead focused on an above-consensus full-year 2019 revenue and profit guide. Consequently, SQ stock reversed course, and ended up trading higher on the day.Source: Via Square This reversal makes sense. Square's Q4 numbers were strong and underscored that the company's underlying secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and digital banking remain robust. The full-year 2019 guide implies that these drivers will remain robust for the foreseeable future. As such, a weak Q1 profit guide is just a hiccup in what is otherwise a very strong growth narrative. It should be ignored, and SQ stock should trade higher on these good numbers. In the big picture, SQ stock is a long-term winner. The company is capitalizing on a secular shift towards non-cash payments, while simultaneously building out multiple digital banking initiatives, the sum of which will keep Square's growth rates high and strong for a lot longer. Margins are also ramping with great pace, and profits are soaring.But, SQ stock is already up 700% over the past three years. How much more upside is left?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the long term, a lot. In the near term, only a little. Based on reasonable growth assumptions, Square stock remains on a winning track towards $150-plus price tags. But, over the next few months, fundamentals imply that upside is capped around $85. As such, I wouldn't be buying SQ stock in bulk here. But, I wouldn't be selling either. This stock remains a long-term buy-and-hold. Strong Q4 Numbers Paint A Positive PictureSquare's Q4 numbers were really good. Net revenues rose by over 50% again. Adjusted revenues rose by over 60% again. Gross Payment Volume, or GPV, growth was again above 25%. GPV mix improved to include 24% of sellers with greater than $500,000 in annualized GPV, versus 20% last year and 16% two years ago. Adjusted Subscription and Services-Based revenue more than doubled year-over-year.Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded roughly 300 basis points year-over-year, continuing what has been a multi-year margin expansion narrative. On top of 60%-plus adjusted revenue growth, this margin expansion powered 97% year-over-year EBITDA growth.All in all, Square's quarter was very good. To be sure, there are some lingering concerns regarding slowing GPV growth. GPV growth has decelerated from 30%-plus a few quarters ago, to under 30% in each of the past two quarters. This signals that the non-cash payments processing tailwind is slowing, which isn't great news.But, it's not deal-breaking news either. Of course, growth will naturally slow here. The fact that it's only slowing by ~1 percentage point each quarter despite being up at 30% and lapping 30%-plus growth is actually impressive. Moreover, the big growth narrative here isn't GPV growth. It's over on the subscription and services side of Square, where Square is building a banking ecosystem surrounding its core payments platforms. Revenue in those businesses is more than doubling year-over-year. That revenue is also high-margin, so it's additive to the bottom-line and is helping drive profit growth.Thus, while GPV growth is slowing, Square's Q4 numbers underscore that this company remains on a winning trajectory. The company continues to be a 20%-plus grower in payments processing, and is building out a robust portfolio of ancillary payments and banking related products like business payments cards and a mobile money app, most of which are seeing incredible traction. So long those businesses continue to ramp, Square will remain a big revenue grower with a strong margin expansion narrative. Long-Term Drivers Imply Big UpsideFrom a valuation perspective, SQ stock has healthy long-term upside. But, upside in the near term will likely be capped by what is becoming an increasingly full valuation.Considering Square's relatively small GPV (less than $100 billion annualized), huge addressable payments market ($40 trillion in global consumer spend) and persistently large growth rates (25%-plus GPV growth has become the norm for several years), it increasingly appears as though Square's payments processing business will continue to be a 20% grower for a lot longer. Meanwhile, considering how well all of its other subscription and service businesses like Cash App are doing, it also increasingly appears that revenue growth on that side of Square will likewise remain well in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, margins are consistently rising by roughly 200 basis points every year. So long as robust revenue growth persists, this trend of 200 basis points of margin expansion every year should persist, too.Putting all that together, I think Square projects as a 20%-plus revenue grower for a lot longer, while margins should continue to ramp towards 30% in the long run. Modeling those assumptions out, I believe Square can do about $4.25 in EPS by fiscal 2025.MVP stocks -- Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- all trade around 30 to 35 forward earnings. Based on a peer average 32.5 forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for SQ stock is close to $140. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $85. Bottom Line on SQ StockStrong Q4 numbers and a healthy fiscal 2019 guide imply that Square remains on a winning trajectory, powered by secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and various digital banking initiatives. If Square can stay on this winning trajectory, then price tags close to $150 make sense for SQ stock in the long run.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism Having said that, valuation looks pretty full in the near term.

2019-02-28,"Last night Square (NYSE:SQ) management reported earnings and SQ stock investors absolutely did not like what they saw. Not as much as they hated the Box (NYSE:BOX) earnings report but nonetheless, the stock is down more than 4% in early morning trading.Source: Via SquareManagement reported a decent scorecard meeting, beating the metrics on the top and bottom lines. SQ even had strong triple-digit growth in services and subscriptions. But as is the case these days, they guided lower than expected going forward. Wall Street demands to be wowed, or else they punish the stock on earnings events.And therein lies the opportunity with Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese dips on earnings that don't come from bad execution are usually opportunities for those who want to go long the stock. SQ is a momentum stock so it almost never allows for an easy trade. On the way up it always seems too high to chase and on the way down it looks like it is falling into a chasm.This morning, Square stock is falling into a short-term support zone around $74 per share. But even if this one fails, It will have strong support through $70 per share. In the long run, the $4 differences between levels won't matter much, especially for a fast mover like this. How to Trade SQ Stock After EarningsYear-to-date, SQ stock came into earnings up 40% so it can afford a few red ticks. Furthermore, for the past 12 months, it is up 70%. This is not the case of BOX, where it is losing growth; SQ is still firing on all cylinders.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market So while 2019 has been great so far, 2018 ended badly when the whole market crashed into year-end. Since then, SQ stock fell 50% from the September highs but it has recovered half of it back from when the correction started. The slide ended on Christmas and since then it's up 45% even after this dip.Those who missed the rally will want back in and it will be a matter of finding the right levels.Fundamentally, I like the transactor companies like this. The gang includes Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The world is migrating to complete electronic payments and these companies are the ones that will make it happen. SQ is the most expensive of them, but it is also so far the most exciting. So, for now, the valuation won't matter much to investors as long as it delivers on growth.Cautious guidance does not mean Square stock deserves a 4% drop. This could be management managing expectations going into a tumultuous geo-political situation where nations are in tariff-war showdowns. Wall Street has a history of over-loving momentum stocks. Much like the situation with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for example. At $290, everyone loved it, but when it fell from grace, very few outspoken fans remained.To that I say that it's not bad because this is human nature; we even have a term for it: FOMO. Both extremes are wrong, so somewhere in the middle lies the truth. It's dips like these that bring the hopium back to more reasonable levels.Surprisingly, a momentum stock that has run up this fast usually sports an overly exuberant ranking among Wall Street experts. But currently, analysts who cover it are split between BUY and HOLD as it trades in the middle of their price range for it. I doubt that given that they beat their targets, there will be a deluge of downgrades. Maybe on the dip some of them will see the opportunity and Square stock may even get a few upgrades.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-02,"My editor asked me to write an article about PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock. Being the end of the week and all, I thought I'd throw him a curve ball. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I was thinking about what I'd like to say about PayPal stock, positive or negative, I came across a Feb. 27 story by Bloomberg contributor Carolina Millan that discussed why analysts think Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) could become the next PayPal. It caught my interest for two reasons:First, I'm a big fan of Latin American businesses. Most investors think of Central and South America as a collection of third-world, second-rate countries. Venezuela doesn't help. However, I believe there's a lot of potential for investors willing to travel down a slightly different road. Here's something I wrote way back in 2012 -- despite all the political and economic flare-ups that have taken place between then and now, I'm a bigger fan today than I've ever been. The second reason the article caught my interest is that I've recommended MercadoLibre stock on several occasions in the past. First in May 2013; most recently this past September. I've always liked the fact it doesn't own any inventory that's sold on its e-commerce platform, unlike Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March So, the fact that MercadoLibre is taking a page out of the PayPal playbook is significant. Here are two reasons why. The Elephant in the RoomFor years the media had speculated about when Amazon was going to conquer Latin America. &quot;So only 10% of the online population is actually shopping, leaving 135 million Latin Americans currently online but not buying anything. That presents a huge opportunity for the company [MercadoLibre] as online penetration increases,&quot; I wrote in 2013. &quot;Of course, Amazon sees such opportunity too. Last year, it opened an e-commerce site in Brazil that focuses on e-books. Some wonder if this is the precursor to broadening its offerings in the largest country in Latin America.&quot;Fast forward to 2018 and people continue to speculate about Amazon's plans for Latin America. In 2017, it began selling electronics and appliances, and in 2018 it went even further and is now selling apparel. Amazon claims it will have more than 300,000 items available to its Brazil customers. While I do see Amazon as a real competitive threat to MercadoLibre, Latin Americans are so familiar with the MercadoLibre name; it will take years for Jeff Bezos and company to break the company's hold on e-commerce in the region.And that's saying something because I believe in the Amazon business model. When Cornered, Fight BackAll businesses face competition. You shouldn't be in business if you're afraid of your competitors. MercadoLibre, as far as I can tell, don't fear Amazon but do respect it. &quot;Our way of competing successfully is to look at all the players, see what they have that we think is great, and if we can incorporate that into our model, we will, but mostly play our game,&quot; MercadoLibre CEO Marcos Galperin said last July at Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley conference. &quot;We try to play our game and use our advantages and our strengths. We have a great network of sellers, a great brand, we're investing very heavily, we already have scale.&quot;PayPal has made several acquisitions in recent years including Venmo and iZettle to diversify its revenue streams beyond its online payment platform, which is accepted by 82% of the top 500 U.S. internet retailers and represents 85% of the company's overall revenue. MercadoLibre is looking to diversify beyond e-commerce retail by growing MercadoPago, its payments business.In the fourth quarter, MercadoPago processed more than $2 billion in third-party, off-platform (online and offline) payments generating almost 70 million transactions. Mobile point-of-sale devices were a big part of that off-platform payment volume accounting for nearly half the 70 million.In fiscal 2018, MercadoLibre's Non-Marketplace revenue, which includes MercadoPago, exceeded its Enhanced Marketplace revenue -- the fees it gets for sales on its e-commerce platform -- for the first time in its history. In 2017, its Non-Enhanced revenue accounted for 39% of its overall revenue. Today, it's 51% of sales.  The Bottom Line on MELI and PYPL StockSince PayPal was separated from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July 2015, PayPal stock has appreciated by 155% compared to 37% for its former parent. I don't think there's any question that PayPal stock will continue to outperform eBay in the years ahead. Analysts expect PayPal revenue to grow 22.2% annually over the next five years. With the acquisitions it's made to broaden its horizons in the online payment industry, I don't think there's any doubt PYPL stock will keep moving higher. As for MercadoLibre, I continue to like its business. If you can afford to, I'd buy both.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-03,"According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has teamed up with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to create a credit card that will be part of a new iPhone app. The reason? AAPL had gotten frustrated dealing with different banks for services like smartphone leasing and digital wallet processing.Source: Shutterstock As should be no surprise, top banks like Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) pitched hard for the deal. But in the end, Apple wanted a partner that could expand into other lucrative areas, like wealth management.No doubt, the fintech market has tremendous potential and looks to be a secular trend across the globe. Based on an investor presentation from PayPal (NYSE:PYPL), the total addressable market is a whopping $110 trillion! And a critical part of this will be smartphones. So yes, this should be very good news for AAPL stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe partnership also has some other clear advantages. By pairing up with GS, AAPL will greatly reduce the need for handling regulations or building the core finance infrastructure. None of this is strategic to AAPL. As for GS, a partnership with AAPL should supercharge its foray into consumer finance. Note that the iPhone has 1 billion users.  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March It's a win-win, right? Well, kind of. There are actually some nagging risk factors as well - which may mean that the impact on Apple stock could be disappointing.First of all, GS has only a short history with consumer finance offerings. It was in 2016 that GS launched Marcus, an online platform for unsecured personal loans. The unit has gone on to add more products like high yield CDs, home improvement loans, and debt/credit consolidation.Next, the credit card market is intensely competitive. The major banks in this category spend heavily on TV and digital advertising - creating top-of-mind brands.And yes, a popular way for people to find credit cards is to go to online comparison sites like LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE). This means that a credit needs to provide compelling features and rates that stand out from the noise.It also seems like a good bet that other mega tech operators will move into the credit card space, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Here's how KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck puts it: &quot;While there is clearly opportunity for Apple to play in financials, news and video, there is also significant competition and much greater room for Apple to mis-execute. This increases risk to the brand that we believe offsets the profit potential based on details we have seen so far.&quot; AAPL Stock Price and the Credit Card BusinessThere are millions of loyal fans who will love to have an Apple credit card. But this only represents a minority of the user base. Consider the company's payments business. Despite its convenience of being loaded on the iPhone, the activation rate has been only about 25% or so in the U.S. and the annual revenues are under $400 million, according to Loup Ventures.In light of this, why wouldn't a credit card have a similar growth path? Unless there is something unique, it probably will be more of a niche play.When it comes to Apple stock, the two main drivers are the iPhone and services. But as seen in the past few quarters, these segments have been a mixed bag. The iPhone -- which represents a majority of revenues -- appears to be a mature business and the growth from services has not been enough to compensate for this.And unfortunately, a credit card will likely be just a rounding error when it comes to the top line.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-03-04,"The iShares Dow Jones US Financial Services (NYSEARCA:IYG) ETF has clocked an impressive 14.67% return for the year so far. This vehicle tracks the performance of a wide assortment of finance stocks like commercial banks, investment banks, asset manager and credit card firms.Of course, the overall bull move in the markets has been a major factor. After all, the 12-month return of the IYG is still -5.66%.Besides, there are still some headwinds for finance stocks. One is the drop in interest rates, which has pinched margins. But there is also the threat of slowing global economic growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet despite all this, there are certainly attractive consumer finance stocks -- especially those that have focused on next generation technologies like cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). And the winners will not be just be startups. Even traditional financial institutions should benefit.  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March So then what are the best consumer finance stocks to invest in now? Let's take a look at three: Bank Of America (BAC)Source: Shutterstock  When it comes to commercial banks, scale is critical. After all, the industry is highly commoditized. So achieving economies of scale can be a differentiator. Just look at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). In the latest quarter, the consumer banking segment posted earnings growth of 52% to $3.3 billion. There was also a nice 6% increase in debit and credit card use.But this is only part of the story. Consider that BAC has been focused on digital transformation. For example, the company has 36.3 million active digital banking customers and 26.4 million use the mobile apps. While much of this has been due to typical online banking systems, BAC has been creating innovative technologies. There is Zelle, which is a peer-to-peer payments app. During the past year, transaction volumes soared by 97% to $14 billion. Then, there is Erica -- an AI digital assistant -- that has 4.8 million users.Granted, the digital efforts are still in the early stages. But so far, they are showing lots of traction -- and should help to lower costs and improve customer loyalty making BAC one of the top consumer finance stocks to buy today.   Intuit (INTU)Source: Pictures of Money via Flickr (Modified) In the fintech world, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has some of the most lucrative franchises: TurboTax and QuickBooks. Year after year they throw off substantial amounts of cash flows. But these businesses have also been a source of valuable data. Consider that QuickBooks has 4.5 million users and TurboTax has 36.4 million. And yes, INTU has been leveraging the data by developing new offerings. For example, there is QuickBooks Capital, which analyzes accounting information to underwrite loans. Since the launch a year ago, the service has funded $277 million in loans.INTU has also made progress on the AI front. To this end, it has built a digital assistant, called QB Assistant, that has answered more than 1.5 million questions.  * 5 Tech Stocks Investors Should Buy on the Rebound Finally, INTU has seen lots of success with QuickBooks Employed, which makes it easier to track mileage and expenses. All in all, it is focused on the huge gig-economy opportunity, which involves fast-growing companies like Uber and Lyft. The app currently has 845,000 subscribers, up from about 489,000 a year ago.   PayPal (PYPL)Source: Shutterstock Since taking the helm of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in 2015, Daniel Schulman has made some great strategic decisions. A big part of this has been M&A. But Schulman also has taken a more collaborative approach with financial institutions. Let's face it, consumers want choices -- not to be locked into proprietary solutions. The bottom line:  The strategies have worked out quite well. PYPL continues to grow at a strong pace and generate significant cash flows. The company also has an enormous user base. Last year, the number of active accounts hit 267 million, up 17%. During this period, payment transactions jumped by 27% to 9.9 billion.But perhaps the most important driver is Venmo, which is the must-have payments app for Millennials. In the latest quarter, transaction volume soared by 80% to $19 billion (for the full year it was $62 billion). What's more, the monetization is still in the early phases. On an annualized basis, it looks like revenues will be about $200 million, compared to essentially zilch a year ago.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

During this period, PayPal stock has posted an average annual gain of 35.24%, whereas EBAY's has been a more modest 15.14%.Source: Shutterstock Something else:  There is a stark difference in market caps. The value of PYPL stock is $113 billion and eBay's is $34 billion. So yes, the split off has unlocked quite a bit of value for shareholders.But what now? Is PayPal still a good play right now? Well, there are certainly some risk factors. For example, the market is highly competitive, with fast-growing operators like Square (NYSE:SQ) and many well funded fintech startups. But even old-line banks are threats like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble What's more, PayPal is far from cheap at current levels. Note that the price-to-earnings ratio is at a hefty 56X.But despite all this, I still think the bull case is still intact. And to see why, here's a look at three major advantages: PayPal Stock: VenmoPayPal's Venmo came from eBay's $800 million acquisition of Braintree in 2013. In the press release for the deal, the app got only one mention - at the end! But of course, Venmo turned out to be a huge winner and is worth billions today. In fact, it is the main growth driver for PYPL.Venmo is a peer-to-peer payments app that has social features (such as sharing information about purchases). It has become a must-have for the Millennial generation.No doubt, growth has certainly been torrid. In the latest quarter, total payment volume (TPV) soared by 80% to $19 billion. According to PYPL, this year should see the TPV hit a whopping $100 billion.The company has been making initial moves to monetize Venmo, with fees from a debit card and an instant cash-out service. For 2019, the forecast is for revenues to exceed $200 million. PayPal Stock: Payments Operating SystemA critical strategic move for PYPL CEO Daniel Schulman has been to partner with financial institutions. The rationale:  to allow more choice for customers. And yes, it has been spot-on.But there has been another goal with this strategy - that is, to create an operating system for mobile and digital commerce. And pulling this off could be a game changer for PayPal. As seen with companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), platforms can be extremely valuable. There are also significant barriers to entry.PayPal does have the key elements for creating an operating system. First of all, the company has a massive user base, with about 267 million active accounts. This is expected to be over 300 million by the end of the year.Next, PayPal has the necessary core technologies for payments, such as merchant processing, ecommerce, cross-border payments and fraud detection. Such capabilities are difficult to replicate, especially as an integrated system. PayPal Stock: Market OpportunityThere are secular forces that are driving digital payments like the ubiquity of smartphones, tablets and wearables. The result is that payments capabilities are being integrated into chat, ride-sharing apps and many other apps.So how big is the digital payments opportunity? According to Schulman, it is a staggering $100 trillion! Keep in mind that PYPL has only a couple percentage points of the market. In other words, there remains lots of runway for the company.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-03-12,"Most tech stocks have staged impressive comebacks so far in 2019. However, in the next few weeks, we might witness a battle between investors and traders, where there will be considerable profit-taking in several of Wall Street's tech darlings, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP).Like most tech stocks, NFLX, PYPL and SNAP are high momentum stocks. In other words, when the broader markets go up or when the company's earnings beat expectations, both investors and momentum traders tend to hit the 'buy' button fast, expecting superior gains within days or weeks.However, if markets suffer a decline or if the company cannot keep up with the rising expectations, investors' risk appetite decreases fast and these stocks can fall much harder than less volatile stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI am expecting some stock price weakness in the near-term in all these three stocks. If you already own any of the Netflix, PayPal or Snap stock, you might want to hold your position. However, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5-7% below the current price point. Expect nearer-term trading in these stocks to sell to be choppy at best.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may want to protect your portfolio with a covered call or possibly a put option spread with a 3-month time horizon. If you do not yet hold any of these stocks, you may want to wait several weeks to buy into the shares at the next dip.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners With all of that in mind, here's a deeper look into why these tech stocks might join many other &quot;stocks to sell&quot; lists in the upcoming days. Netflix (NFLX)Many investors have put Netflix in their sights as a possible stock to sell soon, as various headwinds have hammered down the positive sentiment surrounding its longer-term outlook.Specifically, the price of NFLX stock went from an intraday low of $233.68 on Dec. 24 to an intraday high of $371.49 on Feb. 25. Netflix's quarterly release on Jan. 17 showed that the company beat earnings with earnings-per-share of 30 cents per share. Although its overall numbers were strong, the company cut revenue projections for 2019.Over the past decade, the company has increased annual revenues from $1.6 billion in 2009 to $15.8 billion in 2018.With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 137, Netflix is a growth stock as well as a speculative stock. Analysts value NFLX stock on the expectation of continued high revenue growth that would lead to future profits. But whenever Wall Street fears the company is failing to meet growth or profit expectations, NFLX stock gets penalized. Hard.Currently, the most critical metric investors pay attention to is Netflix's subscriber growth. This number needs to remain strong every quarter to justify the high valuation. For the first quarter of 2019, NFLX is expecting to add 8.9 million paying subscribers.However, new competitors, including Disney (NYSE:DIS), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and AT&T (NYSE:T), are increasingly entering the content distribution space. Before too long, the market might become oversaturated.The upcoming competition from Disney is particularly daunting. Its new streaming service Disney+ will launch by the end of the year and include original movies and TV shows from Disney's brands, including Marvel and Pixar. The platform is expected to concentrate largely on offering content for families. In preparation for this service, Disney is expected to pull its movies off Netflix. Both companies know that content is king.Netflix's current focus is on original content development as well as international expansion. Original content production is a costly business, as it requires the company to part with upfront cash and thus it contributes to Netflix's negative cash flows. Therefore, as Netflix has to constantly borrow to keep on growing, it faces demanding pressure to ensure that it meets its growth targets. Otherwise, it cannot pay its debts easily.If NFLX cannot keep up with the aggressive growth assumptions or increase its prices, especially in international markets, then its margins and the stock price would suffer. As these competitors make their mark in the marketplace in 2019, investors may decide to have a wait-and-see attitude, pressuring the recent price gains.Disney's ESPN+ platform -- the DTC sports entertainment video service -- already has over 2 million subscribers. On Apr. 11, Disney will hold an investor day when it will provide a first look at Disney+ and its original content. Meanwhile, on Mar. 25, Apple will also hold an event, where the company is expected to announce its new TV service to rival Netflix. Around both dates, I am expecting volatility in NFLX stock.Shorter-Term Technical Analysis: Year-to-date, the NFLX stock price is up over 33%. Shorter-term momentum indicators, which describe the speed at which prices move over a given period, have become extremely overbought as a result.Although these indicators can stay overbought for quite a long time, it would not be not surprising to see some profit-taking following the earnings report.In other words, the excessive uptrend we have witnessed over the past month, cannot possibly be sustained. The level I'd be watching is $335. If Netflix stock approaches this level, I'd take it as an early warning that price risk is likely to increase.If you believe in the fundamental bull case for Netflix stock, you might consider waiting for a better time to go long, such as around the low-$300's or even upper $280's.For now, NFLX remains one of the top tech stocks investors are likely to sell in the upcoming weeks. PayPal (PYPL)Global online payments company Paypal is also one of the tech stocks that will likely be joining investors' stocks to sell lists soon.The price of PYPL stock went from an intraday low of $76.7 on Dec. 24 to an intraday high of $99.45 on Mar. 1.As fintech competition is heating up, this pioneering company in the digital payments sector still dominates the first-person payments sphere. It has 267 million customer accounts, 21 million of which are merchant accounts. Unlike Netflix, PayPal is a cash generating machine.When PayPal reported earnings on Jan. 30, it met revenue expectations for the quarter which rose 13% to $4.23 billion. Its adjusted earnings came at 69 cents per share, up 26% from a year ago. The growth in total transaction volumes and in the number of active users was behind the impressive numbers. However, its revenue forecast for 2019 was about 1% below analyst's estimates and thus, PYPL stock went down the next day.As a digital wallet, PayPal's profitable business model depends on processing personal and merchant customer transactions on its global suite of payments platforms. In 2013, when PayPal acquired Braintree, which specializes in payment systems for e-commerce ventures, it also became the owner of Venmo, a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app. Sending money electronically peer-to-peer with a few taps has taken off among U.S. consumers.In this market, which is expected to grow by double-digits in the next few years, Venmo has almost 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors. According to the latest quarterly report, Venmo processed approximately $19 billion of total payment volume, up 80% year-over-year. Through Venmo, PayPal is reaching a younger customer base.However, PYPL stock may fundamentally suffer in the coming months if negative global economic and political conditions dominate the headlines. In January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of a global economic decline as China -- the world's second-biggest economy -- has been slowing down considerably.Likewise, German markets have been particularly worried about the stall in the Chinese economy, as Germany exports heavily to China.Furthermore, if we do not have a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war in early 2019, the markets may throw in the towel in frustration and another selloff might begin.Finally, on Mar. 29, the United Kingdom is set to leave the European Union. The U.K. now finds itself without a clear path forward on Brexit. The U.K. and European financial markets are increasingly edgy about the outcome we may have on that day.In other words, risks for the financial markets are skewed to the downside and in case of a global slowdown, the demand from PayPal customers may soften, denting the price of PYPL stock.Shorter-Term Technical Analysis: YTD, the PayPal stock price is up over 15%. As in the case of the Netflix technical chart, shorter-term momentum indicators are overbought, signaling potential profit-taking in the shorter term.In the next few weeks, I do not expect any substantial positive momentum to push the PYPL stock price over the psychologically significant $100 level. Even if it goes over $100, it is not likely to stay up for long.The two levels I'd be watching are first $95 and then $85. If PayPal approaches $85, then there is likely to be further selling.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 If you believe in the fundamental bull case for PayPal stock, you might consider waiting for a better time to go long, such as around the low-$80's or even upper $70's. Snap (SNAP)Snap Inc joins this list of tech stocks to sell in March as it is also demonstrating signs of near-term volatility. But the possible pain in SNAP stock can be attributed to reasons other than those that affect NFLX and PYPL.The price of SNAP stock went from an intraday low of $4.82 on Dec. 21 to an intraday high of $10.29 on Feb. 25.Since its Initial Public Offering in March 2017, SNAP investors have not had much reason to be pleased with the performance of SNAP stock. After an IPO price $17, and a subsequent high of almost $30, it has not rewarded its early shareholders.However, when SNAP reported earnings Feb. 5, investors welcomed the revenue increase of 36%. Meanwhile, it posted a loss of 4 cents per share, vs. an expected loss of 7 cents a share; its net loss also improved by $158 million to a loss of $192 million. The next day, the price of SNAP was up over 30%.Now, analysts seem divided as to what is next for the company from a fundamental standpoint. Will it be able to continue its positive growth trend and increase its user numbers? Or will it once again disappoint investors who fear that SNAP does not have a viable business model where it can monetize the app's popularity?In other words, Wall Street is currently debating whether every &quot;cool&quot; app will become a successful publicly traded company.I believe it will take at least a few more quarterly reports to fully appreciate the fundamental story of Snap. But until we have a better picture of the execution of management in 2019, I expect SNAP stock to be volatile.Shorter-Term Technical Analysis: YTD the price of SNAP stock is up over 80%. In the next few weeks, I do not expect any substantial positive momentum to push the stock price over the psychologically significant $10 level once again. Even if it goes over $10, it is not likely to stay up for long.If you believe in the fundamental bull case for Snap stock, you might consider waiting for a better time to go long, such as between $7-$8.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-12,"After a brief spike higher, Square (NYSE:SQ) has fallen below the levels it saw before the Feb. 27 earnings announcement. Investors have sold Square stock, as concerns about valuation and slowing profit growth weigh on the equity.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) However, the &quot;slowing&quot; profit growth remains massive. Furthermore, Square's moves into cash registers, payroll processing and banking have formed a compelling ecosystem. This influence calls into question the future of many long-standing financial businesses. Considering SQ's transformational power in the finance business, I would recommend using the recent decline to look for a buy point in Square stock. As I've pointed out in previous articles, Square stock is the financial tech stock of the 2010s. Much like Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) in the 1990s and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the early 2000s, Square carved out a financial niche that the large players could not push aside. Now, Square has built an ecosystem that has helped it to grow beyond its place as a niche player. Beware the Square EcosystemPut simply, Square has grown with the small businesses it continues to support. Admittedly, when venturing beyond phone-based platforms, both the Square Cash Register and the Cash App seem like natural extensions. As of the end of 2018, the Cash App had already grown to 15 million accounts, up from just seven million in 2017.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, now Square has moved into many other areas such as scheduling, payroll systems and even small business loans. This system has become so powerful that customers who left had Square seeking cheaper payment processing solutions, returned to the fold.These moves should also make one wonder about the future of the more traditional financial stocks. For one, Square's small-business lending threatens the type of loans made by community banks, many of whom already struggle to provide high-tech banking services.However, the power of the Square ecosystem threatens more than just community banks. Square Cash Register pressures the company formerly known as National Cash Register, NCR (NYSE:NCR). Square Payroll threatens the business of ADP (NASDAQ:ADP). Moreover, between the Cash App and Square's loan business, what need will consumers have for a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or a Visa (NYSE:V)? Buy Square Stock… If It Pulls BackAll of these companies have time to adapt. For that reason, I will not predict their demise. However, given the power of this ecosystem, it is little wonder why Square stock has commanded such high multiples. Despite my bias toward value, even I like SQ stock long term. Still, over the past year, I have been a Square stock bear on valuation concerns. These worries remain and I would not yet buy SQ.However, even a value-based case has begun to form on SQ stock. The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen to about 68. Also, profit growth has slowed down, but only gradually. Wall Street forecasts a 57.4% increase for this year. For next year, that will only fall to 50%. Analysts also think that SQ will maintain a 49.8% average annual growth rate over the next five years. If the forward PE drops below 60 (a point it surpassed as recently as December), I would recommend buying this stock. Final Thoughts on Square StockThe bad news in Square's numbers may create an opportunity to buy a transformational business at a comparatively low valuation. I have long held a negative view of SQ stock due to its elevated multiple. Despite a steep decline and a partial recovery, SQ still trades at a high PE ratio.However, profit growth will likely come in at about 50% per year for the foreseeable future. More importantly, the growth of its ecosystem looks positioned to transform the finance business. This could also force many of its peers to either adapt or possibly close their doors.  * 12 2018 Winners That Will Be Big Ol' Losers in 2019 The Square financial ecosystem will transform the financial industry more than any one company has in decades. This factor alone makes Square stock a buy on any significant pullback.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-12,"Calendar 2018 wasn't a good year for a lot of stocks. But, it was especially bad for formerly high-flying China tech stocks like Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), which were killed throughout 2018 on slowing China economic expansion concerns. Tencent stock was a loser for lots of reasons.Source: Shutterstock Rising trade and FX headwinds didn't help the situation, either. In that beaten up China tech stock group, Tencent, often labeled the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of China, but which is much more like the Facebook, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) of China fared poorly.From early 2018 to late 2018, Tencent stock was essentially cut it half, from $60 to $30. Now, it's bouncing back, and this rally appears to have runway for the rest of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Specifically, Tencent stock has steadily risen from $30 towards $45 in the New Year on various positive developments. For starter's, China's economy is showing signs of stabilizing.Trade headwinds are less severe. As are FX headwinds. Meanwhile, a massive China video game freeze which stalled Tencent's video game business in 2018 is over, and China is now approving numerous Tencent video game titles.All together, the growth narrative surrounding Tencent stock is simply improving. It also helps that things are looking up on the technical side, too.As such, Tencent stock has gone from 2018 loser, to 2019 winner. It will stay a 2019 winner for the foreseeable future, meaning that buying into this rally could be a good idea. The Big Picture Is GreatIn the big picture, Tencent's long term growth narrative has always been juicy.You have a company which touches every aspect of China's digital economy. They operate the country's largest social media platforms, hence the Facebook comps.They are also China's biggest and most popular video game publisher, hence the EA comps. Tencent also operates China's largest video and music streaming platforms, hence the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify comps, as well as China's largest mobile payments system, hence the PayPal comps.If that weren't enough, Tencent is also a formidable player in online security and the cloud.As such, as goes China's digital economy, so goes Tencent stock. In the long run, China's digital economy still has a long ways to go. Internet penetration rates in China are just above 55%. They stand at 85% throughout Europe, and 95% in North America. At the midpoint, that's a 35 point divergence in a country with 1.4 billion people. Thus, over the next several years, China's digital economy will continue to add hundreds of millions of users.Consequently, in the big picture, Tencent stock has huge growth potential. As China's digital economy adds hundreds of millions of new users over the next several years, that will translate into robust growth for Tencent's social media, streaming, payments, and gaming platforms.Ultimately, that will push revenues and profits materially higher, the sum of which will drive Tencent stock way higher, too. Near Term Headwinds Are Reversing CourseThis robust long term growth narrative hit a road-bump in 2018. China's economy slowed. FX and trade headwinds became more severe. China stopped approving video games. Revenue growth rates at Tencent slowed. Margins compressed. Profit growth fell flat. Tencent stock struggled.Now, those headwinds are turning into tailwinds. China's economy is picking up steam again. FX and trade headwinds have eased. China is approving video games again.Revenue growth rates are expected to start stabilizing with economic activity re-accelerating. Margins should improve against weaker laps. Profit growth should come back into the picture. Tencent stock should rise.This is already happening. It will continue to happen because the long term growth potential here is so promising. Thus, if near term issues get fixed (it appears they are being fixed), Tencent stock should return to its longer term winning ways. Bottom Line on TCEHY StockTencent stock is a long term winner powered by robust and dominant exposure to China's still rapidly growing digital economy.This long term winner just hit a rough patch in 2018 thanks to temporary headwinds. Those headwinds are finally reversing course, and as they continue to reverse course through the remainder of 2019, Tencent stock will get back on a winning path.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TCEHY, FB, PYPL, and SPOT.

2019-03-13,"Another robust trading session has the S&P 500 threatening to run higher, especially if the index can stay over this ~2,800 level. That said, there were some big movers in both directions today, so let's get a look at our top stock trades moving forward. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Aurora CannabisShares of Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) were flying higher Wednesday, up almost 13% after it was announced that Nelson Peltz would be an advisor to the company. It thrust the stock over resistance near $8.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks Winning in 2019 and Beyond This mark had kept a lid on ACB over the last five months and as it gives way, there's a lot of potential upside. Don't forget, in October ACB was trading north of $10 while its 52-week high is $12.52.Below $8 and there's cause for concern among bulls. I would not be long this name below the 21-day moving average or uptrend support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: RokuIn the opposite direction we have Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). This stud is still up 100% so far on the year, but a pair of downgrades on Wednesday morning knocked it down by $10 a share. Sheesh!Clearly this doesn't change Roku's fundamental outlook, but the declines likely ushered in profit takers who have been long this stock for its post-earnings run. Now I need to see uptrend support hold and I want to see Roku stock close above the 21-day moving average.If that's the case, bulls may have a case to be long, but it wouldn't be bad for Roku stock to digest some of this big move. A test of this $58 area would allow ROKU to retrace about 50% of its day-one earnings rally. Also worth pointing out is that Roku stock, at its lows on Wednesday, sat at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from its post-earnings range. See if it holds Wednesday's low and reclaims the 21-day. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Rite AidWhat have we always said here on InvestorPlace? Do. Not. Invest. In. Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD)!There's a reason why as this name is volatile and circling the drain. Long or short can get both investors hurt and that's why it's been a no-touch for me for a long time. Notice on the chart that the stock couldn't even get above $1 back in January.An eventual delisting is likely and even today, RAD couldn't hold its gains. I expect this one to take out 65 cents and if it does, it will likely go below its 52-week low at 60 cents. I'm not shorting, but I'm definitely not buying it. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: ExpressAnother struggler, investors had a warning in Express (NYSE:EXPR) before Wednesday's 10.5% post-earnings fall.Notice the purple arrows on the chart. Arrow No. 1 told investors that support near $5.08 was no longer in play. Arrow No. 2 showed that the retest of support failed, just before earnings. Even if it had barely reclaimed support, the pre-earnings breakdown was warning enough with a name like this.Now sub-$5 and I find little reason to stick with EXPR. Expect rallies to be met with sellers until the tide changes. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: PayPalAfter breaching $100, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is pulling back. It's clear that momentum is bullish in PYPL and that makes it a solid buy-the-dip candidate.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash It's totally possible that we get more upside follow through above $100 on Thursday. Particularly given that shares are not yet overbought. However, I'll be looking for an eventual pullback into uptrend support and the 21-day moving average. If we get it, bulls have a great risk/reward setup.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long ROKU.

2019-03-13,"By now, you should have received most of your tax documents. Keep in mind that most of them are required to be sent out according to IRS regulations. If not, there could be fines assessed. But, of course, paperwork can get lost in the shuffle. A clerical error could send your tax documents to the wrong address, or perhaps you recently moved and forgot to update your address. So what do you do if you have not received everything you need to file your taxes before the April deadline?Source: Shutterstock Well, first of all, there's no need to panic. There are actions you can to expedite the matter. It is vital, however, to not wait until the last minute.For taxpayers, the most common documents fall into four categories. Let's see what to do for each of them:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Category 1Form W-2: This reports wages and salaries along with the amounts withheld for income taxes, Social Security and Medicare.What to do if your W2 is missing: Call your employer. Granted, in rare occasions, there may be resistance or maybe the company has gone bust. So you can contact the IRS ( 1-800-829-1040) and the agency will reach out to the employer.And if this does not work? Probably the best approach is to fill out Form 4852, which is for creating a substitute W-2. You will need your final pay stub for this. Category 2Form 1099-R: This has pension/annuity income or the amount from an IRA distribution.  Form 1099-INT: This reports interest earned from your bank or brokerage account.  Form 1099-DIV: This provides the amount of dividends earned.What to do if your 1099 is missing: You can reach out to the issuer, which is usually a bank or brokerage firm. In fact, you can probably download the form directly from the firm's website. Category 3Form 1099-MISC: This is for income earned from self-employment or royalties.What to do if your 1099-MISC is missing: You should call the issuer directly. Although, a 1099-MISC may be more difficult to get. This is especially the case when the issuer is a small business (the owner may actually be avoiding paying taxes). So if you cannot get the form, you can report the income on your 1040, under Schedule C.Now there may be instances where a 1099-MISC is not required to be sent to you because the income is below $600 or the compensation is paid with a service like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). This is common for, say, freelance work with Uber or Lyft.But this does not mean you are off the hook for reporting it. The IRS requires that you disclose all your income. Period. Category 4K-1: This reports income or losses from a partnership.What to do if your K-1 is missing: This form does not have a deadline. The reason is that company's often need time to finish their books. Consider that you may not receive a K-1 until after the April 15 deadline. As a result, you will need to file an extension (IRS Form 4868), which will give you an additional six months. However, you will still need to pay the estimated taxes owed for the partnership - or you will be subject to paying interest and penalties.This can certainly get complicated -- in other words, you may need to get the assistance of a tax professional.Tom Taulli is an Enrolled Agent and also operates PathwayTax.com, which is a tax advisory and preparation firm.

2019-03-13,"Last year was especially hard on the financial sector. It developed the reputation that the banks could sustain a rally. But one segment within the financials is hotter than ever and held up well even last year. Unlike traditional money centers, financial technology or &quot;fintech stocks&quot; like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and even old dogs like Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continue to rally through thick and thin. Wall Street is enamored with their business models, and this has benefitted PayPal stock.Source: Shutterstock In fact, PayPal stock is up 21% in the past 12 months; whereas, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 10% for the same period. The fastest and most expensive runner of the fintech bunch is Square (NYSE:SQ), which is up 35% year-to-date, but PYPL, V and MA are all strong regardless as each is up around 15% for the same period.Today, the story is about PayPal and how it should be a winning investment for the long term and offer short-term opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How to Approach PayPal Stock TodayFor years, the global trend has been to transition finances to strictly online transactions. From regular shopping to global money flow, we demand our money to flow fast and worldwide. This was most evident during the Bitcoin craze of 2017. Although the value of the coin is debatable, everyone agrees that the blockchain technology behind it is attractive and encapsulates the concept.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners Transactor companies like Paypal offer the blockchain concept of moving money fast and they are operational now. So they are best suited to sustain their success for years to come. Since the transition to electronic finance is in its infancy, there is enough business for all the current competitors to thrive.So PYPL stock is likely to do well for the long term, but the problem for investors is that it's a momentum stock. It moves fast in both directions and this presents a problem to many. On the way up it seems like it's ready to correct thereby forcing traders to miss out on the upside.Case in point, while Wall Street is still expecting a correction in stocks, PYPL stock is almost at its all-time highs. Clearly, the fintech bulls are used to the momentum aspect of this trade. The idea is to buy high and sell higher. Else we'd end up missing the whole trade.Fundamentally, Paypal stock is not cheap. It is almost twice as expensive as V and three times as expensive as American Express (NYSE:AXP). But for as long as it is growing fast, investors will give it a pass on that front.Younger companies need to over spend in order to catch up so it is more important that traders judge their top line performance and not the margins. At least PYPL is in the black whereas SQ still loses money.For those who want to own the shares for the long term, then, the actual timing is less important. If the stock market is rising, then PYPL will be higher later. But not every one wants to hold stocks for the long term and for those kinds of investors, there are short-term clues for more surgical entry and exit points. Bottom Line on PYPLFor the short term, PYPL is near its all-time highs, so buying it up here requires courage. But with proper stop loss levels, traders can do it provided they stick to their exit points well.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 PayPal stock recently broke out of the $94 zone so that would be the best level of short-term support if the rally fades from the top. The closest support level, which usually is the weakest, is at $97. Below that, there are two similar supports at $96 and $95. So depending on personal preferences and risk tolerance, those would be the significant short-term levels to trade. This only applies to those in it for the short term. Longer term, it can fall to $88 per share and not change the bullish thesis much.In summary, Wall Street is attracted to financial tech because the transition into an electronic environment plays right into the hands of companies like PayPal. That means you can own it or trade it with confidence for years to come.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-13,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Last month marked 15 years since Facebook 160 NASDAQ FB founder Mark Zuckerberg debuted his social network from his Harvard dorm room From his initial focus on the college market,Facebook Stock Awaits A Change That Will Make Network More Like … WeChat
2019-03-13,"Last month marked 15 years since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg debuted his social network from his Harvard dorm room. From his initial focus on the college market, he definitely saw much grander opportunities.While growth was superfast, Zuckerberg still faced many existential challenges. Just some included fighting tough rivals like MySpace as well as the making transition from the desktop to mobile devices. But along they way, Zuckerberg stuck to his core message: to make the world more open and connected.And yes, the strategy has definitely paid off in a big way. Currently, Facebook stock has a market value of $491 billion -- making the company one of the world's most valuable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet it seems that things may be changing again, this time setting up Zuckerberg's most important moment.Part of this is due to the backlash to privacy breaches. The most notable, of course, was the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, which led to the release of personal information on 87 million users. That showed just how lax Facebook had become over the years.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary But there is another important challenge, which could weigh on FB stock: The social media market is getting more mature. And yes, this will mean it will get tougher to gin up growth. Push for PrivacyTo deal with all this, Facebook is changing its strategy -- and ironically, it's about being more private. This is certainly risky since it's an approach that's in stark contrast to the company's stated mission. But then again, in order for Facebook to continue to thrive, I think there is little choice for the social network.In early March, Zuckerberg penned a long blog post titled &quot;A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking.&quot; In it, he noted that the future of social media will be about platforms that involve &quot;private, encrypted services where people can be confident [that] what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever.&quot;Granted, this is not so eloquent or inspiring. But I think Zuckerberg is spot-on with strategy -- and his new focus could be key to Facebook stock growth over the long haul. The short term, though, could be dicey. Keep in mind that nearly all FB revenue comes from advertising. In other words, sophisticated user targeting could be tough as the data is encrypted and many of the messages are ephemeral.Another challenge is the Facebook brand. Will users buy in to the new message? Will they believe it?Well, that's far from clear. Significant Revenue PotentialDespite the privacy mishaps, there appears to be little impact on the user base. What's more, the revenue potential for a private Facebook is significant. Note that we have already seen this with WeChat, owned by Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). The Chinese platform has become the go-to app for making a myriad of transactions -- both for virtual items and even within brick-and-mortar stores. The result is that WeChat has quickly morphed into a massive ecosystem with powerful barriers to entry. In fact, China has rapidly become a cashless society because of this.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio I suspect Zuckerberg is thinking the same thing could be the case with FB. More importantly, the company has the apps for this -- like Messenger and WhatsApp -- and the engineering resources to pull it off. Bottom Line on FB StockThe shift towards a more private Facebook -- and its impact on the FB stock price -- will definitely take time. It will also be tough to do in the U.S., as Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMessage platform holds a dominant position in the category. But again, Zuckerberg has a knack for finding growth opportunities. Consider his success with Instagram versus Snap (NYSE:SNAP).But I do think Zuckerberg needs to strike a transformative acquisition to push his new vision. Perhaps one would be to acquire PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). It would not only get a full payments platform, with a large massive user base, but also the popular Venmo peer-to-peer app.Regardless, Zuckerberg's blog post should really be encouraging for holders of Facebook stock. It shows that he understands that, to remain on top, there will need to be disruption with the current way of doing things.Tom Taulli is an Enrolled Agent and also operates PathwayTax.com, which is a tax advisory and preparation firm.

2019-04-04,"It's a pretty good bet that - in the coming months - we'll see important changes at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) that will affect EBAY stock.Source: Shutterstock The main reason for the coming changes is that the company has two major activist shareholders: Elliott Management and Starboard Value.  Elliott Management has the largest stake, with $1.4 billion of eBay Inc stock (or more than 4% of the outstanding shares) and has been the leader when it comes to pushing for action. In a letter to management, the investment firm called for spinning off StubHub and the online classified businesses to unlock value for the owners of EBAY stock.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises This week, we got some ideas about the restructuring moves that EBAY plans to make. The company will shut down its eBay Commerce Network. effective May 1, according to a report in Techcrunch. eBay Commerce is an ad network that allows merchants to advertise on third-party sites. However, it really did not get traction, as there are only 1,000 publishers in the network.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, getting rid of the eBay Commerce Network looks like a good move for EBAY and EBAY stock After all, the network has been around since 2013, so there was more than enough time to attempt to build it up. It also is important to note that the digital ad market is fairly saturated, with mega operators like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominating the sector.Yet EBAY is not getting out of the ad business. Instead, it appears that the company is going to target much bigger revenue opportunities in the category, such as ads on the eBay properties as well as affiliate programs. EBAY Stock and Activist ShareholdersIt did not take long for Elliott Management and Starboard Value to make a deal with EBAY. And for the most part,it appears that  the agreement will produce positive results for EBAY and EBAY stock.First of all, there will be a significant change in the company's capital allocation. Keep in mind that eBay plans to return $7 billion to shareholders over the next two years, including a quarterly dividend.But the settlement also includes a serious focus on restructuring operations. That includes a deep-dive review of the company's assets and a streamlining of its operations, which means consolidating the marketplaces under one global leadership team.eBay's revenue growth has been unimpressive during the past few years, especially given the ongoing changes that affected e-commerce and mobile. eBay's efforts to become more focused on its core marketplaces should help rev up its top line thereby boosting EBAY stock.Also positive for EBAY's results and EBAY stock is the fact that the company has agreed to bring Elliot partner Jesse Cohn and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) CEO, Matt Murphy onto its board. A third independent director is expected to be put in place later in the year. The Bottom Line on EBAY StockEBAY is no stranger to activist investors. Back in 2015, Carl Icahn agitated for the spinoff of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The move did unlock lots of value for PYPL, but EBAY stock mostly lagged.EBAY has some major advantages. The company has global scale, with 179 million active buyers. It also has a thriving mobile business, as its app has been downloaded over 447 million times. EBAY has been moving away from auctions, which are mostly a niche business, and focusing on new product offerings.And in the wake of the increased influence of Elliott Management and Starboard Value, EBAY should have more urgency to realize more value from its assets. No doubt, that should bode well for EBAY stock, especially since the valuation of eBay Inc stock remains fairly reasonable. The forward price-earnings multiple  of EBAY stock is only about 12.5.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

However, according to Bank of America, BABA stock affiliate Ant Financial's Alipay payment app is a much bigger deal than investors may realize.Source: Charles Chan Via Flickr BABA Stock Super AppBank of America analyst Eddy Leung calls Alipay a &quot;super app.&quot; Here are some of the numbers driving that high praise.Americans are familiar with digital payment leader PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). As of the end of Q4, PayPal had an estimated 267 million global active accounts. Leung estimates Alipay has more than 600 million mobile users.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio In addition, Alipay has the largest mobile and PC market share in Chinese payments at roughly 50%. Even better, that market share has barely budged since late 2016. Alipay is dominating the market and keeping competitors like Tencent (OTC: TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) at bay.Alipay offers a variety of useful payment services within it's app. It also is expanding its services outside of payments. For example, Alipay now offers transportation pass services for bikes and buses in some large cities. It also offers delivery services and dining reservation services. Alipay users have utility booking and payment services at their fingertips. Alipay has also implemented a user rewards credit system and even offers charitable donations services. Increasing EngagementLeung says Alipay's large, stable market share allows it to focus on monetizing its users and increasing engagement rather than growing its user base. The latest mobile app usage data from China suggests those efforts are paying off.Alipay is already the third most popular app in China in terms of monthly active users behind only WeChat and QQ. It's still a distant fifth place in terms of engagement. However, engagement numbers are significantly higher than they were just a couple of years ago.More than 80 percent of Alipay users now use the app for multiple services, according to Bank of America. More than 60 percent use at least three services, while more than 20 percent use five or more different services. Service use is up across the board compared to a year ago.&quot;We see Ant Financial ('Ant')'s Alipay app emerging into a large mobile platform, going beyond its leading position in an already very large vertical segment and increasingly serving the needs in everyday life of its users and offering bigger opportunities to cooperate with the other business units under Alibaba,&quot; Leung says. BABA Stock OverlookedWhether because of the ongoing trade war with China, distrust of Alibaba's corporate structure or the fact that U.S. investors are more familiar with Amazon's services, Alibaba stock is often overlooked by U.S. investors.As a result, Alibaba has put up staggering growth numbers in ecommerce and cloud services that have put Amazon to shame in recent quarters. Yet BABA stock has barely moved in the past year. Leung and Bank of America have a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $215 price target for BABA stock.I recently wrote about why some of the common bear arguments against Alibaba don't hold weight. Alibaba's market is much bigger and faster-growing than the U.S. market, it is essentially protected from international competitors and it is on the cutting edge of technologies that will dominate 21st-century China.Alipay is just one of the dozens of businesses under Alibaba's wing that have massive long-term disruptive potential.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan was long BABA stock.

2019-04-10,"Visa (NYSE:V), stock is up more than 30% over the past year, stoked, in part, by Federal Reserve rate hikes that have translated into higher profit margins for credit card companies. The overall fundamental strength of the company has also been the catalyst behind the V stock returns.The world's largest retail electronic payments network, Visa, is expected to report earnings on Apr. 24. There could be some volatility and profit-taking in V stock in April, especially as many other financial services firms also report in the coming weeks. However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add Visa stock to their portfolio. Long-Term V Stock StrengthsRobust Fundamental Numbers:  Visa is a quality blue-chip company with a $345 billion market cap. The group does not issue credit cards or lend money. Instead, the company operates as an &quot;intermediary,&quot; charging a fee on each of the 150 million transactions its network handles every day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisa has three sources of revenue:  * Service revenues (for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products);  * Data processing revenues (fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, or clearing); and,  * International transaction revenues (for cross-border and currency conversion transactions).Visa's revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2018 was $5.51 billion, a 13.25% increase year-over-year. The company saw double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions for Q4 and full-year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at almost 55%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.65.Wall Street expects Visa's profitability and robust financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for something with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta. It's currently bidding to buy Earthport, a British payments company.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 19%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking in V stock. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;In April and May, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks, and even have a pullback toward the low-$140's or even mid-$130's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.99, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, V stock price may also be adversely affected.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $185.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off If there are other strong earnings reports or news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in V stock price. However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, leadership in the respective market, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-11,"Stocks blasting to new highs usually come bearing gifts -- for bulls, at least. If you're a bear, then beware because these super-powered leaders pack a punch. And that makes them some of the best stocks to buy.I ran a quick scan last night for new yearly highs. With Wednesday's rally, dozens of stock made the list, giving me ample choices from which to identify who deserved a coveted spot in today's gallery. The infatuation with stocks that are blazing into virgin territory, or at least new yearly highs, is well founded.Shareholders are basking in profits. There is no overhead supply, no group of afflicted owners begging to get back to breakeven. Short sellers are losing money -- more than ever before. And that creates some serious incentive to cover their positions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives More demand + less supply = bullish.Check out these three stocks to buy at new highs. Stocks to Buy at New Highs: Cisco (CSCO)Source: ThinkorSwim Were it not for Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) inclusion in the list, the title would have been &quot;3 Stocks to Buy at Record Highs.&quot; But during the height of the dot-com bubble, CSCO stock rallied as high as $82 before its crash to single digits. And that means this week's jump to $55.82 only represents a fresh 19-year high.It's still impressive. The strength of this year's uptrend has been matched by its consistency. The 20-day moving average has proven the perfect companion by supporting every pullback. Recent profit-taking formed a high base pattern that potentially triggered with yesterday's rip.Given this year's history of profitable breakouts, I see no reason to bet against another upside thrust. Consider buying the June $55 calls for $2.65. Paypal (PYPL)Source: ThinkorSwim Since breaking out of last year's trading range, Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been on a tear. With yesterday's bump, its year-to-date gains now stand at 28%. The last upswing saw increasing momentum, and all major moving averages are rising beneath the price.Volume patterns are also backing the bulls. I see a handful of accumulation days over the past quarter, with only a few sporadic episodes of distribution.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back The next earnings report looms on April 24, so consider that the wild card. But if you believe the trend continues, then buy the June $105/$110 bull call spread for $2.70. You could come close to doubling your money if PYPL stock rises above $110 by June expiration. VMware (VMW)The price action of VMware (NYSE:VMW) has largely mirrored PYPL, at least recently. Its trend is booming, with the moving averages stacked atop each other in bullish form. Distribution has disappeared, with hardly any significant selling pressure.  Implied volatility is even tanking, showing uncertainty is running low these days.Pattern-wise, we've seen VMW stock develop a mini ascending triangle formation that it finally completed with Wednesday's surge. If this breakout follows the script of its predecessors, big gains await. I suspect we will see a push toward $200.To capitalize, buy the July $190/$200 bull call spread for $4.60. The liquidity of VMW options is mediocre, so limit orders are a must here.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

That's a very respectable run. It's ability to capitalize on consumer sector has certainly given it a head start if not a solid competitive moat for all the newcomers that have shown up since its founding in 1998. PYPL Stock Spun Off With Perfect TimingSpinning off from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) a few years back looks like a brilliant idea and could not have been timed any better. Just as PYPL stock started to spread its wings, the financial sector was losing some of its post-crash regulations and disruption started hitting the banks and the way they interacted with their customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a industry that traditionally risk-averse and top-down driven, this new banking option empowered individuals and allowed them unprecedented access to their money.When peer-to-peer (P2P) banking hit -- being able to send money directly from your account to someone else's account on your mobile phone -- it opened up a whole new world where banks no longer functioned as anything more than a repository for your cash before you spend it.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees PYPL's Venmo is one of two of the most popular P2Ps out there now. Zelle, which is owned by a consortium of the big banks, still leads PYPL, but not by much.Essentially, the big banks saw that if they didn't move quickly, P2P banking could significantly hurt their business with younger generations that weren't interested in traditional banking, and more importantly, didn't have to be.New services were popping up and the best solution was for the national banks to circle the wagons and come up with their own digital payment services platform. In 2011, Zelle was born. Its instant payment service was launched in 2017.But even with that significant competition, PYPL is still growing. In Q4, had an 80% spike in transaction volume. For all of 2018, volume on Venmo increased 49%.About 85% of the financial institutions in the Zelle universe are regional and local banks and savings and loans. But PYPL is still focused on the individual consumer and is now adding features like credit cards as well as a variety of other strategies to encourage stickiness and grow its business.This isn't a zero-sum game. Both strategies have great opportunities to grow their businesses. And PYPL is doing a very good job on that front because it has its roots as a technology disruptor rather than a branch of the largest financial institutions in the world.

2019-04-29,"As I've written before, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock was an exaggerated reflection of last year's broad market. As major indices gained in the first three quarters of 2018, Square stock soared. In fact, Square stock nearly tripled over that time. When investors sold off stocks in the fourth quarter, SQ plunged, at one point losing 50% of its value in less than three months.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Oddly, 2019 has been a bit different. Like many stocks, SQ rallied at the beginning of the year. Since the company reported seemingly strong Q4 results back in February, however, Square has diverged from the rest of the market, and the rest of tech. SQ actually has lost about 10% of its value while other ecommerce/payment plays like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) have continued to rise.And so there's an obvious path to upside coming out of Square earnings on Tuesday afternoon. A report that includes both a beat and strong and/or raised guidance should mean that SQ itself can join in the rally. Anything less, however, is a problem. Square stock still isn't cheap and still isn't pricing in any sort of disappointment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now  Square Earnings ExpectationsFor the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting Square to continue its impressive revenue growth of late. Consensus estimates suggest a 56% rise in adjusted revenue. Square calculates adjusted revenue as total sales less transaction costs, bitcoin costs, and purchase accounting adjustments.Earnings are expected to be relatively light, at just $0.08, against $0.06 the year before. It's likely that analysts are expecting investments behind key initiatives like the Square Card and the acquisition of Weebly to hit near-term margins and profits.Investors should expect those consensus estimates will be beaten. In fact, Square appears to have topped expectations in every quarter since its late 2015 IPO. With the economy still strong, that trend seems unlikely to change. One potential red flag, if a small one: small business confidence has weakened in recent months.And that trend had better not change. While SQ has struggled in the last two months, it's still up 29% so far this year and still trades at about 90x full-year 2019 EPS estimates. An earnings or guidance miss is not priced in.But at this point, even a headline beat probably isn't enough to move the needle. To some extent, given Square's history of conservative guidance, investors likely are pricing in better results than analysts are modeling. And so a beat and even raised guidance alone aren't likely to lead to a huge gain in SQ stock after earnings. Rather, Q1 earnings might be more about the story Square can tell and the progress it's making in key growth areas. The Story Behind SQ StockTo at least some extent, the core Square business model of providing payment services to small- to mid-sized businesses appears priced in. Again, SQ stock isn't cheap, or close. To get back to the valuations that drove SQ to $100 in early October, Square needs to convince investors it has growth drivers outside of that core business.And so it's likely the ancillary initiatives here that will be the focus of investors, rather than just the headline revenue and EPS growth figures. Investors will want to know whether the integration of Weebly is progressing, as Square looks to become a more viable competitor to Shopify's e-commerce platform.Larger sellers (above $500K in annual volume) are becoming an increasingly large part of Square's ecosystem: that category drove 24% of payment volume in Q4 2018, up from 16% two years before. Further expansion there would limit Square's reliance on more volatile (and more cyclical) small businesses, and perhaps de-risk the story in the eyes of some investors.Square is looking to get a bank license. Investors will be looking for an update on that front. Impressive Venmo user growth has driven PYPL stock higher. Can Square position its own Square Cash app as a viable alternative and a driver for SQ stock?Again, valuation here already is high. In this market, however, it clearly can move higher. But it's not going to be a matter of just 'beating' earnings. Square has to again convince investors that it's a leader in payments with wide-ranging growth opportunities.Doing so will mean that Square gets treated the way it was last year and the way SHOP stock is now. That's the way that the rally in Square stock jumpstarts after Tuesday's report. Is Square Stock a Buy?Is that path viable enough for investors to buy SQ ahead of earnings? It's likely a matter of taste. I've long liked Square as a business, having once compared it to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), if at a much smaller scale. But I've also argued, often incorrectly, that Square stock is overvalued. I think the same is true of Shopify stock at these levels.There are risks both into and out of earnings, as the sharp fall in Q4 showed. Investors clearly have to trust the overall market, given how hard SQ stock fell when overall sentiment turned sour. And competition isn't going anywhere, whether it's Paypal, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), or other private fintech plays.That said, for growth stock investors, there really aren't a lot of opportunities left out there that aren't at all-time highs, or close. And it's possible to see a narrative in which Square earnings are impressive, allowing SQ stock to play 'catch-up' to the rest of tech in coming months. It's not a trade I would make. But ahead of the report, I can see why other, more aggressive, investors might.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-29,The payments giant has fine-tuned its immensely successful partnering strategy by adding an equity component to its deal-making.,PayPal Is Shifting Its Revenue Strategy
2019-04-29,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile-payments company, is expected to report earnings on May 1, after market close. Following its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018 as the company became a darling among long-term investors.Source: Via SquareThen Square stock had a rough second half of the year in 2018. And in 2019, although the stock is up 27%, it has lately been exhibiting some price weakness. Thus shareholders are now wondering if they should consider buying the stock prior to the earnings release.Despite the overall strength in price this year, I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy into the shares just yet. When Square reports earnings this week, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Although I would not bet against SQ stock's future, I expect to see further volatility and possible price weakness in Square stock in May. Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Is a Growth Stock in a Competitive IndustryAlthough it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses, individual clients and act more like a traditional bank. Its ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. In other words, through various growth initiatives, management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech sphere.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 The global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the so-called fintech revolution is fast changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers.For example, small vendors can now easily accept card payments anywhere and with a minimum set up effort and fees. Individuals, especially the younger generations, are also making a drastic shift to using electronic payments.Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. Square faces competition from many companies, including the global online payments group Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant.On Feb. 27, SQ reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue. However, the San Francisco-based company, run by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, gave Q1 earnings guidance that came up short of expectations.A growth stock like Square trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. Therefore, since late February, SQ stock price has been in a downtrend. Square Stock and Earnings Season JittersOn May 1, in addition to the headline numbers, such as earnings and adjusted revenues, Square investors will pay particular attention to several numbers, including:  * Gross payment volume (GPV): Square defines GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. In Q4 2018, the company processed $23 billion in GPV, a year-over-year increase of 28%, driven by growth in larger sellers. Wall Street tracks this metric widely.  * Growth in larger sellers: Square defines larger sellers as those that make more than $125,000 of annualized GPV. At this point, 51% of GPV comes from larger sellers.  * Square's peer-to-peer Cash App: This mobile payment service app had more than 15 million monthly active customers in December 2018. SQ charges 2.75% per transaction to businesses that accept Cash App payments. It also makes money through individuals using the app.  * Square Capital: The business lending arm offers loans to eligible Square sellers. In 2018, Square Capital originated more than $1.6 billion in small business loans. Wall Street is worried about SQ's potential exposure to credit risk.While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has question marks as to whether the group can maintain a sustained growth quarter after quarter.Currently, Square is a domestically focused company and its revenue stream mainly comes from the U.S. In the U.K., it has recently launched the Instant Deposit and Cash App. Although bulls are hopeful that Square can increase its penetration into global markets in the coming years, too, bears argue that if the U.S. economy slows down considerably in the near future, the lack of geographical diversification is likely to hurt the stock price.Therefore, most investors are likely to wait on the sidelines until they have a chance to analyze SQ's balance sheet to see if the stock might be somewhat overvalued. They will also want to see if there is any growth fatigue or major trend changes in the industry.Unless the numbers and the rest of the 2019 guidance are exceptional in May, SQ stock investors may decide not to invest in it for several more weeks … or even months. So Should Investors Buy SQ Stock Ahead of Its Earnings?Square stock is momentum-driven, hence it usually experiences big price swings after reporting earnings. In other words, it can easily gap up if the numbers are better than expected, or if the numbers disappoint, SQ stock can easily gap down, too.The options markets are pricing in an approximate post-earnings move of 10-12% in either direction in SQ shares. In case of a favorable earnings report, my next price target for Square stock in the coming weeks is between $75 - $80.On the other hand, any disappointment in Square's earnings statement or future outlook could quickly send the shares to low the $60's. At this point, through short-term technical analysis, I'm expecting further price decline in Square stock.After the earnings results, I'd not fight the tape and would be willing to re-evaluate the technical charts in the coming days.If you already own SQ stock, you might want to hold your position. However, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5%-7% below the current price point.After the upcoming earnings call, in case of a price drop, if you still believe in the bull case for Square stock, then you might consider waiting for a better time to buy, such as when the share price is around $65, or even lower.  * 5 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Under $10 If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a covered call strategy with a time horizon of approximately one month. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of SQ at a limit price of $71.55 (the closing price on April 26) and, at the same time, sell a SQ May 31 $71.5 call option, which currently trades at $3.85 and offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in Square stock.This call option would stop trading on May 31, 2019, and expire on June 1. The Bottom Line on Square StockFintech is an evolving and growing industry. With its strong small business focus and proactive management, Square stock is likely to weather the ebbs and flows of the industry. However, there might be a weakness in the SQ stock price in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate.On a final note, if the SQ stock price declines further amid a subdued earnings season, Square may very well become a takeover target.Investors who are interested in growth companies in financial services but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as SQ may also consider investing in various exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have Square stock as a holding. Examples of such funds would include the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF), the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) or the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-01,"Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) continued on their torrid run higher in late April after the digital payments provider delivered first quarter numbers that broadly underscored the company's healthy long term growth narrative. Investors were reassured that it remains the unchallenged leader in the secular growth digital payments market, and that the drivers pushing forward this company remain as vigorous as ever. Consequently, the PayPal stock charged higher.Source: Shutterstock This is nothing new for PYPL stock. Over the past several years, the growth narrative supporting PayPal has remained healthy, the numbers have remained robust, and the stock has remained on an upward trajectory. That's why PYPL stock is up more than 200% over the past five years, versus a 40% gain for the S&P 500.Over-performance in PYPL stock will persist. In the big picture, the same things that got PayPal here (i.e. a huge digital payment shift powering big revenue growth and steady margin expansion, against the backdrop of a stable global economy) will continue for the foreseeable future. As such, PYPL stock projects to remain on a winning trajectory for the next several years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares From a numbers perspective, fundamentals support upside in the stock to $125 in 2019. Thus, with PayPal stock trading around $110 today, upside over the next few months looks good. Strong Q1 NumbersPayPal just reported first quarter numbers. From an expectations standpoint, the numbers were mixed. First quarter profits beat. Revenues were in-line. The second quarter guide met on profits, but came in below for revenues. Meanwhile, the full-year revenue guide was in-line with expectations, and profits were guided above the consensus estimate.In the big picture, though, quarterly beats/misses are just noise for PayPal. The bull thesis on PayPal stock boils down to two things. One, the digital payments shift is happening very quickly, and isn't slowing. Two, PayPal is the face of that digital payments shift, without any major or worrisome competition.As such, all investors need out of quarterly earnings is for the numbers to broadly confirm those two things. How? Continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion. Across the board, PayPal delivered just that this quarter. See the important numbers below:  * Total Payment Volume growth of 25%. This marks the third quarter in a row of 25% TPV growth. TPV growth is expected to stabilize at this level, and come in at up ~25% for the full year, too. Thus, TPV growth has been, is, and remains stable north of 20%.  * Active Account growth of 17%. This marks the second consecutive quarter of 17% account growth. That 17% mark is up from 15% in the year-ago quarter and 10% in the two years ago quarter. Thus, account growth is accelerating higher despite tougher laps.  * Adjusted revenue growth came in right around 20% again and is expected to come in around 20% again this year. Thus, revenue growth remains stable around 20%.  * Operating margins expanded 10 basis points in the quarter, and are guided to keep expanding for the full year. Margins have been on a multi-year uptrend. This uptrend isn't going to end anytime soon.Overall, PayPal's numbers underscored the obvious. The digital payments shift is alive and well, and PayPal remains king in that market. So long as those things remain true - and the valuation remains reasonable - PayPal stock will trend higher. Fundamentals Support Upside to $125Zooming out to the big picture, long term growth fundamentals create a visible pathway for PYPL stock to $125 in 2019. The key to the upside? Robust e-commerce growth, and PayPal maintaining its position as a digital payments leader.In 2016, ecommerce accounted for less than 9% of global retail sales. Last year, the ecommerce penetration level reached nearly 12%. By 2021, eMarketer projects it will run towards 18%. And, assuming current secular trends persist, ecommerce will likely run towards 25% of total retail sales by 2025. Meanwhile, global retail sales are moving higher by a few percentage points every year given population growth, increased urbanization, and inflation.Thus, the ecommerce market is one defined by rapidly rising share in a stable growth retail sales market. Ultimately, that combination positions ecommerce retail sales to grow at a healthy 15%-plus clip for the foreseeable future.PayPal is at the center of that 15%-plus growth market. The more sales move to the digital channel, the more consumers will adopt digital payment methods. Of those digital payment methods, PayPal is among the most popular, and has maintained that title despite rising competition.Consequently, as the commerce market grows at 15%-plus rate over the next several years, PayPal's payment volume and revenues should rise at a similar 15%-plus pace.A 15%-plus revenue growth rate, on top of gradual margin expansion, should reasonably drive PayPal's EPS towards $8 by fiscal 2025. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings. Based on that payment processor average 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2024 price target for PYPL stock is $200. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $125. Bottom Line on PayPal StockPayPal's first quarter earnings report was mixed in terms of beating/missing Street expectations, but that's largely irrelevant. What's important is that through continued robust revenue growth and margin expansion the numbers underscore that the long term growth narrative supporting PYPL stock remains as healthy as ever.So long as that remains true, PayPalstock will remain on a winning trajectory towards $125 in 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PYPL.

The metrics are just as positive for Square stock competitors, too.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)But, SQ reported earnings last night and got slammed down 5% on the headline. The dive continued this morning, with Square stock falling another 5% from the open.SQ beat both the top and bottom lines, but second-quarter guidance was lower than analyst forecasts. This is an unforgivable sin on Wall Street these days, and investors are punishing Square stock &quot;appropriately.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong other points of contention, SQ management reported a lower gross payment volume than expected. The bears really sunk their teeth into this highlight.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away Meanwhile, CEO Jack Dorsey's message was that the company is still on target to grow its ecosystem. This is a term that works for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) so perhaps it will for SQ eventually, but it hasn't yet.In reality, after the success of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) earnings, investors expect the same from Square. So this exaggerates the disappointment when the results are not ideal. This is the opposite of what happened with AAPL's earnings situation. Wednesday's rip was perhaps bigger as investors sigh of relief that AAPL earnings were not as bad as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).What didn't help matters for SQ? CFO Amrita Ahuja noted that they will reinvest back into the business. This is code for they will spend a lot of money in order to keep up. Square does face formidable competition from PYPL, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), so they have to spend to compete.The exciting part about SQ is that it's the new kid on the block. But as it grows it will come into face to face competitive situation with these behemoths. So this is merely an adjustment period and should not change the overall bullish thesis. Management has been executing on plans well to earn our trust and nothing in this report tells us otherwise yet. Trading Square StockSo is this the right time to catch the falling knife? No, but it depends on the time frames of individual investors.So if I am long the stock I don't panic out of it. There is support relief below these levels even after the dip. The zone around $65 per share has been pivotal for almost a year. This should act as support on the way down.Areas of contentions like this are where both bulls and bears agree on value so they fight it out hard. This creates a stall which, in this case, would be support. This is not a hard line in the sand but rather a zone. So even though a big dip of this size usually is not a one-day event, the selling will abate the deeper SQ goes into the pivotal zone. Even if it fails, there is another one just $5 below it.Furthermore, there still is a bullish pattern in play that suggests that SQ stock is targeting $92 per share and this dip doesn't yet kill it. As long as the dip doesn't accelerate the upside scenario is still viable. I do have to admit that this dip severely reduces the odds of it working out this coming quarter.Square stock is not cheap as it sells at nine times sales. But this is not absolutely nuts as it is in line with say Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Visa and MasterCard actually trade at 16 times sales but they have the benefit of running a huge profit. SQ still is not profitable.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May In the long term, Square is likely to get its act together. They operate in a booming area of electronic payments. The whole world is in the middle of a revolution that is determined to migrate all transaction to electronic format. So as long as management stays on task any serious dip is a buying opportunity of Square stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-03,"One of the greatest obstacles to share price appreciation is mediocre management, supported by a complacent board. But activist investors offer a solution, targeting poorly managed companies and lobbying them for changes they think will sweeten the share price.Activist investors look for issues such as weak corporate governance or executive compensation schemes when hunting new stocks to buy. They often then take a significant stake in the company and push for things such as asset sales or the return of excess cash to shareholders. Companies slow to implement change may be threatened with &quot;proxy fights&quot; that result in corporate officers and directors being forced from their seats.These activist investors sometimes create big windfalls for shareholders. For instance, Carl Icahn pushed eBay (EBAY) to spin off its PayPal (PYPL) business in 2015; since then, PayPal has tripled in value. Activist David Einhorn pressured Apple (AAPL) in 2013, urging the iPhone maker to return excess cash to shareholders. Since fiscal 2012, Apple has returned more than $350 billion in the form of buybacks and dividends, with the vast majority of that coming since 2013.Here are 17 stocks to buy if you believe in the ideas of their activist investors. Some have just recently come under siege, others are in the middle of proxy fights, and still others have already made truces and have implemented changes to unlock value. But all of these stocks carry significant risk - after all, activist investors typically target struggling companies, and no turnaround is a slam dunk. So invest in small amounts, with funds from the portion of your portfolio dedicated to aggressive holdings.

2019-05-06,"It has been ages since bulls had to deal with any nasty plot twists. But one finally arrived over the weekend in the form of a tweet by President Trump threatening to increase tariffs on imported goods from China. The subsequent market turmoil has bears on a rampage, but there are still good stocks to buy.Today we'll look at three of the best.It may seem counterintuitive to shop for buys when the sky is falling, but are we not taught that profits flow from buying low? Well, prices for many stocks are a few percent lower than Friday. But you don't have to attempt a daring knife catch. Days like today reveal which stocks are really in demand. Some companies were aggressively sold at today's down open, but others were quickly bought.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality It's this latter group that interests us the most. Let's take a closer look at three stocks to buy despite the turmoil. Apple (AAPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Even after a quarter where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rallied some 21%, it was still able to gap higher to a fresh seven-month high on earnings last week. The recent strength made this morning's down open a critical test of whether the bid beneath the surface was still alive and well.As I write this, 90 minutes into the trading session, AAPL stock has rallied 2% off the lows to cut its day's losses in half. That kind of snapback is exactly what shareholders want to see as confirmation of relative strength.While we may need some backing and filling before the selling pressure ends, this dip should ultimately prove a buying opportunity. Mark today's high ($208.71). If we take it out over the coming days (or later today), then bull trades are worth a shot. Paypal (PYPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The trend in Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) this year has been one for the textbooks. Just look at how it has been respecting the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Both have provided support on the way up. PYPL could be the poster child for a trend in motion remaining in motion.Last week's launch to a new record high reaffirmed buyers' dominance and reminded spectators that it's a stock worth buying into weakness.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio Well, weakness has arrived and this morning buyers are on the move. I suggest you join them. Because implied volatility is low, bull call spreads are worth a shot. Buy the June $110/$115 bull call spread for $2.26. Workday (WDAY)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Software stocks are flexing some serious muscle this morning. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is sporting a robust bullish candle, notching new intraday highs as I type. The overall trend for WDAY stock is bullish with its price rising atop ascending 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.This morning's down-gap was aggressively bought at the rising 20-day as well as an old resistance zone, which has now become new support. As long as WDAY remains above $195, the path of least resistance is higher; $220 is the next upside target.Buy the June $210/$220 bull call spread for $3.40.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-06,"BTIG analyst Mark Palmer increased his price target on shares of PayPal Holdings Inc.  to $130 from $114 on Monday, citing opportunities related to the company&apos;s continued monetization of Venmo and its ability to grow the PayPal user base at a fast clip. &quot;PayPal&apos;s progress toward monetization of Venmo has accelerated: The app had 40 million users at the end of 1Q19 and at that point had an annual revenue run-rate of more than $300 million, a sizeable jump from the annual revenue run-rate for the app of more than $200 million that management had announced in January,&quot; Palmer wrote. He argued that Venmo is putting pressure on PayPal&apos;s take rate, or cut of each transaction that the company retains. He expects a &quot;substantial&quot; impact on PayPal&apos;s financials once Venmo approaches profitability, which the company has said won&apos;t occur in the new couple of quarters. Palmer is also upbeat about the company&apos;s ability to keep growing engagement, in terms of the number of transactions users complete every year, and attract new users to the PayPal ecosystem.

2019-05-06,"Square (NYSE:SQ) stock tanked in early May after the payments processor's first-quarter results beat analysts' expectations, but it delivered downbeat Q2 guidance. In the wake of the lackluster guidance, the Street's  growth and competition concerns about SQ were reinvigorated. As a result, SQ stock dropped nearly 10%, falling to its lowest levels since January 2019.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)This selloff of SQ stock is overdone. Square is at the epicenter of a non-cyclical shift in the global economy from cash to cash-less payments. Within that shift, Square's presence and share are growing  across multiple channels, including both the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce fronts. After comparing the company's current market share to its long term total available market, I think SQ has tremendous growth potential over the next several years.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Plus, the company has a created a suite of subscription and service businesses which should provide  healthy growth catalysts over the next several years. Square is also digging into banking, a potential new growth market which could eventually be quite lucrative. On top of all that, SQ's profit margins are steadily rising.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, Square still is and will continue to grow rapidly, while SQ  has tremendous long term potential.With SQ stock sitting below $70, that potential is being undervalued . As a result, the recent selloff of Square stock appears to provide investors with a chance to buy the shares of a winning company on weakness. The Bears on Square Stock Underestimate SQ's OpportunityAccording to those who are bearish on SQ stock, SQ has built a payments processing empire in the micro-merchant world. But that world is becoming saturated, and in order to continue to generate rapid growth, SQ is expanding by creating solutions for larger sellers. According to the bears, the problem is that these bigger sellers already have a suite of payment processing solutions, ranging from First Data (NYSE:FDC) to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to big banks.Thus, as SQ gets bigger, it's starting to rub elbows more frequently with the competition, and Square is having trouble with all this competition., the detractors of SQ stock say. That's why the company's growth is slowing and this slowdown will persist, causing the richly valued SQ stock to drop, they conclude.That thesis sounds pretty valid. When the company behind a hyper-growth, richly valued growth stock slows down, its shares usually fall. But the bears underestimate  just how big the company's  opportunity is, and how much room Square has to grow, despite its big competitors. SQ Stock Will Win Over the Long-TermThe value of global retail sales was about $24 trillion last year. Square's gross payment volume in 2018 was about $85 billion. Thus, SQ processed just 0.35% of all global retail sales last year.But that's up from 0.23% in 2016, and 0.29% in 2017. Thus, SQ is a small company whose share of the global retail market is rapidly increasing.That trend should persist. Square's non-cyclical tailwinds remain healthy, and consumers continue to use cash-less payments more frequently. Moreover, Square is finally making a big push into e-commerce with its Square Online Store. The company is also rapidly gaining share among large retailers. Further, the company has not yet tried  very hard to penetrate the overseas and banking markets.Square's potent strategies should enable its market share to continue to grow, causing its revenue to rise quickly. Meanwhile,  its margins are consistently trending higher, so its profit growth is and should remain robust.Given all of Square's positive catalysts,  SQ stock should be bought on all major dips, as long as its valuation isn't excessive. The Valuation of SQ Stock Is AttractiveAt its current levels, the valuation of SQ stock is highly attractive for long-term investors.On a trailing price-sales basis, SQ stock is as cheap as it gets in the payments processing world. SQ's trailing sales multiple stands at eight, versus an 8.3 sales multiple for PayPal, and mid-teens sales multiples for Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Also, the valuation of SQ stock bottomed at roughly eight times sales in late 2018, so Square stock is trading just above a meaningful resistance level.Over the long-term, Square's annualized revenue growth should stay at roughly 25% over the next several years, assuming the company continues to gradually grow its share of the global retail marketplace. Adjusted EBITDA margins should ramp from the 18% expected this year towards an eventual peak of 30%.By 2025, I think Square's earnings per share can reach $4.50. All the other payment stocks trade at 30-plus forward price-earnings multiples. Based on a 30 forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for Square stock is $135. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of over $80. The Bottom Line on SQ StockSQ stock has declined tremendously because of fears that its growth is slowing. But such fears are short-sighted, since its growth is only slowing gradually, and it still has enough long-term potential  to support strong growth for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, investors seem to be ignoring the fact that SQ's margins have been consistently trending upward.Ultimately, this combination of persistently high revenue growth and margin expansion will power SQ stock significantly higher from today's depressed levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ, PYPL, and SHOP.

2019-05-10,"When it comes to investing in the banks of the future, it only makes sense to also keep your eye on tech stocks.Source: Shutterstock Banks have been making a big push into digital payments, and the results have been promising. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) leads the banks with 51 million total active accounts.However, that lead seems rather tenuous after Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its first quarter earnings, divulging that its Venmo active accounts exceeded 40 million at the end of the quarter. This puts PYPL in the same league as the  banks and among the most frequently used financial apps domestically.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From That should have big banks feeling uneasy. Given their substantial investments in technology, it's unlikely they realized just how tenuous their footing is. Their app usage especially in the longer term is not guaranteed. The fact is that switching costs between payment apps are negligible. Banking Tech Stocks Look to the FutureWhat's more disconcerting for the banks is the total payments volume growth that Venmo alone showed; 73 percent growth for the quarter, bringing the total payments volume to $21 billion. These are big growth numbers. Not only are millions of users being added each quarter, the total volume is materially increasing. Volume is a main determinant of how much intermediaries make, so this is important.Since Venmo already has a debit card--Venmo card--that can be used anywhere that accepts Mastercard, it's looking ahead at opportunities to further enhance profitability.  The logical next step is its own credit card.Branded credit cards are a popular strategy to drive customer engagement, brand awareness, and of course, profits. Retailers may be the first industry to come to mind that has leveraged this, typically with points or cash back enticements. Clearly, though, many banking tech stocks are not far behind.So far, Venmo is primarily digital and having presence in credit cards will help Venmo contribute even more to Paypal's top line. Even though the trend is toward all things digital, there are still many offline retailers, and a credit card would allow Paypal to tap that market. SQ Stock Rises as Cash App StrengthensAnd its not just tech stocks like PYPL nipping on their heels. Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based tech startup founded by Jack Dorsey, has reflected its success in attracting payment volume and growing its capital lending business. The stock is up 34 percent to date.With their Cash App, SQ has built a slew of financial tools for users to send, spend, and store money. They also have a Cash Card that allows customers to make purchases with a prepaid Visa card that is linked to the balance stored in Cash App. It's also bitcoin compatible.Cash App volume grew nearly 2.5x year over year, reflecting the growing network effects and reach of the app. According to Nomura Instinet's data:&quot;Cash App monthly downloads remained elevated at [2 million] new downloads a month, up from an average of [1.9 million] in 2018.&quot; Overall, the Cash App has 45.3 million cumulative downloads, compared with 41.2 million for Venmo as of January--the all-time highest difference between the two.&quot;Overall, in the battle for the the digital wallet, SQ stock and PYPL stock look like buys here. Banks inherently aren't as nimble as tech companies. So tech stocks like SQ and PYPL have edge in designing user interfaces and smaller but more loyal customer bases. While the mere fact of startups encroaching on bank payments is not enough to warrant a sell on big bank stocks, it's not a favorable trend.

2019-05-13,"Less than a week after payments player Square (NYSE:SQ) served up a lackluster outlook for the quarter currently underway, the company added another item to its menu. Via its acquisition of Eloquent Labs, Square can now offer an artificial-intelligence powered chat solution to its payment customers.Source: Via SquareThe news didn't revive SQ stock, which was already weakening heading into last week's first-quarter report. Later, that bearishness accelerated despite shares topping Q1 estimates. Admittedly, the acquisition isn't apt to make a major, measurable impact on the top or bottom lines anytime soon.Adding an AI-chat platform to its mix, however, is no small matter when you view this in the proper context.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Elle at Your ServiceEloquent Labs is the developer of Elle, which can converse intelligently with a customer through a conventional online-chat platform without any human input from the service provider. While resolving complex customer-service needs remain currently out of reach, Elle can easily handle simpler-but-distracting tasks like returns and product-tracking.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites The deal bolsters what Square can do for its merchants, which analysts believe number well over two million. Invariably, it also boosts the investment profile of SQ stock.Although founded as a simple payment middleman, Square has evolved into a one-stop solution provider for small businesses that must accept credit-card payments. Its point-of-sale systems can also act as inventory-management systems as well as customer relationship management solutions. Square has even developed restaurant-specific tools and apps. This notably includes the integration of Caviar, which facilities online ordering and delivery of food.The aim, of course, is to add so much value that small vendors see little choice but to delegate the back-office work to Square. This allows proprietors to focus on their core businesses.Square has built such a potent product, however, that larger businesses are signing up as well.Square is generally elusive with details about its business, even with owners of SQ stock. But CFO Sarah Friar was willing to at least concede some information last year. &quot;We have merchants that do $100 million-plus on Square today,&quot; Friar stated, adding that the company &quot;doesn't see a cap anymore&quot; in terms of merchant size.The advent of Elle jibes with that philosophy. Square's corporate blog post explains that &quot;Eloquent's conversational AI services are exactly the kind of technology that can level the playing field for businesses of all sizes by providing sellers efficient ways to interact with their customers.&quot; Strong but Competitive Market for Square StockAlthough they've been around for years, AI-powered &quot;chatbots&quot; haven't become reliable business tools until recently.Pavel Dmitriev, VP of Data Science for Outreach, explained late-last year:Most chatbots today are rigid rule-based systems forcing users to interact with them in an unnaturally structured way, which often ends up being a frustrating experience. While I do not expect all the problems to be solved in 2019, I believe significant progress will be made…As a proven platform, business owners are more comfortable utilizing this tech. They also take confidence in that the chatbots are increasingly becoming more human. Dmitriev believes better gathering of a buyer context and more specialization can make the technology as effective as they need to be for a particular merchant.To that end, some observers estimate that the global conversational AI market will be worth nearly $16 billion by 2024.Competitors aren't readily yielding to Square on this front, however. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced earlier this month it would open its conversational-AI engine up to developers in the finance world.Square rival Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has long used such a platform to serve its own customers. But Paypal can deploy this AI solution to its merchant users if they want to stand up to SQ.Square stock has something of an edge on would-be competitors, however, in that the underlying firm already has deep relationships with so many small and mid-sized businesses that have largely been overlooked by tech providers. Looking Ahead for SQ StockInterest in Elle may be moderate at first.Undoubtedly some of Square's merchants see the need and would be willing to utilize the option if made available. However, these merchants are typically very small and localized businesses. With their customers just as likely to make a phone call or visit in person as they are to initiate a typed or voice chat, Elle is overkill. SQ stock isn't a buy solely on the advent of an AI-chat platform, which will likely see modest initial uptake.As Square takes aim at larger merchants though, being able to also offer Elle in addition to other existing features gives the company some added firepower on the client-gathering front.It's certainly nothing that can hurt SQ stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-14,"After nearly reaching $75 per share, Square, (NYSE: SQ) stock is changing hands for around $65 per share. Markets became less bullish on SQ stock after SQ provided weak Q2 guidance.Source: Via SquareEven though its Q1 results beat analysts' consensus outlook, the payment processing firm needs to demonstrate that its initiatives such as its latest partnership with Postmates will be fruitful. With a market capitalization of $28 billion and a forward price-earnings ratio of almost 60, SQ stock is more suitable for growth investors. So how significant is its latest partnership announcement?  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk  Deal with PostmatesPostmates is a network of couriers who deliver food, groceries, and alcohol locally. Following the deal with Postmates, Square customers can use Postmates' couriers to get goods to customers who place orders with SQ.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare is no stranger to the delivery business. It owns food delivery services firm Caviar, a company it bought in 2014. Yet Postmates will catapult Square's addressable market size because Postmates has a presence in  more than 1,000 cities.After  raising $100 million in January, Postmates is valued at $1.85 billion. Second-Quarter GuidanceSquare needs to grow its addressable market because it lowered its Q2 outlook. It forecast earnings of $0.14 - $0.16 per share of SQ, below the consensus forecast of 18 cents per share of SQ stock . But the top end of the company's full-year revenue guidance range was raised to $2.28 billion from $2.25 billion previously.Many investors clearly sold SQ stock following the guidance because they felt uncertain about SQ's near-term outlook. Yet the company's full-year EPS guidance of $0.74- $0.78 per share was unchanged, indicating that SQ lowered its Q2 EPS guidance because it expects to delay recognizing some of its revenue by a quarter or two. Strong Momentum in Q1Despite the deceleration of Square's business in Q2, the company's  growth in Q1 still justifies the valuation of SQ stock. Specifically, its seller and cash app ecosystem drove total year-over-year revenue growth of 43%. The Valuation of SQ StockThe 22 analysts covering SQ stock are very bullish on it and have an average price target that is about 20% above the stock's recent $66 share price (per Tipranks). If investors think that the company's revenue will grow between 25% and 45% annually for the next five years, a 5-year DCR Revenue Exit model suggests SQ stock could have a fair value that is about 30% above its current price. The Bottom Line on SQThe  downtrend of Square stock  is puzzling because its peers, namely PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V), and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have all traded higher recently. But the company's near-term slowdown is scaring buyers away and creating selling pressure on SQ stock.Investors who missed the rally that took Square stock to $100 in October 2018 have another chance to pick up SQ at a decent level. Consider initially buying a small number of shares of SQ. And from there, average down or up over the next few months.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But even with the stock market in rally mode for much of 2019, Square stock has been absent.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)What's going on?Shares have been rolling over as it appears there's been a bit of a &quot;buyer's strike&quot; regarding Square. While Square stock had a violent rally off its December lows, shares are actually flat since Jan. 15. Compare that to its peers and Square stock investors may be getting frustrated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is up 22.5% in the same timeframe, while the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up 13%. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are up 18% and 28%, respectively. The year-to-date numbers are even worse.Stock YTD Return SQ 17% QQQ 19.3% V 24% MA 33.6% PYPL 33.8% I know it's hard to complain about a 17% gain for the year, but considering the fourth quarter that we endured, a snap-back rally like that is to be expected. The fact that it's lagging the QQQs and has generated just 50% of the return from its most compared to competitor (PYPL), and SQ stock is frustrating.Will that underperformance continue? Trading SQ Stock  Click to EnlargeAbove is the weekly chart for Square stock. You can clearly see that Square was enjoying a nice, solid uptrend (blue line) for the better part of a year. However, that uptrend came to an end in Q4 2018, when the markets took a painful fall. Square, which was already elevated from its uptrend by quite a bit, was no exception to this selloff.In October, SQ stock hit a 52-week high of $101.15. By mid-December, shares had fallen more than 50% at its lows when it hit $49.82.On the bounce, shares ran to that $77.50 to $80 area, which effectively capped SQ stock from January through April. At $81.56 is the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range, which more or less acted as resistance. Unfortunately, the 38.2% retracement at $69.43 did not support SQ stock on the downside, nor did the 50-week moving average.I worry about Square in the short- to intermediate term if it can't get over some of these technical levels. Specifically, I want to see Square over the 10-week moving average and above the 38.2% retracement. Over downtrend resistance (purple line) would eventually be nice too.If it can't do that though, it's prone to more declines. Those declines are exacerbated in the event that U.S. stocks take a bigger hit. I have my sights on three potential downside levels: $60 is a notable level of both resistance and support and only gave way amid a flood of selling in December. At $55 is the 100-week moving average, which should provide a bounce should SQ stock test it.Finally, a retest of the lows near $50 should attract buyers. I don't expect this level without a larger flush in the broader market. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare has been a multi-year stud, but that action has not translated to 2019. The company still has a terrific growth profile, with analysts modeling revenue and earnings to grow 43.5% and 60% this year, respectively; 2020's forecast is solid too, at 35% and 49% growth, respectively.While management provided a solid full-year outlook on May 1, second-quarter guidance came up a bit short. At 88 times this year's earnings (after the earnings pullback), SQ stock doesn't have much room for error. Disappointing on guidance, however marginal, can sap momentum in a hurry.Let's see where Square stock can firm up and whether it can regain momentum. Over the 10-week will be the first sign of turning it around.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long V.

In Friday's trading, it certainly had Wall Street's attention.The S&P 500 fell by roughly 0.50%, while PayPal stock found itself under even more duress -- shedding about 1%. Peer-mobile payments play Square (NYSE:SQ) is off 1.25%.

PayPal Stock Weekly Price Chart  Click to EnlargeIt's been a good year for PayPal stock. Shares are up 32% for 2019 and have captured 20% since breaking out of PYPL stock's year-long, base-on-base pattern in late January. So, what next? I see more upside potential.I believe technically shares can match the gains of the prior bullish leg from April 2017's breakout near $45 to the high of 2018's year-long congestive base. Some investors refer to this type of continuation action as a mirror move or two-step pattern. And in this instance, should it play out that way, PayPal stock should rally towards $140-$150.There's no guarantees of course. And PYPL stock's weekly stochastics are currently overbought. Still, if price and volume matter most, Thursday's relative strength breakout on increased volume to fresh highs from a short two plus week flat base does look compelling.For like-minded investors I'd recommend buying PayPal stock above $115.39. This entry is 1.5% through the pattern high and about .5% north of Thursday's high of $114.66.The purchase obviously sacrifices a tiny bit of upside. But if we're correct about the PYPL's trajectory, it's well worth the cost as this strategy looks to avoid buying a false breakout after the broader market's quick snap back from its trade war panic.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-21,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) may have established the digital-payments industry, but there's no denying that its rival, Square (NYSE:SQ) has won the war of publicity since the start of 2018.There's a secret that only owners of PayPal stock know, however, or at least realize. That is, after crushing it in 2017 and holding its ground in 2018, PayPal stock price is crushing it again this year.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential This may not be the absolute most opportune time to buy PayPal stock if you haven't done so yet; given the frothiness of PayPal stock price, PYPL stock is ripe for some profit-taking. But, there's a reason PayPal stock price is still climbing as if PYPL was a new, high-growth company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Still Chugging AlongIf you want a number, it's 35%. That's how much PayPal stock price is up since the end of 2018, versus the S&P 500's 15% advance.Even more remarkable is that the big gain took shape at a time when few thought it would, or even could. Early last year eBay revealed it would begin featuring PaPal's Dutch rival, Adyen. In the meantime, Square found a way to facilitate peer-to-peer payments every way except the primary way that PayPal serves consumers and small businesses. PYPL wasn't (and still isn't) interested in handling cryptocurrencies at a time when cryptocurrencies were all the rage. As of late-December, the consensus price  target on PayPal stock was just under $100 per share.None of it really mattered, though. As it turns out, PayPal is even better when it's left alone and allowed to do its own thing without anyone standing over its shoulder.The numbers tell the tale. PayPal's revenue surged 13% last year,. and its non-GAAP earnings per share jumped 26%.After, blasting past the consensus price target in April, PayPal stock closed yesterday at $112.15. The Outlook of PayPal StockThis year is expected to be even better for PayPal. Analysts are calling for more than 16% revenue growth in 2019, followed by more than 17% growth next year. Its EPS is expected to reach $2.98 this year and hit $3.51 in 2020.That leaves little to complain about. The acquisition of Venmo and better cultivation of its Merchant Services arm -- which is a stab right at Square -- have been worth the expense and effort. In Q4, Merchant Services' revenue jumped 29% year-over-year. After PayPal works to improve the integration of iZettle, which it acquired last year, the subsidiary should continue to grow by double-digit percentage levels.The key for PayPal stock has been, according to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, size that others like Square can't match.Palmer also notes that Venmo is nearing profitability, which could prove to be a major catalyst for PayPal stock. &quot;&quot;PayPal's progress toward monetization of Venmo has accelerated,&quot; noted the analyst earlier this month. He adds, &quot;The app had 40 million users at the end of 1Q19 and at that point had an annual revenue run-rate of more than $300 million, a sizeable jump from the annual revenue run-rate for the app of more than $200 million that management had announced in January.&quot;All told, Palmer now thinks PayPal stock is worth $130 per share. Not YetWhile the rest of the analyst community isn't quite as enthused, given the consensus price target of $116, their unwillingness to raise their targets may have more to do with this year's bullish surge and less to do with a lack of value.That crowd still has a point. The steep rally, while not unlike 2017's big move, has pushed PYPL stock to prices that will be difficult to hold onto. This week's snapback rally into new-record territory is exciting, but also uncomfortably hot.Where any pullback may finally stop and reverse is difficult to say. There's a major support level near $80. A selloff of that scope seems unlikely given the company's outlook, however. More plausibly, a retreat to one of the moving average lines around $100 or $93 will stop any bleeding of PayPal stock.The toughest part of trading is being patient when waiting to buy stocks, and mustering the willingness to pull that trigger in the midst of a pullback. Don't shoot for perfect timing, and don't sweat it if you wade in too early. PYPL is a long-term trade driven by fundamentals that have remained surprisingly solid.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-21,"Square (NYSE:SQ) continues its slide. The San Francisco-based payment services company has moved lower even as its peers continue to see their stocks go higher. Despite a steady decline, analysts have mostly held to their price targets on Square stock. Although SQ may remain range-bound for some time to come, investors now have an opportunity to make a trade.  Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Given Square's recent trading activity, where it goes from here remains in question. The stock has fallen steadily since its 2019 peak of $82.78 per share in late February. The company provided weak guidance in its quarterly report on May 1. Hence, earnings and revenue beats for the most recent quarter failed to stem the tide. As a result, SQ trades near the $65 per share level.What makes this more confusing is that our increasingly cashless society will require Square's services. This trend has benefitted peers such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) over the last year. Consequently, PayPal and peers such as Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) have exhibited remarkably similar trading patterns over the last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Not Square.I had taken a bearish position on Square stock in recent months. Even with an improving outlook, I thought SQ would face short-term pain back in March. However, with a further 15%, I have recently begun to hold a more bullish outlook. Square Stock Should Clear TargetsAnalysts appear to agree. The average price target on SQ currently stands at $83.50 per share, very close to the stock's 2019 high. On the low end, one analyst set a $30 per share price target. I could see such a price in a recession. However, with a growing economy and a predicted earnings growth rate of 59.6% this year, I do not think such an outcome will occur.The highest current price target comes in at $101 per share, near the level of its 52-week high. Hence, barring a recession, SQ stock should remain in its range for now.The good news for SQ bulls is that the stock price can rise even if Square remains range-bound. Although profit growth will fall modestly, Wall Street predicts that earnings will still grow at an average rate of 45.47% per year over the next five years. Currently, SQ also supports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of about 57. With its current level of profit growth, I do not see the PE ratio falling significantly in the near term. Square Stock and ExpansionFor investors who want to look beyond the short term, Square also continues to bolster its ecosystem with new products and initiatives. One example involves its Square Online store.After acquiring Weebly, it was able to offer clients a more comprehensive online store. This now makes Square a competitor of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and expands its reach in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Now, with its recent alliance with Postmates, the reach of its ecosystem expands further.Financial services has also become a focus. Square already makes business loans. In recent months, it has also attempted to expand on its Cash App and break into banking itself. However, this move to gain FDIC approval and become an industrial loan company still needs to pass regulatory hurdles.Moreover, Square has only scratched the surface of its potential reach. Currently, the company only operates in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, and the U.K. Though it has not announced plans to move into other countries, it holds tremendous potential offshore.All of these factors should eventually translate into growth for SQ stock, even if the equity remains range-bound for some time to come. The Bottom Line on Square StockThanks to the falling price, traders have an improved opportunity for short-term gain as the long-term outlook improves for investors. A falling stock price continues to take SQ toward the lower end of its current range.Analysts have held to their $83.50 per share price target. Further, Square continues to expand its ecosystem as they add e-commerce storefronts, small business loans, and delivery. The company also offers a bright future to investors with likely moves into banking and other foreign markets.Whether one wants to make a short-term trade or build a long-term investment, SQ stock has fallen to a level where both types of investors can likely swipe in profits.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-22,"Another jittery week seems to be upon the markets as news headlines highlight that the U.S.-China trade negotiations may be at an impasse. Trade is not a zero-sum game and tariff tiffs will likely affect many companies, countries, and consumers at different levels. Understandably many investors are beginning to get nervous as to where stocks in their portfolios may be headed next. Therefore, today I'd like to discuss the short and long-term outlook for Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile-payments company.Source: Via SquareFintech is an evolving and growing industry. And the global economy is gradually shifting from cash to cash-less payments. With its strong small business focus and proactive management, Square stock is likely to weather the long-term ebbs and flows of the industry. However, there might be further weakness in the SQ stock price -- after losing 9.2% in the past month -- in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate. Square's Growing EcosystemAlthough it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses, individual clients and act more like a traditional bank. Its most recent earnings report released on May 1 and accompanying shareholder letter provide a good overview of the growth in service offerings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare's ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech apps sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.For example, SQ's peer-to-peer mobile payments Cash App has more than 15 million monthly active customers. Square charges 2.75% per transaction to businesses that accept Cash App payments. It also makes money through individuals using the app.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal Management would like to see the Cash App become more like a traditional bank whose core customers are small businesses as well as individuals. As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to capture that growth.In October 2018, the group announced Square Installments, which lets customers pay in monthly installments. Previously, Square had also launched Square Capital, which provides short-term loans to small businesses that use its service to process credit card payments.Clearly, Square is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels and many growth investors are bullish long term on Square stock. However, they would need to pay special attention to how each business that Square is now chasing contributes to the bottom line.While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has some questions as to whether the group can maintain a sustained growth quarter after quarter. What Could Derail Square Stock Fundamentally?The global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the fintech apps revolution is fast changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers.Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. Square faces competition from many well-capitalized companies, including the global online payments group PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant.To be sure, not every area Square expands into will necessarily translate into easy money. Unless Square increases its revenue base, Wall Street may not be too forgiving about the SQ stock price. Therefore, from a valuation point of view, I'd urge long-term investors to exercise caution with the current price levels.For example, many analysts are expressing doubts over Square's expansion into the loan business and questioning whether the company is taking on too much risk.Another are of potential concern would be declining growth in transaction fees, which still provide the majority of revenues. Square's shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not be enough to make up for the decline in transaction fees.The May 1 earnings report showed that the group's gross payment volume (GPV) grew to $22.6 billion, at a relatively modest rate 27%. Yet Wall Street was concerned about this growth rate.In other words, shareholders would need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much and away from its core business of payment processing. Therefore, they'd need to regularly re-assess their views based on company and sector developments as well as earnings statements. Where is Square Stock Price Now?Let us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018 as the company became a darling among long-term investors.With such high return on initial investments, many investors look at the future through rose-colored glasses as they tend to assume growth rates will accelerate for many years. That's how recent IPOs usually become momentum stocks. However, if growth decelerates, then the stock price usually suffers. In other words, a momentum stock like Square trades in line with revenue growth trends and expectations.Despite the euphoria in the first three years, SQ stock price has been exhibiting price weakness since all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. This year, although the stock is so far up 16%, April and May have not been good months for shareholders. The weak Q2 guidance issued during the Q1 conference call triggered the recent downtrend.If you are looking for an entry signal to buy SQ shares, from a technical chart perspective, I am not expecting the stock to make a significant leg up any time soon. Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur.And, I do not expect the SQ stock price to reach the $100 level any time soon; the market may be starting to price the stock with a more realistic and fair view.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect nearer-term trading in SQ to be choppy at best. So Should You Buy SQ Stock in May?I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in May as well as in June. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Depending on news headlines, Square stock may trade sideways for several days, only to continue to pullback toward the low-$60's level, where it is likely to find initial support.If the support around $60 level does not hold, then it may fall further to $50 level, where I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in late July.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I'd not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50. I'd also consider buying covered calls in conjunction with going long on SQ shares.If you already own the shares, you might want to stay the course and hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date. Bottom Line on Square StockStocks suffer during times of uncertainty and the current political and economic fundamentals offer plenty of questions. Therefore, I'd encourage potential new investors to wait for a few weeks until the smoke clears from the markets and until buyers are definitively back in control in Square shares.Until that time, Square is likely to be a one-step forward, two-steps back kind of stock until it reaches low $50's level. On a final note, if the SQ stock price declines further amid a subdued earnings season, the company could very well become a takeover target.As of this writing, the Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-23,"In a market that's near its all-time highs, there are a number of stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). There's little doubt that Adobe has an attractive business with excellent growth prospects. The argument comes down to what ADBE stock price should be.Source: Shutterstock ADBE stock isn't cheap. The company's  guidance, which it updated after its strong Q1 earnings report, indicates that the price-earnings ratio of Adobe stock, based on expected  fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share, is 35. Among 56 U.S.-listed stocks with a market cap over $125 billion, only three - PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) - have a forward P/E  ratio that's higher than ADBE's 28.4.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend But Adobe almost certainly belongs in that group. And in the context of its current growth and its opportunities, ADBE stock price actually doesn't seem excessive at this point. I've  been a fan of Adobe stock for a long time,  and ADBE stock has continued to rise for years. Right now, it doesn't look like that will change.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why ADBE Stock Price Is Cheap EnoughOne simple comparison highlights why Adobe stock is, at worst, cheap enough to consider. Again, ADBE trades at 35 times this year's expected EPS, and 28 times analysts' average 2020 EPS estimate. For a large-cap software play, that's simply not that expensive.Indeed, look at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), an Adobe cloud partner and a long-rumored potential buyer of the company. Microsoft - even excluding its almost $8 per share in net cash - trades at 26 times analysts' average fiscal 2019 EPS estimate and over 23 times  their FY20 consensus EPS estimate.Should Adobe stock be trading at a higher valuation than Microsoft stock? Absolutely. ADBE's growth going forward should be far more impressive. Adobe's adjusted earnings per share, according to analysts' average projections, should rise 23% next year, more than double Microsoft's anticipated increase. Both companies have benefited from the shift to cloud-based services, but Adobe has much lower exposure to flattish consumer PC revenue.This data doesn't mean ADBE stock price is cheap. Indeed, I was skeptical toward Microsoft stock for some time before turning bullish on it last year. The recent run of Microsoft stock to a near-trillion-dollar market cap makes MSFT once again somewhat dicey from a valuation standpoint.But the valuation gap between MSFT and ADBE stock is, at worst, reasonable. If Adobe 's EPS  continues to rise at a 20%+ annual rate, that gap will disappear in just a few years. Put another way, 35 times  this year's earnings for ADBE stock  might sound expensive. But Adobe's EPS looks poised to reach $12  by 2021. At current levels, ADBE stock is trading around 23 times $12. A multiple of 23 times for ADBE stock sounds close to cheap. Growth Drivers for Adobe StockThe ADBE stock price is, at worst, in a range that will enable Adobe to grow into its valuation and then rise further. ADBE is not quite priced for perfection, as some may believe.If ADBE's growth continues, Adobe stock should rise and outpace the market. And there are plenty of reasons to expect that ADBE's growth will continue. Creative Cloud demand is only going to grow as creative jobs multiply amid the growth of streaming media and small businesses, i.e the customers of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).ADBE's Experience Cloud - boosted by the acquisitions of Marketo and Magento last year - will continue to expand its addressable market and benefit from the increasing importance of data analytics and the increasing breadth of marketing channels, including digital marketing.Adobe should benefit from many of the trends that have driven tech stocks, in particular, to their current valuations. The shift to cloud? Check. Digital advertising growth? Check. Big data? Check . If an investor is going to pay up for exposure to those trends, ADBE stock is a logical choice for him or her. Watch the MarketThe biggest risk to ADBE, in fact, seems to be external. At some point, investors may bring stock valuations down across the board. (But I'd note that risk has been seemingly ever-present for the past decade,.) The ADBE stock price dropped by more than 25% in the market-wide swoon late last year, so it's not immune to broad market weakness.But any investor owning pretty much any tech stock at the moment is taking some sort of valuation risk. And there doesn't appear to be many tech stocks as appealing as ADBE. Adobe stock isn't cheap, but it shouldn't be, at least not yet. And if it keeps doing what it has been doing, $267 will seem cheap in retrospect.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Its digital wallet, Venmo, has risen to over 40 million accounts as of the first quarter. Venmo also registered a 73% increase on payments on its platform. This compares well to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 37 million digital accounts and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) who with 29.8 million digital users. PYPL lags only JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which claims 51 million active accounts. A Closer Look at PayPal StockGiven this increase, I see ample room for growth for all major players involved. The predicted profit increases in PayPal stock represents the growth well. Analysts expect earnings increases to come in at 23.1% this year and 17.8% next year.This has also brought somewhat higher price-to-earnings (PE) ratios across the industry. PayPal's forward PE now stands at 32.1. While not cheap, that appears inexpensive compared to SQ stock and its 59.3 forward PE ratio. Moreover, the multiples of Visa and Mastercard are somewhat lower, but not by much.But here's the thing.In this sector, multiples tend to rise with rates of profit growth. Square supports a significantly higher PE ratio. However, Wall Street believe SQ's profits will rise by 59.6% this year and 49.3% the next.In 2020, Square's profits will grow at about 2.5 times PayPal's earnings this year. Next year, Square will roughly triple PayPal's growth rate. Given this differential, I see a case for buying SQ when its forward multiple comes in a less than double PayPal's PE ratio.Conversely, investors can pay about 26.4 times forward earnings for Visa. Following what looks like an industry trend, that will buy investors lower but still impressive growth rates. Analysts expect Visa will see a 16.5% earnings increase this year and a 15.6% rate in 2020.Moreover, PYPL has risen more than 46% from its December low. This comes in substantially higher than the 33%-plus growth in SQ over the same period. Given this rapid rise, I cannot rule out a short-term correction. What should investors do?PayPal stock will remain a growth equity for years to come, but it may not outperform a key peer. PYPL trades near record highs. Its massive profit increase justifies its PE ratio in the low 30s. However, one cannot ignore Square stock, which offers almost triple the growth at less than double the valuation.Again, I do not think this negates the bull thesis in PayPal stock. I also believe payment stocks will generally continue to rise long-term. In my view, it comes down to risk tolerance. Investors more comfortable with lower multiples should consider PayPal or maybe Visa. However, for those who will willingly pay a higher PE for more elevated growth levels, Square stock might make a better choice.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-24,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has recently given back a lot of its gains from last year. After briefly topping $100 per square, SQ stock has sharply reversed. SQ stock now trades for just $65, and has failed to recover, even as the stock market has roared back from its December lows.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)It's not hard to see why SQ stock has underwhelmed so far  in 2019. The  valuation of Square stock reached outrageous levels when the shares hit $100. At that point, the market was pricing in both huge growth by SQ and a sharp upturn in its profitability. Unfortunately, Square's first-quarter results, unveiled on May 1, did little to support either tenet of the bulls' thesis.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer  Earnings Were Fine But Not EnoughSquare's Q1 results were a mixed bag. If expectations for the company had been lower, investors probably would have been fine with the results. But given the high price of SQ stock,  blowout results were needed to sustain its upward trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSQ reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 11 cents, which topped analysts' consensus outlook of 8 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company continues to lose money. On the revenue side, it topped consensus expectations, but not by much. Its $489 million top line  only modestly exceeded analysts' consensus outlook of  $480 million.Some bulls pointed to the company's escalating year=over-year revenue growth rate as a positive point. But, excluding the impact of Square's recent acquisitions, its growth rate has been declining in recent quarters. Furthermore, analysts expect SQ's growth to fall off sharply, from something in the high fifties now to closer to 40% next year. Obviously, 40% annual revenue growth is still great, but when the company is still only, at most, marginally profitable, the owners of Square stock will want its CEO, Jack Dorsey, to produce better results. SQ Stock Still Has a High ValuationEven after dropping 35% from its high of last year, SQ stock is really expensive compared with its peers. Square stock is trading around 7.5 times its 2018 sales and nearly 60 times analysts' average 2019  earnings estimate.Those numbers are much higher than the valuations of other payment tech companies. Maybe the current valuation of Square stock would make sense if SQ had recently carried out its IPO and was still early in its maturation process. But Square has been around long enough to start backing up its valuation. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is trading closer to six times its  sales and 30 times its  earnings.Both WorldPay (NYSE:WP) and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) look even cheaper than PayPal on the basis of these metrics, to say nothing of Square. The owners of Square stock have to ask themselves what makes SQ stand out from its competitors. Square dominates its niche of the smallest of businesses, but has struggled to gain traction with larger companies. As businesses'  volumes rise, Square's fees tend to become less competitive. Jack Dorsey has to find a way to change that situationBut SQ has some other irons in the fire. Its Cash App, for example, has had a strong run, though it appears that PayPal's Venmo is catching up. Some of Cash App's features, such as Bitcoin trading, could cause some users' interest in SQ to rise, but that probably won't be enough to drive SQ stock back to its old highs. Jack Dorsey  needs something bigger, which brings us to… Square's Quest for a Banking LicenseThe one thing that could really turn things around for SQ stock in a hurry would be a banking license. Square originally filed paperwork for a license in September 2017. It intended to become a Utah-based bank that would focus on small business.However, after regulators expressed concerns about its application, SQ withdrew it. However, SQ refiled its application late last year. Why is Square so intent on obtaining a banking license? In theory, an FDIC-insured Square Bank would give SQ a large amount of disruptive power. Right now, SQ has to operate using its customers' banks, which adds fees and friction. Square Bank would allow its small business customers to open their own accounts directly with Square, cutting out the middleman.Obtaining a banking license  would help Square make more loans to its small-business customers. SQ arguably has better data than traditional banks, as it can see a huge portion of its customers'  transaction data in real time. Additionally, SQ could obtain payments on its loans directly from the recipients' transactions, rather than waiting for the businesses to choose to make payments.In theory, SQ stock should surge after it receives a banking license. But the license may never be granted. For one, the FDIC tends to be fairly cautious about granting banking licenses to more aggressive firms. I've been skeptical about whether Square's small-business lending will earn high enough returns to offset the large credit risk of lending to tiny businesses. Its business model looks good during boom economic times but what happens during a recession? Perhaps regulators are wondering the same thing. Jack Dorsey will have to convince regulators that SQ's business model will remain sound during economic downturns. The Verdict on SQ StockIf Square gets its banking license soon, all bets are off. But for now, SQ stock is likely to continue to struggle compared with other tech stocks.Its last earnings report was underwhelming. With its valuation still far above that of industry rivals, Jack Dorsey needs to put up dazzling results to get its stock price moving again. Another earnings report that just barely tops expectations, let alone a miss, could send SQ stock lower in a hurry.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-29,"Last year the impression was that banks couldn't hold their rallies, so it was easy to short the financial centers. But that was not the case for the payment transactors like Square (NASDAQ:SQ). The perception is that these financial tech -FinTech -- companies are more tech than financials, so their stocks were soaring. But SQ stock has recently hit a snag and it lags the group.Source: Via SquareYear-to-date, SQ stock is still outperforming the S&P 500, up 16%, but that's about half as much Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and about eight percentage points worse than American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V).For the last three months it's even worse. SQ is down 21% when the rest are still up for the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, is this relative slack in Square stock's performance an opportunity to bet on the bounce? Or is it a leading indicator that the rest of the gang will revert lower? My bet is that the fintech sector is still a bullish bet and that any weakness in Square is an opportunity to buy. For the last two years, SQ stock is up 184% which is more than double its competition. SQ Stock and the MarketIt is important to note that the whole equity market is being held hostage by the crisis of sentiment that we are having due to the tariff war. Keep that in mind for all bullish write ups inside that context.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June First, let's examine the whole fintech sector and why it's a definite winner for the long term. The globe has committed to moving as many financial transactions as possible online, and companies like Square are already there. This is a trend that is not likely to reverse, so demand on their products and services is likely to stay strong for decades. There are smaller companies coming into the arena, but I bet the ones already there will have the advantage.Fundamentally, SQ stock is still relatively new, so it's the most expensive of the bunch. Wall Street gives it the higher valuation because in theory it delivers the most growth. So far, management has not faltered, so this credit should continue until they show that growth is abating.In their last earnings report, SQ beat the metrics but were cautious with their guidance. So the message is that they continue to successfully execute on plans. Don't panic because of the muted guidance -- this is management padding their expectations. Eventually this, too, shall pass and the stock should play catch-up with the rest.SQ stock sells at 8x sales. So although it loses money, it's twice as cheap as Visa and MA, both of which sell at over 16x price to sales. So after a big stock dip like this, I can consider it a value trade here. A lot of the froth has already fallen off.But the best argument for a Square rally scenario from here is technical.The weekly chart shows that SQ stock just bounced off an important support zone. The area around $60 per share has been pivotal for over a year. Bulls and bears are willing to fight over it, which in turn creates congestion. On the way down, this translates into support.Moreover, Square stock still maintains a higher low trend off the Christmas bounce. This is also bumping against the descending line of lower highs, so now it comes into a tight point. Usually, these explode in a big move, and after so much of the froth has already left the stock, I bet odds are it surges higher.If so, the immediate target would be the April and February fail points at $75.50 and $82 per share, respectively.Conversely, stocks are still hostage to geopolitical headline risk, so overall sentiment is sour. Square stock rallies would probably need the help of overall market action. So if the general malaise persists on Wall Street, then SQ is vulnerable.Below $61 per share, it could trigger a retest of the December lows near $51. I don't see this happening, but the technical bearish pattern looms and the neckline is close. So if this is a short-term trade then I have to set tight stop loss triggers. Else, I can hold Square stock for the long term as it will be a winner.In short, Square stock has solid fundamentals in a popular sector. And now also has favorable technical setups. This makes it an attractive bullish bet for the next few weeks.The experts on Wall Street are split on the rating between buy and hold, but they all agree that its stock should be higher. It's trading now well below their average price target near $83.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

In relative terms, the charge is almost a rounding error when compared to the $15 billion in quarterly profits.Losing user trust is Facebook's real risk and yet markets are too complacent over this settlement. Facebook violated COPPA, a rule governing how children see advertising online. This could increase the fine, especially with the FTC delayed due to a bipartisan split.Realistically, if Facebook's fine increases, the stock may fall but will eventually recover. The company's advertising revenue growth is so strong that it may absorb any one-time costs. User-Privacy a Low Concern for UsersUsers are mostly complacent with their privacy. If they had any concern at all, they would leave the site en masse. Instead, usage hardly changed. Plus, Facebook owns WhatsApp, and Instagram and usage are growing for both apps.In Q1/2019, Facebook said around 2.7 billion people used Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Stories on all three sites topped 500 million daily active users. And Facebook is learning from its experiences from the Cambridge Analytica privacy breach.WhatsApp will have more security and privacy than ever. This includes end-to-end encryption, with users getting more ways to interact on top of that. Facebook Stock and GrowthElectronic payments and commerce continue to offer revenue growth opportunities for Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is focused on adding such functions on Instagram and Facebook. Already, the sites have shopping and Marketplace. There, tens of millions of small businesses use these pages to share their inventory and help people discover goods and easily pay.The growth in online transactions and payment processing from Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) in the last few years validate Facebook's ambitions to develop a similar offering.Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have the highest potential for supporting private transactions. Users already have private messaging, so this is a natural space for supporting business interactions.Facebook will test Payments in India first and if successful, roll out the service country by country. For now, investors do not have a timeline on the launch. Profits from InstagramStrong impression growth from Instagram Stories and Feed will draw users but is still not drawing as much revenue growth compared to Facebook. Despite Stories as the biggest individual driver of impression growth in the last quarter, Instagram needs higher engagement.Until then, management does not expect limited advertising growth, which in turn limits the near-term profit potential. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockAnalysts are extremely bullish on Facebook stock, having an average price target of $220 for Facebook stock. Realistically, investors should not expect that 21% upside potential happening in the near-term.Chances are low that users will leave the site due to privacy concerns but it is still a small risk factor. The FTC fine may change and the government may impose harsher restrictions, which could limit Facebook's growth.These are all low risks that will slow the stock's ascent back to $200. In the longer-term, chances are good that the stock will trade well above the $200 level.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

All three are at the precipice of trade-worthy moves that just need the right nudge. PayPal (PYPL)PayPal has been on a tear this year. At its current price, even with Wednesday's sizeable stumble, PYPL stock is up an impressive 44% from its late-December low. It deserves a break.A deeper, more critical look suggests this chart may have to take a sizeable step back before it begins moving forward again though. In fact, a detailed look at matters suggests the bears have already put that pullback into motion. The trick is simply figuring out where it might stop.  Click to Enlarge  * The swings since late April are clues in and of themselves. Volatility after a prolonged straight-line move often indicates a change of heart. The purple 50-day line is the make-or-break level from here.  * To that end, a couple of the past four trading days have not only been bearish, but they've been bearish on above-average volume.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart puts things in perspective. The RSI indicator is now unwinding its overbought condition, but it's also clear in this timeframe that the divergence so far this year has been overdone.  * The gray 100-day moving average or the white 200-day moving average line are the most likely landing and turnaround levels for any selloff that takes shape from here. Iron Mountain (IRM)It's not a situation most real estate investment trusts find themselves in right now. Then again, Iron Mountain is unlike most REITs. The company is organized as a real estate investment trust, but provides physical and digital storage of documents companies are required to keep.Regardless of its distinguishing features, recent weakness has dragged IRM to the brink of a critical technical floor, and to within sight of another. And, the weaker it gets, the more sellers crawl out of the woodwork. One or two more rough days could break its fragile floor.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War   Click to Enlarge  * The line to watch from today on is $30.58, plotted in blue on the daily chart. That was not only Wednesday's but the key low from a couple of times earlier this year and late last year.  * It's not overwhelming, but the volume behind the recent &quot;down&quot; days has been above average, and continues to grow. There may be more sellers waiting in the wings.  * Backing out to the weekly chart we can see Iron Mountain shares have actually been fighting a losing battle for years. The rising support line that carries IRM higher from early 2009 has been broken and re-broken since the middle of last year, after failing to make higher highs since 2014. General Mills (GIS)With nothing more than a quick glance, General Mills looks like it's untouchable. The stock plunged more than 5% on Wednesday -- a big move for a food name -- and the volume was heavy. There were a bunch of sellers, and more downside could be in store.A closer look at the chart and the backdrop, however, hints that yesterday's big setback may actually be a buying opportunity. The bleeding stopped exactly where it was supposed to, and where one would normally expect to see a reversal effort.  Click to Enlarge  * The key line is the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray on both stock charts. GIS only had to kiss it for the buyers to get off the sidelines.  * Underscoring the bullish argument is the possibility that General Mills only had to close the gap left behind in March. The lower edge of that span is highlighted with a yellow line on both stock charts.  * Whatever's in the cards, it's apt to happen soon. How shares respond today will suggest much about the true direction of the undertow here.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Square -6.2% -15% 1.8% 19.3% 20.5% 595% PayPal 2.2% 15.5% 38% 34% 39.3% 196.8% So what now; which stock is better and should investors go with SQ stock or PYPL (or both) moving forward? Growth and ValuationThe first things many investors evaluate when looking at stocks are growth and valuation. Square's earnings are forecast to grow about 60% this year and about 50% next year. That easily outpaces PYPL at 23% and approximately 18%, respectively.The same goes for revenue growth. Square's sales are expected to jump 43.5% this year and 34.5% next year. Analysts, on average, &quot;only&quot; expect PayPal's revenue to rise 16.5% and 17.5% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.While growth favors SQ stock, the valuation of PayPal, unsurprisingly, is superior. PYPL stock trades at roughly 36 times this year's average earnings estimates, while Square stock trades at 86 times the consensus 2019 EPS estimate. PayPal and SQ trade at 7.3 and  about ten times this year's consensus revenue expectations, respectively.With higher growth rates come higher valuations. That is no surprise and explains why SQ stock has a higher valuation. For some investors, that is a turn-off, even though SQ is growing more quickly than its larger competitor. At the same time, others may find SQ's growth attractive. That's why we have to look at other metrics as well. Cash Flow and FinancialsSquare's free cash flow (FCF) is growing rapidly, with its trailing FCF more than doubling to $204 million over the last year. However, PYPL is churning out incredible FCF right now, generating trailing FCF of about $6 billion.That leaves PYPL stock trading at about 22 times its FCF, while SQ stock is trading at 144 times its trailing FCF.Turning to the balance sheet, PayPal also dominates. The company has $7.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, while its current assets total $34.9 billion versus its current liabilities of $28.6 billion. It has no debt, while its total assets of $46.2 billion are 50% above its total liabilities.Square does not have a weak balance sheet. But unsurprisingly, given its meaningfully lower FCF, its balance sheet is not nearly as strong as that of PYPL. SQ has $1.08 billion of cash and short-term investments. Its current assets of $3.2 billion outweigh its $2.2 billion of current liabilities, while the company carries just over $1 billion of long-term debt. Its total assets of $4.4 billion are roughly 33% more than its roughly $3.3 billion of total liabilities. The Bottom Line on SQ Stock and PayPal StockIf I had to pick between Square stock and PayPal right now, PYPL would be my choice. The stock is in an uptrend, not a downtrend, and has the wind at its back. PYPL's FCF is robust and continues to grow at a steady pace. While PYPL is growing more slowly than SQ, PayPal has a more attractive valuation and a better balance sheet. Further, PYPL's overall user growth is impressive, led by its Venmo service.Unless the price and valuation of SQ stock drop sharply, I would recommend buying PYPL stock on a moderate pullback and staying away from Square stock. If SQ does drop sharply , it may be worthwhile to own both names.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-30,"Fintech darling Square (NYSE:SQ) continued its roller coaster performance this week, closing down almost 4% on Wednesday. Square stock had seen significant growth to start 2019 but that changed to a downward trend after the company reported Q1 earnings on May 1. Since then, Square stock stock performance has been all over the map, but the trend has been downward.Source: Via SquareYesterday's drop means SQ is down 14% since the start of the month. The big questions are, why is Square sliding and why the recent volatility?  SQ Stock Trouble? Not China and Not PrivacyOne thing Square has going for it is a lack of exposure to two of the biggest issues that have been wreaking havoc with tech stocks over the past year: the trade war with China and privacy concerns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompanies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have seen their stock repeatedly hit by an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, that has resulted in tariffs and the threat of boycotts. Square's mobile payment processing is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom -- not China.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War The one area where SQ stock could have a minor exposure is its hardware. Square designs its own hardware, but does have manufacturing partners outside the U.S., and high-tech products like the Square Terminal and Square Reader may utilize components that are affected. In Q1, the company reported hardware revenue of $18 million, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to its $959 million in total net revenue.Square CEO Jack Dorsey's other gig -- Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) -- along with other tech giants has seen its stock hit by ongoing investigations over privacy, fake information, and election interference. Square is in the clear on this front. Square's Q1 Earnings Failed to ImpressThings got rough for Square stock when the company reported its Q1 earnings on May 1, resulting in a 6% drop for SQ. While total net revenue was up 43% year-over-year with an adjusted EPS of 11 cents, Square's losses widened to $38 million (from $24 million in Q1 2018). A big part of that was operating expenses of $419 million, which were up 52% compared to Q1 2018. What had many investors concerned was gross payment volume of $22.6 billion, which grew 27% on the year, but missed analyst expectations by $200 million. Square's growth is showing signs of slowing … Worse, Square issued Q2 guidance for EPS of between 14 cents and 16 cents per share, again lower than analysts had been expecting. Increasing Competition for Square StockSquare faces increasing competition in virtually all areas of its business, and that has contributed to the turbulence in Square stock. PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo competes directly with Square's Cash app for consumers, and Venmo posted payment volume growth of 73% year-over-year in Q1, on volume of $21 billion. Other companies have taken note of Square's success in point-of-sale and have launched their own competing services. For example, a month ago Canadian fintech Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) took aim at Square with a move from web sales to introducing a new line of retail hardware, including a card reader and a point of sale tablet.As InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek points out, Square has a valuation that is much higher than other companies focused on payment technology. Unlike other tech companies, a trade war with China and the prospect of fines and regulation over user data is not an issue for SQ. But combine that high valuation with slowing payment volume growth, disappointing earnings guidance, increased competition and inevitable takeover talk, and you get the perfect recipe for Square stock volatility, and an overall downward trend.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-03,"A year ago, Square's (NYSE:SQ) equity lift signaled an overheated market. SQ stock touched $100 at the end of September, a valuation that seemed close to unsupportable. That turned out to be the peak for the tech firm. The broad market turned and SQ lost half its value in less than three months.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)For the first two months of this year, Square stock followed the market back up, bouncing some 50%. But investors have soured. Since March 1, SQ stock has dropped about 20%, and it's somewhat of an odd decline. Other payment plays are doing well. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), perhaps the most direct peer, has doubled so far this year, leading to widespread concern about its valuation.Yet SQ stock has been left out of this rally. Plus its valuation, while still high, has declined. For the first time in a while, SQ looks potentially intriguing. It's not quite cheap enough yet, but that could change in the coming months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Has SQ Stock Come Down?The easy answer for why SQ has struggled over the last three months is that earnings have &quot;disappointed.&quot; More specifically, guidance has disappointed. Square beat earnings expectations in the third quarter but investors didn't like the Q4 guidance. The pattern repeated with Q4 actuals in late February, with SQ stock falling after that report too. Once again, following the Q1 release, investor concerns about the outlook for Q2 sent shares tumbling.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Of course, the fact that the same pattern has repeated three straight times seems a bit strange. At a certain point, investors would seem to realize that Square is guiding conservatively. In each of the last three quarters, Square easily outpaced initial guidance.For instance, ahead of Q1, Square projected adjusted revenue of $472 million to $482 million; the actual figure was $489 million. Adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents handily beat forecast, which ranged from 6 cents to 8 cents.If guidance again is conservative, then Square's Q2 numbers should come in right about where analysts projected ahead of the quarter. And it's worth noting that full-year guidance was pretty much in line with those expectations.Earnings haven't been spectacular relative to expectations, but they've been good enough. And expectations aside, performance has been close to spectacular. Adjusted revenue increased 59% year-over-year in Q1, and 49% excluding help from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 62%. Square is growing like gangbusters, yet investors don't seem all that impressed. Peers Are Doing FineThat said, it does seem like earnings are the culprit because investor attitudes toward similar stocks still seem positive. Shopify shares have nearly doubled YTD. While SQ stock has lost 20% since March 1, other payment plays have rallied.SHOP is up a whopping 44%. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has gained 11%. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are up 11% and 8%, respectively. Tech stocks on the whole, as measured by the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, are about flat.Here too, the declines seem a bit strange. It's not as if optimism toward Square's opportunity has changed all that much. In fact, looking at similar securities, that optimism has risen. Yet Square stock continues to fade and is currently threatening a four-month low. The Case for and Against Square StockThere's one big issue, however. The declines in SQ of late seem strange, but they're also coming off levels that looked far too high to begin with. And even with the pullback, Square stock isn't cheap, or close. Shares still trade at about 10x adjusted revenue, even backing out cash. On the same basis, forward price-earnings ratio is in the 55x range.And there are some modest concerns beneath the headline numbers. Growth in smaller accounts has decelerated to the range of about 17% in Q1. That puts pressure on Square's ability to grow with larger accounts. To attract those customers, Square may have to give better pricing, and spend more money. As I've pointed out relative to SHOP, cyclical weakness could hit small business -- still about half of revenue -- and lead to a quick slowdown in growth.There are still concerns here, but there's still an intriguing story, and a lower valuation. I've compared Square to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the past, given its potential to expand beyond its initial business. And Square is delivering on its promise, at least in the early stages.Whether the price is cheap enough is in the eye of the beholder. From here, 55x forward earnings, given the risks, isn't quite cheap enough. And it seems likely -- particularly if broad market fears accelerate -- that SQ stock will continue to fade. But the story here is attractive, and the valuation more reasonable. It's not entirely clear why that valuation has come in. But if it continues to do, SQ could indeed become too cheap to ignore.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-04,"Shares of Chinese technology giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) were on a tear in 2019. Until they weren't. Through the first four months of the year, TCEHY stock rose 25% amid easing global trade tensions, improving economic conditions in China, and improving fundamentals for Tencent stock.Source: Shutterstock But, in May, TCEHY stock dropped 15% as global trade tensions escalated, and threatened those improvements in China's economy and the Tencent narrative.To be sure, the trade war is a big scary thing with a lot of unknowns. No one knows how long it will drag on for. No one knows exactly what it will entail, how big the impact will be or what a resolution will look like. Because of all those unknowns, a lack of growth clarity could weigh on Tencent stock for the foreseeable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut, in the big picture, Tencent is a secular-growth company at the epicenter of China's secular-growth digital economy. Both those growth narratives were hit off course in 2018 by certain one-off headwinds. Those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror. As such, both growth narratives are back on track in early 2019. The trade war could knock them off course again. But, if it does, the hit will only be temporary, because this trade war likely won't last.  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Consequently, Tencent stock is presently characterized by potential near-term risk and guaranteed long-term reward. That creates a favorable setup for long-term investors to take advantage of recent trade-related weakness in the stock. Tencent Is A Secular Growth CompanyIn the big picture, Tencent's core internet economy growth narrative was hit off course in 2018. But, it is now back on track in 2019. This narrative should remain on track for the next several years. As it does, it should power TCEHY stock meaningfully higher.Tencent is at the epicenter of China's digital economy. The company is somewhat like the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) of China, all rolled into one. They operate the country's largest social media apps, largest streaming platforms, largest digital payments platforms, and largest gaming marketplaces. They also operate one of the country's biggest cloud businesses.All in all, then, wherever the digital economy spans in China, Tencent is there, too, and with a huge presence.China's digital economy is a secular growth narrative. China's middle class is rapidly expanding and urbanizing, creating a surge of participants in the country's digital economy. Internet penetration rates across the country remain below developed country averages, as does consumption and income per capita. All three of those rates will rise over the course of the next several years. As they do, China's digital economy will expand rapidly as will Tencent's various businesses.Tencent has been a 30%-plus revenue grower over the past several years with falling margins. Over the next several years, revenue growth will slow as China's digital economic expansion slows. But, margins should moderate as management focuses less on growing into new markets, and more on profitably scaling current operations. Consequently, I see this company as a 20%-plus revenue and profit growth company over the next several years.Ultimately, that level of sustained profit growth should drive TCEHY stock higher in the long run. Near-Term Tailwinds Outweigh HeadwindsIn the near term, Tencent stock is characterized by a few tailwinds, and a few headwinds. But the tailwinds should offset the headwinds, and the stock should rebound from its May selloff.On the tailwind side, Tencent is benefiting from three things. One, China's economy has stabilized and shown signs of improving in 2019. This is largely due to what was improving global trade relations. Two, the China video game market freeze which killed Tencent's gaming business in 2018 is now in the rearview mirror, because China regulators are now approving games again. Three, margins are finally starting to show signs of stabilization after several years of big compression, mostly due to the nascent payments and cloud businesses finally maturing.On the headwind side, you have the trade war. Ultimately, the trade war could negate the first tailwind for Tencent stock.But what about the other two tailwinds? After all, even amid loud trade war noise and a video game freeze in 2018, Tencent still reported revenue growth rates consistently north of 20%. Even if that trade war noise gets louder, the lack of the video game freeze headwind should enable the company to keep growing at a 20%-plus rate.Importantly, margins are finally stabilizing after huge compression in 2018. If this stabilization persists, that 20%-plus revenue growth should flow into 20%-plus profit growth, versus what was essentially flat profit growth in the back half of 2018. Ultimately, this return to profit growth in 2019 should push Tencent stock higher, regardless of trade war noise.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Impacted by the Mexican Tariffs  Bottom Line on TCEHY StockLong term, Tencent stock is a winner. Short term, Tencent stock is a mixed bag of tailwinds and headwinds. But the short-term tailwinds are broader and more relevant than the short-term headwinds. As such, near term strength should offset near term weakness, and TCEHY stock should bounce back from its May selloff.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long TCEHY, FB, NFLX, and PYPL.

2019-06-06,"Since peaking at around $80 a share, Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is stuck in a downtrend. Selling accelerated and failed to hold the $70 when, on May 5, the company reported first-quarter results. Square issued a second-quarter outlook that trailed consensus estimates, which wasn't a great thing for Square stock.Source: Via SquareInvestors need to know what changed to slow the company's previously strong momentum. Trading recently at around $63, the stock has unfavorably high valuation multiples. So, given the revised second-quarter guidance, what is Square stock worth? New Product Highlights in First QuarterThrough the first quarter, Square enhanced its omnichannel offering by launching the Square Online store.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets By syncing online and in-person data, seller items, orders, inventory, and prices are all synced automatically. This strengthens Square's ecosystems and the value of the seller tools. And by launching the Square Online store globally, the company expands its addressable market. It launched the online store in the United States, the UK, Canada, and Australia.In Japan, Square launched Square Stand and a Square contact person chip reader. This enables sellers to pay wirelessly or through a wire. Processing payments is as easy as connecting a Square reader to an iPad device. Given the ease in quickly setting up Square payments, expect usage growing rapidly.Last but not least, the company's launch of Square Invoices should accelerate full-year revenue growth. The product targets a market opportunity worth $1 trillion in consumer invoices, and that is just the market size in the U.S. alone.Previously as a feature on Square's Dashboard, it is now a standalone mobile app. Already, Invoices processed over $5 billion in GPV in the last year through 350,000 active sellers. Due partly to the incredible growth opportunity here, Square raised its full-year outlook. OutlookSquare increased its fiscal-year 2019 revenue guidance by $60 million, to a range of $2.25 billion - $2.8 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $2.25 billion. With revenue at a 43% growth rate, markets may bid shares lower because it expected better numbers. Still, in the first quarter, GPV from mid-market sellers grew 50% from last year.Its Cash App performed strongly and contributed to Square's adjusted growth rate of 59% in Q1. The company will also build revenue momentum based on strong monthly active users. In the previous (Q4) period, Square reported 15 million monthly active users. And in the last quarter, Cash Card increased engagement and monthly active customers. Positive CatalystsThe success of Square's Cash App is a positive catalyst. Cash App volume grew by 2.5 times in the first quarter. Add the positive impact of network effects and engagement growth and investors will have little doubt that revenue growth could exceed the company's forecast for the year.Look for the cost of acquiring monthly active users falling, thanks to network effects. Add instant deposit, Cash Card, instant deposit, P2P funded through credit cards, and cryptocurrency as just a few Square offerings and markets will realize Square may potentially report yearly results exceeding its forecast.Square's EBITDA guidance of over 60% year-over-year growth will result from disciplined cost management. Its consistent performance is another positive catalyst. Management forecasted EBITDA growth outpacing adjusted revenue growth this year. This is what it accomplished annually in the last five years. Effective Marketing CampaignsSquare will build upon its strong net promoter scores in many of its international markets by running brand campaigns. Its campaign in the U.K. in progress is already reaching the intended audience across its portfolio. As its brand awareness grows, Square will take a portion of processing transactions associated with household spending, and as its market share grows, so too will its revenue.Investors have plenty of credit card services to consider. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is valued with a market cap of $128 billion, nearly five times bigger than that of Square. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) has a $352 billion market cap but the stock also trades at lower valuation multiples. Still, Visa is so large that its revenue growth will not match that of Square's rate. The Bottom Line on Square StockSquare's second-quarter results will lag estimates but the company expects higher full-year results. Instead of bidding the stock higher, the market dumped the stock instead. Wall Street analysts are bullish on Square stock and have an average price target of $85 (per Tipranks). If it gets there, the stock has an upside of 35%.When Square reports next quarter, an earnings beat should send the stock to at least $80. This would bring the stock back to its March high.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-10,"The downtrend in financial services is on pause, at least for the time being, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) leading the June mini-rally. BAC stock is up 4.4% for the month, while the S&P 500 index (NYSE:SPY) has gained 2.5%.Source: Shutterstock Talk of interest rate cuts by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell ignited a strong rebound in stocks. Fundamentally, rate cuts hurt interest rate spread for banks and weaken profits. Conversely, a growth in economic activity also brings more deals for banks. Further speculation of U.S.-China trade tensions easing is sparking stock rallies. Yet even though investors cannot count on a resolution, they should consider buying Bank of America for many other ideas. Leading Financial Services FirmAt a Deutsche Bank Global Financial Services conference at the end of May, Bank of America highlighted its leadership in consumer financial services. It has 63 million clients, 16,000 ATMs, and is the top 20 most-profitable firm in the S&P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far In the last three years, the bank grew revenue by 20%, to $37.6 billion at the end of 2018. It achieved this strong growth in four ways. First, it repaired the client experience, rebuilding loyalty. Second, it offered a customized client experience through client segments. Third, it embraced high tech. Fourth, it replaced core infrastructure. This led to an impressive 21 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage. Contrarian Client FocusNearly half (45%) of Bank of America's clients are retail clients with an annual income of less than $50,000. BAC takes a no-nonsense approach with this group, minimizing fees while delivering services through its digital capabilities. By keeping costs in maintaining each customer low, the bank has the flexibility to offer value-add education. BAC's &quot;Better Money Habits&quot; is an example of such an initiative.Small business owners account for around 20% of its clients. This group has annual business revenue of under $5 million. So, as their needs grow, BAC connects them with its client professionals.Preferred clients make up the remaining 35% of clients. This group has more than $100,000 in assets and happens to skew toward the older crowd. Here, BAC offers advice and guidance through its network of client professionals. Digitization UnderwayMarkets tend to have a willingness to pay a big premium for electronic payment firms like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) or Square (NYSE:SQ). BAC is already servicing its clients with a digital bank offering. The firm is ranked 1 in share rankings for consumer deposit share in the U.S. Its digital bank allows clients to access their account securely, through Touch ID and debit lock/unlock. Payments can be processed through Zelle, Mobile Wallet, and Mobile Check Deposit. Bank Branches UpgradedDespite investing in its digital bank, BAC is not ignoring its brick-and-mortar network. It continues to invest in and expand the branches. The upgraded physical banks give customers a touchpoint with a staff of professionals, should they need face-to-face support. BAC's financial center network is so far ahead of the competition that the share of deposits/financial centers is 1.75x-2x while competitors only operate at 0.75x-1.5x. Growth Opportunity AheadBank of America will continue investing in both its digital bank and financial center network, integrating the two. That will simplify the offerings for customers. Similar to other banks, BAC will invest in high tech and high-touch capabilities.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Macroeconomic headwinds have yet to hurt BAC's business, although the bank noted a slight slowdown in activity. But even though the economy is growing at 2% instead of 3%, consumers still account for two-thirds of the economy. And with low unemployment, the banking business is still very strong. Takeaway on BAC StockBAC stock would have traded in the $30 - $32 range had the markets not sold off in May. Analysts are very bullish on Bank of America stock and have a price target of $35 a share. Plus, with the stock paying a dividend yielding 2.26%, investors seeking exposure to the bank sector should consider this bank today. Investors should also take note of the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (NasdaqGM:KBWB), which has BAC stock as its fourth-largest holding in its 25-stock bank shares portfolio.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-10,"Compared to 2017 and the bulk of 2018, Square (NYSE:SQ) has been disappointing of late. SQ stock is still down 36% from its early-October high, unable to hold on to its rebound gains from earlier this year. Indeed, shares are down nearly 18% from March's average price, largely thanks to a slowdown in revenue growth.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Investors and analysts alike, however, may have been imposing unfair expectations on the company. The bigger it gets, the tougher the comparisons become. Traders revolted at the initial sign of a headwind.It was an inevitable development for Square, though, just as it's an inevitable development for most young tech companies that are building a business on a good idea. Eventually, an organization grows out of its high-growth phase and moves into the mature phase of its life.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat unexpected graduation upended this name, but the subsequent weakness is an opportunity to step into SQ stock on the cheap while the market reframes what Square should be at this stage. Tough Act to FollowThe fact that it was able to launch at all is impressive in and of itself.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows When Square debuted in 2009, Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) was arguably the king of the online payment world, while players like Visa (NYSE:V) and First Data (NYSE:FDC) seemingly held a firm lead on their piece of the payments market.Square's founders Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey, who also runs Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), saw an unmet need, though. With 23 million sole proprietors in the United States in addition to millions more small shops being ignored or poorly served by the credit card industry, allowing them a simple and cost-effective means of accepting card payments has proven to be a huge opportunity.Several numbers confirm the idea, not the least of which is the 350% advance SQ stock has dished out since the end of 2016. Accelerating double-digit growth made for a convincing bullish argument.Things began to change in the latter part of last year. The pace of growth began to slow and outright decline in the first quarter of this year, from a pace of 51% to 43%.Still, it's growth that most other companies envy, and growth that, from most other companies, would have investors salivating. Not Square, though. The chatter surrounding this storied stock -- and it is a true &quot;story stock&quot; -- has been all about the breakneck speed of its sales growth, en route to a swing to a real GAAP profit. When the pace slowed, the story crumbled.Take a closer look at the company, however. The future still looks amazingly bright, and the market may be on the verge of mentally repositioning Square as something other than a story stock that needs unsustainable growth rates to drive unsustainable rallies.Once that dust fully settles, SQ stock should become a solid, even if less volatile, prospect. Square OutlookIt's a reality that hasn't eluded analysts even in the midst of some rather dramatic investors panic.Though traders have driven shares down to their current price near $65, the consensus target remains just under $83. That's still relatively close to its peak consensus target of around $88 in December of last year, before another wave of selling forced some analysts to at least acknowledge current price action.Driving that rather persistent optimism is a growth streak that's projected to remain in place for the foreseeable future. While the relative, comparison pace is slowing, on an absolute basis, the growth train continues to roll.By the third quarter of this year, analysts expect positive GAAP earnings.It's not just wishful thinking either. Square has catalysts in the cards. Chief among them is ongoing growth of its Cash App. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal reiterated this week the possibility that it could propel SQ stock higher, after saying in March: &quot;Square's vision is that consumers rely on Cash App, instead of a bank account, for services like bill pay, budgeting, investing, and lending, in addition to storing, spending, and sending money.&quot;Instinet's Dan Dolev is bullish too, though for a different reason. He also noted in March: &quot;With over 80% of large-sellers self-onboarding, we expect this positive trend to continue,&quot; highlighting Square's traction with bigger businesses. Bottom Line for SQ StockInvestors are slowly but surely figuring out the future can't look like the past no matter how successful the company is. Though it's taking time, the adjustment is being made.  * Walmart Stock Looks Poised to Reach $120 This Year That's not to suggest such an adjustment is made in a straight line. Surely many traders will remain stuck in the old paradigm, while others are already valuing Square like an old-school name. It's a paradigm that sets the stage for more volatility. That volatility is being exacerbated by the overall market's uncertainty.The fog is lifting though, and what's starting to emerge is a company that's still easy to own even if it's not putting on a fireworks show.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Although not facing a direct threat, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war still imposes concerns against Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) Naturally, this dynamic threatens Alibaba stock.Source: Shutterstock Moreover, Alibaba's flagship property Tmall has capitalized on the rise of China's consumerism. But if those consumers are losing jobs and eroding incomes, the economic tensions would hit BABA stock in the jugular.But here's a wrinkle to that thesis: thus far, little empirical evidence exists that Alibaba has suffered under the tariff shootout.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNevertheless, nervous investors have shaved more than 20% off the BABA stock price since June of last year. That's the case even with this month's rebound effort. Fear, no matter how unmerited, remains a powerful force.But this irrational apprehension won't last indefinitely. Eventually, investors will realize that problems haven't weighed down Alibaba stock; at least, not in the manner that experts suggested.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Indeed, China may be inching its way to the trade negotiation table. That development only bolsters the bullish case for Alibaba stock here in the aftermath of its post-earnings tumble. Many Remain Bullish on BABA Stock Despite NoiseIt wasn't difficult to cast a shadow of doubt on the most-recent results from the so-called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China. While last quarter's top line was up 51% year-over-year, the 11% slide in operating income was worrisome. To many analysts, this confirmed that trade turbulence spelled out certain doom.Alibaba stock tried to rally on the news, but the sellers were able to rekindle weakness.However, not all experts (or amateurs, for that matter) are convinced the trade war is as bad as advertised.SunTrust's analysts remain among those supporters, citing dominance in China's e-commerce market and the country's burgeoning middle class. Additionally, the company has multiple strategic investments that reaffirm confidence in the long-term picture for the BABA stock price.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian agrees. He further dives into the latter argument, noting viable synergies. One of those synergies is Alipay, an online payments company that now exceeds PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in size. Further, Alipay has a cloud-computing platform called Aliyun which could drive incremental growth.Most important, Sebastian maintains a &quot;buy&quot; rating on Alibaba stock.Arguably the hardest-hitting bullish case for Alibaba stock right now, however, comes from Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson.Sanderson initiated Loop's coverage with a &quot;buy&quot; rating, explaining it was the firm's &quot;best play&quot; on China's shift toward a consumer-driven economy. More than that though, he noted Alibaba's target market provides insulation from macro issues. These include slowing exports or trade wars. Better yet, they're well positioned to serve China's ravenous consumption.But Alibaba's slowing growth? It's mostly due to the law of large numbers. Next year's expected 35% improvement in revenue and subsequent 24% increase in per-share earnings is still amazingly impressive, and prices BABA stock at only 24.6-times forward-looking earnings. Looking Ahead for Alibaba StockStill, undervalued or not, you cannot ignore mass-scale human psychology. The trade war legitimizes fears, which invariably keeps a lid on the BABA stock price.That may be about to change as well, however.The data is admittedly inconsistent, but on balance, the tit-for-tat tariffs seem to be having little impact on trade. While China's trade surplus was down nearly 13% during the first four months of the year, May's surplus was roughly twice what had been projected to China's favor.Chinese consumers now appear to be buying fewer American-made goods, but the opposite isn't necessarily true.It could indicate waning demand, though it may also simply be the impact of an ever-weakening Chinese yuan, which just hit its lowest value of the year. Or, the yuan could be this weak because China's economy is starting to crumble thanks to the war of tariffs.Regardless of the interpretation, what's left is shares of a company that isn't doing nearly as poorly as it's supposed to be doing. Moreover, a key overhang for Alibaba stock may fade.Whispers are now starting to circulate that China's President Xi Jinping is willing to enter serious negotiations of trade policies between the two economic giants. Such a meeting could take place at the G20 Summit scheduled for later this month.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Businesses also appear to be pulling back on making investments because of the uncertainty regarding trade, especially with China.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows If there is a recession or a serious slowdown, SQ could take big heat. The reason is that a big chunk of the company's revenue come from small businesses. And yes, they generally are disproportionately effected during economic hard times.According to Square's 10-K filing: &quot;Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services.&quot; Square Stock: ValuationEven though SQ stock is 30% off its 52-week high -- which was tipped in September -- the valuation is still far from cheap. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 63x and the shares trade at about 8.3x sales.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Now a premium is deserved for a company with Square's strong platform, brand and customer base. But then again, if the growth rate starts to falter, there could easily be more downside. We already saw evidence of this in the latest earnings report. SQ Stock: Managerial BandwidthA key part of Square's strategy has been to add more and more services on its platform. This has not only provided more convenience for customers but has expanded the market opportunity. Note that this strategy has been critical in keeping up the overall growth rate as payments volumes have been trailing off.But there is a risk to this strategy -- that is, it increases the complexity of the organization. The services span diverse categories like invoices, deposits, inventory, appointments, website hosting, marketing, employee management, business loans and so on. All of these are in highly competitive markets.Besides, CEO Jack Dorsey is essentially a part-time CEO, as he also heads up Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). So it will certainly get more challenging for him to manage SQ as the business scales.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. unveiled plans for a new, global financial system with a broad group of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. on board to create a cryptocurrency it expects will one day trade much like the U.S. dollar and inject a new source of revenue.Called Libra, the new currency will launch as soon as next year and be what's known as a stablecoin–a digital currency that's supported by established government-backed currencies and securities. The goal is to avoid massive fluctuations in value so Libra can be used for everyday transactions across Facebook in a way that more volatile cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, haven’t been. The project is the culmination of a year-long effort as Facebook seeks to spur growth on its various platforms that already count more than 2 billion users. But it will also likely face skepticism–from regulators who already think Facebook has too much power and plays loose with digital privacy, and from those that are dubious of cryptocurrencies, which are known more for speculative investments and blackmarket commerce than for legitimate financial transactions.Read Facebook's white paper on Project Libra here.If successful, Libra could make Facebook a much bigger player in financial services.  Cryptocurrency firms have been trying to build cross-border, digital currencies on the blockchain to disrupt traditional banking and payments for a decade, but nothing has caught on at the scale of traditional money yet.Facebook, which announced the project with 27 partners, is already under wide-ranging regulatory scrutiny over how it handles users’ private data. Growth of its main platform has plateaued in some major markets and crypto payments would be a way to turn messaging – across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram -- into a business that complements its advertising operation, which generates almost all of its revenue. Facebook shares gained early Tuesday as analysts saw the move as a potentially major new profit stream. “We view Facebook’s introduction of the Libra currency as a potential watershed moment for the company and global adoption of crypto,” wrote Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who has an outperform rating and $250 price target on Facebook shares. “In terms of scale and importance, we believe this new financial infrastructure could be viewed similar to Apple’s introduction of iOS to developers over a decade ago.”Still, the announcement was met immediately with political opposition in Europe, with calls for tighter regulation of the company. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Libra shouldn’t be seen as a replacement for traditional currencies and called on the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on the project for their July meeting.“It is out of question’’ that Libra “become a sovereign currency,’’ Le Maire said in an interview on Europe 1 radio. “It can’t and it must not happen.”Read More: Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Project: Who’s In and Who’s OutFacebook Could Be for Crypto What AOL Was for Internet Adoption Crypto Chiefs Novogratz, Allaire Say Facebook Coin Bullish SignFacebook Rallies as Analysts Praise 'Watershed' Crypto Move France Calls for Central Bank Review of Facebook CryptocurrencyTo come anywhere close to matching the U.S. dollar for utility and acceptance, Libra will need to be widely trusted. So Facebook and its partners are mimicking how other currencies have been introduced in the past.“To help instill trust in a new currency and gain widespread adoption during its infancy, it was guaranteed that a country’s notes could be traded in for real assets, such as gold,” the companies wrote in a white paper. “Instead of backing Libra with gold, though, it will be backed by a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.&quot;The total number of Libra can change, and new digital coins can be issued whenever someone wants to exchange their Libra for an existing fiat currency, so the price shouldn’t fluctuate any more than other stable currencies, according to David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project.“It would make a scenario where there’s a run on the bank completely impossible, because we are backed one-for-one,” he said. Libra will also be audited, he added, an important step in an industry with limited transparency.Facebook has closely guarded its crypto plans for more than a year, though many of the details have already been reported by Bloomberg News and other outlets.Read about how Marcus tapped PayPal talent to build Facebook’s blockchain team.Marcus, who used to run Facebook Messenger, said Facebook plans to build a new digital wallet that will exist inside Messenger and its other standalone messaging service, WhatsApp. Once Libra is up and running, the currency and the digital wallet should make it easier for people to send money to friends, family and businesses through the apps. Libra will run on the so-called blockchain, a database that can use millions of computers to verify transactions, eliminating risks that come with information being held centrally by a single entity. Facebook created a new subsidiary, called Calibra, to build the new wallet and focus on the company’s blockchain efforts.Facebook's track record in payments and commerce has been spotty. A few years ago, it began letting people buy flowers or hail an Uber through its Messenger service. Those features have not been huge hits. In 2010, it began offering Facebook Credits, a way to buy virtual goods inside Facebook games. But in 2012 it scrapped Credits, and in 2013 it started working with third-party services like PayPal process some payments. Facebook's revenue from &quot;payments and other service&quot; was less than 2% of total sales in 2018. When it finally arrives, Libra will be late to a party that’s been going on so long, many of the party-goers have either left or collapsed. Some past attempts to make coins usable for commerce, such as Bitcoin, haven’t widely caught on yet because price volatility mainly attracted traders and speculators. Predecessor stablecoins, like Tether, have been used by some traders to park funds in during times of high volatility, but have not been broadly adopted for commerce.Read more about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s early plans for cryptocurrency. U.S. regulations may represent another hurdle for Facebook. Creating a digital currency doesn’t just require buy-in from financial institutions who need to accept it, and consumers who need to trust it, but it requires approval from regulators, too. The Securities and Exchange Commission has shut down about a dozen businesses issuing their own tokens for violations of securities law. Marcus said Facebook has been in contact with regulators and central banks, but added that the company hasn’t received a “no-action” letter from the SEC yet. That would have safeguarded the project from regulatory action by the agency.One way Facebook hopes to appease regulators is through the Libra Association, a governing body tasked with making decisions about Libra. Firms including Visa and PayPal Holdings Inc. are part of the group. Marcus described these members as “co-founders,” and said they will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed.“Facebook will not have any special privilege or special voting rights at the association level,” said Marcus, the former president of PayPal. “We will have competitors and other players on top of this platform that will build competing wallets and services.”All Libra Association members are putting a minimum of $10 million into a reserve to help support the cryptocurrency’s value. This buy-in comes with voting privileges. However, the association’s governance structure is still in flux, and most of the group’s crucial decisions, including the creation of its charter, have not yet been decided, according to several members of the group. They asked not to be identified discussing private details.“Facebook will not have any special privilege”Libra’s timing could also pose challenges. Facebook is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission over the company’s privacy practices. Some have called for the company to be broken up, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Asking consumers to put more trust in the social media giant, and giving Facebook a strong entry into the world of digital payments and banking, will likely draw further criticism.Opinion: Crypto-evangelists hoped digital currencies would challenge Big Tech’s data control. Zuckerberg has other plans.The company plans to keep financial data gathered from Libra users separate from Facebook user data. That’s why Facebook’s digital wallet will exist under the Calibra subsidiary, which will house user transaction data on separate servers, Marcus said. If a WhatsApp user uses her Calibra wallet to send money to a friend or pay a retailer, those interactions won’t be stored alongside her social-media profile.“There’s a clear distinction between Calibra and what Calibra has access to, and what Facebook Inc. has access to,” Marcus said. “It’s very clear that people don’t want their financial data from an account to be comingled with social data or to be used for other purposes.”(Updates with analyst comment, French finance minister, and shares.)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Surane.To contact the authors of this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netOlga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netJulie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to One Day Rival the Greenback

2019-06-18,"Facebook Inc.  on Tuesday said it will roll out its highly anticipated digital currency next year, intended to be used to make payments over the internet as well as on its social-media platform. The cryptocurrency called Libra coin uses blockchain, the digital-ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  to create its digital currency. However, unlike bitcoin the digital asset will be pegged to hard currencies like the dollar and the euro  to make it less prone to the wild prices swings associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The move is widely viewed as an implicit endorsement of the blockchain technology and to a lesser extent crypto assets, which were first created back in 2009 when a person or persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto minted the first bitcoin. The Facebook digital payment venture will be backed by more than two dozen companies, including Mastercard Inc.  and PayPal Holdings Inc. , as well as Uber Technologies Inc.  and Spotify Technology . The cryptocurrency will be overseen by a Geneva-based company called Libra Association, with many of the aforementioned backers serving as members of the independent organization. Facebook is also creating a digital wallet called Calibra that allows users to safely store their Libra coins.

Revenue for the quarter ending March 31 was $5.5 billion, an 8% growth year-over-year (YoY).Earnings per share (EPS) also increased to $1.31, a 17% YoY increase. As a result of robust growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, the company also increased its outlook for the year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at over 54%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.6, compared to the industry average of 2.4.In fact, Visa and its long-time archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) can be said to have a duopoly in the cards network sector. Both companies collect transaction fees for without bearing credit risk and control a majority of the digital payment infrastructure. And there does not seem to be much threat to the dominance of either company.Visa's sales numbers are forecast to grow over 10% in 2019 and 2020. Overall, Wall Street expects Visa's profitability, high margins, robust cash flow and healthy financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for a purchase with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta as well as It's currently bidding to buy Earthport,a British payments company, that facilitates money transfer services across borders.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 28%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Leading up to its earnings report in late July, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks and even have a pullback toward the low-$160's or even mid-$150's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.98, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, Visa may also be adversely affected.Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in these tech stocks.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.Current shareholders may also consider hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $180.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.If there are mixed earnings reports or important news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in the stock. For example, if any of Visa peers were to issue an earnings warning, due to a potential slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. or globally, then Visa shares could also be adversely affected in the near-term.However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night.In general, whenever Visa stock price has a correction, such as the one it experienced in late 2018, the shares come back rather quickly, only to make a new high in several months. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, profitability, leadership in the respective market, stability, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.There are two important secular trends currently affecting the payments sector in the U.S. as well as many other countries, i.e., payment transactions are increasingly moving to mobile and digital payments are surpassing cash payments. As the industry is growing and being transformed, Visa stock may indeed provide a solid long-term investment for many shareholders.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-18,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning, ending the standoff that has kept most broad market indexes locked in a narrow range for the past week. The gains come amid optimism that the Fed's two-day meeting kicking off today will end with action supporting higher equity prices.Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.53% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.59%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 1.03%.In the options pits, the summer doldrums took their toll yesterday with overall volume falling well below average levels. Specifically, only 14.3 million calls and 12.5 million puts changed hands on the session. The distance between put and call volume narrowed, however, when looking at the action at the CBOE. By day's end, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio climbed to 0.72. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched higher to 0.65.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions traders swarmed in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).Let's take a closer look: Facebook (FB)Facebook shares were flying off the shelf yesterday after the social media king unveiled plans to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra. FB stock ended the day up 4.24% and is set to open another 1.7% higher this morning.With more than 2.4 billion active users, Facebook is in a unique position to bring the cryptic world of crypto to the mainstream. And the company isn't venturing into the digital currency waters alone. They just announced a slew of large partners including Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) backing their efforts.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 With the day's gains, FB has returned to the north side of its 50-day and 20-day moving averages, officially recouping all of last month's losses. It now sits within striking distance of its April high near $200.On the options trading front, traders chased calls throughout the session. Total activity ramped to 259% of the average daily volume, with 649,521 contracts traded; 78% of the trading came from call options alone.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 32%, placing it at the 35th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.82 or 2%. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla shares gained 4.7% on Monday to notch a new one-month high. And the rally is continuing this morning with TSLA stock up another 2.5% premarket. One notable development could be fueling the bulls' fire.Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted over the weekend, &quot;Just deleted my Twitter account.&quot; Shareholders the world over likely cheered the move given the trouble Musk's aggressive tweets have caused in the past.Although Tesla shares have rallied well off their 52-week lows, many resistance levels sit overhead, including the 50-day moving average. This has been the spot where previous rallies have failed, so it will be telling if TSLA can finally close and stay above it.On the options trading front, puts outpaced calls despite the stock rally. Total activity climbed slightly higher to 109% of the average daily volume, with 427,700 contracts traded. Puts claimed 52% of the day's take.Implied volatility rose to 65%, which places it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $9.24 or 4.1%. Micron (MU)Micron shares have now come full circle this year. The four-month uptrend that carried the chip stock 41% higher from January through April has now completely unraveled. Its descending 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages loom ominously overhead and reveal how bears dominate across all time frames.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today With Monday's drop, MU stock now sits at a critical short-term support level of $32. Speculators are likely teeing up breakdown trades in anticipation of the floor's failure.The company's next earnings release is scheduled for June 25, so look for that to provide the next catalyst for Micron's trend.On the options trading front, calls were favored over two-to-one versus puts. Total activity finished just a hair above usual at 101% of the average daily volume, with 123,780 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 72% of the session's sum.Option premiums are pumped up ahead of next week's earnings report. Implied volatility sits at 55% or the 56th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Facebook Inc. on Tuesday launched its ambitious new cryptocurrency, which targets 2.6 billion users and is backed by up to $1 billion in funds. For the blockchain faithful, there was plenty of the usual stuff you see in these kinds of projects: A white paper, a nonprofit consortium to govern the digital coins, geeky technical details on how transactions will be validated, and the promise of open-source code.But for consumers, who will decide ultimately whether or not Libra is a flop, there was only a slightly underwhelming hint of what it might actually be used for: A picture of someone sending money to someone else via a smartphone.Even setting aside the various risks thrown up by the Libra white paper (financial stability, user privacy, and whether it could cope with hundreds of millions of daily transactions), you have to ask why it might be a compelling product. The service described by Facebook, namely sending money “as you might send a text message,” is already offered by plenty of other companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Cash, PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo and Circle, a peer-to-peer payments provider that lets you transfer traditional fiat currencies.Indeed, Facebook itself lets you send cash through its Messaging app. The company even had its own virtual currency before, called Credits, for the purchasing of content from within apps. It didn’t take off.Libra’s sales pitch says that “in time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, like paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.” It’s true that you can’t do that on every payments app. But Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg faces plenty of competition in the race toward a cashless society, with other corporate and government rivals already well advanced in their plans. Sweden, for example, is on the road to becoming cashless as soon as 2023. The local mobile payments service Swish was used by about 60 percent of Swedes in 2018, according to a Riksbank survey. It has more than 6.7 million users in the country.This isn’t to write off Facebook’s chances completely. Maybe its financial heft and vast number of users could turn something that’s already pretty convenient today (money transfers and payments) into something ultra-convenient. Imagine a pot of Libra tokens that could pay directly for every goods purchase or app subscription without the need for any currency conversion or card payment. This would, though, depend on Facebook’s ability to manage the huge technical challenge of designing a single coin that can be used truly anywhere.To become a genuinely universal medium of exchange, the company would need to get rival tech giants like Amazon.Com Inc. and Netflix Inc. on board. And why would they want to do Zuckerberg any favors? The idea that Libra is really at arm’s length from his social media empire of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is debatable. Facebook plans to lead the Libra consortium for the rest of 2019, and it will be at least five years before the blockchain technology that supports the tokens is completely decentralized. The ultimate dream of any crypto project worth its salt is that the digital currency doesn’t rely on a single point of control. But even if Facebook manages to get there, does Zuckerberg really want to embrace the dangers of a Wild West cryptocurrency? Bitcoin is a lesson here.And what about Facebook’s targeting of the “unbanked,” or those in the developing world struggling with volatile currencies? Bitcoin and its ilk promised to address the same problems, and have failed completely to help anyone other than speculators and criminals.Zuckerberg’s own patchy record on international payments should give pause too. WhatsApp Pay has struggled to gain regulatory acceptance in India, the world’s top remittance market, because its data storage practices didn’t meet national standards. Libra will have to answer a lot of similar questions about its financial structure and treatment of customer information.Facebook has been on a mission over the past year to recapture the trust of its users. Libra certainly demands a lot of faith.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. made a renewed push into payments on Tuesday, announcing plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra.Read More: Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to One Day Rival the GreenbackIt will be governed by the Libra Association, a group of companies that will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. Almost 30 firms have joined and Facebook hopes another 70 or more will enter the fold in the future.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper hereWho’s In:Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., the world’s largest payments networks, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc. are on board. For Visa and Mastercard, it’s a chance to offer the world of cryptocurrencies the same services they provide in card payments. All three companies know the challenges of building a network and can offer expertise in encouraging consumers to use the instrument and cajoling merchants into accepting it.Companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Spotify Technology SA keep millions of credit cards on file, and they risk losing customers when people get a new card or number. E-commerce firms also pay higher “card not present” rates when processing payments, so anything that can reduce these expenses is welcome.“Libra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology, while reducing the costs for everyone,” said Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments at Uber.International companies, including e-commerce firm MercadoLibre Inc. and telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc, signed onto Libra, too. Blockchain technology and stablecoins are potential solutions for the messy world of cross-border payments, which suffers from delays and high costs.Who’s Out:Large banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., already have their own payments businesses that reap billions of dollars in fees. With regulators still deciding how to treat cryptocurrencies, banks and investment firms are treading cautiously.So far, no large brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., are taking part. The industry is always interested in lowering the cost of accepting payments, but traditional merchants have historically been hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies due to volatility and lack of consumer adoption.The largest U.S. technology companies, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc., are noticeably absent. Many of these firms have their own digital payments businesses and some are experimenting with blockchain technology. Apple has poured scorn on Facebook for repeated privacy missteps and other big tech firms are trying to avoid being associated with the social-media giant.“This is very early -- 27 organizations right now, 100 by the time we launch,” David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And by that time, I definitely expect to see banks in there, I definitely expect to see other large technology companies and I definitely expect to see more diversity of organizations in terms of geographical distribution.”Square Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is a cryptocurrency fan, but even his firm isn’t part of Libra at launch.

The hearing titled &quot;Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,&quot; comes after a number of Congressional lawmakers a day ago demanded that Facebook , which is leading the digital-payments venture, delay its attempt to roll out the cryptocurrency by the second half of 2020 as planned, while legislators review possible risks to consumers. House Financial Services Committee head Maxine Waters on Tuesday said Facebook &quot;is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.&quot; The social-media outfit is wrestling with privacy concerns following its Cambridge Analytica scandal. On Tuesday, Facebook said: &quot;We look forward to responding to lawmakers' questions as this process moves forward.&quot; Facebook has been meeting with regulators about its cryptocurrency plans, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Facebook officials have met with Securities and Exchange Commission as its prepares to kick off Libra Coin with more than two dozen partners, including payment company PayPal Inc.

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s bid to create a new cryptocurrency has the potential to some day disrupt the global money system, analysts say. That’s if the new stablecoin, called Libra, can gain enough traction. In the meantime, they say, the plan probably means little for existing payments companies, like Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. -- which are all partners with Facebook.Shares of Mastercard, Visa and PayPal were mixed in mid-day Wednesday trading, ahead of the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Facebook was down as much as 2.1%.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary about the new cryptocurrency:Cowen, George Mihalos, Jaret Seiberg“If successful – if – it could be very disruptive to the legacy interchange model developed by the networks and banks,” Cowen analysts wrote in a note. Libra may also be “price-eroding to processors,” and serve as a “shot across the bow to money remittance firms.”Their expectations aren’t all bad for existing financial firms. Libra offers potential to bring “new money” into the digital payments ecosystem, they said, which would add to the value stored in digital wallets, like PayPal’s. That may lead to greater account adoption and transaction growth, though costs will probably come under pressure, as “Libra will in many ways be akin to using cash.”They also warned that politics pose a risk to Facebook, with Congress likely to hold hearings in the next few months. “Washington has the power to end Libra and any other cryptocurrency,” they said, by denying access to the banking system, making converting the currency to cash impossible. Congress may also adopt legislation that imposes onerous anti-money laundering and public audit requirements.MoffettNathanson, Lisa EllisThe announcement may be “most important for the cryptocurrency world,” and less so for payments companies, Ellis wrote in a note after discussing the plan with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. “The cryptocurrency ecosystem may finally have a crypto-based system that – in design, at least – meets the major criteria required to make it functional for payments.”Libra has passed Visa, Mastercard and PayPal’s litmus tests, she said. They “see enough potential in the system to have raised their hands to participate – the first significant endorsement of the viability of cryptocurrencies from the incumbent payment ecosystem.”Citi, Ronit GhoseLibra “could be a big thing,” as the “support of Facebook and other internationally active partners will provide at minimum, a lot of public exposure to stablecoins and specifically to the Libra project.”Citi questions how regulators will respond to Libra.“For instance, Japan and Singapore consider coins pegged to a legal fiat as e-money,” while China, India and Indonesia ban dealing in virtual currencies, and Libra might fall under the SEC’s purview in the U.S. “The creation of ‘private money,’ even if fiat-linked, will raise a lot of political and regulatory debate.”Morgan Stanley, Brian Nowak, Betsy Graseck, James FaucetteMorgan Stanley analysts see little threat Libra will disrupt current global payment networks, noting Visa and Mastercard have “significant scale advantage, mature fraud detection capabilities and low cost structure.”They ask whether facilitating cross-border payments -- the only thing that’s not already present in today’s real-time banking system -- will be enough to differentiate Libra from other services, including Zelle and PayPal’s Venmo. They note that JPMorgan’s Interbank Information Network (IIN) is a blockchain that currently offers anti-money laundering and know-your-client (AML/KYC) services, with 259 banks and payments as a use case.KBW, Sanjay SakhraniThe initiative isn’t an immediate threat to payments companies, Sakhrani wrote in a note. “While the use case appears compelling for the underserved, adoption at a much broader scale will be required for Libra to emerge as a viable alternative to existing payment ecosystems.”Libra seems different than other cryptocurrencies, as it solves at least some issues, including volatility in value. Also, sponsorship from a large platform like Facebook may “help with the problem of adoption, although we believe that barriers to scale are likely still high, particularly in regions where a well-functioning payments ecosystem exists.”Wolfe Research, Darrin PellerThe most likely medium-term impact may be on “P2P, cross-border remittance, and the global underbanked,” Peller wrote in a note. He doesn’t see a near-term use case for Libra disrupting the payment system in “financially developed markets outside of remittance.”He sees opportunities for PayPal to fund Libra wallets/transactions and assist merchant acceptance, but adds that there are “long-term questions on potential pressure around e-commerce fees if Libra gains ubiquity.”To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Janet FreundFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Wall Street Sees Big Promise in Facebook Coin, With a Lot of Ifs"

2019-06-19,"Nine months after shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) hit an all-time high of $101.15, the stock has lost almost 29% of those gains and sits about $30 below the triple-digit zone. Now, about half way through the year, what's it going to take for SQ stock to climb above a Benjamin by the end of 2019? Or, do we need to wait for that?Source: Via SquareInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI wouldn't count on Square stock hitting $100 in 2019. That said, I'd bet heavily on it hitting triple digits in 2020. Here's why.  Cash App Gaining GroundAt the end of 2018, Square had 15 million monthly active customers, having doubled that the number from the end of 2017. Launched in 2013, Square CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey sees its peer-to-peer payment service replacing your bank account to make bill payments and utilizing other financial services.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today A new report from Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev suggested that downloads of Square's Cash App increased by 2.2 million in May, 500,000 higher than Venmo, the PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) market-leading peer-to-peer payment app. Venmo is doing a good job monetizing its mobile payments app. In 2019, Venmo is expected to generate $300 million in revenue. If Cash App can continue to get more downloads than Venmo, at some point, it's possible that Square can also successfully monetize its contender. Square Capital Continues to GrowIn the final quarter of 2018, Square Capital, the company's lending business that provides loans for users of Square's payment processing services, facilitated 72,000 loans valued at $472 million (an average of $6,556 per loan). That was 55% higher than a year earlier. Since it 2014 launch, Square Capital has facilitated more than $4.5 billion in loans to more than 250,000 merchants, many of them small businesses. As Square continues to provide more services to its customers, offline and online, the company's revenue will continue to grow at double-digit rates. By figuring out how to monetize new products faster -- 51% of its Q4 2018 revenue was from products launched since 2014 -- the faster it will deliver GAAP profits. Larger Merchants Coming OnboardWhile Square got its start helping small businesses process payments, the number of larger businesses using its services has grown substantially as it's introduced new products such as Square Register, Terminal, and the Online store. Square generates more than half the company's total gross payment volume from businesses with more than $500,000 in annual volume. As the company continues to add merchants, large and small, Square is looking for ways to keep them happy.   * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 One example is Square's push into cryptocurrencies. The company recently hired former Google alum Steve Lee to be Square Crypto's first hire. &quot;Broadly, we have this massive seller network of small, medium, and large businesses … and we would love to make it as fast and efficient and transactional as possible, and that includes looking at our seller base and our register,&quot; CEO Jack Dorsey said recently. &quot;You know, it's not 'if,' it's more of a 'when' … How do we make sure that we are getting the speed that we need and efficiency? … From a merchant perspective, and that's something we really need to get right.&quot;As Square moves to become a one-stop shop for businesses, Square Crypto could be especially attractive to larger enterprises.  Bottom Line on SQ StockIf SQ stock doesn't make it to $100 by the end of 2020, it won't be because of anything it's doing in its business to scare investors away. It will be because we've gone into recession and Square's smaller customers could be severely hurt by a downturn in the economy. As for it hitting $100 in 2019, I'd say the odds are pretty low without a significant catalyst beyond the points mentioned above.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-19,"Square (NYSE:SQ) is one of the dominant names in the fast-growing mobile payments market and while the stock has, at various points, reflected expectations for that rapid growth, Square stock is not an easy money play.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Square is up more than 28% year-to-date, that performance is unimpressive when measured against a broader basket of fintech stocks. For example, the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) is up more than 32.32% this year. Additionally, Square stock resides 29% below its 52-week, putting the shares deep into bear market territory.As of this writing, Square stock is just under $72, indicating that if analysts' are anywhere close to their assessments on the name, most of which are bullish, there could be considerable upside for the shares. The average analyst price target on Square is nearly $83.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less  New Markets, New ChallengesWhen Square first started out, the company's bread and butter was small business owners looking for ways to get paid faster. Think hair stylists, landscapers, pet-oriented businesses and other entrepreneurs with mobile businesses that were processing large amounts of transactions, but at small to medium dollar amounts per swipe.So for Square stock to be attractive over the long-term, the company needs to forge into markets, and those areas are chock full of well-heeled competitors.&quot;We contend the limits of these attributes will be tested as it moves into restaurants and other complex verticals,&quot; SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Andrew Jeffrey said in a note out in April.Square has built competitive advantages in the market for credit and debit card readers that operate through mobile phones. Ask most investors to name another company that competes in this arena and they may struggle to answer, but getting into more conventional, brick-and-mortar businesses brings opportunity and potential risks for Square stock.Square continues to grow at a very fast rate, with adjusted revenue up 49% year over year,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;The business is transitioning as the company builds out more ancillary products, with transaction-based revenue up a relatively modest 26% and subscription and service-based revenue up 97%, excluding acquisitions.&quot;The research firm has a $49 fair value estimate on Square stock.Some analysts are more bullish, but investors should query why. Square stock could get a lift from its reward card known as boost, but are 10% discounts at select restaurants and coffee stops enough to move Square stock. Apparently, some on the sell side think the answer is &quot;yes.&quot;KeyBanc's Josh Beck &quot;thinks that Square will compound annual revenue growth of about 35% over the next three years and will hit have a 26% margin by 2021. His target price is $100 a share, which represents about 40% upside,&quot; reports Barron's. Bottom Line on Square StockMuch of the bull thesis for Square stock revolves around the Cash app, a mobile app that customers use to send money to friends, family, etc. Square's Cash app competes with Venmo, operated by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL); and Zelle, a money transfer service offered by a slew of major U.S. banks. Analysts are enthusiastic regarding Cash app's prospects.Another area underscoring the risk/reward with Cash app is how Square frame the app. Beyond being a payment transfer option, Square wants customers to think of and use Cash app like a traditional bank.Square is &quot;still working with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on receiving a banking charter. That would allow Square to expand the types of lending and deposit business it can do without a banking partner,&quot; according to Barron's.&quot;We believe Cash App--and Cash Card in particular--will drive upside to SQ revenue estimates over time as user engagement increases, and platform growth expands,&quot; said Barclays's Ramsey El-Assal in a recent note. &quot;While SQ has remained guarded regarding Cash App user statistics, we believe enough distinct data points have been released to allow us to put together a more complete model of Cash App revenue performance.&quot;Still, there are concerns with Cash app, too. Notably, Square is a latecomer to this space, arriving here after Venmo and Zelle, meaning the perhaps the most legitimate opportunity for Cash app to pilfer market share from its rivals is to offer lower fees, meaning lower margins for Square.&quot;We continue to believe that Square's relatively late entry into the space and the existing consumer customer bases at Venmo (PayPal) and Zelle (the banks) leaves it as the most poorly positioned among the leading platforms from a long-term perspective,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;As such, we think the future of this business hinges on how many platforms ultimately remain viable, and we continue to believe Cash App could prove to be a distraction from more achievable growth opportunities closely related to the core acquiring business.&quot;Square is a well-known name in a compelling market niche, but even with its recent declines, Square stock is not particularly cheap. For now, investors may be able to find better opportunities in the fintech space, including PayPal.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is getting into the cryptocoin business with a new currency dubbed Libra, which it says will be backed by a market basket of currencies, not just pegged to the dollar. Thus far, the announcement has proven positive for some FB stock investors, while others are far more cautious. With that said, here's a look at what we can expect from FB's Libra.Source: Shutterstock In a white paper the company said its plan is to build a blockchain that can let unbanked people around the world afford banking transactions. It announced a host of banking industry allies will support it, including Visa (NYSE:V), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Facebook is hoping for $1 billion of investment for Libra, but so far only $10 million has gone into it.Facebook stock had been shooting up since the start of June on rumors of the move, a gain of almost 16% since June 3, adding $75 billion to its market cap. Speculators sold the announcement, sending the Facebook stock price down 1% in overnight trading. FB was due to open at about $186.50 on June 19, a market cap of $538 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Libra?Credit card processors risk being bypassed in the developing world by blockchain and other technologies that let people trade and access banking services at low cost.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), for instance, handled 250 million transactions last June after the government there removed high-denomination bills from circulation. Indian transactions of under 1,000 Rupee, worth about $14.30, can now be done using UPI for the equivalent of .14 cents. Standard Visa rates are about 3 cents per transaction, and a 2.5% &quot;discount&quot; to merchants for settlement risks.People with worthless currencies in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela have turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The smallest unit of bitcoin, called a Satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, is now worth about 3 Zimbabwe cents. But the cost of the bitcoin blockchain makes it difficult for the ordinary citizen to use it.The Libra dream is of a stable coin running on a low-cost, global blockchain, allowing those who can't afford banking services to access them and, eventually, replace weaker currencies. The hope is that buyers and sellers will be able to move Libra money with simple Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp messages as early as 2021. Libra CriticsThe idea of a banking system that's only regulated as a blockchain and bypasses governments has its critics. Economist Nouriel Roubini says there's nothing blockchain about Libra, calling the whole thing a pipedream.Fans of existing crypto coins aren't thrilled by Libra either. Facebook insists its Calibra wallet, which will hold the Libra currency, won't share data with its ad platform. But analysts hyping the play still see power in combining financial data with Facebook's user data.Libra includes a new transaction language called Move, a protocol called Byzantine Fault Tolerance meant to make permission-less transactions safe, and a new Libra blockchain database. The Libra Association itself is defined as a non-profit, but the payment companies, internet merchants, venture capitalists, communication companies and blockchain enthusiasts involved all hope to make billions by using Libra to conduct business outside the current banking system. The Bottom Line for FB StockTrading on Libra today is trading on hype and hope.Facebook's value remains rooted in its free ad-supported services, which continue to churn out $15 billion of revenue each quarter, one-sixth of which becomes net income.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever Facebook's value is also based on its cloud network, with four data centers, three more on the way and more cloud capacity in Singapore.FB remains the smallest and, because of its business model, the most controversial and least stable of the Cloud Czars.

2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Creandum, an early investor in Spotify Technology SA and iZettle AB, has raised a 265 million euro ($300 million) fund, in a bid to find and back Europe’s next tech superstars.With offices in Stockholm, Berlin and San Francisco, the venture capital fund returned more than $800 million to investors last year after exits from previous investments, such as Spotify, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange, and Small Giant Games, which was acquired by Zynga Inc.With it’s fifth and latest fund, Creandum will continue to target early-stage investments in so-called seed and A rounds in areas including food, health tech, mobility, fintech as well as logistics, manufacturing software and energy.&quot;We try to continue to stay small, despite a chance to raise more money,&quot; Johan Brenner, the general partner at Creandum, said in an interview, adding the fund’s backers are comprised of 26 investors, including pension funds, endowments and family offices in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.Creandum turned away some investors to keep the fund small, Brenner says, adding that it would help &quot;to focus on the early stage, where we think the best investments can be made and the best returns can be made for our investors.&quot;While a larger fund would allow the firm to make many more small investments, Creandum wouldn’t have the time to support the investments and the management, resulting in lower returns, Brenner said. Creandum said it has already made some investments through the new fund that are yet to be announced.Creandum’s fund size compares to peers that have raised much larger pools of capital. Accel, an early investor in Slack Technologies Inc., in May announced it has raised a $575 million fund aimed at nascent companies in Europe and Israel. While European insurer Allianz SE unveiled in February it was increasing the size of its tech investment fund to 1 billion euros.The Creandum II fund, which started in 2007, has returned about 1,000 percent. The fund in May 2018 sold its stake in iZettle to PayPal Holdings Inc. It was also one of the first institutional investors in Spotify in 2008.(Added context on Creandum II fund.)To contact the reporter on this story: Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Early Spotify Investor Raises $300 Million for Young Startups

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s plan for a new cryptocurrency has the potential to change entire industries. A more likely outcome is that the technology transforms the social media giant’s own business.While Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertising, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says the future is private messaging. That’s a tough venue for data-hungry digital ads, so Wall Street has been wondering how the company will make money from this new future. Libra, the crypto coin Facebook announced last week, provides a tantalizing answer. “Libra could introduce a meaningful new product and profit stream for Facebook over the coming years,” Citigroup analyst Mark May wrote in a recent research note titled “Facebook’s Path to Printing Even More Money.”Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users on both WhatsApp and Messenger yet makes almost no money from the messaging services. Last week, when Facebook revealed its Libra plans, the company also said it would soon put new digital wallets inside these apps so users can easily use the cryptocurrency to send money to friends and businesses anywhere in the world. If the plan works, WhatsApp and Messenger will become new payments and commerce hubs that take small-but-profitable cuts from billions of transactions, according to May and other analysts. “This move is a strong indicator of Facebook’s intent to become a transactional platform (through Messenger and WhatsApp), expanding well beyond its massive advertising business,” wrote SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali.Facebook has a checkered record in payments, and Libra has been poo-poohed by some crypto purists. But China’s WeChat and QQ show what’s possible when messaging apps cleverly fold payments and other services into the mix. WeChat and QQ make money by facilitating payments between users and merchants, distributing mobile games, and selling  digital goods, such as stickers and avatars. The services have turned owner Tencent Holdings Ltd. into the most valuable publicly traded company in China. Facebook’s crypto push could facilitate similar offerings in payments, shopping, apps and gaming, while tapping into the company’s huge user base in Asia, where it has nearly four times as many monthly active users as it does in North America, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. Libra “may prove to be one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams,'' he wrote in a recent note.For now, Facebook and its new subsidiary Calibra, which is building the digital wallets, are framing the new currency as a way for individuals to send money to each other across borders. David Marcus, who is leading Facebook’s Libra efforts, said that the company doesn’t plan to take a fee when people send money to friends, and will likely charge “tiny transaction fees” for payments to businesses.That could be the first step toward something more lucrative. Before Facebook, Marcus was president of PayPal Holdings Inc., the largest independent digital payments business in the U.S. PayPal facilitates one-to-one payments, but it has become a common way to pay for online purchases, too. “You usually don’t make money off of [peer-to-peer] payments,” Harshita Rawat, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “The actual use case is getting people into the habit of doing financial transactions on the platform, and then start to roll out other e-commerce related activity.” Once users get comfortable sending money through an app, adding a marketplace feature and more interactions with businesses often follow. That is “where the real monetization opportunity is,” she added.Marcus can see a future in which Facebook turns payments and digital wallets into a new business -- even if he’s not exactly sure what that will look like.“Over time, if we build more services on top of Libra, we’re probably going to likely index on other sources of income,” he said. “That’s future talk. We’re not going to do that for the first few years of this ecosystem because we want to focus on adoption.”  Whether or not Facebook gets that adoption is the more pressing challenge. The company’s crypto plans are already under fire from regulators in Washington and Europe who don’t like the idea of Facebook dipping its toe in yet another aspect of people’s personal lives. And gaining consumer trust after years of privacy mishaps may be harder than Facebook expects. Bernstein’s Rawat describes Libra as “somewhat of a moonshot project.”If people do start stuffing their new digital wallets with Libra, it might not take years for Facebook to turn that activity into revenue. Marcus believes the new wallets could have a more immediate financial impact on a business line Facebook knows well: Targeted advertising. If users have Libra on hand as they scroll through Facebook’s News Feed, when they click on an ad it will be easier to buy something. That would make Facebook ads more appealing to marketers. “If there is more commerce happening on the platform, then small businesses will end up spending more and advertising will be more effective for them,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Julie Verhage.To contact the author of this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Libra Creates New ‘Path to Printing Even More Money’ Through Messaging Services

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. may have boosted the single, greatest risk they face -- that of tougher regulation -- by becoming early backers for Facebook Inc.’s new digital money, called Libra.That’s according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette, who wrote that the three companies face a potentially “heavy burden” as already-fierce regulatory scrutiny is likely to keep growing.“It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,” Faucette said. That may turn it into a “supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,” which means there’s probably going to an “up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally.”Mastercard and Visa face greater regulatory and political risk than technology risk, he said. As the cost of transactions fall, it will be hard to dislodge them as industry leaders -- unless there’s political or regulatory opposition. &quot;But such pushback is real,&quot; Faucette said.However, he’s still bullish on the companies, along with PayPal, as Libra isn’t yet “far enough along to dent our enthusiasm.” He also takes solace from some companies’ openness to leaving the Libra group “if opposition and process seem too daunting.”House and Senate hearings on Facebook’s digital coin, scheduled for mid-July, are “significant” for the company, and for Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and other firms, Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note.“These hearings are critical for Facebook,” he said. “There is only one chance to frame the debate. It has to set a tone at these two hearings for how Libra will benefit consumers while protecting their privacy.”That’s a hard task, as the hearings will likely be hostile and most lawmakers are likely to be skeptical. “Even lawmakers who generally support crypto are likely to see little political upside in supporting Facebook’s entry into the space,” Seiberg said.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Visa, PayPal May Bear a ‘Heavy Burden’ With Facebook Crypto Plan"

2019-07-01,"Not all stock drops are created equal. Some of them spell the end of a trend, the beginning of a correction or bear market. Others are benign and rise alongside mild bouts of profit-taking that prevent a stock from becoming too overheated. With all of that in mind, let's take a look at some attractive stocks to buy that offer pullbacks of the second variety.The reason for shopping bullish opportunities is simple. Equities are opening sharply higher this morning after a positive meeting between the U.S. and China at the G-20 summit over the weekend. President Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on imposing any additional tariffs.Optimism surrounding the latest turn in the ongoing trade war has investors in a buying mood. The S&P 500 is tagging new record highs premarket. The surge in small caps over the past few trading sessions is also notable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 One-Stock Portfolios for Passive Investors I've scoured the market and discovered three strong trends that are providing low-risk entry points for the new week. Let's take a closer look. Lululemon (LULU)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim June's earnings announcement sparked a breakout to fresh record highs for Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) stock. Shares of the apparel company have enjoyed solid gains for 2019, gaining 48% on the year. The recent pullback has returned LULU to the scene of its breakout. This provides a second chance for spectators that missed the initial surge to get in on the ground level.Last week's hold of the rising 20-day moving average suggests buyers are indeed willing to defend their turf. In other words, old resistance is morphing to new support. And with that, a revisiting of the prior high at $190.52 seems likely.To capitalize, buy the Aug $180/$190 bull call spread for around $4.80. Paypal (PYPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Ever since eclipsing its 2018 high in February, Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares have been on a tear. On the way, its year-to-date gains grew to 38%, outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite by a mile. The trend's consistency has also been impressive. Although multiple pullbacks have arisen along the way, buyers swarmed to defend the rising 20-day and 50-day moving averages.With such a long history of dips getting bought, it's hard to bet against the current one seeing a similar resolution.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever If you're willing to bet PYPL returns and potentially exceeds last month's high of $120, then buy the Sep $115/$125 bull call spread for around $4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The semiconductor industry is one of this morning's biggest winners. And that's boosting stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). With the stock up some 5% out of the gate, I advise against chasing but buying into weakness over the coming days is appealing.Its long-term trend continues to hold strong. The recent test of the rising 50-day moving average ended successfully with last week's rally. Because we've seen a lot of chop between each of its upswings this year, I like using cash flow plays to profit from time decay, while waiting for the next ascent. The elevated volatility helps boost the potential return on investment of strategies like covered calls and naked puts.If you're willing to bet AMD sits above $28 at August expiration, then sell the Aug $28 put for around $1.15.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options positions in AMD.

As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to benefit from that growth.Indeed, SQ has recently applied to become a traditional bank. Becoming a bank could jump-start Square's long-term growth, eventually driving SQ stock higher.In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ is now aiming to become a major player in the fintech apps sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.When Square acquires a new client, it may be able to sell other services to the client.  Therefore, the future of SQ stock is partly dependent on the number of new clients it can attain and partly on the range of services it can offer.Released on May 1, its most recent earnings report and accompanying shareholder letter provide a good overview of the growth of its service offerings. Square's business model is evolving as the global payments space develops. The Fundamentals of SQ StockClearly, SQ is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels, and many growth investors are bullish about the long-term outlook of Square stock. However, they need to examine how each business that Square is now creating will contribute to its bottom line.While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has some questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.As a company that was founded in 2009, Square has not yet lived through an economic downturn. In other words, if the U.S. economy stalls, investors do not yet know how Square's management will respond. Additionally, since most of Square's customers are small businesses, which tend to be more vulnerable to economic hardships,Wall Street does not yet know how SQ stock may react if the economy sours.Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits for the company. And unless SQ increases its revenue, Wall Street may not be too forgiving of the high valuation of SQ stock. Therefore, I'd urge long-term investors to be cautious about Square stock at its current levels.In investing, it is not enough to personally like a potential product or service offering; instead, investors should also search for companies that have catalysts which can drive the value of their stocks higher.But many analysts are now expressing doubts over Square's expansion into lending and questioning whether SQ is taking on too much risk.Another area of potential concern is the declining growth of its transaction fees, which still generate the majority of its revenue. Square's shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not make up for the decelerating growth of its transaction fees.Square's most recent earnings report showed that the company's gross-payment volume grew a relatively modest 27% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.6 billion, causing Wall Street to become concerned about the outlook of Square stock. However, Square's gross revenues increased 43% YoY to $959.36 million.Yet SQ stock's quarterly net loss was $38 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $24 million, or 6 cents per share a year ago.Moreover, management's subdued outlook disappointed the market, and investors penalized SQ stock in the wake of the news.Finally, the expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global- payments giant.Therefore, the owners of SQ stock need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much away from its core business of payment processing. SQ Stock's Short-Term Technical Chart Paints a Mixed PictureLet us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering (IPO) of Square stock in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, and lots of euphoria became baked into the stock price. As a result, Square stock has been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, the stock was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 30%, April and May have not been good months for the shares. The company's weak Q2 guidance has triggered the recent volatility of Square stock.However, in June, Square stock participated in the stock market's rally and went up from an intraday low of $59.89 on June 3 to an intraday high of $74.55 on June 20.From a technical perspective, I am not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, possibly up until its earnings report in early August, SQ stock is likely to be rangebound between $65 and $75.SQ has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if there are any negative headlines that affect the technology sector in general or the fintech sector specifically, then Square stock may easily go below $60.I do not expect SQ stock to reach the $100 level in the coming weeks, as the market may be starting to value the earnings growth of the stock more realistically.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing the stock at this point. Strategies for Buying SQ StockSquare stock has fallen meaningfully in recent months. In the coming weeks, I would be a buyer of the shares of the payments company around $60 or lower, especially between $55 and $60.Investors who already own Square stock might want to stay the course and hold their position. That said, the owners of SQ stock who are worried about short-term profit-taking may, within the parameters of their portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, consider placing a stop loss about 3%-5% below the current price point, to protect the profits they've made so far.Experienced options investors may also consider using a covered call strategy with approximately a six-week time horizon. In that case, they may, for example, buy 100 shares of SQ stock around its current price of $72, and at the same time, sell, for example, a SQ Aug 16 $75 call option.The $75-strike option offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline of SQ stock. The strategy would also allow investors to participate in a potential price increase of Square stock. This call option will stop trading on Aug. 16 and expire on Aug. 17.Such a covered call would provide breathing space until the markets potentially calm down. Then, after earnings season, investors can decide on the best course of action for their portfolios, with less anxiety than those who are unhedged. The owners of a growth stock like Square need to regularly assess their views based on updated earnings results and developments that affect the company and the economy. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants. And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square's revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also go down.I would consider buying SQ stock if  its price declines towards the $55-$60 level. I think the long-term  owners of SQ stock will be well-rewarded within three or four years as the company increases its ecosystem for small and mid-sized businesses and capitalizes on the potential of its Cash App.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-05,"At first glance, the fact that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is developing a cryptocurrency for its 1.5 billion users has got to cause a little unease among the owners of Visa (NYSE:V) stock. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor that matter, any companies that are involved with transferring money should have a few concerns. That includes Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL).   * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 However, in this article, I'm got to look at the ramifications of FB's cryptocurrency, both good and bad, for Visa stockholders.  Why Visa Should Be Worried About LibraWhen I first read the news about Libra, my immediate thought was that companies like Visa would lose market share as individuals and corporations around the world switch to Libra to carry out transactions. But, as I read more about Libra and what it is and isn't, I realized that Visa shouldn't fear the cryptocurrency; instead, it should fear the regulators who are going to shine a big light on its systems as a result of FB's move to create a global currency for the unbanked. &quot;It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette stated recently. &quot;That may turn it into a 'supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,' which means there's probably going to (be) an up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally,' he added. So, if Visa chooses to compete with Libra, what will happen if U.S. lawmakers get a sense that the company is standing in the way of lower transaction processing costs? Or, alternatively, if it cooperates  with the cryptocurrency, will governments take out some of their frustration with FB's cryptocurrency on Visa?  The members of the Libra Association, which includes FB, Visa, and 26 other companies, have each agreed, on a non-binding basis, to commit $10 million to the association. However, because so many details about Libra have yet to be worked out, including those surrounding security and privacy, it's unlikely that the funds will be forthcoming anytime soon.     The Libra Association says it will launch in 2020. Somehow, I doubt it will be able to meet its goal.  Why Visa Has No Reason for AlarmKeep your friends close and your enemies closer. Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Association. It's got a seat at the table. If it doesn't like where the association is headed, it can always leave or vocally complain about what's happening. I have to believe that all the payments companies are going into this with their eyes wide open. The Verge's Elizabeth Lopatto recently wrote an interesting piece about Libra that everyone should read. It goes into detail about what Libra is and isn't. It's an excellent piece. She makes the point that a company like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) could develop its own cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Lopatto and University of Virginia Assistant Professor of Media Studies Lana Swartz  noted that FB isn't trusted by most consumers. &quot;People don't trust Facebook. They do trust Starbucks. Trust is a huge part of how money works,&quot; Swartz, told me. Starbucks has a greater geographical reach in terms of branches than any bank in the world, she says. &quot;Moreover, SBUX has a heavily used payment app and some of the most sophisticated fintech in the world,&quot; The Verge's Lopatto wrote in an article published on June 26. &quot;So maybe that's the answer: Starbucks launches StarBucks, its own branded cryptocurrency, and it just massacres Libra because we like and trust Starbucks, and we don't like or trust Facebook,&quot; she stated.She's absolutely right. Starbucks is in a much better position with consumers than FB ever will be. I, for one, would like to see SBUX do something to help the unbanked. Whatever happens, I'm sure Visa's got a plan to cope with competition from SBUX and/or FB.  The Bottom Line  Whether you own Visa, Mastercard, or Paypal, I think you've got an excellent investment and should continue to hold onto the shares for the long haul.

2019-07-09,"For investors in Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, it hasn't been a great summer so far. All around, stocks are hitting new record highs. The S&P 500 index came within a few points of reaching 3,000 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has been roaring. Software and internet stocks are absolutely booming at the moment. But SQ stock is doing nothing much at all.Source: Via SquareSince its peak at $101 last fall, SQ stock has been in a deep slump. By December, it had lost half its value, retreating to $50 a share. Square stock bounced back this spring, hitting $80 again in March. Since then, SQ stock has gone sideways to down, however, even as the market has taken off like a firecracker. At the current $73-and-change price, Square stock remains more than 25% below its record highs.It's not hard to see why investors are nervous. Competition looms large for Square. The company is still unprofitable on a trailing earnings basis. And it appears to be running out of strong domestic opportunities; bulls are already pointing to markets like Japan as Square's salvation. But if it can't make much money at home, will it do better overseas? Meanwhile rivals spanning from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to new things such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra coin could upend Square's plans.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Libra a Threat to Square?Last month, FB announced its long-awaited crypto-currency venture. Called the Libra, Facebook has grand ambitions for its entry into the crypto space.The Libra will be backed by hard assets with the aim of being a relatively stable store of value that users can transact with, globally, avoiding much of the world's current regulations and roadblocks to the free flow of money. Interesting, the Libra has a huge group of launching backers - several dozen in fact. These include almost all the power players in the payments space. The credit card companies are in, as is PayPal, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Stripe, and several payments companies in emerging markets.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Who is missing from the Libra launching coalition? Along with the big banks, Square isn't there. That's particularly interesting since other direct competitors to Square -- like Stripe -- are happy to be involved. Should SQ stock owners be worried?On the one hand, Libra, at least as it is now envisioned, isn't a big threat to Square's primary small business transaction processing at this point. Libra's big play, at least for now, appears to be taking on the entrenched fee-heavy money transfer and remittances services, like Western Union (NYSE:WU) and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI).So Square's main business isn't too directly threatened (yet).However, do note that Libra would compete more heavily with Square's Cash App. Also, it's worth considering that PayPal, which owns Venmo, is involved in Libra. PayPal certainly doesn't want the Libra to supplant Venmo. But as a backer of Libra, PayPal has way-more influence in how things go, while Square -- and its Cash App -- are on the outside looking in. Cash App may not Matter Much to SQ StockInterestingly, it may not be a big deal even if the Libra supplants much of Cash App's business. That's because Square likely generates very little revenue from Cash App as it is.Our Vince Martin broke down the numbers in a recent article. Given that PayPal's Venmo is a $300 million a year business, that means Square's necessarily is even smaller, since Venmo has more users and activity than Cash App. Though, in defense of Square, Cash App appears to be catching up based on download figures.Regardless, Square has a $30 billion market cap and $3.5 billion in annual revenues. Cash App is still something close to a rounding error for the overall business. It appears, at this point, to serve more as marketing for the Square platform than as a profit driver in its own right. So if much of Venmo and Cash App business gets diverted to Libra, it may not be a big issue for SQ stock. Can the Core Business Make Money?Unfortunately, this highlights the bigger issue for SQ stock. Despite penetrating a large portion of the small business market in the U.S., Square continues to lose money. At some point, you have to ask: When will this company be able to make money? Over the past 12 months, Square lost more than $50 million on its revenue of $3.5 billion.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 With U.S. growth already reaching limits, Square is now looking to overseas markets such as England for further opportunities. Perhaps most interestingly, some bulls see Japan as the next big thing for Square. Josh Enomoto highlighted the potential there, noting that Japanese consumers still love physical cash, in part because small stores don't like accepting credit cards. Enomoto wrote:Installing Square's payment-processing equipment isn't difficult. It also gives small Japanese businesses a more equal playing field against their larger counterparts. If more proprietors bought into this concept, it can create a ripple effect that ultimately skyrockets SQ stock.If the business model hasn't reached meaningful profitability in the U.S. yet, however, will going overseas improve matters? There will surely be more overhead, marketing costs, and so on to set up in new markets. And unfamiliarity with local customs will likely lead to some losses and setbacks as well. Bottom Line on SQ StockSQ stock is now trading at 65.6x forward earnings, as it faces too much competition and offers too little certainty. That's if they manage to hit analyst estimates. As it is, the company has no &quot;E&quot; in the P/E ratio at the moment since it lost money last year.It's not clear how the company plans to monetize the Cash App, many bulls' current big hope for the future. And international expansion could lead to more headaches down the road. Facebook's Libra, if it is a hit with consumers, could cause trouble for Square on multiple fronts as well. Square stock has an interesting story. But at nearly 10x sales and a massive forward P/E ratio, Square stock investors are paying a high price for an uncertain future.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned FB stock.

2019-07-10,"It's tempting to jump on the bandwagon when momentum strikes. Multiply that sentiment ten-fold when a respected analyst offers a bullish take. Still, with Square (NYSE:SQ) and SQ stock, I need more than just a single analyst's seal of approval.Source: Shutterstock Moreover, positive coverage isn't the end-all, be-all. Neither is strong support from retail investors. Although it's nice to invest with the crowd, sometimes the crowd can lead you in the wrong direction. They also tend to get on board an opportunity late. I believe that's the case here with Square stock. Square Stock Making Big Moves, but Going NowhereTaking a look back over the past year, SQ stock has had a wide range with a high of $101.15 and a low of $49.82. This is a short-term trader's paradise but a noisome roller coaster for long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSure, SQ stock has done well this year, and especially recently. But over the longer-term, shares are still struggling near the middle of the range, essentially back to where it was trading last summer.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half An analyst upgrade can do wonders, however. A fresh announcement from Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev confirmed this point. In this case, it was enough to bid the SQ stock price up on heavy volume. In particular, Dolev raised his target price on SQ shares to $100 from $90 on Friday. As justification, he explained that Square's Cash App has strong momentum. What's All the Fuss About?In addition to the 11% price target increase, Dolev placed a buy rating on Square stock. To justify such optimism, Dolev cited his recent survey of 260 Cash App users. In it, he concluded that the app could provide a &quot;potential boost in sales growth, helped by growing deposit frequency, a price inelastic user base, disruption of the prepaid card industry, and an impressive engagement across Cash App's plethora of services.&quot;Furthermore, Dolev reported that Square is the preferred payment app for people who earn $50,000 a year. On a side note, PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo is the payment app of choice among people with incomes above $50,000. One Man, One OpinionAs I mentioned, I don't believe that one analyst's opinion is enough to justify buying a stock. And that holds true even if the analyst has done his due diligence. In Dolev's case, his survey of 260 Square Cash App users represents a small sample size. Moreover, it's only a snapshot of consumer sentiment at that moment -- nothing more, nothing less.Besides, Dolev is something of an outlier in his extreme optimism. The average price target of SQ stock among 35 analysts that FactSet polled is a much more reasonable $82.66. Bloomberg reports 17 analyst buy recommendations, 16 holds, and four sell ratings on the equity. Buy, But Not with Both HandsWith shares up 44% year-to-date and outperforming the median 20%-plus in the information technology sector, I'm impressed with SQ stock. However, I'm not impressed enough to recommend anybody load the boat.If anything, I see SQ stock as an investment to hold. More precisely, I'd adopt a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach. Because just as analyst sentiment can juice up momentum, that same enthusiasm can fade in a hurry.Fundamentally, here's why I'm cautious: I don't see PayPal and Vemno yielding any of their considerable market share in the app space anytime soon. Currently Venmo is accepted as a form of payment among two million merchants and is particularly popular with millennials. Of course, this is a coveted demographic with massive aggregate spending power. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe inveterate (and perhaps insufferable) contrarian in me can't bring myself to buy SQ stock right now. However, I wouldn't oppose taking a small position in Square either. If shares should approach the $60 level, I'll certainly revisit it. By then, our friend Dan Dolev would have dropped his price target like a hot potato.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10,"As many pundits and analysts have pointed out, there's no doubt that the valuations of Square (NASDAQ:SQ) and Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) are huge. The gigantic valuations of Square stock and SHOP stock may prove to be justified, if pretty much everything goes their way, enabling their businesses to continue to quickly expand and become much more profitable.  Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Stepped-up competition from companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), or macro factors like an intense recession are a real threat, though. If they don't find a way to keep growing their businesses and profits rapidly, the valuations of Square stock and Shopify stock will prove to be too high. As a result, Square stock and Shopify stock will drop rapidly.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half At this point, given all of the potential obstacles SQ and SHOP are facing, along with their gigantic valuations,  I think they each only have a roughly 35% chance of preventing their stocks from eventually dropping sharply in the next year or two.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, I would estimate that there is only a 10% chance that either SQ stock or SHOP stock will rise more than 300% over the next five years. How to Jumpstart Square Stock and SHOP StockBut, by combining forces, SQ and SHOP would dramatically increase their chances of lighting a fire under SQ stock and SHOP stock.The main concept is pretty simple. A merger of equals would create one of the biggest cross-selling opportunities in history. Of course, most of Square's customers currently use its products to make face-to-face sales, and most of SHOP's customers use its products to build online stores.Put a different way, SQ primarily services customers who concentrate on selling their products in brick-and-mortar stores or on the road, while SHOP's bread and butter is facilitating online sales.There is likely a bit of overlap between the two companies' customer bases, since some businesses are beginning to have a physical and online presence, and the lion's share of businesses currently  focus on one venue or the other.So if the two companies merge, they could greatly increase their customer bases by aggressively marketing their products to the other's customers.Specifically, SQ could sell its point-of-sale tools and its debit card to SHOP's customers, and SHOP could market its software and platform to Square's customers.As InvestorPlace columnist Luke Lango has pointed out, retail is now a combination of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Consequently, many of Square's physical-only customers will eventually look to sell their products online, while many of SHOP's online-only customers will eventually try to sell their products face-to-face.By merging, SHOP and SQ can more efficiently target each other's customers, since SQ will have easy access to the contact information and other data on SHOP's customers and vice versa. Square Stock and Raising CapitalI believe that many investors and banks would be tremendously enthusiastic about a merger between SQ and SHOP. As a result, SQ stock and SHOP stock would rise dramatically going into and immediately after the deal.Furthermore, banks would jump to lend money to the companies at very favorable terms.  The rally of Square stock and Shopify stock, along  with the companies' new loans, would enable them to recruit more and better talent using stock-based compensation and higher salaries.They could also acquire more and better companies, and sell shares of SHOP stock and SQ stock  to raise a great deal of additional money. Using the additional funds, they could develop and launch new products, such as insurance and wealth management services, both of which, by the way are offered by Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) fintech unit, Ant Financial. Alibaba Has Shown the WaySpeaking of BABA, after combining forces, SQ and SHOP will have access to a tremendous amount of customer data and capital. Using those assets, they can expand into many businesses and efficiently use artificial intelligence to become the American version of Alibaba.Thanks to its data on small businesses, large investments, and prolific use of AI, BABA's ecosystem has successfully expanded into many areas other than e-commerce, including lending, logistics, online payments and advertising.Merging would indeed enable SQ and SHOP to emulate BABA, become one of the most valuable companies in the world and closely rival or even surpass Amazon.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any of the companies mentioned.

2019-07-10,"As of the end of last year, the Cash App mobile payment app from Square (NYSE:SQ) caught up with the Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) rival app Venmo in terms of active users.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Since then, Instinet analysts Dan Dolev and Conan Leon have seen Square's Cash App move ahead of PayPal's platform. As of June, they measure 56.1 million people using Square's tool on a regular basis,  6.4 million than the headcount of Venmo's user base.It's not a reason in and of itself to step into SQ stock, or shed PayPal shares if you own them. Indeed, it's only an anecdotal data nugget one would expect regarding a relatively young newcomer aiming to take a bite out of an established company's market share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half On the other hand, perhaps it's a glimpse of a paradigm shift that will eventually, decidedly favor Square stock over shares of its chief competitor. Square Stock Is for RealPhilosophically-driven investing can be a dangerous game to play.The advent of affordable 3D printers in 2012, in step with the a renewed affinity for cottage businesses, drew investors into names like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), only to burn them. As it turns out, setting up a profitable manufacturing business in your garage isn't as easy as it presumed.Wearables was another mania that failed to live up to the hype. Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) could do wrong until shortly after its June-2015 IPO. Since August of that year Fitbit could do nothing right. It's down more than 90% from its peak, and once again knocking on the door of new record lows.The slow shift to a cashless society and the continued preference for living digitally-mobile lives, however, isn't hype. It's an inevitable future.There's room for more than one player in that future, but it's a future that favors SQ stock for one overarching reason: PayPal is a first-generation web company, and we're now into the web's second act.Leading the charge now is the demographic that's never known a world without the web, and a group of consumers that's enormously familiar (and in love) with the mobile devices.It matters. PayPal, Venmo and Square StockPayPal has been around, incredibly enough, since 1998, which is roughly around the time ecommerce sites like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) cultivated a need for online payment solutions. That's largely why most consumers over the age of 40 are familiar with the middleman's name; they've likely used it.Unfortunately, PayPal has at least been found somewhat guilty by association. Younger consumers, who are starting to enter their high-earnings years, specifically don't want what their parents had.Case in point: Younger Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users made their way in droves to alternatives when they started finding their parents had invaded their digital social circle.Many of them have spent the better part of their adult lives hearing about and even using social networking, expressing every thought presumed worth sharing.Square's Cash App facilitates more of that all-important text-based communication when sending or receiving money. The app continues to satisfy the new norm for constant contact.To its credit, PayPal's Venmo has kept PayPal relevant by adding a similar messaging option to its peer-to-peer money-transfer platform.Clearly owners and heavy users of mobile devices though, who are more likely than not to be younger than not, are more compelled by Venmo.The new-era differentiation doesn't quite end there, however.PayPal has since followed suit, but it was noteworthy that Square was the first to do what was once unthinkable. That is, establish a means of offering small business loans.It's a step toward fully serving underbanked and even unbanked consumers, which is a decision less and less prompted by modest incomes.A World Economic Forum poll conducted last year found that only 45.3% of the sub-30 generation believes banks are fair and honest. They're more trusting of technology, which in this case is a nod to fintech.PayPal may be struggling to shake off the image that it's somehow closely linked to established banks, even if that assumption isn't quite on-target. At its inception, a bank account was still necessary to deposit and withdraw funds.The clincher? Blockchain. Last month, Square added Bitcoin deposits as an option for Cash App users.Millennials are far more willing to utilize a non-fiat currency, and they soon will be displacing their parents as the target market of choice. Bottom Line for Square StockIt can't be overstated that this shift is so big and moving so slowly, it might be impossible to gauge. It took years for mobile phones to become the norm and make landlines the oddity. Though electric cars are the inevitable future, their availability for years hasn't even made a dent in the combustion-driven vehicle's dominance.The differences between PayPal, and even Venmo, and Square's Cash App are very nuanced, and the two companies are sure to slug it out for the full 15 rounds.This is a match the young lion is going to win over the old lion though, even if for purely generational and cultural reasons.Square stock is shaping up as the better play here, even if it's going to take years to realize it.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-12,"Seven months ago, global financial markets were in disarray. Rates were rushing higher as the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy against the backdrop of record-high corporate debt levels and slowing economic expansion. Trade tensions were running high. The yield curve had inverted. Recession fears were everywhere. Stocks were in free fall. The S&P 500 dropped 20% in a matter of months, and dipped below 2,350.Today, everything has changed.The Fed has considered going into rate-cut mode. Economic expansion globally has stabilized. Trade tensions have cooled. The all-important 10-2 spread on the yield curve remains positive. Recession fears have disappeared. Stocks are in rally mode. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up almost 21%, and for the first time ever in early July, the index peaked above 3,000.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's a long and impressive journey from the 2,350 low on Christmas Eve 2018. It's worth taking a closer look at to understand just exactly what is going to happen to stocks going forward.One way to take a closer look: examine the stocks driving this big market rally, and see if they have sufficient firepower to keep the rally alive for the next several months. * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond With that in mind, let's take a look at 10 $100 billion-plus market cap stocks which are all up more than 35% year-to-date, and see where these red hot large cap stocks are going next. Hot Stocks Driving The Market Higher: Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $575 BillionYTD Gain: 49.8%How It Got Here: Social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shook off data privacy concerns in 2019, and it reported continued robust user and digital ad revenue growth. At the same time, margins are starting to stabilize as big initial investments in data security are phasing out. Facebook is also pivoting into commerce, and in so doing, unlocking an entirely new revenue stream which could potentially become as big as the digital ad revenue stream. Net net, the growth narrative here has improved dramatically in 2019, and in response, FB stock has rallied around 50% year-to-date.Where It's Going Next: Facebook stock will stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future. The valuation remains reasonable at 22 times forward earnings for what is projected as 20%-plus revenue growth over the next several years. Further, the commerce growth catalyst has yet to even materialize, and won't until 2020. Ahead of that catalyst -- which is arguably the biggest catalyst for this stock ever -- investors will continue to bid up FB stock to much more aggressive valuation levels. Mastercard (MA)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $280 BillionYTD Gain: 49.2%How It Got Here: Payments processing giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has surged 49% higher so far in 2019 thanks to a more favorable economic backdrop powering continued strong volume, revenue and profit growth. Specifically, as rates have gone down and U.S. consumer confidence has rebounded, consumer spending has picked up. As that has happened, Mastercard's volume and revenue growth rates have likewise rebounded. At the same time, management has exercised disciplined cost control, margins have expanded and profit growth has remained robust. This has powered MA stock to new highs. * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Where It's Going Next: MA stock should head higher from here into the end of 2019. That's mostly because the consumer economic backdrop (low rates, low unemployment, big wage gains, etc) lends itself to continued robust volume, revenue, and profit growth at Mastercard. But gains going forward should also be more muted, thanks to what has become a stretched valuation. It sits at 36.5 times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 26.3. Thus, while MA stock will stay in rally mode, future gains will be muted relative to historical gains. PayPal (PYPL)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $141 BillionYTD Gain: 42%How It Got Here: Alongside Mastercard, peer payments processor PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has also risen more than 40% in 2019 on the back of favorable economic fundamentals and growth trends. Broadly speaking, low rates and a strong labor market have supported strong consumer spending over the past several quarters. A bunch of that spend is being directed into the online channel thanks to the secular shift towards e-commerce. Of that online consumer spending pie, a healthy portion is being processed through PayPal. The platform's volume, account and revenue growth rates have consequently remained robust. Profit growth has similarly remained robust, and that sustained growth has pushed PYPL stock to new highs in 2019.Where It's Going Next: Much like MA stock, PYPL stock should head higher into the end of 2019, but at a more muted pace. Growth trends here should remain favorable thanks to the supportive consumer economic backdrop. But, valuation is also extended, at 40-times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 29. Thus, valuation and growth will be in a tug-of-war over the next several months, and that ultimately means that PYPL stock will grind higher at a tepid pace. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $164 BillionYTD Gain: 47%How It Got Here: Another large-cap winner in 2019 has been streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). NFLX stock is up more than 40% year-to-date on the back of three things. One, the over-the-top (OTT) streaming growth narrative has remained vigorous in 2019. Consumers globally continue to pivot into the OTT channel. Two, Netflix has continued to develop quality original content with high perceived value. That strong original content portfolio has enabled Netflix to continue to win over the lion's share of global OTT subs. And three, the economics continue to grow more favorable as more subscribers join the platform. NFLX stock margins are marching higher, powering doubly robust profit growth. * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 Where It's Going Next: The three tailwinds which have driven big gains in NFLX stock year-to-date, should persist into the back half of the year. That should keep NFLX stock on a winning trajectory. The global OTT sub market will continue to grow. Netflix will maintain its market leadership position thanks to its original content portfolio. And margins will stay on an uptrend as scale drives positive operating leverage. Valuation will become more of an issue in the back half of the year, but the growth potential for NFLX stock is so big long-term that, with rates depressed, it should continue to run higher for the foreseeable future regardless of near-term valuation friction. Lockheed Martin (LMT)Market Cap: $104 BillionYTD Gain: 41%How It Got Here: For shares of global aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), 2019 has been year of steady and consistent gains. LMT stock has benefited from cooling U.S.-China trade tensions, stabilizing global growth trends, continued robust government defense spending, a few sizable contract wins, strong quarterly numbers, a healthy full-year 2019 guide and a plunge in fixed-income yields. That last has made the 2.3% yield on LMT stock that much more attractive.Where It's Going Next: LMT stock should be able to head higher in the back half of 2019, mostly because all of those aforementioned tailwinds will remain in play. But the magnitude of the gains will be substantially lower than what the stock experienced in the first half. That's mostly because the yield and forward earnings multiple are now back to historically normal levels, so further upside through multiple expansion is unlikely. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $108 BillionYTD Gain: 41%How It Got Here: Global coffee retail giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has rallied to all-time highs in 2019 for three big reasons. First, the China growth narrative has gained momentum as China's economy has shown signs of stabilizing in 2019. Second, the U.S. growth narrative is rebounding thanks to improving traffic trends. Third, margins have remained relatively stable on improving top-line trends. Put together, those three factors have sparked a 41% year-to-date rally in SBUX stock. * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Where It's Going Next: It's tough to see SBUX stock rallying much further from here. Growth trends still aren't great. Traffic trends have been largely negative for several quarters, and remain negative today, implying that indie coffee shop competition is continuing to pressure Starbucks. Further, margins aren't moving higher. They are just flat. Thus, you have a slowing-top-line-growth company with flattish margins. That's not a great growth profile. But, at an above-average 29-times forward multiple, SBUX stock is priced for great growth. This discrepancy could ultimately short-circuit the big 2019 rally in SBUX stock. Citigroup (C)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $166 BillionYTD Gain: 39%How It Got Here: Although a flat yield curve and low rates typically aren't good things for bank stocks, shares of major U.S. bank Citigroup (NYSE:C) have nonetheless rallied in a big way (up 39% year-to-date) due to a flurry of other tailwinds. Namely, consumer confidence and spending have both remained healthy in the U.S. Citigroup's numbers have consequently remained healthy. C stock also passed the most recent stress test, and in response, hiked its dividend, which now seems especially attractive next to a depressed 10-Year Treasury yield.Where It's Going Next: It's tough to see Citigroup stock rallying much further into the end of 2019. The valuation is at historically normal levels, while growth trends going forward should be below-normal given low interest rates and a flattish yield curve. A rate cut will help the yield curve situation, some, but not enough to give C stock more firepower. As such, it looks like the best of the Citi rally may be over. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $392 BillionYTD Gain: 37%How It Got Here: The third payments stock on this list is Visa (NYSE:V). Much like the other two payment stocks, Visa finds itself up big year-to-date because of favorable market conditions and growth trends. Low rates and continued strong consumer economic conditions have led to sustained strong consumer spending. At the same time, the pivot to non-cash transactions has gained momentum, so most of this consumer spending is happening through card transactions. The king of card transactions? Visa. As such, Visa's numbers in the first half of 2019 have been really good from a volume growth and margin expansion perspective. Those really good numbers have propelled Visa stock higher. * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Where It's Going Next: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Visa stock's go-forward growth prospects are nearly identical to those of the other two payments stocks on this list. That is to say, the stock will stay on an uptrend into the end of the year because the underlying growth trends will remain favorable. But, the slope of that uptrend will flatten out because Visa stock is already priced for greatness -- 29 times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 25). Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $1.06 TrillionYTD Gain: 38%How It Got Here: Technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has surged 38% higher in 2019 -- and shot to a market cap above $1 trillion -- because the company's core cloud businesses have bounced back in a big way. Ever since Satya Nadella took over the reins in 2014, Microsoft's growth narrative has been all about developing and scaling cloud solutions. Those cloud solutions have been on a secular uptrend ever since. So has MSFT stock. But cloud growth rates dropped in late 2018 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighed on global cloud capex, and depressed Microsoft cloud demand. That uncertainty didn't last very long. By early 2019, as trade tensions cooled and global economic trends stabilized, cloud capex accelerated higher. So did Microsoft's cloud businesses. That growth re-acceleration has driven MSFT stock substantially higher year-to-date.Where It's Going Next: MSFT stock will stay on a healthy medium-to-long-term uptrend so long as the company's cloud businesses continue to grow at robust rate. For the foreseeable future, this is exactly how things should play out. Robust cloud spend is supported by multiple tailwinds, ranging from the fact the data is only becoming more valuable and more abundant, to the fact that global economic conditions are improving. Low rates will also help support what has become a stretched valuation in MSFT stock. As such, Microsoft's cloud businesses project to remain healthy in the back half of 2019. Thus, MSFT stock projects to keep moving higher. Adobe (ADBE)Market Cap: $150 BillionYTD Gain: 38%How It Got Here: Cloud giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has soared 38% higher in 2019 as strong numbers have reaffirmed the company's secular growth narrative, against the backdrop of a low rate environment which has supported a richer valuation for ADBE stock. On the first point, Adobe is a visual cloud giant positioned for huge growth as: 1) consumers and enterprises continue to adopt cloud solutions, and 2) consumer and enterprise interactions continue to become more centered around visuals than ever before. Adobe's first half 2019 numbers were very good, and supported the notion that this secular growth narrative remains on track. On the second point, a plunge in the 10-year yield from 2.8% to 2% in 2019 has helped support substantial multiple expansion for ADBE stock from 28 times, to 40 times forward earnings. * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Where It's Going Next: ADBE stock should continue to move higher in the back half of 2019 so long as two things remain true. First, Adobe needs to keep reporting strong quarterly numbers which reaffirm the secular bull thesis. That should happen, given healthy economic conditions and strong tailwinds supporting visual cloud solution adoption. Second, rates need to remain low to support ADBE's now bigger-than-normal valuation. This, too, should happen, since the Fed appears poised to cut rates, and such cuts should keep rates depressed for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, PYPL, NFLX, and ADBE.

2019-07-12,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock keeps hitting new all-time highs. Meanwhile Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) just reclaimed the $2,000 per share level for the first time this year. Amazon stock is only a stone's throw away from breaking its own all-time high at $2,050 per share.Source: Shutterstock With both retailers are seeing their shares prices skyrocket, which is the better play for investors? Is Walmart, the king of physical retail, or Amazon, the king of online, doing better? Here's what investors need to know. Walmart: Ecommerce Suffering Sizable LossesA recent article in Recode reported that Walmart's ecommerce division is losing at least $1 billion per year. That's on sales of roughly $21 billion annually, suggesting that Walmart's online sales have at least a negative five percent profit margin.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond This makes Amazon, whose retail is marginally profitable, look great by comparison. Several years after Walmart's big Jet.com acquisition, it still hasn't gotten much closer to making money online.The Recode article suggests that some of Walmart's management team is losing patience with the company's online efforts. If so, that could offer a huge boost for Amazon stock. If Walmart pulls back on its online efforts, it will be a massive win for Amazon in its home market. Amazon: Rivals Making Big Payments PlaysOne area of potential weakness for Amazon is with payments. Amazon has the best check-out experience online on its own website, and Amazon Pay has achieved some success.But it never built something like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) did with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) gathering huge fees and revenue streams from outside its own platform.Other online retailers, by contrast, have been able to develop huge businesses in this area. Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Alipay is one big example.MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has its thriving MercadoPago platform as well. Other independent emerging markets payment companies such as PagSeguro (NASDAQ:PAGS) have been racking up strong valuations as well.Meanwhile, Amazon's hold on the best checkout technology is also under attack. Startup Bolt just raised a bunch of money to expand its checkout platform which allows smaller retailers to compete more effectively with Amazon.Bolt helps give small websites faster checkouts, fraud protection, and so on, making it easier for firms to compete with Amazon in user experience. Walmart Score Big in IndiaAnd it looks like Walmart scored a big entry into this market as well. That's through its Indian Flipkart acquisition.At the time, analysts criticized Walmart for overpaying; Flipkart was supposed to have many obstacles in that market. And while the ecommerce part of Flipkart has arguably underperformed expectations, Walmart got a huge bonus.Flipkart has a mobile payments division called PhonePe (pronounced as Phone Pay). Though it was just founded in 2015, PhonePe has already taken off.The Indian government cracked down on cash a couple years ago. It aimed to reduce tax evasion. In doing so, it set the stage for digital payments. PhonePe's business has absolutely exploded since then.PhonePe is now aiming to raise $1 billion of funding at a $10 billion valuation. At least one analyst thinks the firm is worth 50% more than even that gaudy figure.Given that Walmart only paid $16 billion for Flipkart, they may have gotten a steal. If the payments arm alone is worth $10 billion+, the core Flipkart retail business was a bargain. Amazon: Not Winning at GroceryIn theory, Amazon's blockbuster move to buy Whole Foods was supposed to shake up food retail forever. So far, Amazon's actual results have fallen far shorter of consumers' expectations.Some of this is on Amazon for its messaging. Amazon started off with seemingly aggressive price cuts, giving folks the expectations that Whole Foods would be more reasonably priced. Perhaps Whole Foods would finally lose the &quot;Whole Paychecks&quot; nickname.But it wasn't to be. Bloomberg reported that the price of a constant basket of roughly $400 of food at Whole Foods has dropped by only $10 - or a mere 3 percent - since Amazon took over.This figure is based on analysis from Gordon Haskett Research Associates. That firm has priced out the same group of goods at one New Jersey Whole Foods location nine times over the past two years.It has found that Whole Foods did cut prices heavily in one area: produce. The cost of Whole Foods' produce has fallen more than 15% since 2017. Dairy has also dropped a few percent. But frozen goods, dry goods, and beverages have all been about flat.Meanwhile, the price of bakery items and of snack foods have gone up significantly since Amazon took over. On net, the average consumer has saved hardly anything unless they only shop at Whole Foods for produce.This could be a major problem for Amazon stock going forward as it faces off with its biggest rival in grocery: Walmart. Say what you will about Walmart's e-commerce efforts, they are the best of the national retail chains at logistics, hands down.That's how Walmart has maintained such low prices over the decades, and it's how Walmart is able to compete with Amazon on one and two-day shipping now.If Amazon can't figure out how to lower grocery prices and still make money, Walmart will eat its lunch in this all-important sector of the retail economy. Amazon Stock VerdictAmazon stock and WMT stock are rising for different reasons. Amazon Web Services continues to perform phenomenally. As a result, investors are delighted to own Amazon stock.With all the SaaS and cloud stocks soaring, it makes sense that Amazon is powering to new highs.But in its core retail business, Amazon is showing some vulnerability. It's really underwhelmed with its Whole Foods rollout in particular.If Walmart is willing to keep taking losses in ecommerce for the time being, it may gain further ground on Amazon as the physical and ecommerce channels continue to integrate.If Amazon can't do better in grocery, Walmart has a huge opportunity to reclaim market share online.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

While the company's cloud-based SaaS solution for retailers is a game-changer, it is tough to justify a buy at the current valuation levels.Source: Shutterstock But with sales up 50% year-over-year, do the bulls have a point? Read on to see if Shopify stock is worth the sticker price. SHOP Continues to GrowShopify made its bones offering &quot;back-end as a service&quot; for scores of small e-commerce businesses. With that market locked up, SHOP stock needs new growth avenues to move the needle. With the company's move toward large enterprise customers, Shopify has found new ways to scale up the business into a global e-commerce powerhouse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBased on Q1 2019 results, the growth story continues to play out. Total revenues were $320.5 million, up 50% year-over-year. Subscription revenues were up 40%, as merchants continue to sign up for the platform. The biggest growth was in Merchant Solutions, up 58% YOY. This growth was driven largely by increased merchandise volume among Shopify's third-party merchants.Shopify continues to develop its infrastructure, allowing them to become a global e-commerce powerhouse. The company's payments platform now enables merchants to accept sales in multiple currencies and get paid in their local currency; 40% of eligible merchants now use Shopify's shipping platform. The company's merchant cash advance unit grew 45% YOY.Shopify is to e-commerce what Salesforce is to CRM. The rise of e-commerce continues to be SHOP's strongest catalyst. But as SHOP scales up, will the company stumble along the way?With the Q2 earnings release anticipated to occur in August, within a few weeks, investors will have a clearer picture of Shopify's future growth. But for the time being, Shopify's recent fulfillment center announcement indicates their long-term strategic plans.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy  With Fulfillment Center Expansion, Is Shopify the Next Amazon?Shopify surprised Wall Street with their announced plans to build their own fulfillment centers. The move created speculation that SHOP will go toe-to-toe with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a bigger piece of the e-commerce pie.But can SHOP become the next AMZN? Building out their infrastructure makes Shopify a stronger partner for third-party retailers. But with the company barely generating $1 billion in sales, how do they expect to finance this massive build-out?Based on CFO Amy Shapero's presentation at Shopify's Investor Day, the company anticipates the fulfillment investment to be spread over the next five years. Shopify expects &quot;incremental revenue to largely offset costs&quot;. The company anticipates positive returns on this investment to occur after 2023.The fulfillment build out is a long-term investment. Investors today pay a substantial premium for the expectations of Shopify's game-changing moves. But can this anticipated growth alone justify SHOP stock's current valuation? Valuation: How SHOP Stock Stacks Up to Its PeersWith SHOP continuing to post operating losses as it invests in growth, enterprise-value-to-sales is the best tool to compare SHOP stock's valuation to peers. Shopify currently trades at a EV/Sales ratio of 28.Here are the EV/Sales ratios of Shopify's main publicly traded peers:Amazon: 4.23PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL): 8.5Square (NYSE:SQ): 9.4Twilio (NYSE:TWLO): 24.7The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD): 21But given that Shopify is purely a SaaS platform, it is tough to compare valuation against its direct competitors. Amazon, being a full-fledged retailer as well as a marketplace, obviously trades at a lower EV/Sales valuation. PayPal is a fully scaled up operation, with slower growth but high operating margins.Twilio and The Trade Desk operate in different industries, but are similar to Shopify in that both are cloud services providers (cloud communications for Twilio, digital advertising for The Trade Desk).With Shopify stock trading at a premium to fellow B2B service providers TWLO and TTD, SHOP appears richly valued. While the company is making leaps and bounds dominating e-commerce, the stock is not a buy at these valuation levels.  * 10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why)  Bottom Line: SHOP Stock Not A Buy TodayTen years down the line, Shopify could be a formidable competitor to Amazon. But at the current trading price, SHOP stock is too overvalued for investors to consider.While the company has seen significant growth in revenues, the company has yet to be profitable. While the announced fulfillment expansion is a positive catalyst for future growth, investors need tangible results before putting in a buy order.Short term, SHOP stock is a sell. A massive pullback could signal a buying opportunity to place a bet on SHOP's future prospects. But until then, investors should be cautious before chasing this growth story.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-15,"It has been very hip to be long Square (NYSE:SQ) stock these past few weeks. Now, however, it's time to consider being less trendy and waiting for a less carefree pullback that's making increasingly good sense off and on the price chart. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock For bullish investors it has been a wonderful few weeks since I last wrote about SQ stock. Interest rate optimism and lesser U.S. China trade war saber rattling have allowed the broad-based, large cap S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indices to climb by 4.5% and 7%, respectively, to marginally fresh highs. But it gets even better for SQ stock investors.Over this same period, Square stock has rocketed higher by 20% while building the right side of a very constructive-looking corrective base on the price chart. It's all good, right? Longer-term, I remain optimistic. But in the short-term, the risks have also increased for bullish investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSQ's earnings are out in two weeks and the last time the company delivered its results, investors were far from happy. A mixed report failed to live up to expectations, which led to shares getting hammered by an immediate 8%, then continuing to outpace the broader markets on the downside during May's broad-based corrective selloff.But following Square stock's rally this past month, shares are nearly 11% above last quarter's post-earnings confessional. Furthermore, what many had viewed as a pricey growth play has become even more expensive with today's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 74 and PEG ratio of 2.24. By comparison, peer PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) trades at 34x forward earnings and a PEG ratio of 1.98.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Today, the price of SQ stock has less margin for error to keep Wall Street happy. And on the price chart, shares are warning investors that pressing the transaction button to buy SQ is likely to come with an undesirable late penalty fee of sorts. SQ Stock Weekly Chart   Click to EnlargeI'm a fan of larger constructive bases like Square's generally setting the stage for higher prices. But for timing purposes, a pattern breakout through Square's February mid-pivot high of $84.66 within this particular double-bottom pattern is at increased risk of being a difficult entry point for bullish investors.An overbought daily and weekly chart stochastics indicator and price action outside both SQ chart's Bollinger Bands stresses the heightened likelihood of a pullback or even a failed breakout. In either scenario breakout buyers will be faced with paying too much for shares in the near-term and quite possibly a loss if the pattern entry is managed with a technical exit to minimize exposure.A quick look at a lopsided crop of bullish articles penned recently at InvestorPlace, also gives me reason to think the strong price action in SQ stock won't continue without some challenges. I'm agreeable with most of the optimism, such as Luke Lango's article at InvestorPlace this past week. Still, from a trading vantage point, it's another warning sign shares of Square are more prone to downside risk than otherwise.My suggestion for SQ is to simply wait for a pullback that's strong enough to remove today's rampant bullishness in shares while keeping the integrity of the pattern intact. Technically, I'd like to see $77 hold during a pullback without questioning the durability of this particular base. As such, that's my line in the sand if an opportunity to buy Square stock on weakness unveils itself over the coming couple of weeks.

2019-07-16,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a fundamentally flawed index in terms of how it's weighted -- choosing to use price rather than the market cap -- but in terms of what companies are in the index, the Dow Jones can't be beat. Dow Jones stocks represent the &quot;Bedrock of America&quot; and some of the most important companies on the planet. There's a reason why financial media still quotes the close and movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.However, some of the thirty Dow Jones stocks are better than others. This is especially true when looking at what names will still be in the index down the road and continuing to lead in the world of business.Some Dow stocks feature very forward-looking businesses models and operations. It's these firms that will still be alive and kicking far into the future. And it's here that investors can score on some future potential and the gains and dividends that come with it. In the end, while the Dow is still important, but some stocks within the index are just better than others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills With all of that said, you might be wondering: Which Dow Jones stocks have the best long-term potential? Here are three of the best stocks to buy from the index. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to long-term bets with the Dow Jones stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) has to be at the top of the list. The firm is one of the biggest plays on the continued shift toward a cashless society. And as one of the oldest and largest names in the space, V continues to dominate as we reach for plastic rather than cash.The reason is Visa's business model. The firm functions as a toll-road and collects fees from merchants, banks and other institutions every time someone uses a credit or debit card. V simply operates a secured payment network and moves money from one account to another. So, despite having a Visa logo on your credit card, V itself isn't issuing credit or lending you money.This middleman position is incredibly important for the future. More transactions continue to hit Visa's network. Over the first three months of the year, Visa processed more than 47 billion transactions. This was a 9% year-over-year jump and it's only growing further. With online commerce and fewer people using cash, Visa will be the dominant force going forward. The firm also continues to make inroads into additional services to keep upstarts like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) at bay.The best part of all of this is that V features very fat margins and amazing cash flow growth. More transactions on its network simply mean bigger profits for the firm. And it continues to share those profits with its investors -- growing its dividend by 850% over the last decade.The future cashless society will run on Visa. That fact makes one of the best Dow stocks to buy for the long haul. Disney (DIS)Source: Shutterstock Let's be honest, as long people have children, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is going to be making money hand over fist. And lately, DIS has plenty of reasons to underscore that fact.For one thing, its buyout of 21st Century Fox created a media powerhouse. This brought many major movie and T.V. franchises under one roof. And if anybody can monetize that content through a variety of channels, it's Disney. And one of those ways will be its new streaming services.Disney has already begun pulling its shows and movies from rival streaming services in order to make them exclusives to its new Disney+ service. That's big because the vast of streaming is kids programming. With the complete Disney, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar movie libraries as plenty of its original programming content from the Disney Channel, Disney+ will be the go-to channel for parents looking for entertainment.When you combine with the firm's new moves in its park and recreation divisions -- such as Star War's Galaxy Edge -- as well as continued movie development from its studios, there's a lot to like about DIS stock for the long haul. And we've already begun to see those results. Just take a look at Disney's record second-quarter earnings. Those great results don't even take into account streaming yet.  * 7 ETFs With Oodles of Diversification For investors, DIS stock is a perfect blend of growth for the long haul. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock These days, that famous scene in The Graduate wouldn't be about plastics, but about the cloud. Cloud computing, networking, the app economy continues to reshape how businesses and consumers do, well, everything. Which is why Dow Jones stock, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to be an amazing long-term pick.CSCO's bread-n-butter remains networking and communications equipment. It still builds all the switches routers, modems and other guts needed to make modern data centers and the internet/cloud computing function. This isn't a bad business to be in as data center demand continues to grow. Analysts at Jones Lang LaSalle estimate that data center demand will double by 2021 as cloud adoption grows. That will send plenty of money Cisco's way.But the ace up Cisco's sleeve has to be its newfound focus on services and software.The firm now offers plenty of tangential products designed to go along with networking. They can not only build you a network but secure it, offer data analytics and other similar products to look after this equipment. These services often come with long subscription times and very fat margins. It's here, that CSCO has quickly become a cash cow and one of the best dividend stocks in the technology sector.Its approach on both equipment and services sales, coupled with rising overall data center demand, CSCO has the goods to keep growing far into the future.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Just a few months after leading a funding round for Berlin-based fintech company Elinvar, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is backing another startup in the German capital.The U.S. lender is investing 25 million euros ($28 million) in Raisin, an internet platform for bank-savings products, in exchange for a low single-digit percentage stake. The new funding brings the total volume of primary investments in the startup firm to 195 million euros. Earlier backers include PayPal Holdings Inc.Raisin intends to use the money to enter two additional European markets and the U.S. It has hired robo adviser Wealthfront’s Paul Knodel to create its American business. “Our goal is to start in the U.S. in 2020, the sooner the better,” Chief Financial Officer Frank Freund said in an interview. Some of the money raised could also be used for acquisitions, he said.Berlin has become a hotspot for ambitious German fintech firms: Peter Thiel-backed smartphone bank N26 is also expanding to the U.S., while banking platform provider Elinvar was set up by former employees of Deutsche Bank AG.Raisin was founded in 2012 by Tamaz Georgadze, who is chief executive officer, Freund and Michael Stephan. So far, the company has brokered 14 billion euros in customers deposits to 80 partner banks. Freund expects that number to increase toward 20 billion euros by the end of this year. On Raisin’s website, financial institutions offer their savings products, mainly competing on interest rates.“Raisin has developed a unique savings marketplace with a solid business model, impressive growth and a loyal customer base,” said Rana Yared, managing director at Goldman Sachs Principal Strategic Investments.Original Story: Goldman Sachs setzt auf Berlin mit weiterer Fintech-Beteiligung(Goldman Sachs quote added in last paragraph)To contact the translation editor responsible for this story: Stephan Kahl at skahl@bloomberg.netReporters on the original story: Stephan Kahl in Frankfurt at skahl@bloomberg.net;Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.netEditors responsible for the original story: Erhard Krasny at ekrasny@bloomberg.net, Andrew BlackmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Goldman Follows PayPal With Investment in German Startup

2019-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- After surviving a two-day battering on Capitol Hill, now comes the hard part for Facebook Inc.: turning its 12-page white paper into a legitimate cryptocurrency in the face of deep skepticism from central banks, regulators and politicians of all stripes.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading its blockchain efforts, spent much of his time at congressional hearings this week apologizing for the past mistakes of his employer. When he wasn’t defending Facebook, Marcus tried to explain how Libra -- the proposed currency -- would actually work. He said repeatedly that he wants to work with Congress and regulators to get Libra off the ground, and has no plans to debut the new currency before regulatory bodies are satisfied.“Nothing is launched and nothing will launch until all concerns are addressed,” Marcus said Wednesday. He reiterated a version of that promise over and over during more than six hours of testimony in Washington this week before members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee.Still, large existential questions remain about the project, including who or what will be regulating Libra. Marcus said it was not his place to decide who Libra’s regulator would be, though he appeared to reject the idea that Facebook should be treated like a bank. Marcus denied that the company would offer banking services, and also argued that he doesn’t believe Libra is a security that should fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission.Those issues are unlikely to be resolved soon, since the Libra currency doesn’t yet exist; and the Libra Association, the governing body made up of Facebook and other institutional partners that will be charged with overseeing the currency, has yet to be fully formed.The 28 companies that currently make up the association have not yet drafted a charter, and still must appoint a board and a general manager. Libra will also face additional concerns from international regulators and lawmakers, which could further delay its progress.In the meantime, two people familiar with Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans say the hearings did not give the company any immediate reason to change course.The people, who asked not to be identified because the planning is private, also said that Facebook’s team hoped that other members of the Libra Association would be more active in conversations with the media and with regulators. Of the group’s 28 “founding” members, including PayPal Holdings Inc., Visa Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., Facebook is the only one that testified before Congress, and is by far the company most closely associated with the effort.Over the course of the hearings, a few central questions emerged. Here’s what we know now about how Facebook and the Libra Association will try to answer them in the coming months.1&#92;. What is Libra, exactly?The coin’s legal classification remains murky, which could pose challenges for federal watchdogs eager to slide the token into the U.S.’s existing regulatory regime.Some observers have argued that Libra resembles a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that is based on an index, an investment that would be regulated by the SEC. Labeling Libra a similar product could provide policy makers the hook they need to police the coin, while also giving regulators a mechanism to slow the project down as Facebook goes through a lengthy SEC approval process.At Wednesday’s hearing, Marcus insisted the coin is a just “payment tool” or maybe a commodity that shouldn’t be subject to the SEC’s rules.2&#92;. Is Facebook getting into banking?Marcus went to great lengths in his Senate and House testimony to insist that the company was not. There won’t be bank accounts; holders of Libra won’t be earning interest; and Facebook won’t be taking deposits, he told lawmakers.“It’s like digital cash,” Marcus said. One reason Facebook wants to stay away from these activities is that they would require a federal banking charter. That would open the company up to much stricter oversight, likely by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. The company would face many new, costly regulatory requirements like capital standards and stepped-up disclosures. It would also be subject to monitoring by government examiners.3&#92;. Why is the Libra Association headquartered in Switzerland?This was a very popular question from members of both the House and Senate. Lawmakers raised concerns that Facebook set up the Libra Association in Switzerland to avoid U.S. regulations. Marcus said that was not the case, and said that the location of Libra’s headquarters had “nothing to do with us evading our responsibilities.”Marcus said that Switzerland offered Libra an “international platform” so that it would be recognized globally, and noted that Switzerland is home to other global institutions, like the World Trade Organization.4&#92;. How will Facebook make money from this?In the short term, Marcus says Libra will improve Facebook’s advertising business by increasing the amount of commerce that happens through Facebook’s products. If more people have digital wallets, they may be more likely to make purchases through Facebook or its other properties, like Instagram or Messenger. That, Marcus says, makes Facebook’s ads more valuable because it gives marketers more incentive to reach users with money at their disposal.Marcus also said that it’s possible Facebook could one day offer financial services, including, potentially, loans, but that those products would be done through partnerships with an existing bank, allowing the company to avoid opening a bank of its own.5&#92;. What, if anything, can Congress actually do to stop Libra?While both chambers of Congress are clearly concerned, whether or not they will pass any legislation that would affect the project is less clear. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, discussed a bill that would bar large tech platforms from being financial institutions -- possibly blocking Libra -- though it’s unclear how much support such a proposal would garner.Other lawmakers discussed creating a regulator just for digital currencies or using broader data privacy legislation to address Libra. But so far, there’s no consensus on a resolution. As Congress nears its August recess, it’s unlikely any of those issues will be addressed quickly.&#92;--With assistance from Austin Weinstein, Ben Bain and Robert Schmidt.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMey, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Is Facebook a Bank?

2019-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. profit topped analysts’ estimates in the face of slowing sales growth, showing the company can extract more from its millions of loyal buyers and sellers even if it struggles to attract many new customers.The company also bowed to pressure from activist investors, saying it is reviewing the role and value of its StubHub and Classifieds businesses &quot;to determine the best path forward to maximize shareholder value.&quot;EBay shares rose almost 6% in extended trading on Wednesday, after closing in New York at $39.03.&quot;The idea that management is open to explore a sale of StubHub caught the market’s attention,&quot; said RJ Hottovy, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. &quot;They still have things to solve with their online marketplace business.&quot;EBay Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig has struggled to jump start growth since he took the helm in 2015 following a split with PayPal Holdings Inc. Activist investors Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value acquired EBay stakes, and in January Elliott proposed changes including the possible sale of tickets marketplace StubHub and the classified ads business.EBay shares are up about 40% this year, more than double the benchmark S&P 500 Index. Wenig sees advertising and EBay’s new payments business as sources for revenue growth. Earlier this year, he rejected the idea of selling StubHub or other pieces of the company.&quot;They have assets they can sell to generate cash and return to shareholders,&quot; said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Aegis Capital Corp. &quot;The reasons to own the stock remain valid despite the pressure on growth.&quot;Revenue rose 1.8% to $2.69 billion in the second quarter, in line with analysts estimates. Earnings, excluding some costs, were 68 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts estimated 62 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.EBay raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share. Wall Street expected $2.70 a share, on average.The company also projected that adjusted profit will be 62 cents a share to 65 cents a share in the current quarter on revenue of $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of 63 cents a share on revenue of $2.68 billion.EBay’s advertising sales soared more than 130% to $89 million in the second quarter.

2019-07-17,"Since early June, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in the bull mode. Square stock shot from $60 to $82. But hey, so has the rest of the market. Just some of the catalysts include the expectation of lower interest rates and a truce with the U.S.-China trade war.Source: Shutterstock And yes, some Wall Street analysts are warming up to Square stock. Consider Raymond James' John Davis, who raised his rating on the shares from underperform to market perform. The main reason for this is he believes that Square's debit card is likely to see increased momentum, adding as much as $100 million to the top-line next year.No doubt, this would be a big deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut of course, much of the focus for SQ stock will be on the near-term. In fact, we'll get the second-quarter results on Aug. 1.So what is on tap?  Well, in terms of revenues, the consensus forecast is calling for $557 million, up about 45% on a year-over-year basis. As for the bottom line, the estimate is 16 cents a share, compared to 13 cents during the same period last year.  All in all, there remains quite a bit of optimism on Wall Street.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip  The Square Stock Price and Other NewsDuring the quarter, there has been much activity, especially with partnerships. Here's a look at some of the notable events:  * Square teamed up with the Ogden Raptors - a minor league baseball team that's part of the Los Angeles Dodgers farm system - to provide payment services. The deal involves both online sources, such as with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and offline ones.  * Called Square for Restaurants, this is a set of order management integrations for Postmates, DoorDash and Chowly. All these services are not part of the core POS system, which means eliminating the use of various other tablets and manual entry of orders.  * Square has entered a deal to be the payments and POS provider for the Indianapolis 500. The event includes more than 300,000 customers and about 500 concession stands. It's actually the largest sports venue in the world.  * A resident of southern California has sued Square because he alleges the company's invoice system mistakenly sent his personal medical history to a friend. His attorneys are looking to put together a class-action suit. Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal recently wrote a piece on how Square's system has misfired on various occasions.  * Now when it comes to SQ stock, one of the most important growth drivers is its Cash App. According to Instinet analysts Dan Dolev and Conan Leon, the app has 56.1 million users, which is more than PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) fast-growing Venmo. They currently have a $100 price target on SQ stock, which was recently increased from $90. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare CEO Jack Dorsey has certainly done a great job with the company. What started as a simple app has quickly transformed into a strong platform with a robust ecosystem. It's also amazing that he has been able to do this while still the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Yet there are definitely issues with SQ stock. Even though the company deserves a premium valuation, it is still quite steep, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 73X.Sell-side analysts are generally cautious as well, with three sell ratings and 17 holds. And the average price target assumes zero upside from current levels.For the most part, Square stock is pricing in much of the good news. So this could make the upcoming earnings report a bit dicey since the growth rate has already been trending down during the past few quarters.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-18,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has reached an inflection point. After losing over one-fourth of its value during the spring, Square stock has now recovered to its February highs.Source: Shutterstock This leaves traders wondering where SQ goes next. The increasing influence of Square could eventually make the company one of the biggest in tech. Consequently, this growth has taken the company to high valuations.While this portends well for the future of the company, whether to buy SQ stock at these levels remains unclear.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now  Square Is the Next Tech GiantSquare is so much more than a competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Long term, SQ stock will become the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of finance. It has begun to follow in Amazon's footsteps by becoming both a conglomerate and an ecosystem, and ultimately, a disruptor.The company started by enabling every smartphone owner to accept credit cards. It has since moved into point-of-sale systems and can now handle other business functions such as payroll, funding, and marketing. It has also enabled website creation through its purchase of Weebly. Late last year, Square even made a second attempt to become a bank. This approval would allow them to accept deposits.All this will combine into the same ecosystem, one that could do to many industries what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did to video stores and cable television. If nothing else, it makes Square's point-of-sale system a more compelling offering than the ones built by a company such as NCR (NYSE:NCR).The increasingly cashless society also plays into the firm's plans well. Square's Cash App serves the same function as banks from a consumer standpoint. This could leave investors and consumers may question the future need for a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or a Citigroup (NYSE:C). While I believe it is too early to predict the destruction of large banks, it could force radical changes to their business models to survive.Consequently, the question as to whether to buy SQ stock has become one of when and not if to buy. Like other disruptors, SQ trades at a high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Analysts forecast average annual profit growth at 46.1% for the foreseeable future. Hence, the company can attract investors even with its forward PE of around 73. The Charts on Square StockWithout fundamentals, analysts will evaluate Square based on charts and momentum. SQ happens to trade at a critical level. At around $82 per share, Square stock trades almost 20% below its all-time high of $101.15 per share. It has also reached the approximate price point from which it pulled back in February.If it sustains itself above $82 per share, I think it will run higher in the near term, perhaps even retesting levels above $100 per share. A pullback could mean that it retests support in the mid-$70s per share range.It could also portend the beginning of a trading range between the low $60s and low $80s per share level.Another critical point could come Aug.1 when the San Francisco-based financial tech firm reports earnings for the second quarter. Since SQ will likely report an earnings beat, investors should watch forward guidance. This could provide the catalyst needed to drive Square stock for the foreseeable future. The Bottom Line on Square StockInvestors need more clarity on the equity's direction before buying SQ stock. Square supports a massive growth rate and continues to make the moves that could make its ecosystem one of the most influential in all of tech.However, the price of Square stock has reached levels where it pulled back in February. At this point, investors need to know that SQ is not forming a double top in the low $80s per share range.If it closes in the mid-$80s per share range or higher, it could retest that $101.15 per share high. If it pulls back, investors should wait until the stock finds its next inflection point.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-19,"It's rare to find bipartisanship in today's polarized environment in Washington DC. But there is one issue that seems to unite the factions: the distrust of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and that's not good news for Facebook stock.Source: Shutterstock That's ironic. Keep in mind that FB continues to be quite popular with its users.  The company has also been aggressive when it comes to hiring and providing juicy salaries. In the first quarter, its headcount grew by 36% on a year-over-year basis to 37,773.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) But such things don't really matter much. Over the years, FB has been careless with users' data and privacy. And this has impacted views on FB within DC. After all, the company recently agreed to a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission regarding its privacy practices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet this week's testimony regarding FB's planned launch of the Libra cryptocurrency -- which has the backing of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- is perhaps the most interesting evidence of the distrust towards FB from Washington.Here's what Democrat Congressman,Brad Sherman had to say: &quot;The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers. That's the most consequential innovation, although this may do more to endanger America than even that.&quot;Yikes! Oh, and he referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg as &quot;Zuckbucks.&quot;In the meantime, there was criticism from the other side of the aisle. For example, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump have expressed concerns about Libra. FB Stock and LibraDavid Marcus, who heads up the Libra project for FB, tried his best to handle the questions. He was actually fairly reasonable and understanding.  Keep in mind that Marcus said that the cryptocurrency would not be a vehicle for trading or for banking services. He added that it would also have a great deal of  transparency, helping to reduce its use in illicit activities.According to InvestorPlace.com columnist Dana Blankenhorn: &quot;The difference is that, while banks today have to police compliance at the teller's window, so to speak, Libra will make its blockchain available to police. Facebook will control neither the network, the currency, nor the reserve backing it. Its Calibra subsidiary will just be running digital wallets.&quot;Marcus also mentioned that FB would not move forward with Libra until regulators are satisfied with it.  In other words, he did demonstrate some finesse.It's difficult to predict what may ultimately happen to Libra. But given the pushback in Congress, I think the future of Libra does look dicey. Interestingly enough, the value of bitcoin has plunged recently, going from $13,000 to $9,800. The decline  indicates that investors are skeptical about Libra's future. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockThe success or failure of Libra probably does not mean a lot to FB and FB stock.  Rather, the hearings point to the ominous fact that FB does face serious political headwinds.FB's current problems with Washington look similar to those of  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) back in the 1990s, when the company came under pressure from antitrust regulators. In fact, the parallels are eerie. Both Bill Gates and Zuckerberg started their technology companies while at Harvard and subsequently cashed in on huge opportunities. Essentially, they ruthlessly created extremely powerful platforms and ecosystems which would be nearly impossible to destroy.MSFT  become an easy target. There were many companies that wanted to take it down to even the tech  playing field. As a result, MSFT had to focus more and more time and resources on battling regulators. This ultimately led to the company losing its momentum and dominance, until the past couple years.I could easily envision FB suffering a similar fate. The company has become a convenient punching bag - and for good reason.I'm not  implying that things will suddenly come undone for FB. For the most part, the company appears to be running on all cylinders. But in the years to come, it would not be surprising to see FB face more problems, making it tougher to be bullish about the long-term outlook of FB stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

The company delivered a non-GAAP earnings beat, generating 35 cents per share vs. expectations of 30 cents per share. However, revenue of $5.93 billion declined 3.6% year-over-year and missed estimates by $40 million.Obviously investors are willing to overlook the sales miss, as shares of Halliburton threaten to breakout over $24. However, it may be due to management's commentary that the second half is looking better for its international unit, much like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) said on Friday.At the end of the day, look for earnings to fuel the move this week. It's not just tech, but the sector plays a huge role over the next few sessions. Positive reactions very well could drive stocks to new highs. A negative reaction could further the current pullback. Major Moves on the Stock Market TodayShares of memory and memory equipment makers got a huge shot in the arm on Monday. Last week, we pointed out that Micron (NASDAQ:MU) was breaking out and on Monday the stock erased any doubt about its intentions to race higher.The stock climbed 3.67%, while Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped 4.4% and 6.1%, respectively. Goldman Sachs analysts were the catalyst, as the firm upgraded all three of the stocks to a &quot;buy&quot; rating from &quot;neutral.&quot; For AMAT, they added it to their conviction buy list.The move came with a $56 price target for Micron (from $40) and a $231 target for LRCX (from $197). For the conviction buy, the analysts assigned a $56 price target for AMAT (up from $48).Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to hold above the key $360 to $362 area, but shares slipped 1% on Monday. The decline comes as credit rating agency Fitch cut its outlook on Boeing to &quot;negative.&quot; That's down from a &quot;stable&quot; rating as Fitch worries about regulatory issues and when the 737 MAX will come into service. It could remain an issue into 2020 and hurt operating margins for several years, the firm argued. Poking Around Wall StreetBlackstone (NYSE:BX) pulled back nicely ahead of earnings last week.

2019-07-26,"Visa (NYSE: V) stock is on a tear. Visa stock is up over 37% year-to-date. After the company recently beat average earnings expectations, investors continue to show high confidence in Visa's future prospects.But after this fantastic run, is Visa stock still a buy?At its current valuation levels, V stock price is elevated. But given macro factors that will be good for Visa's business over the long-term, V stock price could climb further.Is Visa stock still a buy? Should investors avoid V stock while the shares remain richly valued? Read on to learn the verdict on Visa stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Shutterstock  Strong Earnings Report Supports V StockOn July 23, Visa released its earnings for the quarter that ended on June 30. The company continues to post solid growth numbers. For the quarter, its sales came in at $5.8 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 14% YoY. The growth of global card payments continues to fuel increases in its revenues.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now For fiscal year 2019, Visa anticipates revenue growth in the low double-digit percentage levels. But what are Visa's long-term growth strategies? Is it willing to look outside the box to sustain its growth? Based on recent developments, it appears Visa can continue to grow by providing new services. Cross-Border Payments Could be Key to Long-Term GrowthVisa dominates the card payments industry, with the largest global market share outside of China. But to sustain above-average growth,  Visa needs to look to new frontiers. One area of opportunity is cross-border payments.With the launch of Visa B2B Connect, the company now offers a seamless alternative to legacy bilateral networks. Traditionally, cross-border transactions required multiple hand-offs before the funds were fully transferred. But this costly, time consuming process is not compatible with today's global business environment. B2B connect uses blockchain technology to improve transparency and reduce complexity. That streamlines the whole cross-border payment process.Along with Visa's legacy competitors, many upstarts are getting into the cross-border payments space. But unlike competitors such as Ripple's Ripplenet, Visa's B2B Connect does not use cryptocurrency for transactions. Given the high volatility of cryptocurrency, financials institutions likely prefer the stability of B2B Connect. Visa's competitor, MasterCard (NYSE: MA), could also enter this space. But so far, MasterCard has focused on specific niches within B2B global payments.After the rollout of B2B Connect, does Visa have additional opportunities that can become positive catalysts for  Visa stock? Or is all the growth from the initiative already reflected in V stock price? After analyzing the valuation metrics of V stock, I believe that Visa's valuation is in-line with  its peers. Valuation: Visa Stock Richly Valued, But In Line With PeersConfident in the company's strong franchise and high operating margins, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Similar to its peers, Visa stock trades at a premium valuation. The company's shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 34.1. The company currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio (EV/EBITDA) of 28.Here are the current earnings multiple valuations for Visa stock's peers:MasterCard: 36.7 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 31.3PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL): 55.4 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 48.6V stock trades at a slight discount to MasterCard stock. PayPal trades at a premium to both companies. That is understandable, given investors' high confidence in PayPal's ability to disrupt the market. Even so, the earnings multiple of V stock seems excessive.While the company continues to generate above-average revenue growth and high margins, paying a high premium for Visa stock may expose investors to material losses if its outlook deteriorates. The Bottom Line: Visa Stock Is Overvalued, But the Shares Could Continue to ClimbDespite Visa stock's rich valuation, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Global card payments continue to grow, aided by the boom in e-commerce, as well as growth in emerging markets.Visa and MasterCard have solid franchises that give them significant moats. But with a variety of legacy competitors, along with fintech upstarts, gaining traction in the space, this advantage may be threatened over the long-term.However, Visa appears equipped to handle the challenges. With its strong brand equity and infrastructure, the company has leveraged its reputation to enter new areas of growth, such as B2B Connect. As a result, Visa could deliver above-average growth over the long-term.While in the short-term Visa stock's valuation appears excessive, it may not be smart to bet against V stock. From its past performance, it's clear that investors believe the company has a wonderful business and trades at a fair price. As the company's growth continues,Visa stock will likely appreciate, with its valuation staying level. While macro factors may lead to a valuation correction down the road, I do not expect  V stock price to drop significantly.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But that doesn't mean everything looks bleak for PayPal stock.Source: Shutterstock PayPal now expects 2019 revenue of $17.60 billion to $17.80 billion, below a prior top-line forecast of $17.85 billion to $18.1 billion. The company's latest guidance is also well below the Wall Street estimate of $17.92 billion. For the second quarter, the company earned 86 cents a share on revenue of $4.3 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 69 cents a share on revenue of $4.1 billion.Showing just how much analysts and investors prize top-line growth, PayPal raised its earnings guidance and the stock still faltered. The company boosted non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2019 to $3.12 to $3.17 a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now As has been the case with a slew of other companies this earnings season, foreign currency issues took a toll on PayPal in the second quarter, but that is not a permanent situation and Thursday's decline could be the pullback investors have been waiting for in the stock, which is still up nearly 37% year-to-date. The PayPal StoryPayPal is often viewed as a financial services stock, but that is a value sector and PayPal stock is a growth name. It is rare for value stocks to return 37% in less than seven months and rare still that they trade at 40.65x forward earnings, as PayPal stock does. However, wide moat fintech players like PayPal justify lofty earnings multiples.Additionally, PayPal is tapping into an array of high-growth markets to foster its own growth. Those included extending the dominance of Venmo, unveiling the PayPal Commerce Platform and more.&quot;Net new active accounts increased by a record 41 million over the last 12 months, and engagement per active account once again increased by 9% to 39 times a year. Venmo's momentum continues, with 70% growth in total payment volume to $24 billion,&quot; said PayPal CEO and President Dan Schulman in a statement.With ecommerce and online retail booming, the PayPal Commerce Platform has the potential to be a long-term contributor to the stock's value.PayPal Commerce Platform is &quot;a new solution designed to meet the specific needs of marketplaces, ecommerce solution providers, and crowdfunding platforms by bringing together a comprehensive set of technologies, tools, services, and financing solutions for businesses,&quot; according to the company.That's a lot of corporate jargon there. For investors, the best thing to do is to examine the data around the growth of ecommerce and online retail.&quot;The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce announced (earlier this year) the estimate of U.S. retail e-commerce sales for the first quarter of 2019, adjusted for seasonal variation, but not for price changes, was $137.7 billion, an increase of 3.6percent (±0.7%) from the fourth quarter of 2018,&quot; said the Census Bureau.Investors needing more convincing about the potency of e-commerce and how it can affect PayPal stock for the better going forward can simply examine the boffo results from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent Prime Day. Bottom Line on PayPal StockIn the second quarter, PayPal also enhanced its partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) while taking a $500 million stake in the ride-hailing firm. Then there is the growth opportunity with PayPal's Xoom business.&quot;In July, PayPal's Xoom product launched its international money transfer services in the UK and 31 other European markets,&quot; according to the company. &quot;Customers across Europe can now use Xoom to send money, pay bills or reload phones to more than 130 markets internationally.&quot;Yes, there were second-quarter issues, but it's best to take the long view with PayPal stock.&quot;More importantly, the company lowered its constant currency revenue guidance for the year to 14%-15% from 16-17%,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;This was primarily attributed to delays in product integrations with some key partners and planned pricing changes. This development does not overly concern us. Despite any near-term operational hiccups, we think the near-term outlook for PayPal remains bright.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-30,"Up 42% so far in 2019, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock is up more than twice as much as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). SQ stock's 14.6% one-year gain is also about double the S&P 500's 7.2% performance.Source: Shutterstock Given Square's meteoric rise over the past few years, one could consider its ~14% gain a relatively quiet consolidation period. In fact, the stock is setting up rather attractively. If Square stock weren't set to report earnings later this week on August 1st, it would be on most traders' radar by now.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up Because of the earnings report though, many will have to wait to see how the stock trades after the report is released. The flip side is of course, after the report is released, SQ stock could very well post a huge move -- either breaking out in big fashion or taking a noteworthy tumble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's look at the charts first. Trading SQ Stock  Click to EnlargeSQ stock has been on a very strong trajectory since its June lows. The stock has found itself in a solid uptrend channel (blue lines) and is making a series of higher lows. While it's hard to see because of channel support, the stock also reclaimed the 20-day moving average and is finding it as support as it pushes higher.Square stock also did a good job of bursting through prior downtrend resistance (purple line) in mid June. This was a troubling trend for SQ stock for most of 2019.However, the stock continues to butt its head up against the $82.50 to $83 level, (just as we suspected). This area has been significant over the past year, acting as support in September and resistance since Q4 2018. Can it push through now?If it can, SQ stock could run to channel resistance, and possibly overshoot it. That would take it to the $88 to $90 area. On the downside, I want to see if the 20-day can continue to buoy the name. It's relatively close, so if it can't, let's see if the 50% retracement near $75.50 can support SQ stock. Below and there's a confluence of moving average support near $70.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) hasn't had a great reaction to earnings so far. Let's see if SQ can buck that trend. Square Earnings PreviewAnalysts currently expect Square to earn 16 cents per share for its fiscal second-quarter results. Those estimates have been steady over the past few weeks, but are down ~16% from 19 cents per share 90 days ago. That's not really too surprising, given that expectations have largely come down across the board on Wall Street.After three straight earnings misses ending in mid-2016, Square has beat earnings estimates for 11 straight quarters. Should it report in-line results this time, it will represent 23% year-over-year growth. While that's a good result for most companies, it lacks compared to the company's overall growth this year.Consensus expectations call for 69% earnings growth next quarter, along with 61% overall growth for fiscal 2019. This translates to EPS of 16 cents in Q2 and EPS of 76 cents for 2019. In this regard, guidance will be key.On the revenue front, analysts expect sales of ~$557 million this quarter, up 44.5% year-over-year. For the year, estimates call for revenue $2.28 billion, representing a similar growth rate of 43.5%. Worth pointing out is that SQ stock has beat revenue estimates for at least 14 straight quarters. Bottom Line on Square StockThe company sports trailing free cash flow of $204 million. While that's still quite small for a company with a $34.5 billion market cap, the growth has been intense. For instance, the company's trailing free cash flow is up 188% over the past year. If this can continue to trend higher, along with sales and earnings, investors may very well continue to support SQ stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels If Square can continue to hold off its competitors and if the economy remains solid, then its underlying business should continue to do well. It's worth pointing out that the recent Q2 GDP report, as well as various earnings results -- such as those from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Visa (NYSE:V) -- have highlighted the strength of the consumer.That should bode well for SQ stock, although we'll find out soon enough.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Square Inc. is selling its Caviar food-delivery app to DoorDash Inc. for $410 million, as the money-losing payments company searches for profits.The sale was disclosed as part of Square’s quarterly financial report Thursday, which failed to impress investors. The stock fell as much as 9% in extended trading.The San Francisco-based company gave a third-quarter profit forecast of 18 cents to 20 cents a share, trailing the average analyst estimate of 22 cents. It said adjusted revenue in the period will be $590 million to $600 million, compared with estimates of $599.5 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Caviar deal is a boost for DoorDash, already the most popular food delivery app in the U.S. The privately held company, which counts SoftBank Group Corp. as a major backer, is valued at more than $12 billion. DoorDash recently faced an outcry over its handling of customers’ tips and said it would change the policy, which counts gratuity toward a driver’s base pay. A challenge it has yet to solve -- and one that eluded Square -- is finding a way to reliably turn a profit from food delivery.For Square, the sale frees up cash that can be spent on other areas. The company said it would shift investment to the cash register and online shopping business and to Cash App, a competitor of PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo. The payments app is on track to generate $500 million in revenue annually based on recent performance, Square said.The sale of Caviar “is about increasing our focus and investment in our two growing ecosystems,” Amrita Ahuja, the chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts following the report. The transaction is expected to close this year, and Square said it’ll update financial guidance after that. Ahuja said Caviar was the second-largest component of its subscription and services revenue, but also the biggest cost.Square said earnings per share for the second quarter jumped to 21 cents, exceeding estimates of 16 cents. They were 13 cents in the same period last year. Adjusted sales increased 46% to $563 million, also above estimates. But gross payment volume was $26.8 billion, missing estimates by $100 million.(Updates with CFO quote in the fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Square Sells Food Delivery App to DoorDash as It Chases Profit

2019-08-06,"After a day of complete debacle on Wall Street where the S&P 500 fell over 3% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 5%, it's hard to conceive that anyone would want to look at any stocks from the long side. But this is what we're doing today because there are quality stocks that got caught up in the headline trading. Specifically, fintech stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) were unfairly punished.Source: Shutterstock The banking sector as represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) fell -3% on Monday. In comparison, V stock fell 5%, MA stock fell about the same, and SQ stock almost 7%.These are proven winners that have business models that will survive the current headlines from the U.S. versus China economic war. So the selling was overdone.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe business of fintech stocks relies heavily on transactions being electronic. To that, this is an ongoing migration from paper to electronic. It is global and happening at an exponential rate. There are no signs of it reversing, so the transaction demand from these three companies will only increase for years to come.Barriers-to-entry are high so there are only a handful of competitors so MA, V and SQ stocks are the ones to bet on.In general, when the stock market falls the best practice is to sit back and do homework. The goal is to find stocks that have retraced the last rally and are now falling into support.Visa, MasterCard and Square stocks all fulfill this requirement and then some. Valuations in these growth stocks almost don't matter, but even here, there's some good news for the bulls.It is impossible to pin an actual bottom, especially because we continue to be in headlines trading mode. Investors are selling stocks indiscriminately and in panic after tweets from the White House or a press releases from the Chinese state media. So this is when homework falls hostage to headlines. But long term, the fundamentals will prevail.  * 7 Biotech ETFs That Should Remain Healthy While all three fintech stocks look good for a bounce trade, this doesn't eliminate the fact that they could still see lower lows in the next few days. The general stock market is still having a crisis of sentiment which usually punishes the good and the bad stocks alike. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Including the Monday drop, V stock fell a total of 10% from the recent highs. This constitute a full correction by Wall Street standards. Nevertheless this doesn't mean that it's a bottom. Year-to-date, Visa stock is still up 35% so there is plenty of fresh winnings to give back if the bears press the issue.However, I do like the technicals here which suggest that V has fallen into short-term support levels. These are more so zones than hard lines in the sand. Visa broke out to new highs from $165 in June and this dip merely revisits the neckline. Often, the bulls need to test the footing from which they broke out before they set higher highs.Albeit, this retest materialized too fast and too deep for this to be a clear bottom but it's worth a shot. Nevertheless, I think that in the long run, buying V stock at these levels should reward investors.   MasterCard (MA)Source: Shutterstock MA stock is in a similar boat as Visa. They trade in lockstep. And after setting highs recently, MasterCard stock also fell almost 5% on Monday. Valuations for both of these stocks are similar as they both trade near a 40 trailing price-to-earnings ratio.This is not cheap in absolute terms since it's about double that of Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But this has always been the case. These are growth stocks that are proven winners and I doubt that a few bad headline trading days will change that fact.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now MA stock also has fallen into its support band centered around $245 per share. This too is more of a zone than a hard line in the sand. And since they don't ring bells at bottoms it is impossible to take full positions in either of these two and be confident of short-term wins. But for the long term, I bet that owning MA at these levels will be profitable -- especially for patient investors. Square (SQ)Source: Shutterstock SQ stock is lagging our other two fintech stocks year-to-date. This last earnings report caused a bit of enthusiasm going into it. But sadly for the bulls the trade was to sell-the-news after buying the rumor.The SQ $83 per share remains a tough failure level to watch for the next big trigger long. But now it has fallen into support. Square stock has almost priced out the entire June rally so the bears have had their way with it. This brings price back into a pivot level. Those tend to be supportive because the bull and bears would want to fight it out hard again. This creates congestion and an opportunity for the SQ stock bulls to buy it and restart a rally.Fundamentally, SQ stock is the most expensive of the three fintech stocks from a P/E perspective since it still loses money. But it sells at nine times sales and that's half V or MA. Regardless, SQ is still the new kid on the block so it's supposed to spend more to grow into its valuation.Of the three fintech stocks, I consider going long V or MA a conviction buy trade versus SQ more of a speculative one.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Swedish payments and banking firm Klarna became the most valuable European fintech startup after new funding pushed its post-money valuation to $5.5 billion.Klarna reached that status after raising $460 million in an equity round that will help it “continue its rapid rise in the U.S. market where it is currently growing an annual rate of six million new U.S. consumers,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.With its new funding, the Stockholm-based startup leapfrogs European fintech darlings TransferWise and N26, which have recently been valued at $3.5 billion.Klarna helps online shoppers arrange financing at points of purchase, as well as provide merchants with payment tools. It challenges companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc., Square Inc. and Adyen NV, each of which has their own twist on facilitating commerce between sellers and shoppers.Dragoneer Investment Group led the raise, according to the statement. Other participants included the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, HMI Capital LLC, Merian Chrysalis Investment Co. and Sweden’s AP1 state pension fund, as well as accounts managed by BlackRock Inc.

2019-08-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Thiel-backed Valar Ventures led an $18.3 million financing round for a crypto-lending startup that plans to launch additional products including a crypto-rewards credit card.Other backers in BlockFi Inc.’s series A offering include billionaire Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Ventures LLC, Winklevoss Capital, ConsenSys Ventures and Akuna Capital, the crypto firm said Tuesday in a statement.BlockFi will use the cash to double the number of employees to 60 this year, build new products and enter additional markets beyond the U.S., founder and Chief Executive Officer Zac Prince said in a phone interview.“What’s very interesting about BlockFi is how they are bringing traditional financial services to this world,” said Andrew McCormack, Valar’s co-founder. “As the cryptocurrency markets evolve, you will start to see more and more companies that provide a lot of block-and-tackling that traditional bank or other market makers have provided in the fiat world for centuries.”Bitcoin BullThe crypto firm has seen monthly revenue grow more than 10-fold since January as Bitcoin prices rebounded and surged past $12,000 in June. The New York-based company expects annual revenue to hit eight figures by year-end, Prince said, without being more specific.Valar, one of three venture firms backed by Thiel, has invested in fintech businesses including Paris-based banking startup Qonto, millennial-focused credit-card issuer Petal, Berlin-based startup Number26 and TransferWise, a U.K.-based money-transfer service. BlockFi is Valar’s first cryptocurrency-related investment.Thiel has long been bullish on Bitcoin. His Founders Fund has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the cryptocurrency, according to a January report in the Wall Street Journal. The PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder and Facebook Inc. board member is worth more than $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.In March, BlockFi debuted a savings account that promises as much as 6.2% in annualized returns and has since gathered about $250 million in assets. The two-year-old company also offers crypto-backed loans, allowing clients to deposit a minimum of $20,000 in digital currency in exchange for fiat loans.The accounts are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and funds can be used by the lender for its own purposes. Monthly interest rates also are subject to change at BlockFi’s discretion, which happened in July, as the firm cut rates for accounts containing more than 10 Bitcoin.“Because it’s a new market, there’s not going to be the same levels of protection or development that exists in markets that are backed by the federal government,” Prince said. “Our job is to build these products, give individuals who want access to them an easy way to interact with them.”BlockFi received $50 million from Galaxy Digital last year to fund crypto-backed dollar loans.Read more: Crypto Diehards Turn to Interest-Bearing Accounts After MeltdownTo contact the reporter on this story: Jasmine Teng in New York at jteng50@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Thiel-Backed Valar Leads Finance Round for Crypto Startup

2019-08-14,"(Bloomberg) -- When Swedish banking firm Klarna became Europe’s most valuable financial technology startup last week, it was only the latest sign that digital finance has escaped the troubles afflicting legacy lenders.Its latest fundraising gave Klarna, which facilitates online installment payments, a $5.5 billion valuation. European fintech companies raised $3.3 billion in venture capital in the first half of 2019, up from $1.9 billion in the same period last year, according to data compiled by CB Insights. In contrast, an index of European Union banks has dropped 39% the past 18 months.“Investors are drawn to it because it’s the perfect blend of a huge, mature industry which, empowered by technology, can deliver vast returns, far in excess of what you see if you’re starting up out of nowhere,” said Ben Brabyn, chief executive officer of Level39, one of Europe’s largest fintech accelerators, in an interview.Here are a few other recent industry highlights and what to watch out for next.Fintechs Flout Brexit WorriesLondon fintechs defied the Brexit gloom that descended on the the U.K. Transferwise Ltd. announced a funding round in May that valued the eight-year-old company at $3.5 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2017. A few weeks later, online bank Monzo closed a new funding round doubling the startup’s valuation to more than $2.5 billion. Meantime, Revolut Ltd., while being eyed by regulators for possible compliance lapses, expanded into stock trading. They weren’t all winners: shares of peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle Ltd. have plunged 65% this year.IZettle’s Surprise PayPal SaleIt was the midnight deal that surprised many -- PayPal Holdings Inc. purchased iZettle AB for $2.2 billion in May 2018 the night before the Swedish startup had planned to price its shares in an initial public offering. Stockholm-based iZettle competes with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc., and Canada’s Shopify Inc.Adyen Soars After IPODutch payments processor Adyen NV hit headlines for two reasons last year. First, in February, it was announced the Netherlands-based firm would replace PayPal as EBay Inc.’s global checkout service. Then in June, it held a billion-dollar IPO and saw its shares surge 90% in the first day of trading. The company, whose clients include Netflix Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, is now valued at 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion)Worldpay’s $35.5 Billion DealAs one of the world’s biggest payments firms, Worldpay Inc. handles about $1 trillion annually -- similar to Chase Paymentech. When Fidelity National Information Services Inc. said on July 31 it’d completed its $35.5 billion acquisition of the company, data compiled by Bloomberg showed the combined business will be the world’s biggest in the processing and payments industry. It wasn’t a bad day for Ohio-based Worldpay, which less than two years earlier had been a British enterprise snapped up for 7.7 billion pounds ($9.3 billion) by U.S. merchant acquirer Vantiv.What’s Next?N26, the German mobile bank backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, announced in July it had extended its most recent fundraising round to $470 million, at a valuation of $3.5 billion. The company is expanding from Europe to the U.S., betting it can attract users from established lenders and credit card providers with free accounts, fewer fees and phone alerts.Other companies to watch include Revolut, which despite multiple run-ins with controversy remains exciting to investors after it held one of the biggest fundraising rounds for a European fintech last year, and app-based banks Monzo and Starling, which are attracting customers at a rapid clip.Further down the line is the U.K.’s online lender Zopa Ltd., which its CEO Jaidev Janardana said in July could potentially hold an IPO in 2021.“The valuations are encouraging but they’re not enough. They’re just an early indicator. The important numbers to watch are the customers,” said Brabyn. “We all need to step up to demonstrate the public value of what we do.”To contact the reporter on this story: Ali Ingersoll in London at aingersoll1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Nate Lanxon, James HertlingFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",European Fintechs Escape Troubles Afflicting Established Banks

2019-08-18,"(Bloomberg) -- A top long-only equity hedge fund is betting big on Internet dating.Helsinki-based HCP Focus, which has a slim portfolio of only 12 “high-conviction” stocks, has 16% of its funds invested in Tinder-operator Match Group Inc. The owner of subscription-based online dating websites and applications has risen 93% so far this year, with a surge in new Tinder subscribers boosting second-quarter revenue and fueling a record gain on August 7. HCP entered the stock at the beginning of 2017.“If you’re a heterosexual single guy, you don’t really care about the technical details,” Ernst Gronblom, portfolio manager at Helsinki Capital Partners, said by phone on Thursday. “When a dating platform has reached critical mass, it’s very, very hard to dislodge it. If a competing platform tries to enter the market, it’s very hard to convince people to create accounts on several dating platforms.”HCP Focus manages about 70 million euros ($78 million) and was the top long-only equity fund over the three years through the first quarter, according to BarclayHedge. It returned an average 22% a year in the past five years through July. Match is its biggest holding, followed by Amazon.com Inc., which has been one of the main holdings since the start of the fund.“It’s not overvalued,” he said. “But I don’t see an explosive upside in it anymore because it’s so huge. It has the potential to give a reasonably good return for quite some time.”Gronblom focuses on companies with network effects that can create “natural monopolies”. He also holds PayPal Holdings Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Facebook Inc., which has the strongest network effects “of any big company on the planet,” he said.Zeroing in on just 12 stocks is the “sweet spot” for Gronblom, giving enough diversification to keep volatility in check yet concentrated enough to give the full benefits of stock-picking, he said. That’s a strategy that has outperformed in recent years, but it faces risks in the short term from a global bear market.“Most of my portfolio companies are highly valued, at least according to traditional metrics,” he said. “If there’s a panic in the market these companies will typically suffer more severe losses than regular companies.“To contact the reporter on this story: Jonas Cho Walsgard in Oslo at jchowalsgard@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jonas Bergman at jbergman@bloomberg.net, Stephen TreloarFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Top Equity Hedge Fund Cashes In on Online Dating

2019-08-20,"Technological advances are disrupting plenty of industries. And if ever there was an industry ripe for disruption, it is financial services. Enter financial technology, or &quot;fintech.&quot; Along with healthcare innovation, fintech is arguably the most disruptive of the emerging themes encroaching on old school industries.A basic definition of fintech is computer programs or other technological components intersecting with old guard financial services, such as banking, lending and credit cards, but there's more to it.&quot;Today, fintech companies directly compete with banks in most areas of the financial sector to sell financial services and solutions to customers,&quot; according to Fintech Weekly. &quot;Mostly due to regulatory reasons and their internal structures, banks still struggle to keep up with fintech startups in terms of innovation speed. Fintechs have realized early that financial services of all kinds -- including money transfer, lending, investing, payments, … -- need to seamlessly integrate in the lives of the tech-savvy and sophisticated customers of today to stay relevant in a world where business and private life become increasingly digitalized.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, when you buy a fintech exchange-traded fund, there's a better chance you'll be embracing stocks such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) then you would be traditional banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On With that in mind, here are some of the best fintech ETFs to consider. Global X FinTech ETF (FINX)Expense ratio: 0.68%, or $68 annually per $10,000 invested.Just a few weeks shy of its third birthday, the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) has rapidly become one of the kings of the fintech ETF universe. Home to nearly $414 million in assets under management, FINX tracks the Indxx Global FinTech Thematic Index.This fintech ETF's components come from industries including insurance, investing, fundraising and third-party lending. The financial services sector is usually thought of as a value destination, but that is not the case with fintech ETFs. FINX trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.However, FINX warrants that rich multiple because it's up just under 30% year-to-date, which is more than double the returns of the S&P 500 Financial Services Index. Importantly, there are significant growth tailwinds bolstering the long-term case for this fintech ETF.&quot;Currently, FinTech represents just 6%, or approximately $675 billion, of the total global estimated annual revenue for the financial services industry,&quot; Global X said in a recent note. &quot;In addition, a recent Global X survey of consumer adoption of disruptive technologies revealed that just 11% of consumers indicated that they use mobile wallets on at least a weekly basis, compared to 84% use of credit cards.&quot; ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF)Expense ratio: 0.75%ARK Investment Management offers a focused lineup of actively managed ETFs (and some passive funds) that address high-growth market segments and many of the firm's products, though pricey, are among the best performers in their respective categories. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF), which launched in February, could be on its way to joining its stablemates as a star fund.One of the newest fintech ETFs, ARK already has $71 million in assets under management and it has been a decent performer until recently. With riskier assets being taken to task, this fintech ETF has dropped by over 6% in the last month. That could be a buying opportunity, not a reason to stay away. The top 10 holdings in ARKF include Square, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).Because it's actively managed, managers can apply more stringent criteria to defining and identifying fintech exposure.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall &quot;A company is deemed to be engaged in the theme of Fintech innovation if (i) it derives a significant portion of its revenue or market value from the theme of Fintech innovation, or (ii) it has stated its primary business to be in products and services focused on the theme of Fintech innovation,&quot; according to ARK's fund description for ARKF. Amplify CrowdBureau Peer-to-Peer Lending & Crowdfunding ETF (LEND)Expense ratio: 0.65%The Amplify CrowdBureau Peer-to-Peer Lending & Crowdfunding ETF (NYSEARCA:LEND) is another new addition to the fintech ETF fray, having debuted in May. As its name implies, this fintech ETF emphasizes crowdfunding, an expansive and growing segment of the fintech space.&quot;Crowdfunding is an umbrella term generally referring to the financing method, typically internet-based, by which capital is raised through the solicitation of small individual investments or contributions from a large number of persons, entities or institutions that lend money directly or indirectly to businesses or consumers,&quot; according to Amplify ETFs.LEND has recently struggled because of its hefty weight in China (45% of the fintech ETF's weight). That's a double-edged sword because China is home to its own rapidly growing, high-potential fintech market. Another thing to note with LEND is that it's a concentrated fintech ETF. The fund has 33 holdings, but just three combine for over half the fund's weight. ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY)Expense ratio: 0.75%The ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY) is the oldest of the fintech ETFs on the market today and the fund is aging nicely as highlighted by a year-to-date gain of more than 39%. Investors are taking note. IPAY now has nearly $830 million in assets under management thanks to year-to-date inflows of $361.1 million. IPAY holds 39 stocks and tracks the Prime Mobile Payments Index.&quot;The index provides a benchmark for investors interested in tracking the mobile and electronic payments industry, specifically focusing on credit card networks, payment infrastructure and software services, payment processing services, and payment solutions (such as smartcards, prepaid cards, virtual wallets),&quot; according to ETFMG.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul IPAY is a fintech ETF that's approachable to a broad swath of investors because not only does the fund feature growth stocks, it has some large-cap value exposure via names like Dow Jones Industrial Average components American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V). Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN)Expense ratio: 0.95%Blockchain technology is one of the bedrocks of the fintech movement and the Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (NYSEARCA:KOIN), though not a dedicated fintech ETF, is one of the more compelling blockchain funds on the market.&quot;… KOIN seeks to give investors access to companies that may benefit from a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way global trade is conducted, data is secured, supply chains are managed, financial instruments are cleared and contracts are recorded,&quot; Innovation Shares says in KOIN's fund description.There is an element of cryptocurrency with KOIN as the fund features exposure to companies that accept digital coins as payments as well as firms that make the tools and hardware to mine assets such as bitcoin. KOIN's other categories are solutions providers (blockchain services providers) and adopters.KOIN's top 10 holdings including Nvidia, Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN)Expense ratio: 0.5%The Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (NASDAQ:MILN) doesn't jump off the screen and scream &quot;fintech ETF,&quot; but this demographically focused fund is in the fintech space, particularly because millennials are driving adoption of mobile payments and other elements of a cash-free society.&quot;Millennials' adoption of technology has penetrated their finances,&quot; Global X's Pedro Palandrani wrote. &quot;Their mobile devices have become their credit card, their wallet, and their overall bank. Take Venmo, PayPal's mobile payment service, which is a platform that has struck a chord with Millennials by allowing them to digitally send money and make purchases. 75% of Millennials have used online or mobile payments compared to only 51% for Boomers.&quot;  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The fund holds 81 stocks of which about five can be considered dedicated fintech plays. Another 10 or so can be viewed as secondary fintech names. SoFi Gig Economy ETF (GIGE)Expense ratio: 0.59%The SoFi Gig Economy ETF (NASDAQ:GIGE) is another actively managed fund with fintech exposure and a newer one at that, having debuted in May like LEND.&quot;… the Gig Economy reflects a transformational change in how many businesses interact with customers, and the Gig Economy theme provides exposure to a trend or developing business model through the compilation of securities from multiple sectors and geographies,&quot; wrote  ETF Trends's Max Chen.Obviously, GIGE is not a dedicated fintech ETF. But because it is exposed to the gig economy's consumption end, the fund features exposure to the payment end as well. This translates to some fintech leverage.About half a dozen of GIGE's holdings are dedicated fintech names and roughly the same amount are larger companies with some form of mobile payment or mobile wallet business. While GIGE has struggled this month (down almost 7%), there is long-term value in the fund's mix of fintech and online retail names.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-20,"Investors have dumped shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) since the last earnings report. And it's only going to get worse. SQ stock is in a sharp downward trend that shows no sign of letting up. All told, there's a good case for Square stock heading back to the lows around $50 a share.Source: Shutterstock The company's last earnings report was far from good. The company offered specific developments, such as the sale of Caviar to Doordash for modest consideration that really hurt Square's long-term growth narrative. And there's a lot more to be nervous about with SQ stock right now. Let's dive into the reasons why SQ stock is still a sell right now. Is Cash App Really Doing That Great?Cash App pulled in $260 million in revenue in last quarter with a rapid growth rate. At first blush, that sounds fantastic. But there's less here than meets the eye.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Major Headlines Mean Opportunities for Smart Investors For one thing, right around half of that revenue came from Bitcoin transactions. Get rid of that, and Cash App's revenues are down to $135 million for the quarter. Who knows where Bitcoin and crypto will go from here. Maybe the recent recovery is real. Maybe not. Anyone that bet on bitcoin or crypto stocks in late 2017 got clobbered the next year. Don't bet the farm on SQ stock hoping Bitcoin revenues continue to surge.Meanwhile, the more durable main source of Cash App revenue appears to be its instant deposit feature. This, like Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), allows vendors to access their cash instantly for a small fee. However, this is quite uneconomic for larger users and thus is unlikely to be a major revenue growth stream forever. Also, the Fed's new real-time payment system may reduce the need for Square's service here. A Bank License May Not Be So GreatThere's also the matter that Square is still trying to get a banking license. It was previously unsuccessful but has made another attempt at regulatory approval.SQ stock bulls point to a banking license as a major catalyst that could shoot the stock back up toward last year's highs. In theory, Square as a bank could add a lot of value for its customers.But taking on the role of a bank adds a lot of headaches and red tape as well. You have to worry about compliance, capital reserves, and all the other stresses of post-financial crisis era banking. In addition, customers that currently pay for services such as instant deposit are going to expect a lower fee experience if they bank with Square as well.On top of all that, are the people bullish on Square as a bank looking at the same financial markets that the rest of us are?The big banking shares like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are performing quite poorly in the market this year. Goldman Sachs, in particular, with all its customer-focused new innovations such as the Apple Card is getting no respect at all. If the market is petrified of interest rates and recession risk for banks, why is it going to give Square stock huge credit for entering this out-of-favor industry? Square Stock Is Really ExpensiveA big issue for SQ stock going forward is that the company still makes hardly any money. In the past, this was easier to explain because the company was purportedly investing heavily in loss-making growth operations like Caviar that would pay off in spades later. But Caviar didn't. And with Square shedding its money-losing operations, in theory, it should look a lot more profitable going forward.And yet, it's not. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to come in around $400 million for this year. Given Square's market cap, this means investors are paying in the neighborhood of 70x EBITDA for this business. That's absolutely absurd. You can justify 20 or 25x for a fast-growing tech company with good cash flows. Square isn't that fast-growing, especially without Caviar, and its operational profile isn't that amazing either.In fact, Square should probably trade at a discount to tech peers due to the credit exposure and recession risk (since its client base is primarily smaller businesses). Instead, the market is pricing SQ stock as though it were as good as the hottest of the cloud software companies. Unless Square's business performs exceptionally well going forward, people are going to get burned here in a major way. SQ Stock VerdictI know Square stock is down a lot, and you might want to buy the dip. But there are better tech plays at this time. SQ stock was profoundly overvalued before; a 25% drop has hardly fixed the valuation issue.

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is planning to shut down its Chase Pay app in the bank’s third reversal on digital offerings in three months.The company started informing customers Wednesday that they’ll no longer be able to use the product to pay with their smartphones when shopping in stores starting early next year, according to an email seen by Bloomberg. They’ll still be able to use Chase Pay on the websites and apps of retailers that accept it.It’s an about-face on a product introduced four years ago to compete with rivals such as Apple Inc. that are working to transform how consumers pay for products and services. New technologies have spurred a revolution in mobile payments, with Chinese companies leading the way in helping consumers bypass credit and debit cards. The U.S. market has been slower to develop.“When we started this, it was four years ago -- the payment space has changed a lot over the period of time and customer behavior has changed,” Eric Connolly, head of Chase Pay, said in an interview. “A lot of merchants have shifted to ‘buy online, pick up in store’ and have invested in their online presence and their apps.”The bank says it wants to capture a larger share of a market long dominated by PayPal Holdings Inc., whose digital wallet was accepted by about 70% of online merchants at the end of the second quarter. Fewer than 1% accepted JPMorgan’s, according to a study by industry publication PYMNTS.com.Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to say how many online retailers currently accept Chase Pay, adding that the bank expects that number to increase. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said that GrubHub Inc. will soon accept it.Shares of the bank, which have climbed 11% this year, advanced 0.8% to $108.16 at 9:33 a.m. in New York.Finn, On DeckJPMorgan has shown a greater willingness than rivals to cut bait on unsuccessful projects as it spends more than $11 billion on technology initiatives designed in part to position the bank to stay ahead of changes in how consumers spend money.Some of the bank’s other digital experiments have failed to take hold. In June, it shut down digital bank Finn a year after rolling out the brand nationally. A month later, it cut ties with fintech company On Deck, whose technology platform it had used to originate online small-business loans.JPMorgan has been testing other technologies to lure consumers to spend more on its cards. It has been adding tap-to-pay technology to its cards and joined with Cardlytics Inc. to offer coupons for select merchants inside its mobile app. In February, it unveiled a prototype cryptocurrency, dubbed JPM Coin, that it plans to use to speed up payments between companies.(Updates with JPMorgan’s digital experiments starting in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Michelle F.

2019-08-22,"Over the past decade, Square (NYSE:SQ), the financial services and mobile-payments company, has been a fast-growth industry disruptor. From its humble beginnings when it offered a simple way for small vendors to accept credit cards, SQ has now become one of the biggest financial technology (fintech) companies in the world. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected this growth.Source: Shutterstock However, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its second-quarter earnings report in August. The current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants.And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square's revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also go down further. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer below $60, especially if it approaches $50.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's what investors should know before buying into SQ stock. How Square's Q2 Earnings CameSquare reported earnings on August 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues.  Its revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share.Square's subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with the Cash App whose quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Square management projected higher-than-expected losses on the bottom line. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $64. Square Is Not Yet ProfitableSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). This innovative financial services company has expanded quickly, with its unique dongles for mobile phones that enable virtually everyone to accept credit-card payments.The global payments industry is a $100 trillion-plus market. While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock.For example, during the earnings release, Square announced the surprising sale of its Caviar foodservice platform to DoorDash. Some believe this exit is premature, considering the evenue potential. On the other hand, others believe that this sale enables Square to leave a low-margin business where competition is fierce.Square is now able to partner with DoorDash which has a much larger platform. In other words, it can further integrate its payment processing system to other foodservice platforms. Nonetheless, analysts agree that the surprise factor Caviar's sale has raised eyebrows.Finally, the expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global- payments giant. Technical Charts for SQ Stock Paint a Mixed PictureLet us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has not been a good month for shares. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $60 and $70.Further, SQ stock has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology sector or the fintech sector specifically, then shares may easily go below $60.Plus, the daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-26,"Just two months ago, with a great deal of hype and fanfare, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his company’s latest project: the Libra Association, a blockchain cryptocurrency initiative backed by a variety of well-heeled corporations – including Facebook (FB), private venture capital firms, and major players in payment processing, such as Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) – and linked to a basket of traditional fiat currencies as a hedge against the extreme volatility of the “pure” cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Facebook being involved, the controversy did not take long to erupt.The main concerns, at first, centered around user privacy issues. Facebook has a notoriously poor reputation in this area, and went to great lengths to address possible concerns. The new Libra crypto coin will be administered by the Libra Association, not by Facebook directly. The Association is grouping of Libra’s backers, each of which gets an equal voice in overseeing the currency. The Libra Association members each put the same $10 million investment into the common pot backing the currency, so no one member can claim a larger share than the others. On paper, it’s appears to be a good system. The Governments Get into the GameIt didn’t take long for government watchdogs to start sniffing around Libra project. As early as June 18, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire spoke against Libra, saying “Libra must not become a sovereign currency.” In the EU Parliament, a German member agreed, and added that Facebook and other private companies cannot be allowed “to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies. A month later, the US House of Representatives had David Marcus, Facebook’s head of cyrpotcurrency, before the Financial Services Committee. During the testimony, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) said, “The creation of a new currency is a core government function and should be left to democratically accountable institutions, that are accountable to the American people.” She added that if Facebook does go through with the Libra launch next year, it should start with a small pilot program under SEC and Federal Reserve supervision.Now the European Commission is starting to investigate Libra. In a circular sent out to the 28 members of the Libra Association last week, the antitrust regulators said, “The Commission is in particular concerned about the possible competition restrictions that may result from the Association, especially with regard to information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data.” The questionnaire requests follow-up within two to three weeks.The new regulatory interest from the EU may have spooked some members of the Libra Association; anonymous reports are circulating that at least three of Libra’s original backers have discussed leaving the group. The reports add that the nervous investors are expressing concern over the effect that regulatory probes into Libra will have on their core businesses. A Careful LaunchFor its part, Facebook – and its partners – are approaching the Libra project with caution. David Marcus has already said that the new crypto coin will undergo “the most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight in financial tech history.” Libra won’t launch until the middle of next year, and while a charter is not yet public, Marcus’ statement makes clear that Libra’s rules are being drawn up in the sure knowledge that they will face close regulatory scrutiny.That’s the background, and the current state of Facebook’s Libra project. So far, indications are that the blockchain project is going ahead; the regulatory interest has the backers cautious, but none have yet dropped out. So, let’s take a closer look at some of those backers, and their stock performance.  Facebook, Inc. (FB)The main issue with Facebook, as it has been for a long time, is user privacy. The company’s reputation in this area is justly poor. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the exposure of users’ private photos, 2018 was the year of data breaches for the social media giant. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg publicly admitted Facebook’s failings in privacy protection. Just two weeks later, added insult to irony, the company disclosed that up to 600 million user passwords, across its apps, had been stored in plaintext. This past spring, Facebook was hit by the Federal Trade Commission with a record-setting $5 billion fine in response to the privacy problems.Starting in July of last year, the predictable happened and Facebook’s stock started losing heavily. It bottomed out on December 24 and has since regained its losses, and then some. In the past month, FB shares have slipped 13%. With all of that, the company remains popular with top analysts.SunTrust’s 5-star analyst Youssef Squali, in an August 20 note, agreed that FB has upbeat prospects. Noting that the company has a long way to go on privacy protection – he wrote, “We note that the data is not deleted and remains on FB’s servers for a length of time that’s unclear to us. This means the data could still be used to report back to an advertiser if a user has purchased a product after viewing the ad, which appears to fall somewhat short of the original pledge by CEO Zuckerberg of empowering users to flush their history whenever they want…” – Squali still set a price target of $236, suggesting an upside of 32%.Overall, Facebook has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 33 buy ratings and 3 holds given in the past three months. FB shares are trading for $177, and the $234 average price target indicates a 32% upside. Mastercard, Inc. (MA)Mastercard is an original member of the Libra Association, and in addition to the membership fee, it brings its payment processing network and long experience in the financial industry. In all of the recent regulatory dust-up around Libra, Mastercard’s only official statement was not to comment on the matter. Fortunately for customers, Mastercard has a far better reputation than Facebook when it comes to data protection.As an investment, MA has offered excellent returns for a long time. The stock is up 44% year-to-date, more than triple the S&P 500’s gain. The stock’s dividend is reliable, and while only yielding 0.49%, the stock’s high trading value makes the annual payout $1.32 per share.Underscoring MA’s inherent value to investors, Nomura analyst Bill Carache said after the company’s recent quarterly report, “Another solid quarter, fueled by better than expected volume growth, new partnership signings, and progress across its growth initiatives. We believe the company can continue to generate mid-teens compound annual earnings growth.” In line with this, he set a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target by 15%, to $324. His new PT suggests a 19% upside.Mastercard also holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 14 buy ratings a single hold in the last 90 days. Shares are selling for $271, so the $309 average price target implies 13% upside potential. Visa, Inc. (V)The larger of the two major credit card issuers and payment processers, Visa is very similar to Mastercard as an investment. The company is solid, having shown steady returns over an extended timeframe. It offers a low-yield dividend of 0.57%, but the share price boosts the dividend payment to a full $1 annualized. Visa’s fiscal Q3 results beat the forecasts last month, and suggest that the company will just keep chugging along with steady low- to mid-teens growth rates. Like Mastercard, Visa has not commented on the regulatory agencies’ interest in Libra.Nomura’s Bill Careche is as upbeat on Visa as he was on Mastercard. He says Visa is “…uniquely positioned to sustain mid-teens annual earnings growth against an uncertain macro backdrop.” Careche’s $204 target on V implies an upside of 16%.Visa’s analyst consensus rating is another Strong Buy, this one based on 18 buys and 1 hold. With shares selling at $175, and an average price target of $201, the stock has an upside potential of 15%. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)The last stock we are looking at here is the leader in the online payment processing space. PayPal has been operating independently since 2015, and has shown consistent stock gains since then. Shares are up 26% year-to-date, despite a slip at the end of July.PayPal’s involvement in Libra makes eminent sense. The company’s proven expertise in payment processing and online finance are highly relevant to the Libra Association, and unlike Facebook, PayPal has not been plagued by data privacy issues. And like Mastercard and Visa, PayPal is a high-quality investment-grade stock.Kenneth Hill, from Rosenblatt Securities, would agree. He initiated coverage with a Buy rating and said, “Look past the recent tumble in PayPal Holdings stock, and the longer-term outlook for the firm looks as healthy as ever.” PayPal’s Strong Buy consensus rating is a measure of that long-term health. The stock has 18 buys and 2 holds given in the past three months, and a share price of $106. The average price target of $130 suggests a robust upside of 22%.Visit TipRanks’ Trending Stocks page to find out what investments are hot with Wall Street’s top analysts.",Will Facebook Libra Survive Regulatory Scrutiny?

2019-08-27,"There aren't many growth stocks in this market that look reasonably valued, but Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has become one of them. Square stock isn't cheap, to be sure, but with a 24% decline since earnings at the beginning of this month it's certainly cheaper than it's been.Source: Shutterstock There are risks. I've long been skeptical (in fact too skeptical) toward Square stock. It remains to be seen how the likes of SQ, rival PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) will perform in a recession.And, again, SQ stock isn't cheap, as it currently trades at 56x 2020 consensus EPS estimates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, in a market where growth stocks have defied gravity for years, SQ seems oddly weighed down. Q2 earnings look fine as far as they go, and the company's Cash App is seeing increasing adoption. The risks here can't be ignored, but for growth investors in particular SQ stock seems worth those risks. SQ Stock Sells Off After EarningsEven looking closely, it's not clear why Square sold off so sharply after second-quarter earnings. The obvious culprit is its third-quarter guidance. Square expects an adjusted EPS of $0.18-$0.20, against pre-earnings consensus estimates of $0.22.&#92;  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects But one might think that investors would have figured out that Square guides conservatively. The company hasn't missed even analyst estimates since 2016. As I noted before earnings, the same pattern played out in the two previous quarters as well: Square beat estimates, Square fell on disappointing guidance, and then SQ stock eventually rallied.That pattern may well repeat, because for the most part the quarter looks solid. Full-year guidance was reiterated, which might disappoint investors looking for a raise. But expectations aside, Square did what it should have.Revenue increased 44% year-over-year, with adjusted revenue up 46%. Expenses did rise almost in tandem with revenue, but modest leverage and a small increase in gross margin led Adjusted EBITDA to climb 54%.This is a good quarter in terms of growth. Q3 guidance is solid, too: at the midpoint, revenue would increase 38% year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA margins will improve more than they did in the second quarter. There's not a lot in the actual numbers for investors to dislike - and focusing on guidance seems to ignore Square's own history. Cash App GrowthBeyond the headline numbers, Square also disclosed strong figures surrounding its Cash App. Excluding bitcoin revenue (which was $100 million-plus, interestingly) Cash App added $135 million to Square's top line in the quarter.That's a $540 million annual run rate - which appears far higher than the ~$300 million run rate PayPal disclosed for Venmo after Q1. Meanwhile, an analyst noted last week that Cash App downloads are accelerating. The gap between Cash App and Venmo downloads is now the largest ever.Cash App is a big potential driver for Square stock. The increased disclosure and strong growth should be a positive. The Key Factor for Square StockThere simply aren't that many stocks in the market trading at even 56x forward EPS while growing revenue 35%+. Admittedly, that may say more about the market, particularly in tech. But at least on a relative basis, SQ stock looks reasonably attractive.Indeed, would an investor rather pay 59x forward earnings for Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), whose sales should increase ~25% next year? Or 49x for Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), with consistent low-20s growth?From that standpoint, Square stock seems undervalued. But there's a catch: margins. There's a real concern that Square margins aren't going to be all that high, given lower gross profit in payments. Cash App, too, has real questions in terms of profitability.It's those margin worries that likely explain the reaction to Q3 guidance. Investors are looking for significant leverage and margin expansion. So far, it hasn't arrived. And the obvious worry is that it never will.But those worries seem potentially overwrought. Guidance does project margin expansion. Analysts, anyway, see a big year on that front in 2020.Square still has room to expand in high-volume customers, and a move into Canada perhaps sets up international expansion down the line.

2019-08-28,"Since late July, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a funk. Consider that shares have dropped from $82 to $63 in less than 30 days. In fact, for the past 12 months, the return is a miserable loss of 20%.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com This is certainly in stark contrast to 2016 to late 2018, when SQ stock was mostly in the bull phase. Interestingly enough, mature operators like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have done much better during the past year.Now the recent drop could easily be temporary. After all, Square remains a top player in the lucrative fintech category, which is a $100-plus trillion market opportunity.  So yes, there is lots of room for plenty of players.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSQ has also been adept at expanding on its core payments platform. The company has expanded into areas like payroll, gift cards, loyalty programs, marketing services, e-commerce, business loans and so on. More importantly, Square has been effective in monetizing these services. During the latest quarter, subscription and service revenues spiked by 87% to $251 million.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow All great, right? Yes, this is true. But I still think investors should be cautious. There are actually some nagging issues that could easily weigh on SQ stock. The Problems with Square StockTake a look at the Cash App. On the face of it, it looks like a solid business, with revenues of $260 million in the quarter. But if you look deeper, you'll notice that a hefty $135 million came from bitcoin activities.No doubt, this segment can be highly volatile. It's not uncommon to see major swings in the value of bitcoin. So, if there is another drop, it could make it tough for SQ to hit its growth targets.In the meantime, the competition in the fintech market is getting more intense. Venture capitalists continue to pour billions into fast-growing startups, presenting potential challenges to Square stock.But there has also been innovation from traditional players like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), Capital One (NYSE:COF), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC), US Bank (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).Keep in mind that these companies are the backers of Zelle, which is a successful person-to-person payments app. It has certainly benefited from the substantial financial resources, technical talent and vast distribution.Yet I think the biggest risk factor for SQ stock is a potential recession. Granted, the U.S. economy has proven to be resilient. But there are more and more ominous signs. These include the fall off in real estate and manufacturing as well as the inversion of the yield curve.If a recession hits - or there is a notable slowdown - the impact on Square stock could be particularly severe. The company's main user base is small businesses, which are the most vulnerable.Square even included this in its 10-K:Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. Bottom Line on SQ StockEven with the fall in SQ stock, the valuation is far from cheap. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is about 56 times.True, the growth rate has continued to be strong. During the second quarter, revenue spiked by 46% to $563 million.But again, this growth could easily decelerate if the economy stumbles. If anything, the latest fall in SQ stock is an indication of how sensitive Wall Street is. So even a small change could have an adverse impact.So for now, it's probably better to hold off and wait for a better valuation.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-29,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the high-tech provider of financial services, mobile payments and merchant services, has yet to see a recovery nearly a month after Q2 earnings caused SQ stock to tank. After dropping 14% in one day, Square stock continued its decline and has sputtered through August. SQ closed at $62.15 on Wednesday, eking out a 0.65% gain on the day, but it's still down 23% since closing at $80.98 on Aug. 1 -- hours before the company delivered those Q2 earnings numbers.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The question many investors are asking is whether the performance of SQ through August means there is upside to the stock. Given the potential for growth and the fact that even at $80.98, Square stock was trading below its 2019 high of $82.28 and well below the $99.01 it hit last fall, it does seem that Square is currently a bargain. The Market Really Didn't Like Square's Q2 EarningsAfter the markets closed on Aug. 1, Square reported its Q2 earnings. The reaction was immediate, and it was ugly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdjusted revenue of $563 million and adjusted EPS of 21 cents both beat analyst expectations, but its net loss of $7 million (up from $6 million the previous year) was wider than expected, and the company issued guidance for weaker-than-expected Q3 earnings. Square also announced it was unloading its Caviar food delivery business, selling to DoorDash for $410 million so it can focus on its core businesses.SQ stock closed on Aug. 1 at $80.98, dropped to $69.60 the next day and bottomed out at $61.55 two weeks later. Here we are at the end of August and SQ is at $62.15, a long way from recovery territory.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  Other Issues Weighing on SQMarket reaction to Square's Q2 earnings report isn't the only thing that may be weighing on investors. The company faces stiff competition on all fronts. PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo peer-to-peer payment app has 40 million users and processed $24 billion in payment volume during that company's second quarter. In comparison, Square's payment volume for all of its services combined in Q2 was $26.8 billion. Meanwhile, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) launched an initiative earlier this year to take on Square directly with its own line of retail payment processing hardware for brick and mortar stores.Then there's the China factor. Square doesn't do business in China and any impact on the cost of its hardware production is expected to be minimal. However, as the trade war with China escalates, it is raising concerns about the potential impact on the U.S. economy and consumer spending as products become more expensive. If consumers cut down on their spending as a result, that will have a negative impact on SQ's payment processing business. Q1 Earnings Response May Model What Happens for SQ StockIf you look back to Square's Q1 earnings, the market reaction was remarkably similar. SQ beat analyst expectations for revenue and EPS when it reported Q1 earnings on May 1. However a wider net loss and guidance that suggested a continued decline in growth resulted in Square stock immediately dropping 8%, and by mid-May it was off 15%. Sound familiar? SQ sputtered through the rest of the month and didn't start to fully recover until early June. However, once investors gained confidence (or put the Q1 earnings report behind them) SQ stock was on a roll, climbing nearly 36% to hit $82.28 on July 12.  * 7 Things to Know About the History of Overstock and Patrick Byrne There's nothing to say that Square stock will follow the same pattern this time around, but for those on the fence about a recovery, it shows recent precedent. Bottom Line for Square StockAugust has been a tough month for Square stock. However, despite the challenges the company faces, odds are good that the negative reaction to those Q2 numbers will fade. If you have been considering an investment in SQ, that makes the current price attractive. Of the 29 analysts polled by Nasdaq, 12 have SQ stock rated as a Strong Buy (only one has it as a Sell) with a 12-month price target of $83.50, suggesting there is significant upside with the post-Q2 earnings recovery currently stalled.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Stripe Inc. became one of the most valuable financial-technology startups by helping businesses accept online payments. Now it’s getting into lending.The San Francisco-based company launched Stripe Capital on Thursday. The service will start in the U.S. and will make loans to businesses that are already Stripe customers, as well as merchants selling on services like Shopify that use Stripe to process payments. Stripe will use the data it has on customers to help determine loan eligibility and terms. The first target market will be smaller businesses that use Stripe, rather than larger customers, such as Amazon.com Inc., that already have access to cash.Stripe Capital will start out by focusing on loans of about $10,000 to $20,000, according to Stripe Co-Founder John Collison. Much like Jack Dorsey’s payments firm Square Inc., which has its own lending service called Square Capital, Stripe has access to a wide swath of data on its customers. “We can constantly be looking at the businesses on Stripe, their cash flow, how they are growing, and who can be productively underwritten for a loan,’’ Collison said.Tech companies have become an increasingly popular lending source in recent years. After the 2008 financial crisis, traditional banks pulled back on small business loans, prompting many companies to look elsewhere for capital. Almost a third of loan applicants turned to online lenders in 2018, up from 24% in 2017 and 19% in 2016, according to a Federal Reserve survey.As the industry has become more digital, PayPal Holdings Inc., Square and even Amazon have introduced small business lending programs, as have a slew of startups including SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Kabbage Inc. and public company OnDeck Capital Inc.Though lending poses risks, Stripe, much like other payment services, says the extra data it has on customers will give it a better idea of whether borrowers can repay loans. The company believes that edge will protect it from significant losses during an economic downturn.“Lending is fundamentally a business that performs very differently based on where we are in the business cycle,” Collison said. “We’re doing as much as we can at the current point with models based on data that we can get from business performance and how small businesses performed in the financial crisis.’’ He added that the product was built with the possibility of an economic shock in mind, and that the company plans to be  “appropriately cautious.’’To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Fintech Startup Stripe Will Lend Money to Customers
2019-09-05,"Markets have been so volatile this summer on U.S.-China trade tensions that investors might not have noticed: Tech stocks are absolutely red-hot in 2019.Indeed, the technology sector of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is leading the broader market by a mile this year, with a year-to-date gain of 29% through Aug. 21. By comparison, the S&P; 500 is up about 17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 21%. (The second-best performing sector is real estate, up 25%.)Stellar gains are always welcome, but they do pose a challenge for investors. After such a big run-up, is there anything left worth buying at current levels?Analysts sure think so. Between momentum and the sector's outsize growth prospects, plenty of tech stocks have nowhere near topped out, they say.To see which picks analysts like best at this point, we screened the Nasdaq Composite for the top-rated small, midsize and large tech stocks. S&P; Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' ratings on stocks and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the better.Here are the 12 tech stocks the analysts love right now.

2019-09-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Michael Novogratz is a step closer toward his vision of making Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. the Goldman Sachs of cryptocurrencies.The former macro manager’s self-styled merchant bank noted its approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to underwrite registered public offerings of securities in a filing last week. The New York-based firm is also looking at shepherding security token offerings -- effectively, digitized IPOs.“It’s a really young industry, and we are a pretty young business,” Novogratz said in a phone interview. “We are sober and patient about how fast it will grow, and we are well capitalized. This feels like a perfect addition.”Galaxy already invests in start-ups and coins, and helps companies secure funding for everything from early- to later-stage rounds. Galaxy managed $390 million in assets as of July 31.Novogratz, 54, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who spent more than a decade at the New York-based bank. He later became a principal at Fortress Investment Group LLC and managed the Fortress Macro Fund before it was liquidated in 2015. He launched Galaxy in January 2018 during the height of the crypto bubble.The company’s advisory business is headed by Ian Taylor, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 18 years before joining Galaxy in December. The Australia native is now leading a team of eight -- up from three employees in December -- with backgrounds in investment banking, consulting and structured finance.Business could take several years to ramp up, but there are plenty of hopeful signs that IPO demand could be coming: A number of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Inc. have raised money at valuations in the billions, and companies like mining hardware giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd. are already planning IPOs. Many major exchanges, mining and chip businesses are generating real revenue and profits.“The business that we are building on the advisory side is a long-term, relationship-based business,” Taylor said. “In time that will pay dividends as financing and strategic advisory opportunities arise.”Galaxy is already working on finding financing for a Bitcoin mining data center to be located in the U.S., for example, Taylor said.Mergers-and-acquisitions advising could be poised to take off as well. Traditional companies like card network Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have joined the Libra Association, a Facebook Inc.-led effort to issue a new digital coin for payments -- and such companies may look to acquire crypto businesses at some point as well. Due to political and regulatory scrutiny, Novogratz pegs Libra’s chances of launching next year at 50%.“Ultimately, we want to be a big part of the crypto ecosystem, and if they are there we want to be a big part of that,” Novogratz said, adding that he is also investing in and advising alternative platforms that would allow for Libra-like coins.Eventually, Galaxy also wants to issue tokens that could connect to or represent ownership of many valuable objects and revenue streams, Novogratz said.“The key here is regulators have been a little slower than we want them to be, but I think they are heading in the right direction,” Novogratz said. “There are a lot of interesting projects, but nothing has happened yet on the ’tokenization of everything’ front.”While some traditional investment banks could join the fray by that time, Novogratz hopes to enjoy a first-mover advantage -- and an advantage of someone focused on crypto from day one.“The traditional banks don’t have the DNA that they really need to understand the crypto community yet,” Novogratz said. “Our edge over time is that we are going to see more projects and get an understanding of what works and what doesn’t.”&#92;--With assistance from Ben Bain.To contact the reporter on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Plans Push Into Crypto Underwriting

2019-09-09,"Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has been a multi-year juggernaut. However, it hasn't fared all that well over the past 12 months. SQ stock is actually down 27% in the past year. That badly lags the S&P 500, which is up 3% in the same time.While Square stock is up 13% year-to-date, it also lags the S&P 500's gain of almost 19%. That's a bit frustrating for shareholders, although those that have been holding SQ stock for a few years surely don't have much to complain about. The stock still boast three-year gains of more than 425%.Still, it leaves many wondering what's next for this stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Stock to $100?On September 3rd, analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey upgraded Square stock to buy from hold and assigned an $80 price target. At the time, it represented about 30% upside. The call came on the same day that analysts at Atlantic Equities hit SQ stock with a sell-equivalent rating and $55 price target, implying about 8% downside.  * 7 Triple Threat Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Term Just given those two perspectives -- shares at ~$60 with price targets for $55 and $80 -- it seems like a reasonable risk/reward. But then on September 6th came a strong call. KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck rated Square stock with an overweight rating. More notably though, he assigned a $100 price target to SQ stock, implying more than 60% upside from current levels near $63.Beck argues that, &quot;Square's Cash App is in a transition period as instant deposit mixes down and Cash Card adoption begins to scale.&quot; Beck adds that, &quot;he does not foresee any substantial regulatory obstacle and believe Cash App revenue could scale to $2B in the next three years and be worth $50 a share.&quot;Beck's $100 price target is just shy of the stock's all-time high up at $101.15. Can it get there? Trading SQ StockSQ stock continues to bob along its 100-week moving average and the $60 level. $60 has been a significant level over the past two years, but has been of even more importance over the past few months. Should it fail as support, it also means the 200-week moving average failed as support.This would be a notable development, and while $55 could buoy the name, even more downside could be possible. Specifically, $50 stands out rather notably. In 2017 it marked the high and almost a year later, it marked a significant low.If it gets there again, it will no doubt draw in buyers who are looking for another strong, multi-month bounce. Investors may also notice short-term downtrend resistance (blue line) currently squeezing SQ stock lower.So what now?To get some upside momentum, SQ stock need to push over downtrend resistance. Climbing to $65 should do the trick, and could trigger a move up to $70. There it will find the 50-week moving average, as well as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Over that and SQ stock can start working on its climb to $78+.Below $60 and I will be waiting to see where Square stock finds support. If it gets down to $50, it will be a worthwhile long from a risk/reward perspective. Bottom Line on SquareSo what's the deal here with Square? We're talking about a high-growth company that's not seeing its stock price act in kind. Estimates still call for 43% revenue growth this year and another 34% growth in 2020. That goes alongside estimates for 64% earnings growth in 2019 and 44% growth next year.At current prices, SQ stock trades at roughly 11.5 times this year's revenue figure. For some perspective, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) trades at ~7.3 times this year's revenue estimates. However, expectations call for growth of &quot;just&quot; 15% this year and an acceleration to 18% in 2020. On the earnings front, estimates call for 30% growth in 2019, but just 12% growth next year.In other words, Square stock is growing into its once super-lofty valuation. Not that it's &quot;cheap&quot; necessarily, but compared to its valuation when it was at $100 a year ago, it's much more palatable at today's levels.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Will it get back to $100? Probably at some point. But let's go one step at a time and use the technicals to help us time an entry. Watch for a break out over $65 or break down below $60.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-09-10,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) hit a home run when the company announced its dating feature in the U.S. markets. Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) will no longer enjoy the absence of competition in the online dating market. Facebook has a huge user base and now has the chance to leverage Instagram alongside Facebook and the Facebook Dating app.Facebook will help its billions of users find a match based on common interests in events, groups, and hobbies. It will even integrate Instagram so that users may include such posts on their Facebook dating profile. The &quot;Secret Crush&quot; lists allow users to add both their Instagram followers and their friends. By the end of the year, users may add Instagram Stories. Dating Faces Safety ConcernsAfter the data leak, users might express skepticism over Facebook Dating safety. But users must opt in to this new feature. The Dating profile is also separate from a user's main profile. The fundamental difference between Facebook and this Dating feature is that users may choose to get matches with friends, friends of friends, and people not in the friend circle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors recognized the threat Facebook has on the online dating market. Last week, Match stock fell ~5% to $81.47. The chart watchers saw a &quot;double top&quot; at around $90 on the charts. Government Scrutiny IntensifiesOn Sept. 6, New York State Attorney General Letitia James said she would lead an investigation against Facebook for antitrust issues. &quot;Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,&quot; she said. &quot;I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk.&quot;  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy The bad news for investors is that Facebook may have to settle without admitting guilt. The government gets paid but the end-users ultimately pay for the damages.Recall that on July 24 Facebook agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. It will pay a record $5 billion fine over its privacy policies. This amount represents 9% of its 2018 revenue. Still, the company generated revenue of $16.9 billion in the second quarter alone. Much of its revenue is from advertising. So long as add spend from U.S. and Canada grows, Facebook can afford to settle with the government. EU Investigates FacebookMeanwhile, EU antitrust regulators are scrutinizing Facebook's planned Libra currency launch. The EU is worried that the cryptocurrency may shut out rivals and restrict competition through the use of information and consumer data. Sadly, Facebook did not even launch the currency, so the investigation may prove premature. Besides, there are many other well-established payment systems. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) all offer some form of electronic payment options.The EU's pre-emptive strike against Facebook is unwise. It may deter the social networking giant from entering the market. This would pave the way for a China-based firm to come in instead. Conversely, the U.S. banks and credit card companies may get a head start if the EU delays' Facebook's entry in the cryptocurrency market.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market  Valuation Here and NowInvestors who forecast a ~20% CAGR in a 5-year DCF growth exit model will arrive at a fair value of $196-$273 for Facebook stock. At a 9.5% discount rate, the implied fair value is $228. Its intrinsic value based on future cash flow is even more bullish. Per Simplywall.St, FB stock is more than 20% discounted from its future cash flow and has plenty of upside for shareholders ahead.On Wall Street, Facebook stock has a $234 target average among 36 analysts tracked by TipRanks.Facebook continues to attract healthy advertising spending. It faces no immediate competition from other social networking sites, either.

2019-09-11,"If you just look at charts and don't pay any attention to monetary trends in the world, you might think that Square (NYSE:SQ) is going nowhere fast and that Square stock is destined to stay below $70 forever.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com This is a textbook example of why I encourage investors to look beyond the charts and educate themselves about the macro environment.As I see it, the Square stock price will be driven not by technical indicators on the chart but by a bigger cultural movement away from cash and towards more convenient and easily accessible forms of payment. Square is a company at the forefront of this movement, and soon enough, SQ stock will reflect the true value of this forward-thinking point-of-sale solutions provider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Say Good-Bye to Cash and Hello to SQ StockThe trend is unmistakable: consumers want convenience, not cash, in their payment modalities. As proof of this, consider the fact that for transactions totaling less than $20, consumers back in 2015 paid with cash 46% of the time. That's already less than half, but check this out: so far in 2019, that figure has fallen to 37%, marking a precipitous drop in cash-based spending.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September This is a global phenomenon, with 47% of China's consumers using mobile wallets as their primary means of making payments. While PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain strong contenders in the global point-of-sale payments space, Square's user base is growing at a record clip: 15 million active accounts by the end of last year, more than double the 7 million at the end of 2017.What differentiates Square from the other competitors is the simplicity of the company's app, along with ease with which users can receive paychecks through Square Cash. Plus, shoppers enjoy the app's wide range of instant discounts, some of which are exclusive to Square Cash.I also like the move that Square made recently to unload its food delivery service, known as Caviar. This is a highly competitive market, and let's face it: food delivery isn't Square's forte. Therefore, when Square announced that it was selling off Caviar to Doordash for $410 million after having paid just $44.3 million for it five years ago, I found this to be a savvy move and a sign that Square is prepared to focus on its payments app. Analysts Are Taking a Shine to Square StockI try not to put too much stock (no pun intended) into analysts' expectations, but I just can't ignore the love that SQ stock has been getting lately. As an example, one analyst who foresees plenty of upside for SQ stock is KeyBanc's Josh Beck.Beck not only reaffirmed an overweight rating for the shares but even gave it a price target of $100 - pretty ambitious considering the all-time high for Square stock is $101.15.&quot;We outline a potential scenario where adj. revenue could come in at $562.5M, which could be driven by a subscription/services number closer to ~$250M,&quot; he said.Somewhat less ambitious but still optimistic are Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who gave SQ stock an upgrade from hold to buy along with a price objective of $80; as well as Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar, who also granted Square stock a buy rating but furthermore assigned a very bullish price objective of $94 for SQ shares. The Takeaway on Square StockI'm not overly concerned about the day-to-day movements of the Square stock price, as I view SQ as a long-term investment in a world that's abandoning cash and moving towards payment methods that are simple and convenient - and Square is proving itself as a strong, focused, and fast-growing competitor in the point-of-sale payments domain.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

They're each moving into a curious technical situation. Paypal Holdings (PYPL)July was a tough month for most stocks, and PayPal Holdings was no exception to that weakness. The stock seemingly started to bounce back in August though, hinting at a renewal of an incredible rally effort that took shape early on in the year.That rebound effort was wholeheartedly up-ended last week though, right where one would have expected a pushback to take shape. Now PYPL stock is hanging by a thread, pressuring its last support level anywhere nearby on the horizon.  *   Click to EnlargeThe support line in question is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. However, it's become clear there's something about the $102.23 level as well, marked in yellow.  * The prod for the renewed weakness was a bump into the purple 50-day and ray 100-day moving average line, the former of which has since fallen below the latter (highlighted).  * If the current technical floors fail to keep PayPal shares propped up, the next most likely line in the sand is the line that connects the key lows from 2018, marked as a dashed blue line on the weekly chart. Conagra Brands (CAG)The final quarter of last year was a tough one for most stocks, but it was downright miserable for Conagra Brands and its shareholders. Shares of the food company fell by roughly half their value in just a matter of weeks.That steep selloff may have ultimately served as a capitulation though, at a time when the company (along with the food industry as a whole) found its bearings again. The action since then suggests that at the very least stability is in the cards, and one more good day could put a full-blown rally into motion.  * 7 Strong-Buy Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Now   *   Click to EnlargeThe compelling clue here is the converging wedge pattern that's taken shape since early this year, framed by red and blue dashed lines on both stock charts.

Horizontal resistance around $30.15 appears to be in play, plotted in yellow on both stock charts.  * Although not overwhelmingly so, the volume behind the past four days of bullishness has been better than the recent average. It's a sign there may be buyers waiting in the wings, ready to pile in. Regions Financial (RF)Finally, in step with most other bank stocks, Regions Financial shares have soared over the course of the past three weeks. A rebound in interest rates prodded the bulk of the bounceback.This sort of thrust is enticing, suggesting a huge bullish motion is underway. And, maybe that's how this one will pan out. It's worth noting, however, that we've seen this sort of effort peter out before, right as it bumped into a technical ceiling that has been encountered just within the past few weeks.  *   Click to EnlargeThe technical line in question is the connector of all the key highs since April, marked as a white dashed line on both stock charts.  * Although overheated and too aggressive, the fact that the purple 50-day moving average line is close to crossing back above the white 200-day moving average line is meaningful. That's a strong buy sign.  * Underscoring the move that has taken shape so far is very solid volume behind the buying, though the sheer pace of the move still leaves Regions Financial vulnerable to profit-taking.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. already lets customers buy and sell Bitcoin on its popular Cash App. Soon, it may let them buy and sell stocks. Square is testing out a new Cash App feature that would enable users to make free stock trades, according to a video outlining the product’s features seen by Bloomberg. While the exact date of its launch is yet to be determined, employees began testing the new feature in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the company who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.A spokesman for Square declined to comment.The free stock trading feature would position Square as a direct competitor to fintech startup Robinhood Markets Inc., which has gained millions of customers by offering no-fee trading, and most recently garnered a valuation of $7.6 billion. Robinhood has since expanded into other offerings such as options trading and margin trading, which would not be offered in Square’s initial product, the person said. Eventually, Square’s new service and others like it could pose a challenge to more established online brokers, like E*Trade Financial Corp.“We are seeing the cadence of free trading increase and I do think that’s something the broader industry can’t dismiss,” said Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities. “As a result, the pricing in those areas will continue to move lower.”Cash App and other peer to peer payment platforms are known for having a young customer base, similar to Robinhood. If Robinhood is any indication of the interest in free trading, Square could quickly gain a lot of traction. Prior to Robinhood's launch, it had a waitlist of 1 million people. Near the end of 2018, it said it had more than 6 million users, though it's unclear how many of them are active on the platform.Square’s Cash App started out by letting users send money to friends, and has since expanded into debit cards and Bitcoin trading. While Square doesn't consistently give updates on how many people are using Cash App, the company said it had more than 15 million monthly active users as of last December. Though there isn’t an immediate path to profitability for most free financial products, the race to add more users to platforms like Cash App has been fierce, with other businesses like PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo also seeing big growth.Right now, fintech companies offering such products largely make money on the interchange fees when customers use their debit cards or on fees they charge for transferring funds to banks instantly. In its most recent letter to shareholders, Square said that revenue from Cash App was $135 million for the quarter, excluding Bitcoin. In a note published earlier this month, KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck said revenue from Cash App could reach $2 billion over the next three years. (Updates with analyst quote in fifth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianTom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Jack Dorsey's Square Is Testing a New Free Stock-Trading Service

2019-09-16,"Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has fallen precipitously since my last analysis. Shares are down from roughly $80 per share in late July to $58.29 at the close Sept.13. With slowing growth, it's no surprise the stock has lost its mojo. But is the recent dip a sign that its time to buy?Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com In July I wrote about how Square stock could be a buy on a dip. However, with recent developments, I am less confident SQ stock can continue trading at such a high premium to its payment processing peers.How have things changed? Read on to see why it's best to avoid Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sentiment Turns Bearish for SQ StockResults for the quarter ending June 30 were decent. Year-over-year adjusted revenues were up 46%. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortization skyrocketed from $62 million in the first quarter of 2019 to $105 million in Q2 2019. The company's Cash App business continues to scale, now generating $135 million in revenue for Q2.But investors are now writing off Square's growth potential. Adjusted revenue grew only 15% from the prior quarter. The company has built a tremendous brand with their flagship payment processing product. But in order to fuel growth, SQ needs new revenue streams to move the needle.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now Food ordering could have been the next frontier. The company owned DoorDash competitor Caviar. However, Square decided to throw in the towel, agreeing to sell Caviar to DoorDash for $410 million. The deal does have a silver lining, as it strengthens Square's ties to the food delivery powerhouse.Square is losing key customers. In late August, the financial press made big hay over the loss of Danish chain Joe & The Juice. This highlights Square's troubles with international growth. With U.S. sales slowing down, global growth is necessary to justify SQ stock's current valuation.Is this making a mountain out of a molehill? Joe & The Juice was likely not material to Square's revenues, but it does strengthen the bear case for Square. Square has a weak economic moat. Competitors with the capital to scale can easily steal market share.InvestorPlace's Mark Hake discussed this Sept. 12. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are inching into Square's business. Square is now playing defense. SQ is even trying to enter their respective businesses. The purchase of Weebly was obviously a play to build a Shopify-esque e-commerce platform. Cash App is Square's answer to PayPal's Venmo.With this in mind, let's see if the valuation of Square stock compensates for these risks. Despite Drop, Square Stock Remains OvervaluedSlowing growth has impacted the Square stock price. But shares continue to trade at a high valuation. Square's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 52.5. This is almost double PayPal's forward P/E of 30.3. SQ trades at a discount to PYPL in terms of its price-to-sales ratio, but enterprise value/EBITDA is another story. Square's EV/EBITDA is 718.3. This is leaps and bounds above PayPal's EV/EBITDA ratio of 40.3.But will Square stock grow into its valuation? If you take PayPal's EBITDA margin (18.3%) and apply it to Square's trailing 12-month sales ($3.95 billion), EBITDA would be $722.9 million. Apply a 40.3x multiple. This gives you an enterprise value of $29.1 billion, close to the mark of Square's current EV ($24.9 billion).There are a few caveats. With increased competition, there will be further pressure to compete on price. PayPal can easily subsidize a price war with Square. While Shopify is an equivalent size to SQ, Shopify can easily offer its e-commerce clients an in-house payment service. Growing into its valuation will not come easy.All of this makes it tough to justify the current price of SQ stock. It would be one thing if Square was the &quot;name&quot; in its niche. But in many ways, Square is unfortunately an &quot;also-ran.&quot; Bottom Line: All Bets Are OffSquare stock has the potential to turn around the ship. Sales growth is slowing, but net revenue has not diminished. The company continues to make gains in the global payments marketplace. However, the recent negative sentiment is justified. In a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; world, even disruptors can get disrupted. Shopify is not an unsinkable ship, but it could do some damage to Square's market power. PayPal's scale brings up concerns over a potential price war.I missed the mark in my last Square analysis. I chose to stay on the sidelines, but believed SQ stock could inch higher. With growth names like Square, it's tough to predict future outcomes. For investors looking at the stock today, it's best to have the same conclusion.Square stock could be cheap down the road. But for now, the company needs leaps-and-bounds growth just to match its valuation. Things could be different when the company announces earnings again in November. But for now, steer clear of Square stock.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-16,"According to a 2018 World Payments Report, global non-cash transactions totaled $482.6 billion as of 2016. These transactions are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.7% from 2016 to 2021, with this figure expected to be even higher in emerging markets. The rapid shift towards cashless payments has not gone unnoticed by fintech companies looking to capitalize on opportunities within this expanding space. A fintech company is any company using technology or innovative techniques to perform traditional financial services. Bearing this in mind, we wanted to take a closer look at a few stocks in this space to see which appear most poised to outperform. We used TipRanks’ Stock Screener to narrow in on the most compelling investments by filtering our search based on sector, market cap and analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look at the results.  Square Inc. While investors have expressed concerns over Square’s (SQ&#92;- Get Report) increasing number of competitors, some analysts argue its payments ecosystem, in which funds get cycled through and repeatedly generate transaction fees, will drive substantial long-term growth. Square’s business is comprised of its traditional payments segment as well as its subscription and services segment, which includes its Cash App that lets users send money directly to one another.    Despite the fact that shares have declined 7% over the last month, SQ remains fundamentally strong based on its core payments growth. According to its August 1 Q2 earnings release, gross payment volume (GPV) jumped 25% year-over-year. While this figure represents a slight deceleration as SQ has gained market share and grown off a smaller base, the company stands to maintain its GPV growth levels based on further expansion of the eCommerce market (according to U.S. consensus data), increased digital payments and its competitive pricing for small and medium sized businesses (SMB). SQ’s subscription and services segment has also witnessed an 87% year-over-year gain thanks to its investments in expanding its two-sided payments ecosystem and new products. These products include its Instant Deposit, Cash Card, Capital, Payroll and omnichannel services from Weebly and Zesty. Adding to the good news, SQ announced during the earnings release that it was selling its food delivery business, Caviar, to DoorDash for $410 million. This sale should help boost the company’s cash flow.  Needham analyst Mayank Tandon tells investors that as the ecosystem expands and the business scales, EBITDA margins can reach mid-30s long-term, consistent with the mature payments processors. He adds, “SQ trades at about 8x our EV/FY20 revenue estimate. While the multiple is higher than traditional payments companies, we believe it is reasonable when comparing it to the 9.5x median valuation of other open-ended payments/software growth stories.” As a result, the five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating and $90 price target on September 12. He believes shares could surge a massive 54% in the next twelve months. Wall Street is divided when it comes to Square. With 10 Buy ratings, 8 Holds and 3 Sells assigned in the last three months, the fintech is a ‘Moderate Buy’. Its $79 average price target implies 35% upside potential, the highest out of the three stocks on our list.  Paypal Holdings Inc.While PayPal (PYPL&#92;- Get Report) shares have dipped 8% in the last three months, some analysts say to buy the pullback based on its strong long-term growth narrative. The pullback comes in part as a response to PYPL’s performance in its latest quarter. While the company was able to post an earnings beat on July 24, it missed the consensus estimate for revenue. Investors were also not pleased with its full year 2019 guidance. As a result of its sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony, revenue growth is expected to slow by 3.5 percentage points. That being said, it’s important to note that total payment volume (TPV) increased 26% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis thanks to its digital money transfer app Venmo and person-to-person (P2P) volume.PayPal also managed to pull off a win with respect to new customers. It added 9 million new active accounts in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Part of this is due to its One Touch product, which is designed to make checkout faster and more convenient. The service eliminates the need to log into an account or fill out billing details, with customers able to make purchases with a single touch.Based on all of the above factors, Canaccord Genuity’s Joseph Vafi believes that the dip presents investors with an attractive entry point. “Short term, we believe the guide-down post Q2 has de-risked the story into next year. Delays in large deal integration may actually become tailwinds for growth next year. Net net, with the pullback in the stock post last quarter’s results, we see positive risk/reward in PYPL shares currently,” he explained. As a result, the 4.5-star analyst upgraded the rating from a Hold to a Buy and raised the price target from $110 to $118 on September 12. All in all, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on PYPL. It has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $130 average price target, suggesting 22% upside potential.  JPMorgan Chase & CompanyWhen most investors think of fintech stocks, J.P. Morgan (JPM&#92;- Get Report) isn’t usually the first name that comes to mind as it’s often regarded as more of a traditional banking company. That being said, J.P. Morgan is making waves in the fintech space thanks to its new same-day deposits.On September 10, the company announced that it would be launching free same-day deposits for its WePay platform users that have bank accounts with the company. The service can already be utilized by certain customers and will be available on all of its platforms by the end of the year. Investors were thrilled by the news, with shares climbing 3% higher in the last three days. This is on top of the 23% it has already gained year-to-date. The excitement is due to the fact that its fintech competitors can take up to two business days to process payments and charge an extra fee for faster service.This service is part of a larger effort to make a name for itself as a fintech company. The company announced in October of last year that it was building a “fintech campus” to house over 1,000 employees in Palo Alto, California. JPM also released a digital brokerage service, You Invest, in August 2018 that includes free trades, a portfolio building tool and access to equity research.While some have expressed concerns regarding management’s September 10 announcement that it cut its full year 2019 guidance for net interest income, one top analyst believes JPM is making up for it with its focus on fintech.The company’s foray into the world of fintech lends itself to Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo’s conclusion that now is the time to buy JPM. As a result, the four-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating while lowering the price target from $130 to $125 on August 16. Despite the price target cut, he still believes share prices could rise 4% in the next twelve months.  6 Buy ratings and 3 Holds received in the last three months add up to a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus. Its $122 average price target indicates 2% upside potential. Discover the Street’s best-rated stocks with the Top Analysts’ Stocks tool",3 Fintech Stocks With Strong Long-Term Growth Prospects
2019-09-16,"Bull of the Day: Fiserv, Inc. (FISV)","Bull of the Day: Fiserv, Inc. (FISV)"
2019-09-16,"Over the past decade, Square (NYSE:SQ) has become a dominant player in the mobile payments and financing sphere. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected the company's exponential growth.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com However, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its second-quarter earnings report in August. Year-to-date, the SQ stock price is basically flat. Now may be a good time to ask why Square shares have been falling and what we can expect in the final quarter of 2019.I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer below $55, especially if the price approaches or even goes below $50. Here are the must-know fundamental metric and price levels for SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Stock's Q3 Guidance Failed to ImpressSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Its payments processing business, also referred to as &quot;payments as a service,&quot; has been a game changer in serving small businesses. To the delight of early investors, this innovative financial services company has expanded quickly and become a disruptor.SQ stock reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share. A year ago in Q3, Square stock's adjusted earnings per share came in at 13 cents.Square's subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. Gross payment volume of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with Cash App -- quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock's losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide. Where SQ Stock's Price Is NowThe U.S. stock market has had several big winners in the past year. However, Square stock has not been one of them. Over the past 12 months, SQ shares are down about 36%.Let us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years to have a better view on what to expect in the coming weeks.Following SQ stock's IPO in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, August has not been a good month for Square shares either. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance which has underwhelmed investors.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $58.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $50 and $55.Plus, based on options trading, many bets are being placed that Square shares will see $50 before too long.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point. Square Stock Is Still Richly ValuedAlthough the decline in Square's stock has improved the valuation, the shares are still richly valued.While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.  And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take the high valuation of SQ stock down even further.The expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ is facing increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv  (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global-payments giant.Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ's forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 50. On the other hand forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 30, 28 and 26 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-to-sales ratio is over 6.3x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance. Should You Buy SQ Stock?The fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in September as well as in early October. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Square is a high beta stock at 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings.It is likely that Square shares will fall toward $50, where I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in early November.Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-$50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I'd not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. kicked off its debut bond offering as the investment-grade market reignited.The digital payments company sold $5 billion of senior unsecured bonds in four parts.

2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. is negotiating with a key congressional committee for Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to testify as soon as next month, people familiar with the talks said, amid questions about the social media giant’s market power and its plans for a digital cryptocurrency called Libra.Sandberg is expected to appear at a hearing as soon as late October, but officials are still negotiating the details with the House Financial Services Committee, the people said. It’s possible the hearing could slip to later in the year, one of the people said.Sandberg’s appearance would follow July hearings with Facebook executive and Libra co-creator David Marcus, who faced sharp questions from House and Senate panels on whether Facebook could be trusted to create a cryptocurrency and whether Libra might be used for nefarious purposes. The discussions are taking place as the social media giant is facing questions about its market power and its plans for a digital cryptocurrency called Libra.Facebook declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook announced in June it’s trying to create a new cryptocurrency using similar technology to that of Bitcoin, saying it would lower the cost of payments and money transfers. The company helped form a new organization, called the Libra Association, that’s incorporated in Switzerland and would manage the currency. While Facebook would be a member of the association, it said it will have no more power over decisions regarding the currency than other companies and nonprofits that join. So far, the association has 27 other intended members, including Visa Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.Blowback to the plan was swift. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Libra could pose a risk to the financial system. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said the company should immediately stop work on the currency. The French and German finance ministers said they would block the project.The project has even faced criticism from proponents of other cryptocurrencies, who don’t believe Libra’s centralized control make it a fair comparison to decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.During a visit to Washington earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg at a dinner promised senators that the currency wouldn’t launch without U.S. regulatory approval.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.net;Elizabeth Dexheimer in Washington at edexheimer@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Sara Forden, Jon MorganFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook in Talks for Sandberg to Testify to House Next Month

2019-10-02,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- Johannes Reck should be feeling pretty groovy. He’s the co-founder of one of the hottest startups in Berlin. GetYourGuide lets holiday makers book tours online in 150 countries and is on course to increase ticket sales this year by 75%. In May it raised $484 million from investors, and it’s now valued at more than $1 billion.Reck’s company is precisely the type of unicorn European policymakers want to see more of as they champion entrepreneurship that can kick-start much-needed economic growth. But he’s fuming. “It’s not even that I am disappointed—I am angry, really angry, because you don’t need to reinvent the wheel here,” says Reck, a 34-year-old German with the wiry build of a marathoner. “It’s not like we are asking politicians to do something unheard of.”The problem? Reck can’t provide his people with a stake in the future of their venture without incurring crushing costs and hassle. For decades, tech mavens in the U.S. have used stock options for employees to spur innovation—and unprecedented wealth. Unlike Silicon Valley, where equity incentive plans have become as ubiquitous as foosball tables and midday yoga sessions, the options culture has yet to take root in many European countries. While some lawmakers are taking action to loosen restrictions on pay, it’s going to be hard to close the gap when income inequality is becoming a more urgent issue on both sides of the Atlantic.European consumers and lawmakers here have long decried outsize paydays as unfair and vulgar. A few years ago the Dutch capped bonuses for bankers, money managers, and other financial professionals at 20% of their base salaries. Entrepreneurs must navigate onerous tax rates and restrictions that often make equity sharing and options more trouble than they’re worth. When employees in Germany exercise options, they have to pay income tax on the difference between the fair market value and the strike price, and that rate runs from 14% to 47.5%. They also have to pay a 25% capital-gains tax on additional profits when they sell their shares.In contrast, American employees typically pay a 0% to 20% rate on capital gains when options are redeemed, though they may have to pay additional levies when they’re exercised, depending on the timing and the type of equity incentive program. Germany and 14 other countries, including Sweden and the Netherlands, are more burdensome than the U.S. regarding options, according to a 2018 study by Index Ventures, a venture capital firm in London and Silicon Valley. For entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, the problem isn’t just about attracting top talent. The compensation bind may also be a big reason why Europe doesn’t produce world-beating tech companies at the same level as the U.S.Other forces are at work, too. Even though they’re part of the European Union, member states remain a fragmented collection of markets that can’t muster the borderless scale achieved in America. Plus, there’s the widely shared belief that European business culture simply doesn’t tolerate the experimentation and inevitable failures that are par for the course in, say, Silicon Valley. While governments across the EU have devoted hundreds of millions of euros to venture capital-style programs to invest in startups, the one tool entrepreneurs truly want remains out of reach.“There are two ingredients to growth in a startup,” says Martin Mignot, an Index Ventures partner. “One is capital, and the other is talent, and when you’re not highly profitable you have to incentivize employees on the promise of the upside. Your currency is that promise.”Spotify, Klarna, and TransferWise lead a roster of European companies that have shaken up industries with new products and created wealth for their investors and employees. Likewise, a handful of countries hew to the American approach on compensation; Britain, Italy, Portugal, and, interestingly enough, France, tax options as capital gains when they’re cashed in.Yet they’re the exceptions. In many other European markets, startup founders have to use various workarounds to vest employees in their businesses. In Sweden, options can be taxed as income at rates of more than 50%. Klarna, a digital payments powerhouse, sidesteps the bill by issuing warrants priced at fair market value using the Black-Scholes model, which are taxed as capital gains at 25% to 30% at the time of sale. But, as incentives, fully priced warrants aren’t as potent as cheaper priced options, says Knut Frangsmyr, Klarna’s chief operating officer. Companies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Spain distribute “virtual share options,” but the instruments are really just cash bonuses by another name and may not deliver the windfalls that bona fide options do when a company is acquired or holds an initial public offering.“We are so proud of our trade surplus and our automobile industry, but we have fallen behind in the digital economy. This is where value and growth will come from”In Germany, at least, help may finally be on the way. Bettina Stark-Watzinger, chairwoman of the Finance Committee in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, has crafted legislation that would cut the tax rate on stock options in half by treating them as capital gains instead of income. Stark-Watzinger, a member of the centrist opposition Free Democratic Party, argues that Germany has become complacent about supporting digital innovation.She worries that promising tech companies will decamp to other countries if lawmakers don’t change things. “We are so preoccupied with the economy of the last century,” Stark-Watzinger says in her office suite near Berlin’s iconic Brandenburg Gate. “We are so proud of our trade surplus and our automobile industry, but we have fallen behind in the digital economy. This is where value and growth will come from in the future.”It won’t be easy for Stark-Watzinger to persuade parties in Germany’s governing coalition to embrace legislation that might be seen as favoring workers in the relatively well-off tech sector. Germany has been far less comfortable than the U.S. and the U.K. about carving out exceptions in its tax system for specific sectors, even to stimulate innovation, says Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington who has studied the issue. It wasn’t until this year that the German government proposed a tax break for research and development investments across industries, a common policy in many Western countries.Whenever the issue of tax credits has come up in the Bundestag, lawmakers have tended to question whether lower revenue will undermine support for social services—a political third rail in a nation that provides free tuition at public universities and universal health care.Mandel says that just because Washington is willing to bet that forgoing tax revenue now will result in bigger inflows later, that doesn’t mean Berlin should. “Germany has a very successful industrial system, so why should they break something that’s working?” he says. “And while German leaders would love to have more unicorns, they might want to develop them their way, not the Silicon Valley way.” Even so, there’s little doubt that stock options have fueled wealth and innovation in the U.S. Companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc., the online payments pioneer, haven’t just made their founders wildly rich; members of the so-called PayPal mafia like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman went on to start ventures that minted fortunes for rank-and-file employees who can then start their own companies and begin the cycle anew.Index’s Mignot calls this the flywheel effect. The flywheel isn’t nonexistent in Europe: The 2018 IPO of Adyen, a Dutch digital payments processing company, made its top brass billionaires. Yet reforming options rules across the EU would help make creating such flywheels the norm instead of the exception, says Magnus Henrekson, the director of the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm. At the top of the reform list is making sure beneficiaries aren’t hit with taxes until gains are realized.GetYourGuide’s Reck, for one, is relieved the issue is finally on the agenda. In many respects, his company looks like a classic Valley performer. It’s backed by SoftBank Vision Fund, and in September it moved its headquarters into a renovated electrical substation that’s a model of post-industrial hipness, with exposed red brick walls, cast-iron beams, and fridges stocked with high-caffeine Club-Mate drinks.Even though Reck was determined to add the pièce de résistance—options—he gave up after realizing that the upfront tax bill would empty workers’ pocketbooks. So he implemented ersatz shares that are essentially cash awards tied to GetYourGuide’s valuation.Those payouts are taxed as income, but only when they’re redeemed, and there’s no capital-gains tax. But GetYourGuide, which isn’t profitable yet, must reserve cash to cover the outlays. “This has massive disadvantages for the company,” says Reck. “We have a huge liability on our balance sheet toward employees, which is obviously weird. And in an IPO scenario, this is something that you have to explain to investors, and that’s not great.”Raisin, another startup, did bite the bullet, granting stock options to its employees. Located in Prenzlauer Berg, a Berlin neighborhood of funky cafes and old Soviet-style apartment buildings, Raisin runs an online “deposit marketplace” that matches European savers with banks offering the best interest rates. Backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and PayPal, it’s invested €16 billion ($17.7 billion) in assets.Frank Freund, Raisin’s co-founder and chief financial officer, isn’t wild about requirements that date to a bygone era. Whenever Raisin grants shares, a notary must literally read the lengthy compensation agreement aloud to both the employee and Freund at a hearing that can take up to 90 minutes. Still, Freund believes the company made the right call. “When you have participation in the company’s performance and growth, it makes a big difference,” he says. “It would be great if significantly more companies would follow our example in Germany.” Scott Chacon will take a pass on that. Chacon is an American entrepreneur who co-founded the software development site GitHub Inc. He’s been spending time in Berlin with his latest venture, an online language-tutoring service called Chatterbug Inc. Following a panel discussion, he mingles with local techies over beers in a leafy courtyard outside a VC firm.Amid the bonhomie, he says Chatterbug chose to base itself in San Francisco and Berlin to tap into the German capital’s diverse expatriate pool. It offered employees a choice of U.S.-style options or German-style virtual shares. But ensuring the different programs were equitable was impossible. Chatterbug now offers new employees restricted stock units that aren’t pegged to a strike price (as options are) and are taxed as income if they’re cashed in during a sale of the company.Standing alongside Chacon, Anne Leuschner, the company’s COO, chimes in. She says Chatterbug’s compensation fudge isn’t ideal, but it’ll do for now. “I wish we had the same system as the U.S.,” she says. “But they don’t want us to get rich in Germany.”Robinson covers wealth in London.

2019-10-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Four payments companies that have joined Facebook Inc. as founding members of the Libra Association are wavering over whether to officially sign on to the cryptocurrency project, according to people familiar with the matter.Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc. are undecided about formally signing onto Libra’s organizing charter because they’re concerned about maintaining positive relationships with regulators who have reservations about the project, the people said.Executives at the payments companies believe Facebook oversold the extent to which regulators were comfortable with the project and are concerned about the perception the social network hasn’t behaved responsibly in other areas -- such as how it has handled user data and privacy, the people said.The Libra Association is asking the 28 founding members to reaffirm their commitment to the cryptocurrency project later this month, according to three people familiar with the matter. Before Libra was unveiled, the companies signed nonbinding letters of intent to explore joining the association.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the Libra effort, tweeted Wednesday that the “[first] wave of Libra Association members will be formalized in the weeks to come.” Marcus said he was unaware of any current Libra partners who might abstain from officially joining the organization, but building a new global currency is “hard and requires courage.”“I can tell you that we’re very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront,“ he added.Companies that officially join the charter won’t be obligated to immediately contribute an initial $10 million required to invest in the project, according to two of the people. The option to delay the payment reflects the association’s strategy to move the Libra project forward in baby steps, the people said. That would give members more time to work out how their participation might affect the rest of their companies’ operations and regulatory obligations, they said.The signing of the charter could take place as soon as Oct. 14, three people said, and will likely happen in Switzerland, where the nonprofit organization charged with managing the Libra digital currency reserve and global payments network would be headquartered.“Nothing has changed with our involvement with Libra since we came on to participate,” said a Stripe spokesman. “We agreed to work on the charter with these other participants. We continue to work on the charter. We’re still actively involved.” He declined to comment specifically on whether Stripe has hesitations about signing the charter.Spokesmen for Facebook, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and the Libra Association declined to comment.The move to get Libra members to formally sign on is the latest indication that Facebook and its partners are pushing forward with the controversial plan, even after it came under fire from policy makers around the world.Facebook has said repeatedly that the Libra Association will be responsible for making decisions about the currency, so its formal creation could mean that regulators start to get better answers than Facebook has offered so far.Some European finance ministers have threatened to ban Libra in their respective countries and the European Union’s antitrust chief says she’s taken the unusual step of scrutinizing Libra because of the risk it could lead to the creation of a new, entirely separate economy.Meanwhile, development of the technology to underpin Libra is moving faster than internal deadlines, Diogo Monica, co-founder of Anchorage, a technology company that safeguards cryptocurrencies, said in a phone interview. Five association members including Anchorage and Facebook’s digital wallet subsidiary Calibra are already running a test network of nodes, and sending transactions -- not done with real money for now -- to each other, he said.Libra has started addressing regulators’ concerns by making tweaks to its technology and policies, such as its anti-money-laundering policies, Monica added. Hundreds of organizations are on a waiting list hoping to join the association, Monica said, but no additional members have been admitted yet, he said.Opponents of the plan say Libra, which would be backed by a pool of traditional currencies, could undercut countries’ monetary policies or be used for nefarious purposes. U.S. lawmakers this summer grilled Marcus, questioning whether Facebook could be trusted to expand into financial services. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg last month told senators that the currency wouldn’t launch anywhere in the world without U.S. regulators’ blessing.Facebook announced the project in June to make international payments as simple as texting. It draws on big names in the payments, technology, telecom and blockchain industries, including EBay Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., blockchain startups Coinbase Inc. and Xapo Inc., and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital companies and non-profit organizations.Why Everybody (Almost) Hates Facebook’s Digital Coin: QuickTakeEven as Facebook has publicly drawn fire, the Libra organization’s members have worked in the background to hash out details of a chartering document to formally establish the non-profit so that the group’s work to stand up the payments system can move forward.The work has proven contentious due to continued uncertainty about the regulatory implications of the project, according to two of the people.“Since June the Association has met with numerous regulators and policy makers,” said Dante Disparte, a spokesman for the Libra Association, in an email. “Additionally the group of founding members have held regular meetings to discuss appropriate regulatory requirements for operating a payment system, as well as conforming to anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, privacy and other standards.”(Updates with comment from the Libra Association in the last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Olga Kharif and Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Arlington at lbeyoud2@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Libra Payments Partners Waver on Cryptocurrency

2019-10-04,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. pulled out of the Libra Association, a blow to Facebook Inc.’s efforts to develop a digital currency.“PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations,” the payments company said in a statement emailed to Bloomberg News on Friday. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.Several founding members of the Facebook-led project have been wavering over whether to fully embrace the effort because they’re concerned about maintaining positive relationships with regulators who have reservations about the initiative, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier this week.Concerns that PayPal might back away from the project intensified on Thursday when the company was mysteriously absent from a meeting of Association members in Washington. All of the other original partners were in attendance, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting.PayPal’s decision to bail is notable because David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the initiative, used to be president of PayPal. Facebook’s blockchain team also has many former PayPal employees. The Libra Association, the group of companies Facebook has assembled to oversee the cryptocurrency, has 28 founding members. The organization has asked these members to reaffirm their commitment to the project later this month. Before Libra was unveiled, the companies signed nonbinding letters of intent to explore joining the association.Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, confirmed PayPal’s decision, and said the first Libra Council meeting will take place on Oct. 14.“This journey to build a generational payment network like the Libra project is not an easy path,” he added in a statement. “We recognize that change is hard, and that each organization that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises.”Disparte also noted that 1,500 “entities” have indicated “enthusiastic interest” in being part of the Association. Some of those entities already have contracts in the works to join Libra, according to people familiar with the matter, though they’ll have to wait until original partners sign the official charter later this month.“We remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,” PayPal said on Friday. “Facebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal, and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.”(Updates with details of Association meeting in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud and Olga Kharif.To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Bails on Facebook-Led Libra Cryptocurrency Dream

2019-10-04,"Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock is down 20% in the past month. SHOP stock slid from $389.70 at the open on Sept. 3 to $310.36 at the close on Oct. 2.Prior to that, SHOP stock had been rallying tremendously. SHOP stock nearly tripled in value from January to August. As a result, the shares reached a frothy valuation.As I wrote in my July column, &quot;Short term, SHOP stock is a sell. A massive pullback could signal a buying opportunity to place a bet on SHOP's future prospects. But until then, investors should be cautious before chasing this growth story.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? I was a little early. The shares went up another 27% before starting their retreat back down to the $300 price level.While I believe SHOP remains overvalued, I can see the stock treading water or rallying higher.But here's why I'm on the sidelines with Shopify stock: Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com  Will SHOP's Fulfillment Push Move the Needle?SHOP is rapidly moving into fulfillment.The company believes that will help it compete more effectively with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But fulfillment is not a slam-dunk. The fulfillment industry is a low-margin business. Since it also has high startup costs, SHOP could lose big if this bet doesn't pay off. Considering the company has yet to generate a profit from its core business, it could be getting in over its head.In tandem with this fulfillment push, Shopify is acquiring 6 River Systems. 6 Rivers provides automation solutions for warehouse/fulfillment operations. The analyst community is positive on this deal. Canaccord's David Hynes believes the acquisition  can jump-start SHOP's fulfillment strategy. He remains bullish on Shopify stock, setting a $385 price target on the name.Jeffries' Samad Samana believes another strength of the deal is that it brings two former Amazon execs into the fold. But Samana remains cautious, rating the stock a &quot;hold.&quot; Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson is also positive on the acquisition, but remains &quot;neutral&quot; on Shopify stock, due to its valuation.Shopify's move into fulfillment has its pros and cons. But weighing catalysts against risks, I think SHOP stock remains highly overvalued. Let's take a closer look at the current valuation of Shopify stock. Even After Its Dip, Shopify Stock Remains OvervaluedEven compared to other growth stocks, SHOP is overvalued. Shopify's trailing enterprise value/sales (EV/Sales) ratio is 26.2. Here are the 12-month trailing EV/Sales ratios for some of Shopify's peers:Amazon: EV/Sales of 3.5Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY): EV/Sales ratio of 8.9PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL): EV/Sales ratio of 6.9Square (NYSE:SQ): EV/Sales ratio of 6.5Wix (NASDAQ:WIX): EV/Sales ratio of 8.1Perhaps comparing Shopify stock to AMZN, PYPL, and SQ is not an apples-to-apples contrast. But even among e-commerce platforms, Shopify's valuation is high. InvestorPlace columnist Mark Hake touched on this in a recent article. He pointed out that Shopify stock trades at a substantial premium to ETSY and WIX, even when comparing their forward sales.For the fiscal year that will end in December 2020, analysts, on average, estimate that  Shopify's sales will be $2.06 billion. Based on its current enterprise value of $33.9 billion, SHOP trades at a forward EV/Sales ratio of 16.4. ETSY and WIX have forward EV/Sales ratios of 6.3 and 5.8, respectively.But SHOP continues to fly high in terms of growth. As its  last quarterly results showed, its revenue continues to grow at a significant clip. The growth of e-commerce is definitely not over. But does it seem smart to buy SHOP stock now,  when the company is entering the costly fulfillment business?The same thing could have been said about Amazon back in the mid-2000s. Back then, there was no guarantee that AMZN could parlay its success as a bookseller into a global retail juggernaut. Only time will tell if SHOP will achieve the same success. The Bottom Line on Shopify Stock: Its Future Is UncertainShopify's core software-as-a-service business is solid. Its competitive moat will enable it to sustain high growth, as its customers accelerate their pivot from bricks-and-mortar to e-commerce. But SHOP stock is not a buy at any price. At its current valuation, Sjopify stock seems frothy. Add in the new fulfillment build-out, and its future profitability continues to be uncertain.All bets are off with SHOP. The company's next quarterly results are due to be released in November. If the company can continue to generate 30%+ revenue growth, investors could dive into SHOP stock again.But buying SHOP today could be a costly bet. The best strategy for investors is to remain on the sidelines. Once the anticipated recession occurs, Shopify could be a screaming buy. Even if its  growth is challenged in a tough economy, the company's long-term prospects may make it a compelling opportunity.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc.’s decision to pull out of the Libra Association may lead to more congressional hearings from critics seeking to press the payments company for more details on why it walked away, according to Cowen.A push for hearings may intensify further if Libra -- Facebook Inc.’s effort to develop a digital currency -- were to lose other members, analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote. Not only has Facebook failed to win Washington’s “buy in,” it’s also lost support and the “messaging war,” he said. And Seiberg warned that other backers may join PayPal in retreating rather than “risk getting pulled into the policy fights over privacy and private currencies.”PayPal pared losses of as much as 2% as Facebook declined as much as much as 1.1%. Meanwhile other Libra backers -- Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. -- both fell more than 1.7% before paring some of the drop. Financials declined across the board, along with the broader market, as analysts fretted about banks’ prospects and trade tensions flared.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette described PayPal’s decision as wise. “While we believe it made sense for PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard to initially participate in Libra to defend their flanks and maintain optionality, the amount of political attention Libra has received has made the opportunity less attractive,” Faucette wrote.Cowen’s Seiberg has consistently doubted Facebook’s ability to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as the social media company is “framing Libra as an independent entity that will control the transaction data of users.” Big partners exiting may mean it will be “harder to convince policymakers that Libra is independent of Facebook.” He expects Facebook will stay in the spotlight and will face mounting scrutiny as the 2020 election approaches.Separately, Height Capital Markets in a note said that “one withdrawal does not doom Libra, but if there is a cascade of departures the Libra project may collapse before it can launch.” The firm also saw regulators’ focus on financial stability as “overstated,” as Libra won’t be issuing any country’s currency or debt, but will convert a given currency into Libra currency, and Libra will be “backed by a basket of short term debt instruments issued by sovereign nations.”Earlier, Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould wrote that Libra “will likely take much longer than initially anticipated” and more government regulation and fines could be on the way.&#92;--With assistance from Cristin Flanagan.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal’s Exit From Libra May Trigger Fresh Hearings, Cowen Says"

2019-10-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify before a key congressional committee that deals with the finance industry later this month, the latest sign of rising opposition to the social media giant’s plans to create a cryptocurrency.The social network’s top executive will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23, according to Maxine Waters, the panel’s Democratic chairwoman. He’ll be the sole witness at the hearing, which is advertised as an examination of Facebook’s broad impact on the financial services and housing industries, Waters said in a Wednesday statement.Zuckerberg looks forward to testifying before the committee and responding to lawmakers’ questions, a Facebook spokesman said. The committee had previously been discussing bringing in Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.The hearing will be the second held by Waters in a matter of months that features a Facebook senior manager. In July, both Democratic and Republican members on her panel grilled David Marcus, the executive leading Facebook’s development of the digital token, known as Libra. Marcus sat through two days of contentious hearings where Facebook’s prior missteps around user privacy and election security were cited as reasons why the company shouldn’t be moving into financial services. Zuckerberg was also criticized for sending a deputy instead of answering questions himself. Marcus said repeatedly that Facebook plans to work with regulators to get Libra off the ground.Facebook announced in June it’s trying to create the new cryptocurrency using similar technology to that of Bitcoin, saying it would lower the cost of payments and money transfers. The company helped form a new organization, called the Libra Association, that’s incorporated in Switzerland and would manage the currency. It also recruited 27 partners to serve as Libra Association members to help govern the proposed currency, but one of those members -- PayPal Holdings Inc. -- abandoned the project before the group’s charter was even signed.Following Facebook’s initial announcement, blowback to the plan was swift. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said Libra could pose a risk to the financial system, and it’s drawn criticism from President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The French and German finance ministers have said they would block the project.Lawmakers are also concerned that the coin might be used to bypass money-laundering rules or that it could undermine government control over the flow of money.The committee’s questions for Zuckerberg likely won’t be limited to Libra. The House Financial Services Committee also oversees housing issues, and Zuckerberg may be asked about Facebook’s advertising practices. Earlier this year the Department of Housing and Urban Development accused Facebook of letting advertisers restrict housing ads to Facebook users based on protected characteristics, like race and religion.Zuckerberg has appeared before Congress just once before -– in April 2018, to answer questions about Facebook’s privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, Zuckerberg was in Washington just last month and held meetings with a number of lawmakers from both the House and Senate, and with Trump in the Oval Office.(Update includes added context around Zuckerberg’s history in DC and more details about other issues that may be discussed.)&#92;--With assistance from Sarah Frier.To contact the reporters on this story: Elizabeth Dexheimer in Washington at edexheimer@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory Mott, Jillian WardFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Zuckerberg to Testify in House on Currency Plans

2019-10-09,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. will report a $228 million loss on investments before taxes in the third quarter, driven in large part by a bad bet on Uber Technologies Inc. just before it went public.The San Jose, California-based payments company said the investment in Uber, for $500 million at the initial public offering price, had declined 34%. Another investment, in Latin American online retailer MercadoLibre Inc., had declined 10%, PayPal said.PayPal’s stake in the world’s largest ride-hailing business was tied to what the companies described as a closer collaboration on payments technology. Uber is the most prominent app to use PayPal’s nascent Pay With Venmo feature. But Uber’s stock has under-performed due to a combination of slowing growth and accelerated losses.A PayPal spokeswoman said the company’s guidance doesn’t incorporate expectations for stock price performance of their investments during the quarter given the “inherent difficulty” in predicting market fluctuations. PayPal said its investments have still generated unrealized gains for the company this year, due to better performance in earlier quarters.Following the report, Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, said he now expects earnings per share of 54 cents for the third quarter, down from an earlier projection of 69 cents. PayPal reports earnings on Oct. 23. The stock was up less than 1% to $99.93 at 11:22 a.m. in New York.(Updates with shares in last paragraph.

2019-10-14,"After sprinting higher through the first seven months of 2019, shares of digital payments provider PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have struggled over the past few months as slowing global economic conditions have converged on escalating trade tensions to create cause for concern with respect to PayPal's growth trajectory over the next few quarters. Net-net, from its late July 2019 highs, PayPal stock has dropped more than 15%.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Time to buy the near term dip in a long term winner? I think so. For three big reasons.First, PayPal is one of the more important players in the secular growth digital payments world, and as that world continues to grow over the next several years, PayPal's revenues and profits will similarly march higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, is in the early stages of monetizing its enormous user base, and Venmo revenue ramp over the next few years will provide a big tailwind for growth.Third, considering its multi-faceted big growth drivers, PayPal stock is cheap here and now.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now The investment implication? Buy PYPL stock here, at $100, before the market realizes the stock is too cheap for its own good. PayPal Is a Secular Growth CompanyThe first big reason to buy PayPal stock is that PayPal is a secular growth company with tons of growth potential over the next few years.Here's the story. Cash payments are dead. Digital payments are the future. There's nothing stopping this trend. Cash is inconvenient to carry around, easy to lose, and clunky. Alternative payment methods - like PayPal - are convenient to carry around (PayPal is in your phone), hard to lose (just don't misplace your phone), and non-clunky (PayPal doesn't take up any physical space).Further, a ton of shopping is done through the digital channel these days, and you can't pay with cash through the digital channel - you use a payment card or a digital payment account.As such, digital payments constitute a very big, very important, and rapidly growing market. E-retail sales measured just over $2.9 trillion globally last year and project to grow at a 17% compounded annual growth rate into 2023. Of that $2.9 trillion pie, PayPal accounted for roughly 20% share in 2018, and given management's guide for 2019 total payment volume, that share will likely rise by about 70 basis points in 2019.The important takeaway? PayPal is expanding its market share in a 17% growth market. Assuming this share expansion persists as it should, given Venmo's ramp (more on this later), PayPal reasonably projects as a 20%-plus revenue growth company over the next several years.Meanwhile, operating margins are running higher at a consistent cadence of 50 to 100 basis points each year thanks to increased scale; this should continue, too.Big picture, thanks to its favorable positioning in a secular growth market, PayPal projects as 20%-plus revenue growth company over the next few years with upside margin drivers. Venmo's Ramp Will Be BigThe second big reason to buy PayPal stock is that Venmo is in the first few innings of what projects to be a huge revenue ramp over the next several years.I thoroughly believe that Venmo is the future of commerce. Let me explain why with a recent example. A colleague picked up bagels on the way to work on Friday morning. Five years ago, I would've whipped out my wallet, and paid him in cash. But, I don't even own a wallet anymore - I use one of those phone-wallet cases - and I don't carry cash.So, what did I do? I paid him $10 through Venmo. He will get that Venmo payment, which he will either transfer to his bank (for which Venmo will take a 10% cut) or he will spend it with his Venmo card.This is a microcosm for what is happening everywhere. P2P commerce used to be dominated by cash transactions. Now, no one carries cash anymore. So, P2P commerce is dominated by digital payments today. In the P2P digital payments world, Venmo is king, because they've invented a way to make P2P digital payments social, fun, and interactive. They also have scale, which helps, because it allows for uniformity and consistency.Net-net, Venmo is a growth machine, and PayPal is just now turning on the revenue engines of that growth machine. Over the next several years, Venmo will turn into a meaningful revenue contributor for PayPal, and as it does, PayPal's whole growth narrative will improve. PayPal Stock Is CheapThe third big reason to buy PayPal is that, given the company's robust growth prospects over the next several years, PayPal stock is cheap here.Here are the numbers. You have a $2.9 trillion global eCommerce market, growing at a 17% pace into 2023, and probably a 15% pace into 2025. PayPal owns 20% of that market. Share is expanding because of Venmo and P2P commerce ramp. This ramp will continue. So will PayPal's market share expansion. Net net, by 2025, PayPal will likely own about 23-25% of the eCommerce market, which will probably stand around $8.5 trillion by then.Doing the math on that, PayPal reasonably projects as a 15-17% revenue grower into 2025. Operating margins, which have been increasing at a cadence of roughly 50 to 100 basis points per year, should continue to march higher as the company benefits from scale and opex leverage. Thus, PayPal projects as a ~20% profit grower into 2025.That pegs 2025 EPS at roughly $8.80. Based on a payments group average 25-times forward earnings multiple and 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target for PayPal stock of over $135 - way above today's $100 price tag. Bottom Line on PayPal StockBuy PayPal stock here. This is a secular growth stock trading at a significant discount to its long term growth prospects, with a big catalyst on the horizon from Venmo revenue ramp. Put those things together, and it's clear to see why PYPL stock should work here.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PYPL.

2019-10-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association hasn’t officially launched but has already lost a quarter of its membership, as Booking Holdings Inc., an online travel company that operates websites including Kayak.com and Priceline.com, joined Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and four other companies in leaving the controversial cryptocurrency project spearheaded by Facebook Inc.With the departure of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking, the Libra Association now has 21 founding members remaining of the original 28 companies that signed on to the association in June. PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., MercadoLibre Inc. and EBay Inc. in the past two weeks have also said they would abandon the project.The remaining members of the Libra Association, a nonprofit that would manage the cryptocurrency, planned to meet Monday in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its governing charter and initial membership.Libra came under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators as soon as Facebook announced the project. Regulators warned that the cryptocurrency, originally set to launch next year, could be used by criminals if not properly monitored, while lawmakers pilloried Facebook’s track record at hearings in July with Libra co-founder David Marcus.Officials in some countries, including Germany and France, announced that they would ban Libra, saying that the currency could be a threat to monetary policy, among other concerns.Visa, Mastercard and Stripe left the project shortly after receiving a letter from Democratic senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, warning that they could face increased scrutiny if they stayed on board.Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Libra-member Coinbase Inc., on Sunday said the pressure felt “un-American.” “Why the need for the intimidation tactics? This would be called anti-competitive/monopolistic behavior if any private company did it,” Armstrong wrote on Twitter.In the face of the departures, Libra has said more than 1,500 companies have expressed interest in joining the association and that the currency wouldn’t launch until it satisfied regulators’ concerns.Developers have continued to advance the open-source code that would underlie Libra. However, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal could have provided critical experience in navigating U.S. financial regulators’ concerns, making their departures particularly painful. Booking Holdings, which has a market capitalization of more than $84 billion, was among the only remaining large, publicly held companies left in the project.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify next week at the House Financial Services Committee on Libra, among other topics.Representatives for the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.net;Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Libra Loses a Quarter of Its Members as Booking Holdings Exits
2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s just as well that big companies that process and facilitate payments have quit Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, fearing a regulatory backlash. If Facebook really wants to bring financial services to the “unbanked,” it should try doing it on a smaller scale than these companies’ presence promised. And even then, the probability of failure will be high.It’s clear why PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., eBay Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. have decided not to join the Libra Association, which Facebook has been organizing to run the proposed digital currency. They took seriously the recent warning of Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio that because of their membership, they could “expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.” The concern is that a cryptocurrency used in conjunction with encrypted messaging could potentially be used in illegal transactions, and anyone involved in creating such an opportunity would be suspect.U.S. regulators are perfectly capable of scuppering major cryptocurrency projects. On Oct. 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had stopped Telegram Group Inc. from distributing digital tokens, so-called Grams, to the investors who contributed $1.7 billion to the creation of the cryptocurrency last year. These include major U.S. venture capital firms such as Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. The same could easily happen to Libra.That’s the problem with starting so big. Telegram’s token offering was the biggest ever recorded. Facebook made a big announcement on Libra and presented a list of partners that read like a Who’s Who of the payments industry. They envisaged global launches for their cryptocurrencies. Of course regulators and politicians were alarmed.To avoid this kind of outcome, Facebook — whose stated goal with Libra is to offer affordable payment services and loans to people currently priced out of the financial services market — could have tried the strategy that got results for one of its remaining partners, Vodafone Group Plc. Vodafone launched M-Pesa, Kenya’s storied “mobile money,” in 2007, and one of the project’s major assets was the Kenyan central bank’s consent to the launch without any formal regulation. Vodafone’s local cellular operator, Safaricom Plc, quickly built up a network of stores where people without bank accounts could pay in and receive cash, and old-fashioned mobile phones began to double as wallets for transfers and purchases. The lack of regulatory intervention and the large physical network, fed by relatively generous commissions, made sure that by 2019, M-Pesa claimed 37 million active customers in seven African countries. But attempts to transplant the service to many other markets have failed. Vodafone has closed M-Pesa in India (in part because of regulatory obstacles), South Africa (low customer interest), Romania and Albania (apparently it was unprofitable). Vodafone discovered there was no cookie-cutter solution. In different countries, lenders, retailers and mobile operators offered competing services, and regulatory scrutiny varied. To find countries in which to launch such an electronic money service, one would need to go down the list of nations with large populations of the unbanked. The top 20, according to the World Bank, includes big ones, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil.But in most of these countries, people are already using some form of digital money in lieu of dealing with traditional financial institutions. That’s why the list of 20 countries with the smallest percentage of people who have recently made or received digital payments looks completely different.In other words, it’s not easy to find a country where a lot of people have neither a bank account nor access to other kinds of financial services. And then there’s a chance that the cash-using population of a specific country wants to stay that way. One possible reason M-Pesa didn’t quite work in Albania and Romania is that these countries have large informal economies. With up to a third of gross domestic product “in the shadow,” traceable electronic transactions are unattractive compared with cash. These difficulties of finding good target markets, and ones with friendly regulators to boot, should explain Facebook’s desire to launch at scale, to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. But the risk with this approach is that the idea of offering cheap financial services to the unbanked begins to look like a smokescreen for building a huge unregulated bank in the developed world — just what regulators in Europe and the U.S. fear the most.Instead of pushing ahead with the remaining partners and risking the same kind of trouble as Telegram, Facebook should go back to the drawing board and start thinking of smaller projects tailor-made to specific countries’ requirements.

2019-10-15,"When Facebook unveiled ambitious plans in June to spearhead the creation of a global digital currency, co-founder David Marcus promised unprecedented co-operation between some of the biggest names in technology and payments.  “Everyone will play their role,” the Facebook executive said of the 28 initial founding members of his Libra scheme.  Members of the so-called Libra Association became wary of the project after regulators and politicians across the globe warned that a mass-market digital currency could pose a threat to the financial system, as well as lead to money laundering and increased financing for terrorism.",Where it all went wrong for Facebook’s Libra
2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association, which oversees a controversial cryptocurrency, was officially formed on Tuesday, and its five board members have one thing in common: close relationships with Facebook Inc. and its executives.When Facebook first announced Libra, the company was quick to point out that it wouldn’t be alone in managing such an ambitious endeavor. Instead, it hoped to be one out of as many as 100 companies controlling the new digital coin. But as regulatory pressures have mounted and early partners have been leaving the project in droves, Facebook finds itself resorting to close allies to fill the Libra leadership team.David Marcus, who heads the Facebook team that proposed Libra in the first place, is on the board. Marcus is also an investor in Xapo Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Wences Casares is on Libra’s board as well.Joining them is Katie Haun, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which was an early investor in Facebook. Another early Facebook backer, Digital Sky Technologies, is part-owned by Naspers, which has majority ownership of the parent company of PayU, the home of another Libra board member, Patrick Ellis.The fifth board member, Matthew Davie of micro-lending service Kiva, also has ties to Facebook. One of Kiva’s board members is John Muller, associate general counsel at Facebook who, like Marcus, hails from PayPal Holdings Inc.“Silicon Valley boards nearly always have these kinds of interconnections,” Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion, wrote in an email. “Even someone without formal ties to Facebook will have informal and indirect ones. So no one qualified to be on the board is likely to be fully independent of Facebook. But I don’t see the board as being essentially an independent check on Facebook. I see it as a group of qualified and interested people.”The board members and the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.“Yes, David is a very small investor in Xapo like dozens of other people from Silicon Valley. Yes, Wences and David are both in payments and fintech in Silicon Valley and because of that they have known each other for a few years now,” a spokesperson for Xapo said. “Neither David being a small investor in Xapo nor David and Wences having known each other for a few years compromises Wences’ independence in Libra’s board.”The Libra Association board was formed after high-profile exits by a number of companies, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal. The exodus followed scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators who have expressed concern about Facebook’s poor track record in protecting user privacy.Facebook has described Libra as a community effort. But the original group of about 28 partners has dwindled to 21 organizations that signed on as members on Tuesday. Facebook’s challenge will be to convince more companies that there is value for them in a project that has the social-media giant firmly in the driving seat, whether it intended that to be the case or not.(Corrects number of original partners in final paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Libra Association Board Members Have Ties to Facebook
2019-10-15,"Plans for Facebook’s proposed “stablecoin,” Libra, appear to be unraveling.  This is hardly surprising, given growing awareness of Libra’s potential adverse consequences.

2019-10-15,"With Square (NYSE:SQ) stock you're free to believe what both bears and bulls are saying these days. But if you're watching the SQ stock price chart and are agreeable with the company's underlying growth narrative, the argument for a longer-term investment can be made today.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Mobile payments innovator Square stock has its share of fans and foes. Bulls on Wall Street will point to the company's growth prospects as a primary driver for shareholder performance. Most recently, SQ received just that sort of praise from Susquehanna Financial Group.On Friday analyst James Friedman wrote a client note which laid out the case for SQ stock to rally. According to the firm, Square's investments are set to deliver stronger payment growth following August's earnings-driven fallout. Susquehanna went on to raise Square from &quot;neutral&quot; to &quot;positive&quot; and reaffirmed its 12-month price target of $77 a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSurprisingly, Friday also saw Instinet analyst Bill Carcache take a bearish swipe at Square's future stock performance. Shares of SQ stock were given a &quot;reduce&quot; rating. Acknowledged innovation in the payments space, as well as the belief Square's investments will bear fruit nevertheless took a backseat to valuation concerns. Square's ValuationWere recent price tag worries associated with the company's failure to turn a profit? Maybe. But I wouldn't be too quick to think that's the end all, be all. Investing in SQ stock is about looking ahead, not in the rear-view mirror.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals SQ sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 58.2. It has a lower price-to-sales ratio than industry competition PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or even credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V). And Square has much stronger sales growth -- estimated at 44% over the next five years. I have to give the benefit of the doubt to the bulls.Additionally, companies like Square are known to sandbag guidance after a weak quarter. Because of this, I think an upside surprise might be just around the corner.  SQ Stock Monthly Price ChartStocks are fluid and price patterns change. Some of my prior notes on the provided monthly chart of SQ stock could be viewed as support of this non-contestable point. As investors, the best we can do is take imperfect information and work with it as unbiased as possible. It's no easy task.Right now Square stock is poised to align its price action with the company's superior growth potential. Following SQ's August correction, shares managed to eventually find a bottom in September at the 50% retracement level tied to its lifetime cycle low of $8.42 to cycle high of $101.15.The September price action in SQ stock is forming a monthly hammer candlestick and this time frame's stochastics are meandering in oversold territory. It is very approachable now to buy Square's growth narrative, even though shares are still highly contentious.My suggestion is to buy SQ stock above $64.75. This will allow the monthly candlestick to receive a small bit of extra price confirmation above the September high of $63.98. From there, I'd look to take partial profits near $80 and where shares turned lower in August. Ultimately though, Square looks like the type of core growth investment which can be accumulated on weakness and allowed to run on the upside.

2019-10-15,"Since it was spun off from online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July 2015, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has consistently delivered the goods. This year has been no different, with PayPal stock gaining nearly 24% since this January's opening price.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Over the years, I've generally taken a bullish stance on PYPL stock. As a digital-payments processor, PayPal has the distinct advantage of being indefinitely relevant. In recent years, we have witnessed the rise and surging interest in alternative payment vehicles, such as cryptocurrencies. More likely than not, this trend will continue to progress.In addition, this underlining thesis behind PayPal stock aligns naturally with current behavioral trends. According to a Pew Research Center report, &quot;Roughly three-in-ten U.S. adults (29%) say they make no purchases using cash during a typical week, up slightly from 24% in 2015.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterestingly, Pew noted that as income levels rise, so does eschewing cash for digital payments. Logically, this makes perfect sense. Those with higher income tend to have higher education levels, and therefore have access to new technologies. Given that saving time is more of a concern than saving money for more affluent individuals, they're more willing to advantage digital payment solutions. Naturally, this benefits PYPL stock.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now Not surprisingly, millennials love anything to do with digitalization. Since they represent the largest workforce in the U.S., the compass for PayPal stock is appropriately calibrated.However, what is surprising is that older generations are also embracing the conveniences of digitalization. When I look at PYPL stock from a wide angle, the increasing adoption of alternative payments is what keeps me bullish.That said, the third-quarter PayPal earnings report is around the corner, and that's not necessarily great news. Management Must Control the Narrative of the PayPal Earnings ReportOn paper, the upcoming PayPal earnings report - scheduled for release after the close on Oct. 23 - should result in a per-share profitability beat. Going back to Q1 2016, the company at worst has met expectations for earnings per share.This time around, covering analysts expect EPS to come in at 67 cents. This is firmly near the upper end of the estimate spectrum, which ranges from 52 cents to 71 cents. In the year-ago quarter, PYPL delivered an EPS of 58 cents. A 15.5% earnings lift year-over-year is well within reason relative to prior performances.On the revenue front, consensus forecast pegs sales at $4.4 billion. As with earnings, analysts are incredibly optimistic for growth, with revenue estimates ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion.But does all this mean that PayPal stock is an easy buy? Unfortunately, recent news items make the narrative severely complicated.In a much-publicized fallout, PayPal dropped out of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra cryptocurrency project. Later, eBay, Stripe, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and Mercado Pago followed suit.Also, in late September, PayPal announced Chinese government approval to buy a controlling stake in Gopay Information Technology. This groundbreaking event marks the first time a foreign entity has entered China's payment services market.But most critically, PayPal lost $228 million in Q3 because of its investment in Uber (NYSE:UBER), which has been nothing short of volatile.Optically, these news items give the impression that PayPal is biting off more than it can chew. Plus, with its Uber losses, PYPL confirms that some of their bets probably won't pan out for some time. Therefore, the PayPal earnings report in Q3 will be about more than the numbers; investors will look to management to re-instill confidence in a suddenly shaky organization. It's Time to Play the Tactical Game with PayPal StockDespite my belief in the longer-term picture for PYPL stock, I've got to look at reality. For the immediate time frame, the markets are bearish on shares. In this situation, the last thing I want to do is fight the tape.Technically, PayPal stock has dropped below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (DMAs), barometers for nearer-term and longer-term sentiment, respectively. I also believe it's an important clue that the price action has stumbled at the 50 DMA in the past two months. Upside resistance is strong, which implies a future downward trajectory.But even if PayPal stock absorbs a rough outing following Q3, I won't take that as a net negative. Instead, it provides a &quot;time capsule&quot; opportunity for those who wanted to jump aboard but didn't for whatever reason. Although the nearer-term picture is troublesome, the forward outlook is among the brightest in the tech space.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-16,"(Bloomberg) -- MercadoLibre Inc. will “for sure” invest more than 3 billion reais ($718 million) in Brazil next year with a focus on financial services and logistics, Chief Operating Officer Stelleo Tolda said.MercadoLibre, the e-commerce pioneer in Latin America now worth $28 billion, plans to invest more in its financial services and payments unit while opening more distribution centers and seeking partnerships to cut delivery time further, Tolda said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Sao Paulo office.The early guidance on outlays for next year follows investments of 2 billion reais in Brazil last year and 3 billion reais this year. As competition heats up from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and local retailers including Magazine Luiza SA and B2W Cia Digital, MercadoLibre is defending its market share of about 33% and looking to get customers to lean heavier on its services for day-to-day shopping and payment solutions, Tolda said.“We strongly believe in the growth potential of this business, so it’s too early to focus only on profitability,” said Tolda, who met MercadoLibre’s founder Marcos Galperin at Stanford University in the late 90‘s and has been leading the Brazil business since the start, 20 years ago.MercadoLibre, based in Buenos Aires but with operations in 18 countries and shares trading in New York, is offering same-day delivery in Sao Paulo and looking to expand its next-day delivery to at least 16 cities in 2020.The firm currently operates two distribution centers near Sao Paulo and will open facilities in other regions, to speed up its delivery in a country larger than the continental U.S.Brazilian e-commerce has more than doubled to 68.8 billion reais between 2013 and 2018 and should almost double again through 2023, according to market researcher Euromonitor International.The newest focus for the company is on the fast-moving train of fintech services courting large parts of the population without bank accounts.MercadoPago, the payments platform, has been leading growth at the company. The number of transactions more than doubled year-on-year in the second quarter with the value surging 47% to $6.5 billion. That compares to $3.4 billion in gross merchandise value from the marketplace.“We see opportunities not only in payments, but also in all financial services, including credit, investments and eventually insurance,” Tolda said. “MercadoPago is also the way through which we believe we’ll have higher recurrence in people’s lives.”MercadoLibre needs to invest in marketing for the MercadoPago brand and search out companies to provide payment solutions and individual customers to use the virtual wallet. Offering payment with cards as well as with QR codes, MercadoPago has already cut deals with a wide variety of brick-and-mortar companies in Brazil such as gas stations, drugstores and the Sao Paulo subway.MercadoLibre doesn’t plan to spin off the financial products unit, which it sees as a way to increase interactivity with customers and attract shoppers into its e-commerce platform, Tolda said. Currently, the average Brazilian e-commerce consumer buys an item per month and MercadoLibre wants to intensify the frequency of purchases to at least once a week, Tolda said.The company recently opened new categories of no-gender fashion and sustainable products in its e-commerce platform to attract younger consumers. It also plans to expand next-day delivery to 16 larger cities, from eight currently, after closing a deal with the cargo unit of airline Azul SA that could help reduce its dependence on the country’s post offices.MercadoLibre has surged 93% year-to-date to $566 on the Nasdaq. That compares to 18% for Amazon, 28% for Alibaba Group Holding and 39% for EBay Inc.After raising $1.9 billion earlier this year, including a big chunk of it from PayPal Holdings Inc., MercadoLibre is focusing on investment in its core businesses rather than any bold new acquisitions, according to Tolda. Talks are ongoing with PayPal on how to collaborate in several areas despite being competitors.“Theirs is a traditional online payment model, and we’re seeing even greater potential offline than online,” with MercadoPago, Tolda said. “It’s an interesting path, this idea of ‘frenemy,’ that exists in the technology market.”To contact the reporters on this story: Fabiola Moura in Sao Paulo at fdemoura@bloomberg.net;Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Cancel at dcancel@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Richard RichtmyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",MercadoLibre Plans to Double Down on Its Brazilian Bet Next Year

2019-10-17,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile payment fintech (financial technology) company, is expected to report earnings on Nov. 6. In recent years, &quot;fintech&quot; has become one of the most popular buzzwords in the markets. Although it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses and individual clients.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com In 2019, SQ stock is up about 14%, but lately has taken a beating. Square shareholders are now wondering if they should consider buying the stock prior to the earnings release.I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy into the shares just yet. When SQ stock reports earnings in a few weeks, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Can SQ Stock Shake Off Earnings Season Jitters?On Aug. 1, the payment-solutions company reported Q2 earnings that were better-than-expected. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion. And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share.Its payments processing business, also referred to as &quot;payments as a service,&quot; has been a game changer in serving small businesses. Square's subscription and services-based revenue increased 87% to $251 million. Primary drivers behind the growth include the Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Cash App's quarterly revenue of $135 million especially impressed the Street.Gross payment volume (GPV) of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. Square defines GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds.The quarterly report once again confirmed that SQ stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock's losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide. Square Is a Growth Stock in a Competitive IndustryAccording to a recent World Bank research paper by Juan Cortina and Sergio Schmukler, &quot;… the trend toward digitalization and technological innovation will likely reshape the global financial sector and the ways in which financial companies interact with their customers.&quot;Square's rather sticky ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. Through various growth initiatives, management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech sphere.The global payments industry is a $100 trillion-plus market. Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. SQ stock faces competition from many companies, including the global online payments group Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant as well.A growth stock like Square trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions as to whether the group can maintain growth quarter after quarter. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly. Therefore, throughout the year, the SQ stock price has been extremely volatile.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock. Square Stock's Rich ValuationFollowing the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018. Yet over the past year, SQ stockholders have noticed a decline in the growth rate of its gross payment volume. Between July 2017 and the end of June 2018, GPV grew about 30%. Now growth hovers around 25%. Wall Street tracks this metric widely.As growth has declined, so has the share price. Now the shares are hovering around $64. Although the decline in Square's stock has improved its valuation, the shares are still richly valued.Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ's forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 56. On the other hand, forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 29.5, 28.5 and 25.7 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-to-sales ratio is over 6.9x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance. Technical Charts for SQ Signal More VolatilityLet us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the past year.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. However, it had a rough patch after reaching the all-time high in October. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has seen the start of a downtrend in the stock. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.Before this, shares had been up over 45% for the year ahead of the Q2 quarterly results release. On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. By Sept. 24, the stock saw a low of $54.41.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up prior to the earnings report. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be range-bound between $60 and $65, a range where SQ stock has strong support. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology or fintech sectors, then shares may easily go below $60.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point, especially prior to the earnings report. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe so-called fintech revolution is changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers. Square is providing merchants with a wide range of tools and services to start, run, and grow their businesses.Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against Square stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.Square is a high beta stock at 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Thus Wall Street would want to see the next quarterly results to judge whether the current investor skepticism is warranted.Analysts are likely to pay special attention to metrics that would indicate Square stock's potential to continue growing sales and earnings over the next several quarters. I personally would not take sides as to whether the share price will go up or down when the group reports earnings soon.Investors with a 2-3 year time horizon may consider any further price decline in Square shares as a good buying opportunity.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg was ready for a Congressional interrogation on Facebook Inc.’s cryptocurrency project. On the stand for more than six hours Wednesday, he got a lashing on every other controversy facing the social media giant, too.The 35-year-old chief executive officer arrived on Capitol Hill prepared to defend the company’s plans for Libra, describing the advantages of a global digital coin that would help open up financial systems to the poor and underbanked around the world. From the start of his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, however, lawmakers made it clear that beyond the questions they had over the new currency, they are skeptical that Facebook should be trusted with the tremendous power it has amassed over 2.7 billion global users.https://t.co/K2g4PUIriZ— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) October 23, 2019 During the CEO’s lengthy appearance, many of Washington’s grievances about Facebook were laid bare. There were heated questions about Facebook’s refusal to fact-check political ads; accusations of rampant child exploitation on the platform; Facebook’s move to encryption and the impact that would have on the ability to obscure criminals; the company’s continued problems with election interference heading into the 2020 presidential election; what it’s doing to prevent “deepfakes,” or manipulated videos; and critiques of its poor record on workforce diversity.“I think you can appreciate using a person’s past behavior to determine their future behavior,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York. “In order for us to make decisions about Libra, we have to dig into Facebook’s past behavior in respect to democracy.” She then dove into a line of questioning about what Zuckerberg knew and when regarding the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal that erupted in 2018.Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters set the tone early on in a tweet she sent just as the hearing got underway.“Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they’re trying to launch a BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious ZuckBuck?”Waters, a California Democrat, said Facebook should stop work on its cryptocurrency project until the company addresses a series of unrelated “deficiencies” in its social-media business.Zuckerberg vowed to try to address lawmakers’ concerns but also said he hoped to “address the risk of not innovating. I don’t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe in trying new things.”He also conceded that it has been “a challenging few years for Facebook.” The company has acknowledged the unauthorized use of private user information by U.K. research firm Cambridge Analytica, shut down several state-backed disinformation campaigns, been targeted with multiple antitrust investigations and been hammered for taking money to publish false political advertising.Facebook has gone to great lengths to try to rehabilitate its image. For years, Zuckerberg had described his social network’s purpose as “connecting the world,” but that mission ended up as a grow-at-all-costs strategy that created blind spots on how the platform could be used in harmful ways, such as live-streaming terrorist shootings and attacks. Zuckerberg last testified to congress in April 2018, answering 10 hours of questions about how Facebook allowed app developers to collect data on users, and how the platform was used by Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.The company spent a record $4.8 million on lobbying in the third quarter, according to federal disclosures filed Monday, up 70% from the same period a year earlier. Since October 2018, Facebook has hired 12 external lobbying firms to supplement the 11 lobbyists it counts among its own employees, according to the company’s filings. Facebook brought on many of the outside firms to support the launch of Libra.Waters has been one of the loudest critics in Congress of Facebook’s effort to create the Libra digital token. When the social-media giant first announced its plans in June, she almost immediately demanded that the company halt development. Government officials and central bankers in Europe have also raised concerns about how the project would protect users’ privacy and prevent criminals from using it to launder money.Facebook sent David Marcus, the executive who leads the company’s blockchain team and has so far served as the de-facto leader for Libra, to address the same committee in July. He too spent much of his time defending his employer for its previous missteps, and trying to convince Congress that people will be able to use Libra without ever having to use Facebook.Zuckerberg reiterated Wednesday that he has no intention of launching the cryptocurrency without approval from U.S. regulators. That was a point of contention and confusion before the Libra Association was officially formed this month.Though he has made the promise before, Zuckerberg took it a step further on Wednesday, saying that Facebook could even be forced to leave the Libra Association entirely if the group decides to move forward with the currency without approval from U.S. regulators. It’s an unlikely scenario, but Zuckerberg’s suggestion that Facebook could abandon a project it started is meant to appease lawmakers who have pushed back aggressively. Zuckerberg said he wants the project to meet or even exceed U.S. government standards.At the same time, Zuckerberg made the case that if the U.S. doesn’t lead in innovation, specifically in areas like cryptocurrency, then China will leap ahead.“We can’t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don’t innovate,” he said.But members of Congress poked holes in Zuckerberg’s argument that Libra would improve America’s dominance in finance around the world. If that were the case, why would Libra need a home base in Switzerland, with a global roster of members and need to be backed by multiple currencies beyond the U.S. dollar? How would the currency actually work, and would it allow transactions that were anonymous or non-refundable?Zuckerberg didn’t have many answers. The Libra product is still just an idea, and its launch will require agreements by association members on how it will function and fit within global regulatory frameworks. He said he didn’t know whether other Libra members were planning to contribute money to back the currency, and that the idea of anonymous transactions is still “an open question.”Facebook originally had 27 partners that planned to join it in the Libra Association, which is supposed to share in the governance of the cryptocurrency. Recently about a fourth of those original members dropped out, including PayPal Holdings Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, said the departure of those members was a disturbing sign. Zuckerberg said some of Libra’s early partners abandoned the project probably because it was risky and because of the intense regulatory scrutiny. Facebook has made an effort to make clear that the social network won’t be solely responsible for managing Libra.Several lawmakers questioned Facebook’s motives for basing the Libra Association in Switzerland instead of in the U.S. A big part of other crypto companies’ decision to set up in the country is the flexible tax treatment they can get. There has also been much clearer regulatory guidance from the Swiss compared to U.S. regulators like the IRS or SEC. And Zuckerberg said he views the financial infrastructure in the U.S. as outdated.Zuckerberg, who has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies, came prepared with lofty arguments about Libra’s purpose: It could help reduce income inequality by giving people -- including 14 million in the U.S. without access to bank accounts -- an easier, faster and cheaper way to send money around the world. At the same time, it would secure America’s international financial leadership, since Libra would be backed mostly by the U.S. dollar, especially if the cryptocurrency is allowed to launch prior to similar planned efforts in China.But lawmakers pushed Facebook to clearly outline the business reasons for the project -- beyond the pitch meant to appeal to regulators. Facebook envisions Libra being incorporated into the company’s various messaging apps including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The company believes that the currency could help benefit its existing advertising business, or create opportunity for new revenue streams. Zuckerberg said in the hearing that Libra will eventually help boost Facebook’s ad prices, but he later said Libra is more than a business plan and that he’s “certainly not doing this because I am trying to make more money.”At the hearing’s end, there was still no consensus on what lawmakers would need to be comfortable with the project. It’s still unclear what agencies or bodies will regulate Libra and when it will actually launch.Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he’s not sure lawmakers learned anything new.“We don’t have a deeper understanding of how Libra would work.”Zuckerberg will have another attempt to clarify when he responds to potentially hundreds of pages of written questions from the legislators.&#92;--With assistance from Joe Light.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Zuckerberg Gets Thrown a Long List of Grievances by Congress

2019-10-24,"It's one of the busiest earnings days of the years, as an influx of quarterly numbers hit the wires on Thursday. Here's a look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Twitter (TWTR)Sorry bulls, but there's no way to sugarcoat the beating in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Shares were rocked lower by 20% on the day with earnings being the culprit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income Amid the decline, TWTR fell out of its rising channel (blue lines) and knifed right through the 50-week moving average like it wasn't even there.Aggressive bulls may consider a long position in Twitter near $28. However, it may be too tempting on the long side should it get to about $26. That level has been a significant mark in the past, while the rising 200-week moving average is just below. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is getting some much-needed reprieve on Thursday, up over 7% after reporting earnings.While the stock's sharp rally out of its falling wedge is nice, it would have been more attractive if PYPL were to close over its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.From here, see if PYPL can reclaim its 200-day moving average. North of that and bulls may consider a long trade. Below the 61.8% retracement, and $100 or lower may be on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Ford (F)Ford (NYSE:F) stock is not having a good day of trading, falling almost 7% after earnings. $9.40 resistance ultimately held Ford in check and now on the downside, bulls will look to see if $8.40 to $8.50 can buoy the name.Below $8.40 puts the October low of $8.30 on the table. Beneath that and Ford stock may be heading for the $7's. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Ford is a tough stock to own. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: 3M Co (MMM)Earlier this month in back-to-back weeks, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) bounced off the $150 area. This mark was support in 2016 after acting as resistance in 2015.Holding this mark now would be best for 3M Co bulls, particularly after its earnings report. Falling below it could usher in a wave of selling for this dividend stud. On the upside, we need to see a move north of $170, clearing it over short-term downtrend resistance (purple line).From there, it puts $180-plus is on the table, where it will find its 50-week and 200-week moving averages. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Lam Research (LRCX)Despite the doom and gloom of the others, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a breath of fresh air. Shares are up more than 12% to new 52-week highs on the day. That also gave a big boost to chips and semi stocks.Shares have been moving higher in a channel over the past year. That action continues now after its breakout over $240. See that $240 now holds as support on a future pullback, while looking to see if channel resistance does its job and acts as resistance.Keep in mind, the stock has a Fibonacci extension up at $273.85. In combination with channel resistance that area could impede LRCX stock in the short-term, should it continue higher.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-10-25,"Holding a stock through earnings can be highly profitable. It can also be calamitous. At times though, a stock report's aftermath can offer investors a stronger risk-adjusted purchase when the news and reaction align in just the right way. And right now, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) are stocks to buy following earnings after cheers from Wall Street.We'd like to believe otherwise, but how a stock reacts to earnings is a crapshoot at best. For one, there's broader market sentiment and perception to consider. And of course earnings on an absolute basis or results versus consensus and whisper views, as well as guidance from the company are factors every stock faces.All told, there's a lot going on with a company's earnings report. What's more, knowing which of these items or combined influences will hold the most weight for any given quarter is an elusive and losing battle when it comes to which stocks to buy in front of an earnings confessional. But don't despair.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up I'm not trying to frighten investors during earnings season. It's actually a great period to watch for companies of interest, to see if those stocks deliver on their promises, and to see how Wall Street reacts to the report. And if the aftermath looks like TSLA, PYPL or CMG, investors have a short list of stocks to buy with greater confidence. Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla is the first of our stocks to buy following earnings. The EV manufacturer and battle ground stock shocked Wall Street this week with a surprise profit that toppled analyst views and announced solid delivery numbers for its third quarter. Adding fuel to TSLA stock's 18% price spike, the company updated investors with positive news that its new factory in Shanghai is ahead of schedule.Technically, TSLA stock is back on the radar for buying as the post-earnings reaction took shares out of a ten-month long correction and into the right side of a new bullish basing pattern above the 50% Fibonacci level. With shares still off 11% on the year and monthly stochastics supporting the price action, Tesla is a stock to buy.TSLA Stock Strategy: Put TSLA stock on the radar for purchase if a simple pullback over the next several sessions takes hold and a new higher low price pivot within this stock's uptrend is confirmed. PayPal (PYPL)PayPal is our next stock to buy. The payment processing champion offered investors better-than-forecast results this week when it reported on Wednesday. The confessional's highlights include the company's easy profit beat of 9 cents on earnings of 61 cents per share of PYPL stock, 19% year-over-year revenue growth, solid account growth and positive margin expansion.Technically speaking, PYPL stock's bullish reaction to the report has formed a weekly chart hammer candlestick. With the reversal finding support in-between a 50% Fibonacci level tied to 2018's cycle low and its prior base-on-base resistance and stochastics signaling a bullish oversold crossover, PayPal shares are in position for purchase.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch PYPL Stock Strategy: Buy PYPL next week on price confirmation of the hammer low. If need-be, use a blended stop-loss below $99 to exit and look to take partial profits following a breakout to new highs. Chipotle (CMG)Chipotle is the last of our stocks to buy following earnings. The fast fresh restaurateur crushed Street profit views and topped off the report with solid same-store-sales growth of 11% compared to forecasts of 9.3%. The results however took a backseat to Chipotle's announcement the company is investing further in its business by introducing drive-thru service. With investors apparently focused on CMG stock's added costs for its latest initiative, shares took it on the chin by a bit more than 5%.But, technically, investors should be ready to thank Wall Street's nearsighted behavior. The far-from-damaging reaction still finds shares of this stock to buy inside a flat, two-month base that has formed slightly above its former all-time-high from 2016.CMG Stock Strategy: Put CMG stock on the radar for purchase on a pattern breakout through $857.90 with a stop-loss of 7%. Alternatively, if a daily chart reversal pattern above $744 can develop in the coming days, buying Chipotle shares on weakness makes sense. And it goes without saying a stop-loss marginally below the confirmed low is a smart risk-adjusted strategy for buying value without fear of indigestion.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-10-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Visa Inc. rose 0.8% in early Friday trading after the company reported earnings and issued forecasts that topped expectations. Analysts used the same phrase -- “better than feared” -- to describe Visa’s results as they’d used to characterize a report by fellow payments company PayPal Holdings Inc. on Thursday.Visa stock rose the most since Feb. 1 on Thursday to close 2.8% higher, while PayPal closed up 8.6% at the highest since Sept. 23. Visa and Mastercard Inc. have outperformed so far this year, with Visa rallying 34% and Mastercard gaining 43%. That compares with a 26% gain for PayPal, and a 20% rise in the S&P 500.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteVisa makes “compounding earnings growth look easy,” Faucette wrote in a note, as it delivered “another quarter of strong double digitrevenue/earnings growth, with 2020 guidance implying more of the same.”Faucette said that investors are “likely to be positively surprised by slightly better cross border and international growth.” He’s “encouraged by progress in longer-term opportunities.” Maintained overweight rating, lifted price target to $207 as valuation was rolled forward to 2021.MoffettNathanson, Lisa Ellis“Visa’s results were about as in line as they could be, which for Visa means really good,” Ellis wrote. She flagged fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 11% and earnings per share growth of 18%, along with forecasts pointing to “more of the same” in 2020.She added that Visa’s “core volume metrics were in-line, if still a bit sluggish.” And most of the call was spent, as usual, she said, on “strategic topics, with a particular focus on Visa’s new offerings.” Rates Visa buy, with a target price of $210.Bernstein, Harshita Rawat“We remain bullish and view Visa (and Mastercard) as a ‘clean’ secular growth story in payments,” Rawat wrote. “Despite investor concerns, macro appears largely stable, and Visa (and Mastercard’s) earnings are somewhat resilient even in a downturn,” while there’s probably upside from compounding earnings-per-share growth.In the quarter, results were largely in line with expectations when adjusted for non-operational items, including accounting, taxes and interest expense, Rawat said. Revenue was also in line when adjusted for accounting, as “modest weakness” in services and other revenue was offset by lower incentives, stronger international transactions, and data processing revenue.Visa’s 2020 forecast was “modestly ahead of buy-side expectations,” she added, noting that the outlook was a key investor focus going into the results as “many investors were cautious on macro and lapping of a strong pricing year.” Rates outperform, price target $200.Jefferies, Trevor WilliamsVisa’s earning-per-share beat was driven by “top-line upside and a lower tax rate,” Williams wrote. Initial 2020 guidance was in-line with Jefferies expectations, and may have been “better than some feared.”“We continue to like the near-term set-up with a 10%-plus discount to Mastercard despite EPS growth converging, full pricing impact in the first half of 2020, FX headwinds easing, and believe Visa Direct can drive upside,” he saidg(Updates share trading in first and second paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Analysts Call Visa Results Better Than Feared, Like PayPal’s"

2019-10-28,"When will the weakness of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock end? Despite a pretty good year for tech stocks, SQ stock has struggled throughout 2019. And lately, things have been going from bad to worse, as Square stock fell below the $60 mark again recently before making a modest recovery.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Analysts have added to the general negativity towards Square stock. More analysts have &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; ratings on SQ stock than &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;outperform&quot; ratings.That's quite rare, particularly for a promising growth company like SQ. However, analysts are frustrated by Square's uneven profit margins and the lack of certainty regarding its income over the next year. That uncertainty is due to  the company's flood of investments in its non-core businesses. How should investors view the debate around SQ stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction  High-Growth Stocks Have Been Under Some PressureAggressive, high-valuation growth stocks in general have not had a great autumn. The slump of multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud stocks appears to be spreading. For the time being, the collapse of WeWork has caused investors to flee many speculative growth companies. That's an understandable reaction. But some folks may be dumping good stocks along with the losers.Many of the SaaS stocks dropped as much as 30% from peak to bottom before starting to recover last week. Even payment names like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) were getting hit until PayPal came through with great earnings last Wednesday.Now Square stock's drop doesn't look quite so bad. Still, the company has clearly underperformed both its payment peers and the tech sector. The Valuation of SQ Stock Is SteepThe main issue that analysts dislike about SQ stock is that its revenue growth has fallen significantly. Yet the company still hasn't become meaningfully profitable. The forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock still comes in above 50, which is rather steep.A huge valuation multiple would make sense if Square still had a clear path to growth. However, its revenues are decelerating, with its competition mounting. It's far from certain how successful Square's investments outside of its core payment business will be, either. More than 50 times forward earnings and nearly seven times sales is not exactly a cheap price for SQ stock given those facts. Will Cash App Become a Big Success?A big part of the reason for the conflicting narratives around SQ stock is what to make of Cash App. The bulls can certainly make a solid case for Cash App being a strong driver of SQ stock going forward.The revenue of the Cash App ecosystem has reached a run rate of about $1 billion annually. Net revenues are less, of course, but they are still running well over $500 million annually at this point, making up a meaningful part of Square's overall $4 billion in annual sales.And you have to give credit to Square's management team for being innovative. It made bitcoin trading a main feature of the Cash App well before other services got into that game. Similarly, Cash App recently launched an effort to offer free stock trading within the application.Both of those specific efforts come with clear downsides, however. Bitcoin's price has never come close to reclaiming the heights of late 2017, and after a rally earlier this year, crypto is skidding lower again.Meanwhile, the effort to be the Robinhood of stock trading fell flat as Charles Schawb (NYSE:SCHW), TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and a host of other brokerages just announced commission-free trading as well.Consumer financial services is exceptionally competitive, and it's not clear that Cash App has established much of a meaningful and durable competitive advantage. Its business has done well so far, and Square's leadership deserves credit for that. But it's hard to get a good sense of what Cash App will be worth to Square in five or ten years. There are simply too many unpredictable factors at this point. The Verdict on SQ StockI'd love to get on the bandwagon  of Square stock. There's a lot to like about SQ, particularly if it can keep evolving Cash App so it stays on top of emerging consumer trends. SQ certainly has the potential to be a stock that, over the long-run,  produces multiples of one's original investment. And with the shares down 40% from their all-time highs, the entry point is certainly reasonable.That said, there are still a few too many question marks on SQ stock for me to get completely on board. And the bull case seems a bit too easy. Payments is a difficult business; for every PayPal that succeeds, there are  a bunch of also-rans that have fallen by the wayside.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) successfully turned things around, or at least was on the right path until recently. So folks believe that Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both companies, can  potentially achieve similar success with Square. But the payments business is harder than advertising on social media.SQ could certainly be successful. The selloff of tech stocks generally is overdone, and SQ stock will probably bounce going forward There is a lot left to prove in terms of the longer-term investment case, however.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned none of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-06,"The corps of Wall Street stock analysts numbers in the thousands, but at the top stand a select few, those analysts with the experience and savvy to pull together the facts and discern the probable path of the markets. You can find these top analysts, the best of the best, at TipRanks Top 25 Analysts, a list of the Street’s top performing stock watchers.Among these top analysts, there is a standout. Glenn Greene, ranked 3 overall, is also the top analyst from Oppenheimer, the New York City-based investment bank. The big Wall Street firms are also rated at TipRanks, and Oppenheimer holds the 4 spot among the Top Research firms. This combination of a top individual rating with a top institutional rating gives extra weight to Greene’s stock ratings.In the last two weeks, Greene has applied his expertise to the major players in the payment processing sector. Let's take a closer look:Mastercard (MA)We’ll start with Mastercard, by market cap, at $271.4 billion, the second largest credit card company in the world. Strictly speaking, MA is not truly a credit card company; it’s a payment processor. The actual cards are issued by banks or other financial institutions, and branded with Mastercard’s logo. Mastercard, the parent company, collects royalties on the logo and branding use, as well as buyer and seller transaction fees every time such a card is swiped.It’s a solid and profitable business model, as evidenced by Mastercard’s appreciation since the market bottomed last December. MA shares are up 42.6% year-to-date, far outperforming the broader markets. For comparison, the S&P 500 gain this year is 22.7%. In its Q3 earnings, reported late last month, MA showed an EPS of $2.15 against a forecast of $2.01, and reported a 14% yearly increase in gross dollar volume of transactions, to $1.7 trillion.Greene noted, “Mastercard delivered strong 3Q19 results with ~16% CC revenue growth and EPS of $2.15... MA modestly increased core FY19 guidance, which now anticipates the high end of low-teens CC revenue growth... We update our estimates to reflect strong quarterly results and now estimate ~18% EPS growth in FY19, which anticipates continued solid broad-based volume momentum.” Greene’s $312 price target on MA suggests an upside potential of 16% to the stock.Greene is not the only analyst giving MA some love. The shares have a unanimous analyst consensus of Strong Buy, based on 18 recent buy ratings. The average price target of $316 represents a 17% upside from the share price of $269. (See Mastercard stock analysis on TipRanks)Visa, Inc. (V)Visa is Mastercard’s bigger twin. Like MA, Visa no longer issues cards itself – it uses the same model of collecting royalties for branding, plus transactions fees on card use. And like Mastercard, Visa finds the model profitable. In its fiscal Q4, reported last month, Visa showed a 13% yearly gain in revenue, to $5.43 billion for the quarter, and an impressive 21% yearly gain in non-GAAP EPS, to $1.21. Quarterly net income, at $3.03 billion, was also up, gaining 6.3% from the $2.85 billion reported last year. Payment volume – the standard metric of total Visa card use – was up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Visa’s strong growth in all metrics reflects both the increasing use of digital payments and continued high consumer confidence and spending in the US. The first factor is likely to continue supporting Visa into the indefinite future; the second is fickle, but likely to continue for the next 6 to 12 months. Even if consumer confidence declines, Visa, with over $20 billion in total revenues in the last fiscal year, and more than $10 billion in net income, has the resources to hold fast.Those resources were Greene’s mind when he titled his recent note on Visa, “V Finishes Year on Solid Note; Provides Encouraging Outlook.” In the note, Greene pointed out that the company gave an optimistic outlook for FY2020, guiding on low-double-digit credit card revenue growth. He wrote in his bottom line, “We are highly attracted to Visa's powerful brand, vast global acceptance network and strong business model. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular shift from paper currency to plastic, consumer spending growth and increased globalization.” Greene’s $202 price target on V indicates his confidence in 14% growth.Overall, V stock gets another unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. No less than 8 analysts have up-checked this stock in recent weeks. Shares sell for $178, and the average price target of $206 suggests an upside potential of 16%. (See Visa stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal (PYPL)With PayPal, we move away from traditional card companies into the truly digital world. This company led the way in online digital payments, and in the four years since it spun off of eBay as an independent entity, it has grown to $15.5 billion in annual revenue and more than $2 billion in net income. Looking at other metrics of success, PayPal has over 286 million active users across 202 separate markets worldwide. Customers can hold, send, or receive funds in 25 different currencies.Like its more traditional peers, PayPal reported earnings in late October. The company showed a 195 gain in revenue, hitting $4.38 billion for the quarter, and a 25% gain in total payment volume – one of the company’s key metrics – to $178.67 billion. Both revenues and total payment volume beat the pre-earnings forecasts. PayPal’s net income for the quarter was $462 million, or 39 cents per share. The EPS was up 8% from one year ago.Green acknowledged both PayPal’s current strong quarter and its recent headwinds in the opening of his recent note on the stock: “After a disappointing 2Q, PayPal delivered strong 3Q results as revenue grew 19%.” In his bottom line, he wrote, “PayPal has an attractive business model characterized by transaction-related fees, relatively low capital requirements, and strong free cash flow generation... We think PYPL is particularly well positioned to benefit as retail activity continues to migrate from brick-and-mortar stores toward online and mobile venues.” Greene gave PYPL a $125 price target, implying an upside of 24%.Green is certainly not the first analyst with an optimistic outlook for the online payment giant, as TipRanks analytics showcasing PayPal stock as a Strong Buy. With an average stock-price forecast of $127.22, analysts are predicting an upside of nearly 26%. In total, the stock has received 17 'buy' ratings vs. just 4 'hold' ratings in the past three months.

2019-11-07,"Just over a month ago, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was thrust into yet another major transition. CEO Devin Wenig announced Sept. 25 that he was stepping down amid differences with the board. As this transition unfolds, the company will look to sell more assets, leaving it with its core online auctions and e-commerce business.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com However, after years of losing ground to other players, many wonder if the company can save itself.Still, with the online auctions industry growing at a respectable rate, EBAY stock should generate some degree of growth despite changing conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Losing GroundEBAY stock was a darling of the 1990's tech boom. It built an iconic brand based around its online auctions. Founder Pierre Omidyar became a billionaire the day the company launched its IPO, and the stock was among the most revered equities during that decade.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over However, its performance after the boom has brought little reason to celebrate. Its core auctions and e-commerce business has taken an obvious backseat to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, resellers have not responded well to the fee structure eBay imposes, leaving little incentive to choose it over the online retail giant. According to Inc.com, eBay's share of the e-commerce and online auctions market stands at just 0.8%.Also, due to the spinoff of the aforementioned ventures, it has not become a conglomerate like today's Amazon. The company acquired PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in 2002 only to spin it out in 2015. StubHub is met with the same fate as the company seeks a buyer.Moreover, gross merchandising volume for eBay fell almost 5%, the worst performance in several quarters. Interim CEO Scott Schenkel blamed this on the recently implemented internet sales tax. This requires the company to collect sales taxes on behalf of some out-of-state sellers. This adds cost to doing business on eBay. However, it adds costs to everyone else too. Hence, it should become less relevant as the e-commerce industry adapts. Global Online Auctions GrowthDespite these signs of continued struggle, eBay stock bulls have one key sign for hope. Orbis Research predicts that the global online auction market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2%. This bodes well for eBay stock as its name recognition remains high.Moreover, profit forecasts for eBay stock reflect this growth. After average earnings declines over the last five years, analysts expect profits to increase by 19.4% this year. Though they forecast only 5.8% earnings growth in fiscal 2020, Wall Street believes profit growth will return to the double-digits on average.Also, investors can buy this growth cheaply. At the current EBAY stock price of around $35 per share, the forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at just 12.1. With average annual profit growth reaching the double digits, I cannot argue against a mild bull case for eBay stock.No, I do not see the kind of outsized multiples that have benefitted Amazon. Nor should investors expect its dot-com valuation or notoriety to come back. However, it enjoys high name recognition in a niche that still drives respectable CAGR growth. At current levels, I see a trade short term and modest gains over a longer time horizon. My Final Thoughts on eBay StockDespite struggles in the e-commerce industry, eBay stock should continue a pattern of modest growth. Without question, the company has lost much of its prestige it gained in the dot-com boom. It has also struggled to expand its offerings through acquisition. This leaves it primarily an auction and e-commerce business, where it has declined relative to competitors in recent years.However, analysts expect the online auctions business to grow at a 7% rate. They also predict average earnings increases in the low double-digits. This and a low P/E ratio should make eBay stock a profitable trade. Longer term, investors probably will not own the highest-growth name in e-commerce, but they will see growth nonetheless.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-11-08,"On Nov. 6, digital payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) released its third-quarter  financial results.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Square stock has been at the forefront of the fintech (financial technology) revolution. Both the company and the owners of SQ stock have been benefiting from the disruptive shift from physical money to digital financial services and products.In 2019, the SQ share price is up about 15%. In the wake of the Q3 results, I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their overly optimistic growth and share price expectations for the rest of the year. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer of SQ stock below $60, especially if Square stock approaches or goes below $55. Here are the important fundamental and technical issues that are affecting SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Analyzing Square's Q3 ResultsSquare's Q3 revenue and earnings came in above analysts' average outlook. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance.  * 3 Positive Market Signals for the Rest of 2019 Its total revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.27 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items,  was 25 cents, beating the average forecast of 20 cents.The company's quarterly gross payment volume (GPV), or the total volume of payments the company processes, increased 25% YoY to $28.2 billion.Management noted that Square Terminal and Square Register, SQ's newest hardware solutions, are enabling the company to cater to larger businesses, helping drive up Square's GPV. When SQ reports its Q4 results, investors are likely to continue to pay attention to this number.The Q3 report once again confirmed that SQ stock is growing rapidly, thanks to its seller ecosystem and Square Cash, the company's consumer digital money transfer service.In general, growth stocks are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel expectations for growth names need to be toned down, they sell the companies' stocks first and ask questions later.For fiscal year 2020, SQ's management expects low-30% YoY adjusted revenue and gross profit growth. That was viewed as  disappointing by investors.Therefore, SQ stock is likely to be choppy in the next few days. Analyzing the Price Action of SQ StockBy analyzing the price action of SQ stock, we can obtain a better view of what to expect from the shares in the coming weeks.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, the shares have been weak since reaching their all-time high of $99 in late September 2018. Yet, by late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, on Aug. 1 Square stock hit a recent high of $83.20.However, the rest of August was not a good month for Square stock. That was partly due to its weak Q3 guidance, which surprised investors. On Sep. 24, the shares hit a recent low of $54.41.On Nov. 6, prior to the release of its Q3 earnings, Square stock closed at $61.34. Now the shares are hovering around $65.From a technical  perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, SQ stock is likely to be range-bound between $60 and $67.5.The next rally will occur only when long-term investors feel that  the price of SQ stock is justified by its future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point. Square Stock Is Still Richly ValuedAlthough the recent decline of SQ stock has made its valuation more attractive, the shares are still richly valued.While SQ already serves many small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain its growth. Especially if the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.SQ's competition has also increased. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv  (NASDAQ:FISV), which is becoming a global-payments giant.The forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock  is over 54. On the other hand, the forward P/E ratios of PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 29, 28 and  23 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-sales ratio is over 6,3. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500's average price-sales ratio is 2.2x.In short, investors are still paying a hefty premium to own SQ stock. Thus, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in Q4. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and its revenue growth will be more balanced. So Should Investors Buy SQ Stock Now?Fintech is still developing rapidly in terms of total market capitalization as well as the products and services it offers. And the fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers.Therefore, over the long-term, I would not bet against SQ stock. The shares have generated solid long-term returns, especially for those who invested early in SQ. The company is likely to  grow further as the fintech market matures.In the short-term, though, the owners of SQ stock shouldn't expect smooth sailing. I believe the markets are likely to be volatile in the rest of November. Like many momentum plays, Square stock will probably be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.SQ stock has a high beta of 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, SQ rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling.Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings. The hype surrounding fintech stocks, including SQ, can easily cause them to rise quickly and become overvalued.It is likely that Square stock may fall toward $60 or even $55, At that point,  I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until its next earnings release, expected to occur in early February.In other words, I' wouldn't rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position in SQ as the price declines further towards $55.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-08,"Square (NYSE:SQ) had an intriguing bull case heading into its earnings release on Wednesday afternoon. Coming out of the Q3 report, Square stock admittedly still has that bull case.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The problem, however, is that earnings don't look quite strong enough to be the huge catalyst for which bulls were hoping.So far, SQ stock has avoided the fate which befell it after the last three quarters. But an 8% rally seems to price in the news for the quarter -- which means hoping for a rally back to 2018 highs of $100 might be too much to ask for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips SQ Stock Holds up After EarningsFrom a headline perspective, earnings would seem bearish for SQ stock, at least if history is any guide. Both adjusted earnings per share (by 5 cents) and revenue (by a little over $5 million) came in ahead of analyst estimates. But guidance for the fourth quarter was below consensus on both lines.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over That's exactly how the last three quarters played out. And each time, Square stock plunged, falling 14% after the Q2 release, 8% after Q1, and 6% (over three sessions) following the Q4 report at the end of February.This time, however, SQ stock actually gained 1.3% in after-hours trading. And the differing response does make some sense. For one, investors may finally have realized that Square guides conservatively. Second, the company's sale of Caviar to DoorDash is having a larger effect on revenue than projected, which explains the soft top-line outlook for the fourth quarter.This time around, the combination of an earnings beat and soft guidance has moved SQ stock up some 8%. That's a nice gain in context: fellow growth name Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) had a seemingly spectacular quarter and saw its shares plunge in after-hours trading. At least in terms of the initial reaction, investors seem at least content with Square's report. The Details Look MixedIt's also possible that investors are looking beyond the headline numbers -- and there were some interesting developments in the quarter.On the positive side, Square gave yet more detail on its Cash App product. Cash App seems to be competing well against PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo, and apparently it still is.According to figures from the Q3 shareholder letter, Cash App revenue excluding bitcoin in the quarter was $159 million. PayPal said after its Q3 that Venmo had reached an annual revenue run rate just shy of $400 million -- or less than $100 million a quarter.Cash App thus seems to be outperforming Venmo. Square is seeing profits on that revenue too, with gross margins near 80%. Meanwhile, Square is adding new functionality to the app including fractional stock ownership, allowing it to compete with well-known start-up Robinhood and traditional discount broker Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which itself is launching fractional ownership.Cash App performance seems like good news. But initial preliminary guidance for 2020 might shake investor confidence. Square said its EBITDA margins for 2020 would be roughly flat to the ~18% it expects this year.Combined with a guided revenue increase in the &quot;low 30s&quot; on a percentage basis, that suggests EPS growth next year likely below current Street estimates, which project a 41% increase.That projected revenue growth is about in line with expectations (the consensus estimate is for 33% growth). But part of the pressure on SQ stock, which still is down 38% from 2018 highs, has come from increasing fears that competition is catching up.Square management positioned the lower margins as due to sales and marketing spend needed to drive growth -- an investment that will pay for itself in a matter of quarters.  But some investors may worry that the spend is what's needed to differentiate the company in an increasingly crowded space. The Bottom Line on Square StockAgain, Square stock is cheaper, but one concern at the moment is that it isn't necessarily cheap. The 2020 consensus EPS still suggests a 60x forward multiple, and next year's estimates may come down after this quarter's commentary.Even backing out cash, price to 2020 revenue is over 4x on a GAAP basis, and around 8x using the company's 'adjusted' figure which will be discontinued after Q3. Adjusted revenue excludes transaction costs and bitcoin revenue, both of which offer minimal gross profit. In fact, Square made just $2 million in gross profit on bitcoin sales in the quarter.In the market of the last few years, those multiples don't necessarily stand out. But clearly investors have had some worries about SQ's valuation of late -- and those worries have spread to other growth stocks. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), to which SQ stock often is compared, trades 25% below late August highs. Formerly high-flying cloud names have pulled back as well.For that reason, I argued ahead of earnings that the relatively flat trading in Square stock was bullish. It certainly seemed to give Square an opportunity to deliver an earnings release that could re-ignite optimism toward its stock. An 8% rally suggests that case did play out. The problem is that I'm skeptical there's enough in Q3 to keep that rally going.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-12,"The Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched new record highs on Monday. Let's look at a few top stock trades going into Wednesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: S&P 500 ETF (SPY)In late October, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) broke out over multimonth resistance near $300. Since then, it has continued to churn higher, only pausing momentarily to catch its breath.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPressing against $310 now, the ETF is starting to show technical signs of becoming overbought (blue circle).Perhaps the SPY is an excellent buy right here, right now for those with a one-year outlook. Maybe it's an excellent sell. No one will know until we're looking back in hindsight.  * 7 Great High-Yield Stocks With Payouts Over 5% But as it stands, this is at least a chart that should give investors pause about near-term upside. The ideal scenario would be for a pullback down to the $300 level that holds as support. That would be an excellent &quot;go-long&quot; signal, especially ahead of a potential year-end rally.While stocks can continue higher, becoming more overbought may only make the ensuing correction worse. Should shares continue higher, there's a channel resistance mark between $318 and $320, depending on when the SPY ETF gets there.This isn't an alarmist call by any means, but perhaps a signal to consider booking at least some profits and/or holding off on initiating full-sized long positions. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was on fire for a while, but that rally has come to a painful end. Now, shares have been pulling back since July.The $94 to $95 area acted as support last month and PYPL stock is working on putting in a higher low (purple lows).While that's a positive development, this chart has a long ways to go before looking healthy on the long side. In short, bulls need to see PayPal clear downtrend resistance (blue line) and preferably the 200-day and 100-day moving averages as well.Below the recent low at $99.60, PYPL could retest its October low at $94.77. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Disney (DIS)To much fanfare, Disney (NYSE:DIS) launched its Disney+ streaming service on Tuesday. Is it a sell-the-news event? Not necessarily.Shares have put together a relatively tight three-day range, which includes Disney's post-earnings reaction and the launch of its new flagship streaming service. In other words, it's important.Shares are over the 100-day moving average now, and this is the must-hold level of support. Below that and DIS could pay a visit to its 50-day moving average. $140.25 is the post-earnings high and the gatekeeper to higher prices. Beyond this mark and Disney shares can continue to push higher.So long as it's above the 100-day, DIS stock looks okay on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Amarin (AMRN)Shares of Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) are scorching higher Tuesday, up almost 20%. The move filled the July gap near $21 before pulling back later in the session.Trading these big moves can be difficult, but we can use recent ranges to help pick our spots.Over Tuesday's high and the $21 gap-fill, and AMRN stock can rally to $23. This mark has been resistance for about a year now.If shares pull back, see if $19 can buoy the name. If not, the stock could pay a visit to the 200-day moving average, but we'll have to keep an eye on AMRN in this event, as buyers may step in before that. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Overstock (OSTK)Because of Overstock's (NASDAQ:OSTK) wicked volatility, it's one of the few stocks on my personal &quot;do not trade&quot; list. However, just because I do not trade it doesn't mean others do not -- but they should be aware of the volatility, as the chart highlights on its own.Unfortunately for OSTK bulls, this stock made a very decisive move below support between $9 and $9.50, plunging below $8 at one point Tuesday. As long as it's below $9, I would consider Overstock a no-touch.A close back above $9 could get a squeeze going, potentially up to the $11.50 to $12 area. There are plenty of better stocks to bottom fish with than OSTK at this time, in my opinion.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. is consolidating its various payments features into a single product with a new name, with plans to roll it out across all of the company’s apps.Facebook Pay is a rebranding of a number of existing payment features into one user experience across the social network’s apps, the company said Tuesday. You can already make payments in the form of donations and in-app purchases inside various Facebook-owned products, and soon you’ll be able to do that across Facebook’s apps through one system that will store user credit and debit cards.The move comes as Facebook is integrating its services, especially the messaging applications, so that users can easily move between apps and understand Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are owned by the same company. Facebook introduced new corporate branding earlier this month to give more clarity on what products it owns, and the company is unifying its three messaging services so users of one can send messages to people on the others.Some critics have said these efforts are a way for Facebook to defend itself against a possible breakup. The company is under antitrust scrutiny from multiple regulatory agencies, and the idea of unifying its branding, and its messaging and payments products, could be an effort to keep regulators from trying to spin off parts of the Facebook empire.People won’t be able to use Facebook Pay to hold cash, but can use it to store their credit or debit card information for easier use. Existing payments partners like Stripe Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. will continue to process payments for the Menlo Park, California-based company. Facebook is rolling out Facebook Pay to its core social network and Messenger in the U.S. beginning this week, with plans to bring it to Instagram and WhatsApp down the line as well.Facebook is also building a separate digital wallet, called Calibra, for storing and spending its proposed digital currency Libra. That wallet doesn’t yet exist and a Facebook spokeswoman said it is a separate effort from Facebook Pay.&#92;--With assistance from Julie Verhage.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Consolidation Moves Ahead With Payments Tools

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s most ubiquitous company is hiding one of its most valuable assets. That needs to change.Tencent Holdings Ltd., best known for the WeChat messenger that almost everyone in the country uses, has a growing fintech business. But it’s getting overshadowed by the games and social media divisions. By spinning it off into a new company, with a move to a separate listing, management could unlock as much as $230 billion in value. That would make the entity China’s fourth-largest listed company and the world’s sixth-biggest financial services firm.Such a move could help Tencent retake some of the limelight that it’s about to share with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. once that company lists in Hong Kong. Alibaba’s fintech unit, Ant Financial Services Group, already functions as a separate business with the e-commerce giant holding a 33% stake. At Tencent, fintech and business services accounted for 26% of revenue last quarter. The Shenzhen-based company is due to report third-quarter earnings late Wednesday.I estimate that revenue from Tencent’s fintech business grew in excess of 70% last year.(1)  The vast majority of that was payments. Yet Tencent also offers other products such as wealth management and has a 30% stake in WeBank, China’s first online-only bank, which was founded five years ago. Data on its fintech profits are hard to ascertain, yet information disclosed by Alibaba shows that Ant Financial was unprofitable last year, so Tencent could be in a similar boat. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The two rivals are startups in the classic sense, using fast revenue growth driven by marketing and incentives to gain ground fast. A major reason why both have lost money in recent years is due to low take rates, the commissions received from processing payments, because they’ve offered discounts to consumers and merchants. A turnaround could be near, Sanford C Bernstein senior analyst David Dai wrote in a recent series on China’s fintech sector. He estimates that a maturing market will ease cut-throat competition and allow both companies to take a greater share of the money that sloshes through their payments platforms.As a result, Tencent’s payment business (TenPay) alone could be worth $137 billion, compared to $127 billion for Ant’s AliPay, the Bernstein team figures. HSBC Holdings Plc uses two methodologies(2) to come up with an estimated value of around $128 billion. Throw in the other products, and Bernstein calculates a base-case valuation for Tencent’s fintech unit of $160 billion, going as high as $230 billion. This indicates that 40% to 58% of Tencent’s current market cap is locked up in this hitherto hidden division. Bernstein has a base case of $210 billion for Ant, reaching as high as $320 billion.Payments spinoffs have proven to be lucrative in the past. EBay Inc. proved it with PayPal Holdings Inc. in 2015, with the latter posting a 177% normalized return since then, outpacing the 145% rise in the S&P Data Processing sub-index which includes Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. PayPal also trounced both eBay (35%) and the S&P 500 (49%). Square Inc., another payments provider, has been one of the hottest stocks of the past decade, returning more than 590% since its initial public offering in 2015.A more recent example comes from India, where Walmart Inc. is reported to be spinning off payments business PhonePe from local e-commerce company Flipkart Group, which it acquired last year. That transaction could turn a $20.8 billion startup into two unicorns with a combined value of more than $30 billion. Tencent doesn’t need to rush to list this fintech unit. Appetite for mega IPOs is likely to be satiated by Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing and that of Saudi Aramco over the next few months. And there’s a long runway of big startups ready for their moment in the sun. By merely making it a separate entity, management can signal intent and allow investors to start re-rating Tencent’s stock accordingly.An offering may not even be necessary, since Tencent is already sitting on more cash than it needs. Instead, the company could distribute shares in Tencent Fintech to existing shareholders, and then directly list the stock. That’s similar to the approach advocated by activist investor Dan Loeb for a Sony Corp. split.Tencent is sitting on a bright light in this fintech unit. Time to let it shine.(Updates to include reference to third-quarter earnings schedule in third paragraph.)(1) The &quot;others&quot; category includes fintech, cloud, film & TV. Tencent noted that fintech is the major component and gave a figure for cloudbut not content.(2) HSBC Approach 1: valuation per user. Approach 2: Using Tencent operating margins applied to its payments business, then comparing to peers.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Alongside the browser, Honey also offers a growing number of products and services, including price tracking tools, an offers and rewards program, and a virtual shopping assistant. With roughly 30k merchant brands on board (i.e. Amazon), the company has generated over $1 billion savings for its users over the last year.4-star Rosenblatt analyst Kenneth Hill was caught off guard by the recent announcement, noting, “We had been expecting some M&A activity on the consumer side but were a little surprised by the size and online focus of the transaction. That said, this makes strategic sense to us... finding increasingly differentiated ways to monetize all sides of a robust ecosystem through innovative technology. More specifically, we note that Honey's $100mn in revenue for 2018, growing at 100%, is a nice building block as Honey joins the PayPal ecosystem.”The purchase resonates with Hill, who reiterated a Buy rating on PayPal stock, along with a 128 price target, which implies about 25% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Hill’s’s track record, click here)Further adding to the bulls’ charge is 5-star Nomura analyst Bill Carcache, who believes PayPal has “the greatest optionality in payments.&quot; The analyst points to PayPal’s recent acquisition of GoPay as a move which opens up opportunities in cross border retail, and further positions PYPL for more partnerships with other Chinese financial and technology companies. Carache said, “PYPL’s share of payment network volumes has quadrupled over the past decade, and we expect these share gains to persist with PYPL’s TPV (third party verification)  (excluding Venmo and EBAY) growing &gt;2.5x faster than the payment networks.”With this in mind, Carache reiterated a Buy rating alongside a price target of $139, implying a surge of more than 33% over the next twelve months. (To watch Carache’s track record, click here)Overall, the Street thinks PayPal stock is trading at a discount right now. With 21 Buys and 3 Holds, the consensus among analysts is that the fintech leader is a Strong Buy. Its $127 average stock-price forecast implies 24% upside potential from its current price of $102.55.

2019-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. fell as much as 1.9% early Thursday after the payments company said it will acquire online coupon site Honey Science Corp. for about $4 billion, its largest-ever acquisition. Some analysts praised the deal’s strategy and growth potential, but others flagged the steep price and wondered whether Honey was the best M&A target for PayPal.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:SunTrust, Andrew JeffreyJeffrey in a note recommended that investors stay on the sidelines as “this is not the deal PayPal needs to secure its position among premium valued network stocks.”Instead, SunTrust views Honey as a “sort of ‘shoot-the-moon’ attempt to more deeply entrench PayPal in the consumer e-commerce experience while also bolstering its merchant value proposition. Unfortunately for investors, the company is paying a large premium, in our opinion, for an unproven solution which does little to advance its ability to monetize beyond e-commerce.”Though PayPal can probably “elegantly integrate Honey into its core app and Venmo,” it may not “significantly advance the company’s market share amid rising competition,” he said. The deal also “does nothing to extend PayPal’s physical world reach, where 85%-plus of all transaction volume occurs.” Jeffrey did flag one positive: Honey is a small acquisition relative to PayPal’s market cap, which may limit downside risk. He rates shares hold, with a price target of $105.Raymond James, John Davis“While the strategic rationale makes a great deal of sense as it touches both the consumer and merchant side of PayPal’s platform and the cross sell opportunities are significant, it certainly didn’t come cheap,” Davis wrote. “Any way you slice it, $4 billion is a lot to pay for a company making little to no money.” Rates shares outperform, with a target price of $122.MoffettNathanson, Lisa EllisThe acquisition is “strategically attractive” for PayPal, as it’s imperative for the firm to strengthen its network by enhancing merchant and consumer value propositions as the “wallet wars” wage on, Ellis wrote in a note.Buying Honey is “well aligned with this critical strategic priority,” as Honey’s tools will strengthen PayPal’s suite of merchant services while integrating Honey’s services into PayPal and Venmo apps will boost consumer engagement, she said.Ellis views the $4 billion price as “consistent with comps for other small, high growth firms in payments and tech,” like PayPal’s iZettle deal. She rates shares buy, with a target price of $135.BofA, Jason KupferbergKupferberg views the deal as “strategically compelling” as PayPal can leverage the high-growth asset to “generate meaningful revenue synergies over time.” That’s even as the $4 billion value “represents a steep revenue multiple,” he said.The purchase also “represents a new breed of acquisition,” he added, as PayPal has in the past mostly acquired payments companies but now seeks to go “deeper into the e-commerce ecosystem by moving up to the front-end of the shopping experience as opposed to being on the back-end at checkout.” He flagged that Honey is working with 30,000 merchants including Expedia, Macy’s, Priceline and Sephora.Kupferberg expects PayPal will update its outlook on its fourth-quarter earnings call in January to include Honey. He doesn’t see the proposed deal changing the company’s capital allocation policy, as PayPal “has the balance sheet flexibility for continued share repurchases and additional M&A.” Keeps buy rating, target $127.(Updates share trading in first paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Janet FreundFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Slips as Wall Street Questions Benefits of Honey Deal

2019-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. will acquire Honey Science Corp. for about $4 billion, its largest-ever acquisition, adding a startup that amasses valuable data on consumer buying habits and doles out coupons for online bargains.About 17 million people use Honey apps or web browser extensions to find discounts at online shopping sites. The startup was profitable in 2018, PayPal said in a statement. Shares of the payments giant were little changed in extended trading.Honey is valued at almost twice what PayPal paid for its next-largest deal, iZettle, the Swedish provider of small-business services it purchased in 2018, and marks the first major acquisition this year. Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has signaled that PayPal, with more than $10 billion in cash, is on the hunt for more deals after a string of takeovers last year that included Hyperwallet and Simility.“You can expect us to be acquisitive going forward,” Schulman said on a conference call with analysts this summer. PayPal looks at hundreds of potential deals every quarter and sees them as a way to expand globally and accelerate development of new products, he said. Schulman described acquisitions as “a part of who we are on an ongoing basis.”Honey, which was founded in 2012, will keep its base in Los Angeles, and the founders will continue to run the business. The company’s services include a browser extension that automatically applies coupons at e-commerce sites. In a statement, PayPal said that Honey’s capabilities will give its customers a better shopping experience, and help merchants drive sales, partly with more timely and personalized offers.Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, said the acquisition would help PayPal make “significant advances” toward becoming more relevant to users. It could also give customers and merchants a reason to choose PayPal “in the face of increasing competition from tech companies, such as Facebook Pay.”As a shopping-focused browser extension, Honey has access to large amounts of customer data. Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said that PayPal typically uses that information for purposes like fraud prevention. She added that if there were to be a privacy issue over data at the combined company that limited its use, some abilities, like targeted offers, could be curtailed.(Updates with Honey details starting in the fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, ;Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal to Acquire Online Coupon Site Honey for $4 Billion

2019-11-22,"Letting people say what they want, to whomever they want, is great for business and makes a great business. But when liberty becomes license you have a problem that doesn't scale. It's like a huge, crowded theater with thousands of people shouting &quot;fire.&quot; This is the problem Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) faces, as it tries to save the free web from government intervention.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Facebook used free services to build a scaled cloud network worth $564 billion, as trading opened on Nov. 22. Defending the $19.5 billion in annual free cash flow that results is becoming expensive.Even artists who rely upon free speech are now attacking Facebook for enabling hate speech while critics of the business model attack it for collecting data that keeps the service free.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven the First Amendment isn't absolute, and advertising is under more restrictions than other types of speech. But these are local (and national) ordinances. Facebook is a global business. The question for 2020 is whether Facebook's freedom, and ours, can survive. Facebook GovernanceGovernment is a human activity. It's all about learning to handle exceptions. It doesn't scale well.Facebook doesn't like embracing governance, but it's essential to freedom. Government can legislate when speech is out of bounds and move against the speakers. Facebook can't, and apparently won't.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market That's because any limits on what can be posted would require constant, expensive monitoring that would threaten the business model. Facebook brought 27% of the last year's $66.5 billion of revenue to the net income line. It had $52 billion of cash and cash investments at the end of September, and no debt, even with a capital budget estimated at $15.3 billion per year.This has let Facebook disintermediate all the world's phone companies. Not just America's AT&T (NYSE:T), but telephone and postal services in Africa, Asia and South America that once limited communication in the developing world. Free internet services have brought an estimated 1 billion people out of abject poverty since Facebook's founding in 2004.It's this traffic, now being unified to try and stave off antitrust action, that is Facebook's secret sauce, and the world's biggest headache. Facebook MoneyHaving been stymied in its effort to launch a crypto-based payment system called Libra, Facebook is going it alone with Facebook Pay. This is an in-app payment system that has already turned its Instagram service into a virtual shopping mall.In theory it's no different from services like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pay. Users load their purchase credentials and Facebook handles the back end. It's built on an alliance Facebook has had with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) since 2016.But bringing Facebook's low costs to international payments is seen as a threat, not just to Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), but to functions now conducted by government. The Federal Reserve has warned that putting such international money flows into entirely private hands is dangerous.Is it any more dangerous than putting the definition of free speech in private hands? The Bottom Line on Facebook StockAs Facebook keeps expanding, it naturally is entering areas previously untouched by non-government entities. But Facebook refuses to create the bureaucracy governments depend upon to maintain ordered liberty, however they define it.Who can say what without getting into trouble? Who defines value and oversees the transaction? These are big questions, and the different answers define the modern nation-state.Now comes Facebook and the free web, promising one ring of open rules. One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.Freedom has always been the threat the web posed to governments worldwide.

2019-11-22,"After falling sharply in early August and into September, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has made a slight rebound. Shares have climbed above the $60 price level, and closed yesterday at $67.42 a share. As SQ stock inches closer to the $70 price level, is now the time to buy?Source: Shutterstock Maybe not. True, the company's Nov. 6 earning releasecame in better than expected. But with shares trading at a rich valuation and competitors stepping up their game, it's important to note that Square stock is rife with risks. However, with last summer's beat-down of the share price, upside is also a possibility.Let's take a closer look, and see why all bets are off with SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Stock is Starting to Feel RivalsFor the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2019, SQ sales were up 44% year-over-year, to $1.27 billion. But, this was only a slight boost from the prior quarter ($1.17 billion). Adjusted EBITDA came in at $131 million, up 85% from the prior year's quarter. Square reported adjusted revenue figures, but after an SEC comment letter, will discontinue using this non-GAAP metric. That adjusted revenue number consisted of revenue net of transaction and bitcoin expenses. The company used this figure to make it easier to compare results to peers.  * 5 Lottery Stocks With Triple-Digit Upside The company's Seller Ecosystem continues to grow, albeit at a slower clip. Sales were up 27% YoY. Square built its reputation by offering a seamless payment platform for small businesses. But now, other major payment players are looking to offer compelling alternatives to Square's Seller Ecosystem products.Fiserv's (NASDAQ:FISV) Clover Payment System is an example. With increased competition, Square's sales and marketing costs are projected to rise 48% this year. As a result, this competitive pressure could hurt margins, and make it tougher for Square stock to deliver prior rates of growth.But on the business-to-customer (B2C) side, SQ stock may have a catalyst in play. Square's growth driver this quarter was the Cash App platform. Cash App revenue grew 115% year-over-year, to $123 million. But Cash App also faces heavy competition from deep-pocketed peers. PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo is Cash App's main competitor. Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) recent launch of its Facebook Pay application could also impact Cash App's growth.Analysts are mixed whether Facebook Pay is a threat. RBC analyst Dan Perlin sees it as a negative for PayPal and Square stock. But MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis views it differently, seeing Facebook Pay as a facilitator of e-commerce, rather than a &quot;neobank&quot; like Cash App. SQ Stock Remains Richly Priced to Payment Processing PeersThe jury's out whether the emerging competition will hinder SQ sales growth. Analysts project sales of $2.85 billion in 2020, up from $2.24 billion in 2019. That means approximately 27% growth for the coming year.High growth is required to justify the valuation of Square stock. Shares continue to trade at a substantial premium to peers. Square's forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio (non-GAAP forward P/E ratio) is 86.1. In contrast, competitor PayPal has a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 34.1. Square's EV/EBITDA ratio is a staggering 360.7, compared to just 36.2 for PayPal.Looking at traditional payment processors, the valuation premium for Square stock is more substantial. Visa (NYSE:V) trades at 29.2x forward non-GAAP earnings. Its EV/EBITDA ratio is 25.5. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trades for 37.1x forward earnings, and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 30. Stay on the Square Stock SidelinesEven with challenges to its business, Square stock remains overvalued. While the company's growth somewhat justifies a high valuation, compared to peers the stock is irrationally priced.  * 9 Tantalizing Dividend Stocks for 2020 How long can SQ stock trade at such a premium? I see one of two things happening to the shares in the coming months. Either the company takes another dive on missed expectations and greater competition. Or shares remain stagnant, as the company attempts to &quot;grow into its valuation&quot;.Either way, there's limited upside with SQ stock. But the company could surprise me. The success of Cash App shows Square can move from one success to another. Perhaps the company can innovate again, create another next-level financial service the moves the needle. Cash App is making big moves into commission-free trading, startup Robinhood's turf.It's tough to predict whether Square can parlay its payments processing success into becoming a fintech financial supermarket. But at the current valuation, I'm not willing to take that risk. All bets are off where Square stock will trade in 2020. Therefore, I prefer to stay on the sidelines.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-27,"Despite all of its growth, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a slight problem. It used to have the digital wallet and online payment market all to itself. But these days, PYPL is facing some pretty big competition from a variety of start-ups and even traditional banks. Getting its mojo back and fighting off that competition are its main concerns.That is why PayPal's acquisition of Honey is a pretty sweet deal for PayPal.While Honey may not be well-known to many investors, its user base is constantly growing and it fills an important niche in PayPal's ecosystem. That is, Honey, which enables its customers to find deals, will enable PayPal to interact with consumers  before they process their payments, As a result, PayPal will be able to hook them in early and funnel them into its system.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Honey acquisition makes a ton of sense for PayPal stock because it will enable the company to fight off much of the competition that's now eating away at PYPL's market share and revenue, thereby undermining PYPL stock. In the end, PayPal's biggest acquisition to date is going to be one honey of a deal.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in December  PayPal's Growing ProblemsCompanies know they're doing well when everyone starts copying them and offering similar services. That's been the case for PayPal. It basically designed the online digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment markets. That first-mover status has been wonderful for PayPal's bottom line for years now. Perhaps it's been too good.These days, competition runs deep in the digital payment space. Companies like Stripes and Square (NYSE:SQ) have moved into payment processing and peer-to-peer payments, while companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have built digital wallets directly into their hardware.And threats continue to mount for PayPal stock.Social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recently unveiled its new Facebook Pay application. Facebook Pay allows users to directly pay individuals and businesses across FB's entire ecosystem.Facebook users who see something they like on Facebook Marketplace can now instantly buy it from a seller. And with Instagram now basically becoming a shopping app, integrating direct payments eliminates a step in the buying process.All of this is a huge problem for PYPL stock, as PayPal was traditionally the facilitator of all of these transactions. And while its revenues and volumes haven't been hurt just yet, some cracks in PayPal's armor are starting to emerge. For example, on Apple's last conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the number of Apple Pay transactions exceeded PayPal's and that Apple Pay was growing nearly four times as fast as PayPal. Honey to The RescueWith mobile payments being such a huge part of its current and future revenues, PayPal had to do something to keep its leadership position entrenched. So, it turned to a relatively unknown start-up , Honey,to do just that.Honey's basic M.O. is helping consumers save money on various e-commerce transactions. It offers a suite of price-tracking tools, coupon codes and a rewards program called Honey Gold. The rewards program provides cash back to Honey's users. All of that is done via mobile devices, the traditional web or automatically through a Chrome browser extension.Here's where it gets interesting for PayPal. By buying Honey, PYPL can basically move ahead of the line and into the deal discovery stage of shopping. And once consumers find those deals, their default choice for paying for them will be PayPal's system.That could be particularly lucrative for PayPal, since a main feature of Honey's mobile app allows consumers to load a shopping cart with multiple retailers' items and pay for them all at once. By using PayPal's OneTouch authorization or its Venmo payment system, consumers would be able to  pay for the products offered by Honey very easily.On the flip side, Honey will help PayPal's merchant partners as well. Those 24 million merchants now will have the ability to publicize targeted, more personalized promotions and incentives to Honey's users, enabling the businesses to attract more consumers. That could be a great way to increase their sales. Meanwhile, PayPal will get a cut of both the advertising/promotion charge and the payment processing fees.And when looking at PayPal's user base of nearly 300 million, the acquisition makes a ton of sense. Right now, Honey has only 17 million users. By increasing its size and making it available to all PYPL users, PayPal will create a cycle of more deals,higher payment volumes and continued growth for itself.Most importantly, Honey gives PayPal an edge over its rivals and creates an enclosed shopping ecosystem and a huge competitive advantage that will help it prevent further market share losses. The Honey Acquisition Will Be Great for PayPal StockLooking at the digital payment environment, one thing is clear: Every firm is trying to offer a closed system that locks in users. By buying Honey, PayPal is now essentially doing that. Honey's app will allow PYPL to jump into the front of the line, hook consumers in with deals, facilitate payments and reward them for their shopping. That will keep them coming back for more discounts and keep them in PayPal's system.For the owners of PayPal stock, that is wonderful news because the deal will help PYPL fight some of the rising competition that it now faces.Ultimately, the $4 billion price tag may seem like a drop in the bucket over the long haul as Honey is integrated and the cycle gets cooking. So the deal gives investors a new reason to be bullish on PayPal stock.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

All three sit well off 52-week highs, and actually have weakened in recent months while the rest of the market has gained.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in December A reversal isn't guaranteed, or necessarily likely, for each of these stocks. But should positive market sentiment hold, they could be targets for investors looking for value in an increasingly expensive market. At the very least, these big stock charts suggest potentially big moves at the end of the year and into 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PayPal Holdings (PYPL)Source: Provided by Finviz One curious aspect of the recent rally is that payment stocks like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been mostly left out. But that may change. The first of Wednesday's big stock charts shows a recent bounce that sets up a potential breakout:  * PYPL stock has exited its downtrend and made a bullish reversal out of a descending narrowing wedge. The 20- and 50-day moving averages have been cleared. And volume has picked up in recent sessions. The 200-day moving average is the last potential source of resistance to a breakout; that aside, the chart here looks exceedingly bullish from a near-term standpoint.  * Again, PYPL stock hasn't been alone in underperforming. Payment stocks have been among the market's best the last few years: PayPal stock, for instance, has nearly tripled in the last five years. More recent trading has been softer. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have traded sideways for the past few months. Square (NYSE:SQ) bounced along its lows. There are signs of life, however. SQ stock has rallied and MA stock is challenging all-time highs reached in early September.  * It wouldn't be surprising to see PYPL stock (and potentially V stock) follow those peers. The sector should in theory do well in a bull market, as it has for the past decade. A 30x forward earnings multiple for PayPal stock isn't cheap, but it's reasonable in the context of the 14% profit growth expected next year. Certainly, there are stocks posting lower growth with higher multiples, as Tuesday's big stock charts showed. In that context, the case for a breakout in PYPL looks even stronger. Macy's (M)Source: Provided by Finviz Intrepid investors have been willing to step into the steep decline in Macy's (NYSE:M) stock in recent months. Support has held on several occasions above $14. M stock has rallied in recent sessions after selling off last week following disappointing earnings from rival Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and its own subpar third quarter release. But the second of Wednesday's big stock charts shows that support is getting weaker:  * The multiple bottom in M stock usually would be considered bullish, as support has held repeatedly. But the lower highs create a descending triangle, which creates an increased risk that Macy's stock will break through that support. The long-term chart is even weaker, showing a steady and concerning pattern of lower highs and lower lows, at least until the last few months.  * To be sure, Macy's stock seems almost absurdly cheap, at less than 6x this year's consensus earnings per share estimate. A nearly 10% dividend yield seems to add to the value case. But Q3 earnings were notably weak, and included the company's second guidance cut this year. Commentary on the Q3 earnings call seemed to imply that the payout could be cut. If earnings are headed for a permanent decline, even a multiple under 6x isn't cheap enough. After all, Macy's stock has looked cheap for years, but touched a post-crisis low in August.  * And so the case for M stock seems to come down to its real estate. A partnership with Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) sparked optimism earlier this year. Hedge fund Starboard Value pushed for real estate joint ventures in early 2016 before exiting its position the following year. If investors see value in the real estate, have trust in management, and stay as bullish as they've been of late, perhaps M stock finally can rally. That does seem like quite a few 'ifs,' however. Iron Mountain (IRM)Source: Provided by Finviz Fundamentally, data storage real estate investment trust Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) looks like a steal. 2019 guidance for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a common measurement of REIT profits, suggests a roughly 11x P/AFFO multiple. A 7.5% dividend yield looks attractive as well.But the third of our big stock charts does suggest near-term weakness, and looking closer there are fundamental concerns:  * Tuesday's decline pushes the stock out of an ascending narrowing wedge -- a classically bearish signal. IRM stock also broke through its moving averages, which leaves little in the way of near-term support. With resistance holding at $34, there's not much case for jumping in just yet.  * Fundamentally, it's true that IRM stock is cheap. But there are real risks here. Increasing digital storage limits the demand for Iron Mountain's services. A plan to pivot to data centers has moved slower than hoped. Ian Bezek last month called IRM stock a potential dividend trap, and he makes a good case.  * And so there's clear downside risk. A bull market might give IRM stock a reprieve, and better news on the data center front could change the narrative. Still, at the very least, investors might want to wait for a better entry point.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-29,"Founded back in 1979, when it acted as a floor broker on the New York Stock Exchange, Rosenblatt Securities has grown and adapted, becoming a major figure in the agency brokerage niche and the largest single broker on the NYSE floor. Analytics and research are key to success in investment banking and floor trading. After all, it’s impossible to know the right market moves without knowing what’s happening behind the scenes of potential equity investments. Rosenblatt’s market research arm delves into the depths, finding out what makes stocks tick, so the firm’s clients can make the best-informed decisions.Today, we’ll look at Rosenblatt’s annual report, entitled &quot;Our Top Core Holdings Ideas to Celebrate Rosenblatt's 40th Anniversary,&quot; to outline the firm's ‘top picks.’ These stocks picked out by top-rated analysts and investors should take note.Specifically, we'll take a look at three stocks that are more purely tech-oriented, that have changed the game in their particular niches, and brought impressive gains to investors. Adding to the good news, TipRanks’ Stock Screener shows that each has racked up enough analyst support in the last three months to earn a “strong buy” consensus rating.Let's take a closer look and see why these stocks truly are top picks:Splunk (SPLK)As if to underscore the importance of data analysis, Splunk is first on our list here. This San Francisco-based software company offers products that monitor, search, and analyze the machine generated big data, indexes and correlates the results, and makes the whole available to customers through a browser-style interface. In short, Splunk makes it easy for its customers to use all of their accumulated information. In recent years, Splunk has also begun offering software products for security analytics and Internet of Things applications.Businesses need Splunk’s products, and that need has powered Splunk’s success. The company’s EPS, at 58 cents, beat the estimate by a significant margin and was also 52% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues were strong, too, and at $602 million showed a 29% year-over-year gain. With fast growth rates like those, you won’t be surprised to learn that SPLK is up 44% in 2019.5-star Rosenblatt analyst Yun Kim reviewed SPLK and came away deeply impressed. In a list of reasons to own shares in the company, he wrote, “[Splunk is the] emerging de facto enterprise standard in IT, along with the likes of CRM, ORCL, SAP and MSFT... It is at the foundation of the current data-driven digital transformation secular trend… We also note that SPLK closed 24 $10M+ deals last year and 10 such deals two years ago, indicating more of its customers are adopting SPLK as its enterprise standard.”A growing industry consensus that Splunk is the way forward for data aggregation, combined with an increasing number of major sales, led Kim to give SPLK a Buy rating and a $200 price target – suggesting an impressive 32% upside. (To watch Kim's track record, click here)Kim’s bullish stance on Splunk is in line with Wall Street’s view. SPLK has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on no less than 25 Buy ratings set in recent weeks. Shares are trading for $149.37, and the stock’s recent strong gains have pushed that price close to the average price target of $158.43, leaving a modest 6% upside. If Splunk continues to perform, expect the analysts to adjust the target upwards. (See Splunk stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal (PYPL)PayPal’s impressive growth has been powered by its domination of the payment processing niche. The company has turned digital payments into the preferred method for online transactions, helping move along the dramatic expansion of e-commerce in recent years. The rewards have been substantial: in fiscal 2018, PayPal saw more than $15 billion in revenues, and over $2 billion in net profits. For 2019 the stock has gained 28%, even after slipping from its peak price in July. This gives PayPal a 3-point advantage over the S&P 500’s year-to-date growth.A look at the company’s Q3 report will show some details of the growth. Total payment volume, a key metric of the value of transactions put through PayPal’s system, rose to $178.67 billion, growing 25%. Revenue was up 19% to $4.38 billion, and EPS showed an 8% year-over-year gain to 39 cents. But the best news for investors was the revision to full-year 2019 EPS. The company bumped it up to $3.07, 3.3% higher than the Street’s expectations. Growth in every metric, and plenty of share price appreciation make PYPL a winner for investors.5-star Rosenblatt analyst Kenneth Hill sees room for an additional 18% upside in PYPL shares. Hill points out several of PayPal’s positional advantages: “Best-in-class, two-sided ecosystem with PayPal’s and Venmo's more than 275mn active Consumer accounts and 24mn Merchant accounts… Clear path ahead to increasing Venmo monetization from Pay with Venmo and Venmo Debit/ Credit, in addition to Instant Transfer… Long-term potential to be a first mover in Asia… complimenting efforts in Europe and Latin America…”Hill sees PayPal with a strong competitive advantage, and puts a $128 price target on the stock to compliment his Buy rating. (To watch Hill's track record, click here)Wall Street generally agrees with Hill. PayPal’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 22 Buys, and only 3 Holds. The average price target, $125.86 suggests that PYPL still has room for 16% growth. (See PayPal stock analysis on TipRanks)RingCentral (RNG)The emergence of cloud computing has brought sea-changes to every imaginable niche in the business world. RingCentral has connected it to the world of communications, providing software solutions to combine office computer and telephone systems. The company’s core product, RingCentral Office, is compatible with other popular applications like Salesforce, Outlook, Google Docs, and DropBox, while providing unique features in call forwarding, multiple telephone extensions, video conferencing, and screen sharing. In short, RingCentral lets customers link and control all of their office communication systems.In Q3, RingCentral posted EPS of 22 cents, beating both the analyst consensus and the year-ago number by 15%. The company’s stock has surged in recent months, bringing its year-to-date gain up to 108% – RNG has more than doubled in value in 2019, and the year’s not over yet. A couple of additional numbers from the recent quarter make it clear why RNG has gained so much. The company’s software subscription increased 33% year-over-year, to reach $210.9 million, while revenues grew to $233.4 million. And while the company was posting this growth, it was also boosting R&D expenditures by 30%.Analyst Ryan Koontz wrote up Rosenblatt’s note on RingCentral, summing up the bottom line in a clear, bullish stand. He wrote, “While RingCentral’s products are strong and arguably the best in the industry, we are most impressed with RingCentral’s commanding go-to-market strategy and execution. The company has built an industry leading team... RingCentral is the largest UCaaS vendor in the market and has continued to take share, growing revenues faster than all of its major competitors.” Koontz was especially cognizant of RingCentral’s new strategic partnership with Avaya, a leader in contact center technology. The joint endeavor was announced this past October and has generated great excitement in the industry.Koontz puts a $210 price target on RNG shares, implying a 22% upside to the stock. Wall Street is in general agreement with his stance, although more conservative on the price target. RNG’s Strong Buy analyst consensus is built from 14 Buy ratings and a single Hold, while the $186 average price target is 8.6% higher than the current $171 share price.

2019-12-03,"(Bloomberg) -- When two Irish brothers started Stripe Inc. together in 2010, there was little question about where they should put their headquarters. It had to be California.Now, though, Stripe is leaving the tech mecca of San Francisco, awash in tech talent and investor cash, and is in the process of moving its main office about 10 miles to neighboring South San Francisco. What’s more, the company—whose $35 billion valuation makes it one of the world’s most valuable startups—is currently building up its staff in another state altogether: New York.In September, Stripe opened an office near Wall Street the company told Bloomberg, and plans to add several hundred employees there in the coming years. The startup’s planned New York growth is on track to outpace its headquarters’.The city has long been a hub for finance, and more recently for tech. “New York is a global leader,’’ said David Singleton, Stripe’s chief technology officer. “It’s just an important market for entrepreneurialism and startups.”Stripe is one of many Bay Area-based fintech companies now building up a New York presence. Plaid Technologies Inc., which connects various apps to customers’ bank accounts, has relocated or hired more than 100 people in the city over the last year, or about a quarter of its staff. Affirm Inc., the lending startup founded by former PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Max Levchin, also recently opened up a Manhattan office that has about 50 employees, the company said. And Brex Inc., the business credit card startup most recently valued at $2.6 billion, has permanently relocated its chief financial officer to Midtown, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing information that’s not yet public.In some ways, the moves are natural for tech startups with financial ambitions. Despite the growing success of fintech upstarts hailing from San Francisco, Wall Street institutions remain on top of the financial world, and New York offers an appealing pool of potential hires. Uber Technologies Inc., for example, announced the creation of a new unit called Uber Money in October, and will be shopping for fintech talent in and around Manhattan, according to a CNBC report. At Affirm, the company’s New York employees’ resumes are littered with names like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Often, financial technology companies that are just getting started set up shop in San Francisco to be close to tech workers with experience designing products at big companies, said Mark Goldberg, a partner at Index Ventures. San Francisco's resident tech giant include Uber, Lyft Inc., Twitter Inc. and Airbnb Inc. But “what they don’t understand is the industry,” he said, adding that eventually, many fintech companies look eastward for hiring. “What I think happens is that companies that start on the West Coast end up recognizing that they want to compliment that DNA with capital market expertise, and with people that have been in and around banks.”Meanwhile, tech epicenter San Francisco has become less hospitable for some companies. Last year, voters passed a new tax on businesses that will go to fund homelessness relief efforts, and taxes financial services companies at a higher rate than other types of businesses. Stripe’s decision to leave the city was widely regarded by local officials as related to the passage of the new tax. The company, which strongly opposed the measure, denied that taxes were a major factor in the decision to move.Stripe instead pointed to the limited office space in San Francisco. The city’s asking prices for commercial rent, which are the highest in the nation, climbed 7% over the last year to record levels in the third quarter, according to real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. And adding to the region’s woes: In recent months fires caused widespread power outages in homes around the Bay Area.Still, none of fintech unicorns Bloomberg spoke to have plans to move their headquarters away from the West Coast. Stripe, while hiring a few hundred people in New York, currently has more than 1,000 employees in Silicon Valley. Affirm’s San Francisco office is many times larger than its Manhattan outpost. And New York-based financial services startups tend to have stubbornly lower valuations than their high-flying West Coast counterparts.For Plaid, New York is a homecoming of sorts. The startup left the city in 2013 after winning TechCrunch’s Disrupt New York Hackathon, and, seeking proximity to engineers and investors, moved its headquarters to San Francisco. “Us coming back and building a really big presence is a strong signal for NYC tech, which has made huge strides in terms of client base, talent, and funding,’’ said Charley Ma, Plaid’s New York City growth manager, who moved from the West Coast for the job last fall. Plaid’s chief executive officer, however, will remain in San Francisco.(Corrects location of early headquarters in first paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",California's Fintech Startups Are Invading New York

With physical cash becoming increasingly irrelevant in modern society, the long-term thesis for PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is abundantly clear. Thanks to an intuitive interface and ease of use, it's not difficult to understand how PayPal stock has dominated the markets.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Not only that, the opportunity for digital payments has rapidly gone international. Most notably, China has witnessed a dramatic shift in online and mobile payments, bolstering the case for not only the PYPL stock price but for rival businesses of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Given the trajectory of this development, it's highly unlikely that it will reverse course.Furthermore, PayPal stock benefits specifically from the underlying company's strong financial performances. In its most recent earnings report for the third quarter, PYPL's per-share profitability exceeded Wall Street's consensus target. Furthermore, the payment specialist beat out covering analysts' revenue target.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNaturally, the Q3 report sent the PYPL stock price higher. It wasn't just the beat on the key metrics that boosted investor confidence. Rather, PayPal demonstrated that more customers were using its platform to make financial transactions. According to a Reuters' write-up of the Q3 results, &quot;Total payment volume (TPV), or the value of payments completed through PayPal's platform, rose 25% to $178.67 billion, beating estimates of $177.32 billion.&quot;  * 7 Energy Stocks That Are Still Worth Buying In 2020 You couldn't ask for more. Except that the Street did. After a brief run, PayPal stock eventually gave up its post-earnings gains. After incurring some choppy trading, the PYPL stock price is basically back at square one.Although the wildness in shares is distracting, PYPL is built for the long haul. The Only Two Charts You'll Need to Understand PayPal StockTo put it bluntly, PayPal is a no-brainer. At some point, you'll want to have exposure to this organization's equity. About the only thing you'll need to consider is when you believe the PYPL stock price offers an attractive discount.Fundamentally, we discussed the broad catalyst for PayPal stock: the digital payments expansion. But as an investment, these two charts will likely convince you of PYPL's longer-term narrative, if you weren't already convinced.First, let's take a look at PayPal's TPV and its TPV growth rate. As mentioned above, Q3 was a standout quarter, delivering TPV of nearly $179 billion, translating to 25% year-over-year growth.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto But what's truly remarkable here is that PYPL stock is not the newest kid on the block. It was under eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) before spinning off. Thus, the law of small numbers doesn't apply in this case.However, the average growth rate in TPV since Q1 2018 is 25.6%. This rate is actually larger than the average rate of 24.8% registered between Q1 2015 through Q4 2017. In other words, as PayPal's TPV is growing nominally, its percentage gain is likewise growing.According to business mathematics, the relationship should be inverse: as metrics rise nominally, the percentage growth should decline. This is also known as the law of large numbers.Yet PayPal is rewriting the math book, delivering both robust nominal and percentage TPV gains. That's a huge tailwind that should serve PayPal stock well.  * 10 Best-Performing Growth Stocks of the 2010s The other chart? Take a look at the correlation between the PYPL stock price and nominal TPV trends.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto Visually, you can see an obvious direct relationship. Statistically, the two metrics share a 98% correlation coefficient. Stated differently, so long as TPV rises -- and it should -- PayPal stock will likely trek upward. Food for Thought on PayPal StockIn the first half of this year, PayPal stock gained 39%. But on a year-to-date basis, shares are up a little over 28%. That means in the second half of 2019, shares dropped over 8%.Moreover, PYPL has been flat since early August. Technically, this suggests that shares are in consolidation mode, with bulls and bears digesting the latest news.In this regard, I believe PayPal stock is setting up a contrarian opportunity. Although Q3 2019 results were impressive, what's more astounding is the company's body of work. This last earnings report was no fluke, although the Street is almost treating it as such. In my view, this moment is an easy buy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-23,"Going into 2020, it's likely that many investors can agree on what they'd like to leave behind. Perhaps the U.S.-China trade war would make that list, or fears of a Brexit &quot;crash-out.&quot; At a domestic level, some might be ready to wash their hands of antitrust or opioid litigation. Others are probably crossing their fingers that Boeing (NYSE:BA) finally gets its 737 MAX planes back in the sky.It's safe to say that 2019 has been an interesting year. The trade war, partially fueled by President Donald Trump's back-and-forth rhetoric, has dragged on. Now it seems like a phase-one deal should be wrapping up, but it's hard to predict what the new year will have in store. At the same time, stocks have largely rallied from the end of 2018's lows. The S&P 500 has hit all-time highs on several occasions and currently boasts year-to-date gains of 27%.In the final few weeks of the year, it's time to watch the ball drop and wait patiently for a Santa Claus rally. It's also time to reflect on InvestorPlace.com's Best Stocks for 2019 contest and prepare for the Best Stocks for 2020 picks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs always, we have a solid round of picks from our experts. Some are hoping that as the trade war continues to resolve, Chinese companies will make a big rebound. Others are betting on tech heavyweights, e-commerce and financials.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 What are these picks? In alphabetical order by ticker below, these companies are ones selected by our experts to be the best performing in terms of year-to-date gains. Starting with their Dec. 31 closing prices, we'll be tracking how they do in the new year, including dividends. Pick your favorites, grab your popcorn, and get ready for what 2020 has in store. Best Stocks for 2020: Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Investor: Reader's ChoiceThis year, InvestorPlace readers switched it up a little, voting for a different FAANG component. After selecting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for three years in a row, our readers picked Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). After 79% year-to-date gains, it's no surprise why.This year has seen better-than-expected iPhone 11 and AirPod Pro sales, and the holiday season should only help those numbers. And on the other side of the revenue coin, services revenue from its Apple Pay and Apple Music continue to increase. As InvestorPlace's Chris Lau wrote, Apple Pay even beat out PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the third quarter for total transactions.For the year ahead, it seems likely that our readers are betting on the promised 5G-enabled iPhone. While there's no set release date, many expect the new iPhone will come in 2020.&quot;Although 5G coverage still needs some work, vendors are ready and waiting to sell 5G-enabled phones,&quot; I wrote when reflecting on the reader's choice pick. &quot;You can currently pick one up from Samsung, LG and Motorola. But none of these names carry the same weight as Apple. When the 5G iPhone rolls out, expect high demand and happy investors.&quot;While the upcoming 2020 presidential election and antitrust allegations pose as headwinds on the company, there's a lot to like about Apple in the next 12 months. And when considering returns in the new year, it's important to note that AAPL offers a dividend yielding 1.1%.Read more about AAPL here. Aimmune TherapeuticsSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Investor: Matt McCallThe new year might be the year for biotech stocks. That investment thesis is behind Matt McCall's choice of Aimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIMT). With a market capitalization just over $2 billion and a share price near $32, AIMT is still a relatively small company. But for 2019, it's up 32.6%, and in the last six months it's up more than 60%.Unlike others in the biotech space that focus on oncology or neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Aimmune focuses on something that's probably much more tangible to the average investor -- food allergies. As awareness over these allergies, and particularly nut allergies, continues to grow, AIMT should grow as well. There are currently no FDA-approved preventative treatments on the market, but Aimmune is looking to change that.As long as approval comes through for it's Palforzia treatment, designed as a preventative treatment for peanut allergies, 2020 should be a good year. McCall writes that &quot;Approximately 15 million people across the United States and Europe are affected by food allergies, making it a massive $24 billion industry. Peanut allergies account for $3 billion of that market. … [Aimmune] generated $0 in revenue in 2019, but 2020 is shaping up to be significantly stronger.&quot;  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Although biotech stocks have a higher risk-reward balance than those in other sectors, it looks likely that 2020 will be a good year for AIMT. Between Matt McCall and Louis Navellier, the pair have created a &quot;Power Portfolio&quot; chock-full of hypergrowth picks for 2020.

Disney (DIS)Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com Investors: John Jagerson and Wade HansenAnother major theme of 2019 has found itself in almost every home: streaming. It seems like pretty much every publicly traded company these days has a streaming service, but none have drawn as much attention as Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ offering. Jagerson and Hansen chose DIS stock with this in mind, as Baby Yoda and The Mandalorian continue to draw in even more consumers. It's crazy to think that in its first day of operation, Disney+ brought in 10 million subscribers.That's not the only reason the duo picked DIS for the Best Stocks for 2020 contest. Disney's magic extends to its movie franchises, its theme parks and its hotels. Frozen 2 has already become a screaming success in the box office and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker promises to do the same. And don't forget that Disney, which apparently owns every name in the media world, is also behind the beloved Avengers franchise.Essentially, there's a lot to like about Disney's narrative. And from a technical perspective, Jagerson and Hansen wrote that &quot;After bottoming out in late-2018 with the rest of Wall Street -- a bottom that formed the head of an inverted 'head-and-shoulders' bullish reversal pattern -- DIS has been gaining bullish momentum.&quot; Since the stock recently broke above resistance at $150, they &quot;wouldn't be surprised to see the stock make a run for $200 before the end of next year.&quot;So in between streaming your favorite movies this coming year, make sure to keep an eye on Disney stock. Oh, and don't forget to note its 1.2% dividend yield. Unrelated but just as important, Jagerson's &quot;Everyday Income System,&quot; can teach you how to earn as much as $1,290 in a single day!

Energy Transfer (ET)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Investor: Charles SizemoreThere's nothing like winning once and then having that same luck twice. That's exactly what Charles Sizemore is trying to do with his pick Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET), which brought him the gold in 2016.Energy Transfer is a midstream pipeline operator -- meaning that it is responsible for processing crude oil and natural gas. It's had a rough time of it this year, with a year-to-date loss of almost 0.45%. But with a dividend yield just shy of 10% and the cash to keep that dividend coming, Sizemore is confident in a rebound.At the end of 2015, anti-fracking sentiment, low oil prices and an acquisition gone awry were hurting Energy Transfer. By the end of 2016's first quarter, Sizemore wrote that all had changed. The stock ended 2016 up more than 50%. At the end of 2019, a lot is similar. Investors are worried about the company's acquisition of SemGroup, fearing that it will add on too much debt. Environmental activism and pushes for renewable energy sources are also weighing on ET and all of its peers. Feeling any deja vu yet?Sizemore writes that lightning can in fact strike the same spot twice. He says, &quot;Energy Transfer's share price could jump by 50% and the shares wouldn't be anywhere close to expensive. I have no way of knowing whether 2020 will bring those kinds of returns for Energy Transfer, but they're certainly not unrealistic. And even if the capital gains end up being a little more modest, we still get to collect a current yield of close to 10%.&quot;  * 10 Best-Performing Growth Stocks of the 2010s If you too want to bet on black gold, ET might just be one of the best stocks of 2020.Read more about ET here. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com Investor: Eric FrySince Eric Fry began researching Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) back in November, the stock is already up an impressive 24%. And as he bets on a global surge in copper prices, he thinks it's likely FCX will return even more to shareholders by the end of 2020.And from his perspective, there's a lot to like about the company, which happens to be one of the world's largest copper producers. By expanding its facilities, it's likely that FCX will be able to boost its own copper production capacity. That's important for a few reasons. Global demand for refined copper is growing at a faster rate than supply, meaning that copper prices should continue to rise. Increased production and higher per-pound copper prices both spell success for Freeport-McMoRan.Fry also highlights that as the United States and China resolve their trade disputes, Freeport should benefit. Why's that? Electric vehicles are very copper intensive and China is one of the largest producers of electric vehicles. So as the two countries begin to warm up to each other, FCX stands to gain from copper-hungry EVs hitting the road once more.&quot;Freeport-McMoRan is a stock that could produce triple-digit gains in 2020, both because its copper production will ramp up over the next several months and because copper prices will likely soar toward $3.50 a pound,&quot; Fry writes.Plus, the company has some artificial intelligence projects in the works and a 1.5% dividend yield, making it even more interesting for investors. But as Fry always says, no bull market lasts forever. Investors can prepare for the next bear market by reading Eric Fry's &quot;Bear Market 2020: The Survival Blueprint,&quot; which teaches you how to thrive and make massive gains in downturns.Read more about FCX here. Hercules Capital (HTGC)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Neil GeorgeThe new year is a big year for many reasons, one of which is the upcoming presidential election. Some in the markets are already worried what Democratic primary candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would mean for many industries. Warren in particular has defined much of her campaign with promises to break up big tech companies and restructure the healthcare sector. To many investors, that's reason for fear. But with Neil George's pick Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC), you can choose an income-generating name that's relatively safe from the drama. And Neil has quite literally written the book on income, Income for Life: 65 Income Streams Anyone Can Collect, so he knows a thing or two.Hercules Capital is a business development company, meaning that it can invest in small companies through loans and financing. But unlike big banks, it's immune to harsh regulations. Although early Democratic debates showed that candidates are more interested in protecting consumers than corporations, HTGC and its BDC peers are not under direct attack. This means you can benefit from its regular annual yield of 9.4% while staying sheltered.Want another reason to believe in this company? HTGC has made a name for itself investing in Silicon Valley companies including Box (NYSE:BOX) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). As tech continues to become all important, it's nice to know that Hercules is riding the wave.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade &quot;All of this comes down to a well-run technology investment company with tax advantages and big and rising dividends,&quot; George writes. &quot;2020 and beyond should be rewarding for this alchemy investment in Hercules Capital.&quot;Read more about HTGC here. Luckin Coffee (LK)Source: Keitma / Shutterstock.com Investor: Larry RamerThis pick is coming up nice and hot. That's right, Larry Ramer chose China's Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK), making a sort of contrarian play in the midst of the U.S.-China trade war. Many have called the coffee company the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) of China, but it will soon have more physical locations and better prices within its home country. And there's a lot to like beyond its brews, especially as it hones in on domestic and international growth.Within China, Luckin began paying respect to the dominance of tea, marketing under the brand Luckin Tea. According to Ramer, &quot;Luckin revealed that sales of its tea had soared an incredible 800% in five months.&quot; As coffee continues to grow in popularity and Luckin elevates its tea brand, there's plenty of growth potential within the Chinese market.And LK is growing across the globe, too. Luckin struck a deal with the Americana Group to sell coffee in the Middle East and India. Ramer sees this as yet another validation that the company has both solid products and a solid brand.&quot;Luckin's rapidly rising revenue and profitability, along with the quality of its offerings, makes it an attractive stock,&quot; Ramer writes. &quot;Add in its huge growth opportunities and its reasonable market cap, and Luckin stock becomes the best stock for 2020.&quot;Read more about LK here. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Louis NavellierLike Neil George, Louis Navellier made his pick for the best stocks contest with the upcoming election in mind. PennyMac Financial Services (NYSE:PFSI) is the fourth-largest loan originator and the sixth-largest loan servicer in the U.S. What does this mean?It means that with the election on the horizon, politicians will want to keep the economy nice and rosy. And a rosy economy means that housing, which has been booming thanks to lower interest rates, eager-to-lend banks and lower construction costs, should remain strong through November 2020 and beyond.Navellier originally introduced this pick to his Breakthrough Stocks subscribers last month. He wrote:&quot;Overall, it's a fantastic environment for mortgage lenders like PennyMac Financial Services -- and I suspect that it will add nicely to the company's top and bottom lines in the upcoming quarters. And the analyst community agrees. For the fourth quarter, analysts have upped earnings forecasts by a whopping 53.5% in the past three months. The current consensus estimate calls for 141.3% annual earnings growth and 73.1% annual sales growth.&quot;  * 4 Beaten-Up Pot Stocks Worth Considering in 2020 With that in mind, put on your hard hats and pack your boxes. It looks like PFSI will soar as both a value and a growth play. It's a mix that combines the best of both worlds, which is precisely the philosophy behind Louis and Matt's new collaboration. It merges Matt's &quot;top-down&quot; approach with Louis' &quot;big winners first&quot; strategy to create a new methodology. They've dubbed it the &quot;Power Portfolio&quot; and it puts 2020's big winners right at your finger tips.Read more about PFSI here. Roku (ROKU)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Investor: Left Brain Investment ResearchIf you were paying attention, you'll remember that Disney stock also made its way into this list, playing on the ever-growing streaming theme. The team at Left Brain Investment Research took a different approach to that trend, instead choosing Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as a lesser-known name that was poised for success.Their thesis? Roku should benefit by &quot;becoming the operating system for smart TVs.&quot; Smart TV manufacturers sell their products with Roku's operating system already installed because it costs them less to use an existing set-up. Left Brain thinks that because of its access to streaming data, the company holds a lot of value in a market that everybody wants to enter. Beyond Disney, it faces competition from names like Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.But instead of worrying about the intense competition, the team believes Roku benefits from its streaming peers. Its platform and its years of experience give it a big lead. And, it has a proven CEO that should help it remain successful in the years to come.&quot;Roku is a rare company with many of the exceptional characteristics we look for in a growth stock,&quot; Left Brain Investment Research writes. &quot;And it has an incredible growth trajectory, as it leads the way in becoming the standard smart TV operating system. Roku's business model allows it to gather invaluable information for targeted advertisers, particularly as competition among content providers grows.&quot;Grab your smart remote and get ready to watch Roku's performance in 2020. Maybe Left Brain picked a winner.Read more about ROKU here. Wayfair (W)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Jason MoserIt wouldn't be right to have a best stocks contest that didn't hit on e-commerce. This year saw some names in retail like Forever 21, Charlotte Russe and Payless file for bankruptcy. And you can't forget Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ), which filed at the end of 2018. Beyond the trend of dying retailers, Amazon rolled out one-day shipping and cut ties with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to focus on its own logistics. It's clear that e-commerce is here to stay, and it should only continue to evolve and grow throughout 2020.That's why The Motley Fool's Jason Moser chose Wayfair (NYSE:W) stock as his pick for the new year. Some estimate that the home improvement and home goods market that Wayfair participates in is worth $285 billion. That's a huge jump from its trailing 12-month revenue of $8.6 billion.Moser says he isn't worried about Amazon's shadow dwarfing W stock because the company has already developed a well-known and heavily followed brand. However, with the phase-one trade deal still murky and tariff threats looming (at least in the distance), he says he's planning on watching the U.S.-China trade war closely for its impact on the stock. I guess that means we won't be done with that headwind just yet.&quot;If you haven't heard of Wayfair by now I'm going to assume that you're living under a rock,&quot; Moser writes. &quot;As the retail landscape continues to evolve and e-commerce continues to grow its share of the pie, Wayfair stands out as not only an investment that should see better days in 2020, but many years beyond.&quot;Whether you're looking for a nice new couch or a stock that should soar in 2020, Wayfair might be your best bet.Read more about W here.Sarah Smith is a Web Editor for InvestorPlace.com.

2019-12-24,"We expect a great singer to hit those beautiful high notes, right? We also count on the greatest basketball players to send the ball swishing through the net almost every single time.The same logic applies to the pros on Wall Street. We count on the experts to guide us to the right choice with their depth of knowledge, analytical precision and overall mastery of the art of investing.As is well known by now, 2019 has presented rich offerings to investors. After such an extended run, though, will the market keep soaring higher? Impossible to know, but we can turn to the most seasoned veterans in the field to shine a light on possibilities.BTIG’s financial sector analyst Mark Palmer is one such expert. The 5-star analyst ranks as one of the Street’s most reliable voices, as his track record can attest to. Recently, Palmer reassessed some of the stocks covered by BTIG and noted 3 names which he thinks are set for more growth ahead.According to TipRanks, a company that tracks and measures the performance of analysts, the Street seems to be in agreement with Palmer. Let’s dive in.Paypal Holdings (PYPL)Paypal hardly needs any introduction. The digital payment processor has been an ever-present feature since the turn of the century, meeting consumers’ online shopping and money transfer needs back in the days when online shopping was just kicking into gear.The payments giant has been on a shopping spree over the last couple of years. Only last week, Paypal completed the acquisition of a 70% equity interest in Chinese payments provider, GoPay, making it the first foreign online payments platform in China.This comes hot on the heels of November’s acquisition of Honey Science Corporation. Honey Science is the creator of a browser extension that helps shoppers find the best online deals. It is a profitable company, with 2018 annual revenue of over $100 million alongside enormous growth of more than 100%. Enough reasons, then, for Paypal to pull the trigger on Honey.Palmer thinks the new addition is an effort by Paypal to “make its platform more robust and differentiated in the face of increasing competition from tech companies such as Facebook Pay.”“We believe PYPL’s acquisition of Honey will help the company to make significant advances toward two of the goals it has pursued since spinning off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015: ubiquity and increased customer engagement. Honey should help PYPL to capture a consumer’s attention at the front end of the shopping funnel in addition to at its back end where it has become increasingly dominant,” the analyst said.With this in mind, Palmer reiterated a Buy rating on PYPL, alongside a price target of $130, implying potential upside of 20%. (To watch Palmer’s track record, click here)And what does the Street think of Paypal’s prospects? The Street is not far behind the 5-star analyst, as it happens. 23 Buys and 3 Hold ratings over the last three months bestow Strong Buy status on the digital payment leader. More that 16% gains could be lining investors’ pockets over the coming year, should the average price target of $126.09 be met. (See Paypal stock analysis on TipRanks) Q2 Holdings Inc (QTWO)Digital banking solutions provider Q2 also has not been shy on acquisitions. Following the 2018 purchases of Gro Solutions and Cloud Lending Solutions, QTWO recently completed the acquisition of PrecisionLender, a fast-growing enterprise SaaS provider for financial institutions.The company’s cloud-based virtual banking solutions for smaller regional and community financial institutions (RCFIs) seem to be working. In November, QTWO released its latest earnings report with an abundance of good news: record breaking registered users and bookings. On top of this, revenue of $80 million marked a 32% year-over-year increase and a fourth quarter in a row of 30%-plus revenue growth.Palmer views QTWO as “an attractive takeout target,” noting its “increasingly robust platform has become more of a threat to its larger competitors.“ Palmer opined, “Considering the company’s prospects to sustain its growth through winning new accounts, increasing penetration of existing accounts by promoting digital usage, and cross-selling across both the deposit and lending sides of the banks and credit unions it serves… We believe shares of QTWO are inexpensive in light of the company’s growth prospects, particularly given the expansion of the company’s platform beyond digital banking with the additions of Q2 Open, Cloud Lending, Gro and PrecisionLender.”As a result, the 5-star analyst kept the Buy rating and $95 price target. Palmer, therefore, sees potential for a 15% gain in the coming year.Q2 currently boasts a full house of only Buy ratings, 6 to be precise, meaning the company has a Strong Buy analyst consensus. The average price target is $93.80, providing upside potential of 14% from the current price. (See Q2 Holdings stock analysis on TipRanks) See also: 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks Poised to Ride the 5G WaveSutter Rock Capital Corporation (SSSS)Sutter Rock is an investment fund with an interest in late stage high-growth, venture-backed private companies. So, essentially, by investing in SSSS, you are investing in the company’s portfolio.According to Palmer, the investment firm’s market cap of $130 million is “a reminder of how wide the gap is between the company’s NAV (net asset value) and its deeply discounted valuation.”The net asset value refers to the amount of shares that make up the company’s holdings. SSSS has a stake in Coursera, Palantir, Ozy Media, and Course Hero amongst others. In Q3, it sold all its shares in Dropbox for $9.2 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of $1.7 million, and in LYFT, for net proceeds of $13.3 million and a realized gain of $9 million.Additionally, Sutter recently announced a buy-back of $10 million of its common shares, always a promising sign for investors. The sentiment is shared by Palmer, who noted, “We believe the stock is very inexpensive relative to its intrinsic value and that its discount valuation has created an attractive entry point for small-cap investors. The company provides investors with a vehicle through which they can access late-stage venture capital-backed private companies with strong operating fundamentals and the potential for scaled valuation growth in which they might otherwise not be able to invest.”Palmer, therefore, maintained the bullish recommendation, with a price target of $11.50. This indicates significant upside potential of 68%.Only one analyst has rated Sutter Rock over the last three months, joining Palmer in the Buy queue. Sutter, therefore, has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $11 is slightly below Palmer’s and implies gains of 61% in the new year.

2019-12-27,"While the broader market has been enjoying a relentless run to all-time highs, investors in Square (NYSE:SQ) can't say the same thing. While Square stock does boast year-to-date and one-year gains of 14% and 26%, respectively, that is not a fair representation of what a bumpy ride it's been.Source: Shutterstock In almost any other circumstance, those returns would very impressive. But considering that U.S. equity markets basically plunged into a temporary bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018, these returns make reality seem better than it is.Let's put it this way: Measure from a week after the start of the year (i.e., Jan. 8th instead of Jan. 1), SQ has returned just 1.3%. Push that time period another week (Jan. 15 to now) and shares are actually lower. In essence, short of the quick bounce back from the Q4 hammering, Square stock has been a total dud.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurther, Square has lagged its major peer PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which is up 30% in 2019 and 41.5% over the past 12 months. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) are up 28.9% and 37.7%, respectively, this year, and 37.3% and 48% over the past 12 months. Breaking Down Square StockFor Square stock bears, the two biggest issues have been valuation (an easy target) and increasing competition.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Regarding the former, valuation concerns have certainly eased as shares remain well off the highs and as growth continues to hum along. In respect to the latter, increasing competition is a negative, but it's clear that Square is the preferred provider for small- and medium-sized business.My bigger issue is this: At a time when the U.S. economy continues to push higher, with equities at all-time highs and with a strong consumer, Square stock should be doing very well -- and it's not.All the while, growth remains solid. Analysts expect full-year revenue to hit $2.25 billion, up more than 41% from 2018. On the earnings front, estimates call for 66% growth to 78 cents a share.For 2020, estimates call for even more growth. Revenue is forecast to come in at $2.86 billion, up 27.2%, while analysts expect earnings of 96 cents per share, up 23.1%. Of course, that leaves SQ stock trading at 66.6 times 2020's estimates -- which isn't cheap! -- but a lot cheaper than it was in previous years. Hidden MetricWhile Square stock continues to stagnate and as earnings and revenue continue to grow, so too are cash flows. This, it seems, is going unnoticed by investors.SQ stock boasts operating cash flow of $581 million over the past 12 months. Trailing free cash flow stands at $511 million. The sums aren't as important as the growth, though.In fiscal 2016, Square stock approached break-even cash flow and pulled in $101 million in free cash flow in 2017. That figure more than doubled (+130%) in fiscal 2018 to ~$232 million.There's still one quarter left in Square's fiscal 2019 year, but already the company has generated free cash flow of $358.6 million. That's up 54.5% from all of 2018 and there's still one quarter to go. The trailing free cash flow figure of $511 million is up 120% from 2018 (although it includes Q4 from fiscal 2018).  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 Long story short, operating and free cash flow growth is strong and if the company continues this trend, it's something Wall Street should take notice of in 2020. Trading SQ StockIt's easy to look at the charts for Square stock and conclude that it's been a dud lately. But let's remember, this name went from sub-$15 in early 2017 to more than $100 per share in October 2018.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGiven that surge, I view the sideways consolidation over the last five quarters as healthy price action. At its 2019 lows, SQ stock was about 46% off its highs. Like other growth stocks I've talked about, down 40%-plus is a good rule of thumb for me. Put simply, I like to accumulate these names on massive declines -- provided the growth profile is still intact.For Square stock, it's clear that the growth is still there, but the stock is not cooperating yet.Bulls who don't want to buy at current levels can wait for one of two things: a pullback or a breakout. If it's the former, look for a dip down to the $55 to $57 area. On a breakout, look for a move over downtrend resistance first. Over that mark -- now near $72.50 and declining -- a move to $80 is possible.Over range resistance at $80 and the 2019 high of $83.20 is possible. Above that and SQ stock can really start to rally.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Worse still, since it hit an all-time high of $101.15 in September 2018, Square stock is down 38%.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past 15 months, while the company's financial picture has gotten stronger, SQ stock has sputtered badly, trading in a range between $60 and $80, nowhere near its all-time high.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers To me, it's inexplicable.  Buy SQ Stock on the DipIn October 2018, I suggested that investors consider buying Square stock after it lost 25% of its value in just five days of trading. A buy on the dip bet and all that. The cause of the dip: Former CFO Sarah Friar announced she was leaving to become CFO of Nextdoor, a social network for local neighborhoods. I suggested CEO Jack Dorsey's comments regarding Friar's departure reflected those of someone in charge of a mature organization where its multiple revenue streams were in the hands of their own lead managers or CEOs. Dorsey felt neither he or Friar were expendable given the company's organizational structure.In the meantime, since Friar's departure, Square has grown revenues by 44%, gross payment volume (GPV) by 25%, and adjusted EBITDA by 85%. Those are hardly the numbers of a slow-growth business. Square Is Poised for GrowthInvestorPlace's Laura Hoy recently reminded investors that the company is poised for growth, increasing its Cash App peer-to-peer payment revenue by 115% in the third quarter to $159 million, or 26% of its $602 million in adjusted revenue.No wonder she called Cash App &quot;one of Square's most promising future bets.&quot;In October, I highlighted some of the reasons why I liked Cash App providing commission-free fractional trading to its 59.8 million potential users. One of the big ones is that Cash App users tend to be younger and in need of easy ways to save up for retirement. By delivering an ecosystem that solves problems for its users, Cash App's revenues will become stickier than its peers, including Venmo, PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) peer-to-peer payment app.On a different subject, Square's Q3 2019 report showed that larger businesses are taking to Square's payment processing products and services. Since Q3 2017, Square's GPV from sellers with an annual GPV of more than $500,000 grew 700 basis points to 27%. Meanwhile, those sellers with a yearly GPV of less than $125,000 dropped 700 basis points to 45%. At the same time, sellers with between $125,000 and $500,000 in GPV increased by 100 basis points to 28%.Why is this important? It shows that the company's revenue has become far more diversified; it now benefits from payment processing across businesses of all sizes.  2020 Will Be a Breakout Year for Square StockLate in 2019, CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that he would spend as much as six months in Africa in 2020 to explore the fintech opportunities on the continent. As InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto pointed out, the business and investment community are split on Dorsey's decision to abandon his biggest market in search of the next great marketplace for Square products. However, Josh reminds readers that Africa has a very young population, most are unbanked, and two-thirds of Africans use mobile phones, a trifecta of growth for Square's products and services.As they say in hockey, you don't go where the puck is; you go where it's going to be. Digital payments in North America are commonplace. Not so much in Africa.For this reason, I believe Dorsey's African exploration should generate both positive PR for the company while also laying the groundwork for a significant future revenue stream. That should be enough to light a fire under SQ in 2020.   At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. gained Tuesday after separate analysts boosted their ratings on the stocks.Square has a “favorable setup,” as sentiment on the company is mixed at the moment and it can beat expectations, BofA’s Jason Kupferberg wrote in a note raising his rating to buy from neutral.“Following significant underperformance in 2019, we see an attractive entry point,” Kupferberg said. He flagged “quarterly execution” and the company’s March 18 analyst day, its first since 2017, as potential catalysts, adding that Square’s 2020 revenue guidance “looks conservative.” Square rose as much as 3.7%, its biggest gain since Dec. 16.Expectations regarding PayPal have been “reset,” Sanford C. Bernstein’s Harshita Rawat wrote in a note upgrading the stock to outperform. She flagged PayPal’s “negative revisions” in the past year, intensifying competition and “execution hiccups” related to partnerships and its Venmo payments app. Paypal gained 29% in 2019, lagging the 44% advance in the S&P 500 Data Processing & Outsourced Services Index.Now, however, Rawat sees a “compelling one-year bull case,” driven in part by higher expectations from those partnerships, such as with MercadoLibre Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., along with PayPal’s pricing, Honey online coupon transaction and Venmo monetization. She also sees “sustained potential” for margin expansion and a “palatable” valuation. PayPal rose as much as 1.3% to its highest since September.Separately, MoffettNathanson’s Lisa Ellis wrote that --with “resignation” -- she has decided to cut Fidelity National Information Inc., Fiserv Inc., ADP, and Accenture PLC to neutral as those stocks are “likely to take a breather in 2020.”At the same time, she expects payments industry-wide volume growth of 11% in 2020 as her economic outlook for the year remains “healthy.” Payment sector operating metrics, from credit card volume growth, to enterprise IT budget growth, to U.S. employment growth, are all strong, she said.“In a sector with many strong companies and stocks, we maintain a high bar for a buy rating: An expectation of 20%-plus stock upside over the following year, with specific catalysts,” she said. Four stocks currently clear that bar: Square, PayPal, Mastercard Inc., and Visa Inc., in that order of preference, she said.Accenture slipped as much as 2.5%, its biggest drop since Oct. 22, to extend a six-day losing streak.(Updates shares in third, fifth and ninth paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal and Square Rally After Analysts Turn More Bullish

The S&P 500 delivered its second-best performance of the decade, up 28.9%. Furthermore, while PayPal stock gained almost 30%, it lagged the S&P 500 Data Processing & Outsourced Services Index by 15 percentage points.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn 2020, with expectations much lower for the S&P 500 and markets in general, if PYPL were to deliver a repeat performance, the stock price would close the year around $140.Here are three things PayPal needs to do in the next 12 months to ensure PYPL stock hits $140. Partnerships Have to Reap RewardsOn Dec. 30, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman announced the company was expanding its partnership with Latin America's biggest e-commerce marketplace, Mercadolibre (NASDAQ:MELI), a stock I've long favored.  * 8 of the Strangest Stocks Worth Your Time In March 2019, as part of a $1.8 billion equity offering by Mercadolibre to expand and grow its e-commerce business, PayPal invested $750 million in the Argentinian company. &quot;Digital commerce in Latin America is experiencing tremendous growth and MercadoLibre is well-positioned for continued leadership,&quot; Schulman said at the time. &quot;We've been impressed with the digital commerce and payments ecosystem Marcos [Galperin, MELI CEO] and his team have built.&quot;However, that was just an investment.2019's end-of-the-year announcement expands the relationship to include PayPal as a payment option for online checkout via Mercado Pago in Brazil and Mexico. In addition, PayPal will be accepted in the MercadoLibre marketplace in Brazil and Mexico for cross-border purchases.As a result, PayPal's 300 million customers can now use the payment processor to buy stuff online in two of Latin America's largest commercial markets.I said in November that if you could afford to buy both PYPL and MELI, you should. Based off December's announcement, I would double down on that sentiment.In the year ahead, I want to see tangible progress from this partnership. If we do, PayPal's valuation multiples could start to creep higher, a necessity if PYPL stock is to hit $140, let alone $200. Additional Revenue Streams for PYPLPayPal announced Jan. 6 that it had completed the $4 billion purchase of Honey, a Los Angeles-based digital shopping and rewards platform.&quot;The addition of Honey to our platform enables a significant step forward in our commitment to provide powerful services and tools for merchants and consumers, move beyond our core checkout proposition and significantly enhance the shopping experience for our 300 million consumers and merchants,&quot; Schulman stated in a company release. Whether we're talking about PayPal, Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), or any of the other fintech companies participating in and around e-commerce, they all want to offer as many products or services to merchants and customers as they possibly can.The Holy Grail of e-commerce is to become a one-stop shop for merchants and buyers alike. We're not there quite yet, but moves like acquiring Honey bring PayPal that much closer. Business Insider contributor Mike Jaconi said it best in a Jan. 7 opinion piece:&quot;When it comes to loyalty, every company, from multi-billion-dollar businesses like Amazon to your favorite mom-and-pop coffee shop, wants to do the same thing: Convince you to come to them first -- and not their competitors -- as frequently as possible.&quot;Honey's entire business model is built on driving commerce. Now, not only can Honey influence what people buy, but it can also influence how they buy those products.That's huge. In 2020, I'll be watching Honey's overall effect on PayPal stock. Continue to Monetize VenmoOne of the things Sanford Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat would like to see from PayPal in 2020 is further monetization of Venmo, its peer-to-peer payment system. Toward the end of 2019, reports surfaced that Venmo was losing users to Square's Cash App, a sign that the stakes might be higher for PayPal in 2020. According to Macquarie analyst Dan Dolev, Cash App is doing well in Venmo strongholds such as New York, California and Massachusetts. Up until now, Venmo's owned the markets on both coasts, with Cash App ruling in the South and Midwest. However, with new features being introduced such as commission-free stock trading, Cash App is getting the attention of new user demographics, forcing Venmo to keep pace.In the year ahead, I'm not so concerned with the monetization of Venmo as I am about user base losses. Square is catching up, and while I like both stocks, that ought to be a big concern for PYPL shareholders.  The Bottom Line on PayPal StockIn 2019, Square stock was soundly beaten by PayPal. In 2020, I think the battle between the two payment processors is going to be a lot closer. Who will win? I couldn't tell you. Long-term, I like PYPL stock. But if PayPal takes care of these three issues, I think it's got a shot at hitting $140.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-10,"Amazon.com Inc. does not appear sweet on the latest acquisition of PayPal Holdings Inc.  The e-commerce giant has labeled Honey, a free browser extension that automatically finds and applies coupon codes when users shop online, a security risk.  One of the sites that Honey works with, and has since its beginning in 2012, is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).  Politico editor Ryan Hutchins was among the Honey users who first noted the warning on Twitter at the height of Christmas shopping season:  ""Honey tracks your private shopping behavior, collects data like your order history and items saved, and can read or change any of your data on any website you visit,"" the warning reads.",Amazon labels Honey a security risk — but only after PayPal bought it
2020-01-10,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. made a big bet in November with its $4 billion acquisition of Honey, a web browser extension that helps online shoppers find the lowest prices. Now Amazon.com Inc. is warning customers not to use the tool.Shortly before Christmas, Amazon said Honey posed a security risk, which was reported Thursday by Wired. The warning perplexed some online shopping experts since the tool has been available for several years and Amazon makes no similar warnings about other browser extensions such as price tracker camelcamelcamel.com.“Amazon’s fight against Honey while letting a dozen other tools go on is confusing,” said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of New York e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. “I don’t buy their security risk message. They just want Honey and PayPal to be squashed.”There is no love lost between Amazon and PayPal, which spun off from e-commerce competitor EBay Inc. in 2015. Amazon has its own online payments service that competes with PayPal and doesn’t allow PayPal payments on its site.PayPal executives were surprised by the Amazon warning about Honey and are communicating with Amazon to resolve it, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. One possibility for PayPal: alerting federal antitrust regulators since the Honey warning could be interpreted as Amazon using its size and clout to harm a competitor. Regulators have encouraged Amazon rivals to provide information about potential anticompetitive practices.If PayPal thinks Amazon’s warning is unwarranted, it can accuse Amazon of deceptive practices, requiring Amazon to explain why it did so.“As markets become more concentrated and firms grow larger, we are seeing more attempts to protect market positions and eliminate rivals through deceptive practices,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Just before Christmas, banners started popping up on Amazon that told shoppers to be cautious when using Honey, calling it “a security risk” and “to keep your data private and secure, uninstall this extension immediately.”“Our extension is not – and has never been – a security risk and is safe to use,” a Honey spokesperson said. “We have a team dedicated to ensuring the security of our users’ information and we regularly engage expert third-party security firms to assess our security protections. If ever an individual or independent researcher contacts us about a potential vulnerability, we engage with that person to understand and remedy the issue (if there is one).”Los Angeles-based Honey has more than 17 million users, who use the extension to save money at Amazon and other online retailers.Amazon shoppers using Honey could be less inclined to follow Amazon suggestions, which don’t always direct shoppers to the lowest-priced product since it considers other factors such as shipping speed. Honey’s use could undermine Amazon’s own algorithm, diminishing the company’s power of suggestion over its shoppers. Amazon has been accused of favoring its own products over competitors, which the company disputes.In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokeswoman said: “Our goal is to warn customers about browser extensions that collect personal shopping data without their knowledge or consent such as customer name, shipping and/or billing address and payment method from the checkout page.”(Updates with antitrust comment in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Matt Day.To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Tells Shoppers That PayPal’s Honey Is a Security Risk

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg) -- After last year’s deluge of financial technology megadeals, investors wondered if the boom could continue into 2020. This week, Visa Inc.’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid Inc. offered an answer: Yes.  “Visa buying Plaid brings fintech from out in the wild to something more mainstream,” said Bain Capital Ventures’ Matt Harris. “It’s a ‘growing up’ moment for all of us,” he said, adding that the startup will now be part of the “critical infrastructure underlying the financial services industry.”Plaid’s rapid ascent—Square Inc. looked at buying it in 2018 for just a fifth of the eventual selling price—comes as large companies look to expand their offerings, and contend with fast-growing digital competition. In November, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion. Charles Schwab Corp. acquired TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion. And Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc. did a series of major deals in 2019 that remade the corporate landscape of payment processing.Today there are nearly 60 financial technology startups valued at more than $1 billion, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm. Many are now acquisition targets, analysts say. Those include smaller players like SoftBank Group Corp.-backed unicorn Kabbage Inc., as well as giants like Stripe Inc., most recently valued at $35 billion, a price tag that makes it one of the world’s largest startups. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat, said in a note that Fiserv and PayPal could be potential bidders for Stripe.Ryan Caldwell, chief executive officer of financial data company MX Technologies Inc., suggested the Visa deal could trigger a domino effect in the industry. “The space tends to heat up when there's been one acquisition,” Caldwell said, adding that larger companies were increasingly aware of fintech’s potential. “A lot of these players definitely need to partner,” he said.Satya Patel, a partner at venture capital firm Homebrew, which was a Plaid investor, said he didn’t expect a bonanza for VCs. “As an active fintech investor, I’d like to think that its acquisition is a sign of things to come,” but added that for every Plaid there will be many more startups that are bought for much less, or go out of business. While companies like Plaid and Stripe deal with the plumbing of fintech, would-be acquirers may also seek out consumer-facing financial startups. In the consumer world, “a re-bundling of financial products is underway,” Patel said. Analysts have speculated that future potential acquisitions could involve some of the new payment plan and lending services, such as Affirm Inc., Afterpay and Klarna Bank AB.“The alternative lending space feels ripe for consolidation,” said Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. These firms would make sense for “possibly PayPal or Square, since they have alternative lending businesses already and these would extend those, even banks like a Discover,’’ she said.The rising crop of digital-first alternative banks, or “neo-banks,” saw big investment last year, and may also see an uptick in deals. Digital banking startups like Chime Inc., Revolut Ltd., N26 and Dave Inc. fall into this category. Because many of them have similar business models, experts believe the industry could be ripe for buyouts.“The neo-bank space will probably consolidate at some point,’’ Ellis said. “Many firms are burning cash just trying to buy and acquire customers.” But that might not happen right away. Said Ellis: “The valuation bubble has to pop a bit for that group to be acquired.”(Adds investor quote in sixth paragraph. )&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Surane.To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa's Plaid Takeover Signals Wave of Fintech Dealmaking

2020-01-22,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is taking another step into the giant Chinese payments market, partnering with state-backed China UnionPay Co. in a move that could expand PayPal’s network in the country. The partnership will allow some UnionPay cardholders access to PayPal’s network, and eventually, could pave the way for PayPal to be accepted at Chinese locations that take UnionPay.Users of Shanghai-based UnionPay, the world’s largest card company by payment volume, will be able to add their UnionPay cards to PayPal accounts and use them in a number of countries where PayPal is accepted outside of China. “There is a lot of room for us to help people visiting from China find a way to pay while traveling,” Jim Magats, senior vice president of global payments at PayPal, said in an interview.The companies also said that the tie-up would allow PayPal and UnionPay’s global subsidiary, UnionPay International, to “explore opportunities” to expand PayPal’s reach in China. In a statement, Magats said the new partnership would give the company the option to “expand PayPal’s digital wallet to physical retail locations where UnionPay is accepted in China, or internationally.”The UnionPay partnership is part of a string of moves by PayPal to grow its Chinese presence. In September, China’s central bank granted PayPal approval to buy a 70% stake in a Chinese payment company Gopay Information Technology Co., allowing PayPal to become the first foreign compapny to operate in China’s payment service market. Gopay has licenses for online, mobile and cross-border yuan payment services.China’s $27 trillion payments industry is dominated by a few companies, with Ant Financial Services Group and Tencent Holdings Ltd. accounting for a majority of digital payments, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. However, in a recent interview with Bloomberg, PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said that it wasn’t too late for the company to stake a claim there. “It’s an exploding market,” he said. “It’s growing so quickly that there’s room for every player in it.”On Wednesday, UnionPay cards will be available to be added to PayPal wallets in Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. The companies said they plan to add the option for more than 30 other markets in 2020.To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Moves Further Into China With UnionPay Partnership

2020-01-24,"Since the beginning of 2019, shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have grown nearly 30%. And PayPal stock is expected to go even higher after it reports earnings next week.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Recently, my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto commented about PayPal's impressive habit of continuing to achieve double-digit growth in its total payment volume (TPV). Enomoto commented that investors don't typically see this kind of growth from a company that has already had substantial expansion.In simple terms, PayPal continues to behave like a start-up company. But as I see it, it shouldn't be that surprising that PayPal remains the cool kid on the playground.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PayPal Is Garnering Loyalty from an Important NicheI believe the secret to PayPal's success isn't really a secret at all. It came on the scene as an alternative to the middleman role that traditional banks were playing. However, as PayPal was moving past the early adopter stage, the company made an interesting pivot. Rather than moving closer to traditional banking, they moved further away. PayPal aggressively and purposefully targeted the unbanked.  * 10 Stocks to Buy as the 2020 Presidential Election Approaches There are some individuals who stay away from traditional banks out of concern for privacy and/or security. But many of the unbanked are not that way by choice. Circumstances have typically put them in a precarious place financially. Unfortunately, this leaves them with options like payday loans and other predatory options.This is not to sermonize. It's just to point out what PayPal did right. Whether by design or by happy accident, PayPal saw an opportunity. The unbanked not only did not have access to the digital economy. They were at risk of falling behind even further.PayPal's efforts started out simply enough. They allowed customers to deposit cash and paychecks into their PayPal accounts. But now by partnering with smaller banks, PayPal has introduced debit cards and mobile check deposits. Small Business Boost for PayPal StockAnd don't forget that PayPal has become one of the leading payment methods for small businesses. And for small business customers, they offer PayPal Working Capital as a way for these businesses to receive loans that would otherwise be unavailable to them.Since many of these companies are of the e-commerce variety, the approval for the loan is based on sales volume, which is easily tracked by an algorithm. The application can literally be completed in minutes: there's no credit check and once approved the loans are funded immediately.Granted, traditional banks can provide a business with more funds, but for businesses just looking for a small bridge loan, this is a simple, discreet alternative. PayPal's Efforts Are Paying OffNow think about this. Two of the major advantages to a traditional bank are the fact that your deposits are FDIC insured and that depositors can receive interest on the money they keep in the bank. PayPal can't do anything about insuring their customer's funds. However, with interest rates so low, the act of saving is more important than where the money is kept.So why would customers need to go anywhere else? PayPal recently created Venmo as a peer-to-peer transaction service. While the company has yet to successfully monetize Venmo, there's little doubt in my mind that it is the predominant way that teenagers and young adults are choosing to move money. Betting on a Blockchain FutureAnd there's another thing to consider. PayPal is already looking for the next new thing.In early 2019, the company made their first investment in a blockchain technology company, Cambridge Blockchain. While blockchain is not new, it has yet to become the standard for e-commerce and banking.But with many of the big banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) beginning to make investments in the technology, it won't be long before the technology becomes prevalent. And PayPal's investment is an effort to ensure it won't be left behind.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-24,"While the market reaches new highs, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock remains in neutral. Square does trade at a high valuation. But with analysts predicting growth deceleration since August, investors have been less confident in giving this stock an even higher valuation.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Is Mr. Market right in discounting Square's future prospects? Is Square a software-as-a-service pioneer like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)? Or is the company more like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or legacy payment processors like Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA)? Back in October, a Barron's article made the case for the latter. In other words, implying more downside for SQ stock.Add in increased competition, and Square does not look like a great opportunity. So, what's the verdict? Let's dive in, and see why SQ stock is most likely going to be stuck in neutral in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Does Fintech Consolidation Mean for SQ Stock?I've before discussed how the competition's heating up for Square. Square's merchant platform faces growing competition from established players like Fiserv. In retail peer-to-peer payments, Square's Cash App goes toe-to-toe with PayPal's Venmo. Square can still expand its merchant and consumer businesses. But customer acquisition costs could skyrocket as the market becomes crowded.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy Square has its work cut out for it. Yet, the company could be an ideal bolt-on acquisition for a larger financial services company. Potential acquirers like Visa or Mastercard come to mind. InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn expressed similar sentiments in his Dec. 30 SQ stock analysis. Blankenhorn argued that strategic buyers could pay a 33% premium to its then-trading price of $63.50 per share. In other words, $84.45 per share.Yet, this article came out before Visa's announced acquisition of Plaid. Plaid provides the back-end technology that allows fintech apps like Coinbase and Robinhood to link with your bank account. Why is this recent deal relevant to SQ stock? It could mean Square isn't the type of company deep-pocked payment companies are looking to buy.By owning the key gatekeeper between banks and fintech startups, Visa may not need to buy a company like Square to stay relevant. If businesses and customers pivot toward fintech startups in lieu of legacy payment processors, Visa can still win by owning Plaid. Visa could also leverage its ownership of Plaid to compete with Plaid's existing clients.Square was in talks to buy Plaid in 2018. Unfortunately, they couldn't get their hands on this hot asset. Doing so would've given them in edge against both startup rivals, as well as legacy payment providers. Square Needs Time to Grow Into Its ValuationSQ stock currently trades for 88.7 times estimated 2019 earnings, and 71.5 times estimated 2020 earnings. In contrast, payment rivals PayPal trades for 38 times 2019 earnings, and 33.3 times 2020 earnings. Their other main rival, Fiserv, trades for 30 times 2019 earnings, and 23.6 times projected 2020 earnings. Square's faster growth rate does justify a valuation premium. But with risks growth could decelerate, paying 71.5 forward earnings doesn't look like a smart move.Could Square grow into its valuation? It could. But even Square's high projected earnings growth of 23% implies it would take a while. In the meantime, investors may start giving Square a lower earnings multiple, sending shares to lower levels.So what's the solution? As InvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto recently wrote, the company's Square Capital lending business could move the needle long term. But investors are well aware of Square's intent to become a fintech &quot;financial supermarket.&quot; Square could win big with this aggressive growth strategy.But looking at the competitive environment, it seems Square is sandwiched in the middle. On one hand, you have new startups that could outfox Square via innovation. On the other hand, deep-pocketed rivals to use scale to hamper Square's growth plans.That's not to say that Square will be muscled out of business. Yet, growth above expectations seems less likely. With this in mind, it seems SQ stock is more likely to come down valuation-wise than go higher thanks to expectation-exceeding growth. Bottom Line: SQ Stock Could Stay in NeutralSquare has much potential to further disrupt financial services. However, I do not believe the company's valuation premium to payment peers like PayPal is sustainable. If February's earnings call indicates further growth deceleration, SQ stock could fall to a valuation closer to that of peers.Square's move to become a fintech &quot;financial supermarket&quot; further cements the argument that the company is not comparable to a SaaS name like Shopify. Square deserves a growth premium to PayPal, Visa and others, but not a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 71.5.So what's the call? Stay away from SQ stock. The company could surprise come February. But chances are Square shares tread water at best in the coming year.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Ruan, the chief executive officer, and Hudson received roughly $900 million and $575 million, respectively.A spokesman for San Jose, California-based PayPal declined to comment.Honey is largely used by consumers as a browser extension that automatically applies coupons at e-commerce sites.

Adyen has already started processing Subway payments in some stores.The Dutch company is facing off with firms like San Francisco-based Stripe Inc. to sign on more merchants, positioning itself to bank a slice of customers’ transactions.

Let's look at a few top stock trades, as the headlines continue to fly. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Microsoft (MSFT)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares were pressing higher on Thursday, hitting another all-time high. The move comes following the company's better-than-expected quarterly results.But what now? The stock isn't advancing in very convincing fashion, fading from its opening levels. Shares did pullback a bit on Monday, but quickly erased those losses ahead of the print.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf shares unwind a bit more, let's see if the 20-day moving average and channel support buoy the name once more. On a correction to this level, investors may consider buying the dip -- provided the overall market remains in relatively good health.Below these marks, though, and the 50-day moving average is in play. Should MSFT resist pulling back from current levels, see if it can ride prior channel resistance higher and take out Thursday's high. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Altria (MO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAltria (NYSE:MO) took another big writedown on its Juul unit and reduced its long-term earnings growth outlook. The stock responded with a selloff, which seems justified in this current environment.So far, support is stepping up from the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, while the $46 level is hard to ignore; This is the zone to watch. Below the 100-day and $46, and MO could tumble to $44 or lower.Above the 200-day moving average, and bulls will need to see if Altria can rally back to its 50-day moving average. If it can, reclaiming this mark and pushing to $51-plus is the next task at hand. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: PayPal (PYPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAfter a lower open, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is doing its best to erase Thursday morning's post-earnings losses. In doing so, the stock is reclaiming its 20-day moving average.If it continues higher, let's see if PYPL can clear $118 and get up to the $120 level. A move below Thursday's low puts uptrend support (blue line) on the table. Below that, and the $110 level will be in the cards, along with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.With bulls back in control of PayPal -- unlike the situation in Q3 -- I wouldn't mind buying on a dip to the $110 to $112 area. Below the 200-day moving average, though, and PYPL may very well be a no-touch for the time being. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Coca-Cola (KO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) continues its slow, but steady run higher. There's something satisfying about watching an old blue-chip, slow-growth stock chug higher on a strong uptrend and trade really well.For KO, the breakout over $55 to start the year gave the stock a much-needed boost of momentum. Shares dipped slightly ahead of earnings, but gapped up over resistance near $57.80 on Thursday on better-than-expected results.Let's see if the stock can hold up above this mark now. If it can, $60-plus is possible. If not, see if the 20-day moving average can support the stock on a pullback. Below that mark, and Wednesday's low at $56.66, and uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average are on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-01-31,"When it comes to fintech stocks, payment processing company Square (NYSE: SQ) has been a disappointment as of late. While the S&P 500 index rose 22% over the last 12 months, SQ stock rose only 6.5% in comparison.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com And that lags far behind other stocks in the fintech/payments arena:  * Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), up 190.4%.  * Mastercard (NYSE: MA), up 57%.  * Visa (NYSE: V), up 48.9%.  * PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), up 14.9%.Happily, Square is off to a great start in 2020, bouncing 19% higher on the strength of a couple key analyst upgrades.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company's next earnings report isn't until late February, so there is plenty of time for sentiment to build before the payment processing company posts it updated outlook.On average, analysts are expecting earnings per share of 21 cents for the quarter, which would be up from 14 cents a year ago. For 2020, analysts are expecting earnings of 95 cents per share, up from an expected 2019 full-year EPS of 78 cents. Why SQ Stock is a GemThe secret of Square is the brilliant way it mixes tried-and-true habits with 21st century technology. Today's customers are already conditioned to carry their credit or debit cards everywhere and many people prefer the convenience of plastic to cash.  * 7 Biometrics Stocks That Will Help Shape the Next Decade Square capitalizes on those spending habits. The company's small, plastic dongles fit in cell phones and tablets, turning them into instant payment processing systems.And because Square accounts can be activated in just minutes, instant credit and debit card payments can be accepted by a whole new world of vendors or with a side hustle -- cookie-selling Girl Scouts, food truck operators, dog walkers and babysitters can all get money in a snap.That convenience provides a great foundation for growth -- and Square is taking advantage.Louis Stevens of L.A. Stevens Investments is a fan:&quot;Square's negative narratives and present valuation belie the company's fantastic underlying financials. The company has been growing their revenues at upward of 40% year-over-year for the last five years, and despite calls for competition destroying their business, gross margins have been improving. For a company that allegedly operates in an ultra-competitive space, their 40% gross margins are sure curious.&quot;Square's present sales growth rate of 40+% year-over-year and 40% gross margins, along with stable, growing free cash flow, are being vastly undervalued relative to the company's peers.&quot; Looking at the Bear CaseWait … what was that about &quot;negative narratives?&quot;No doubt, you can find something bad to say about any stock on the market. A large part of investing, after all, involves people betting on stocks or against stocks, so Square stock bears are always looking for a reason to preach caution.In Square's case, you have CEO Jack Dorsey's plan to live -- for at least six month -- in Africa, a continent that he says will &quot;define the future.&quot; And while getting in on the ground floor of any developing market is exciting, skeptics such as Jeff Sonnefeld of Yale University calls it &quot;reckless.&quot; Others wonder who will be handling day-to-day operations at Square while Dorsey is on the other side of the world.Experts such as Mott Capital Management also note that Square has a history of outperforming earnings, but sets a low bar on guidance that has historically depressed the stock.&quot;Additionally, analysts have been trimming their earnings estimates for the company in 2020 and 2021. Since the beginning of 2019, analysts' earnings estimates have declined by 13% and 25%, respectively. That has brought forecasts for 2020 down to just 96 cents per share and $1.34 per share in 2021.&quot;It's a fair point. Square already boasts a steep valuation with a forward P/E of 80 and a price-book ratio of 26. If Square can hit its earnings marks and post solid 2020 guidance, the stock price will respond.  * 7 Under-the-Radar European Stocks to Buy for 2020  Bottom Line on Square StockThere's no reason to expect that Dorsey and Co. will deviate from what's worked for Square stock so far. Expect a solid earnings report and conservative guidance for 2020 when SQ reports in February.For the long term, SQ is a great stock to own. The company has a solid business model that marries the gig economy to tried-and-true consumer spending patterns, good leadership and a promising track record of growth.SQ may not blow you out of the water, but it's a good fintech stock to hold in the 2020s.As of this writing, Patrick Sanders did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-31,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its earnings on Wednesday afternoon -- and investors don't seem impressed by the results, as PayPal stock is little changed since then.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The response is somewhat logical. PayPal's Q4 numbers did beat analysts' average estimates, but not by much; investors likely were looking for more fireworks. The company's outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2020, at least based on the headline numbers, appear somewhat soft. One-time factors played a role, but the Q4 results don't seem like a massive beat that has materially changed the company's outlook.But that's fine because its outlook didn't need to change. PayPal remains one of the better growth stories in the market, and PayPal stock has one of the more attractive valuations among growth names. Its Q4 earnings and 2020 guidance were more than enough to keep the company's outlook intact. In the wake of the results,   PYPL stock is still intriguing for medium-term and long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Headline ResultsThe lukewarm reaction to PayPal's earnings does make some sense because its Q4 results and 2020 guidance were essentially in-line with expectations. Its revenue increased 18% year-over-year in Q4, excluding currency fluctuations, as its  transaction payment volume jumped 22%, excluding currency fluctuations.Its bottom-line performance was even better: as its management noted, the 2.04 percentage point  YoY increase in its operating margin was its biggest such  expansion since PayPal split from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015.  * How to Insure Your Wealth Before the Coronavirus Strikes Again But the growth was mostly expected: its revenue increase was within 0.4 percentage points of the average analyst estimate. A 3 cent beat relative to average earnings per share expectations is nothing new for PayPal, and it's not terribly surprising in an era in which tech companies almost always beat mean bottom-line estimates.Post-earnings headlines indicate that the company's  guidance gave investors some pause. At first glance, PayPal's outlook does appear to be disappointing. Its Q1 revenue and earnings guidance came in below analysts' average estimate. Full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $3.39-$3.46 fell shy of the $3.49 mean estimate ahead of the release.The company's outlook is better than those headline numbers suggest, however. And its guidance more than enough to keep the company's attractive long-term outlook intact. Understanding PayPal's 2020 GuidanceIt appears that the difference between analysts' expectations and PayPal's numbers come down to acquisitions.  PayPal noted that  acquisitions will reduce its  2020 EPS by 8 cents to 10 cents.PayPal also changed its criteria for adjusted earnings; in 2020, the company will exclude the impact of gains and losses on its investments from its adjusted earnings. In 2019, gains from its investments boosted its EPS by 14 cents. But investments will have no impact on its reported adjusted earnings this year.So PayPal's bottom-line growth is much stronger than its headline numbers suggest. Its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.39-$3.46, against the $3.10 it reported in 2019, suggests a roughly 9%-11% YoY increase. But excluding the effect of acquisitions and 2019 investment gains, PYPL actually expects its EPS to jump 18%-20% this year.The extent to which Street estimates incorporate the company's acquisitions or potential gains or losses on its investments is unclear. At minimum, PayPal's guidance isn't 100% comparable to analysts' estimates. The impact of acquisitions alone accounts for the difference between PayPal's guidance and analysts' average estimates. That, in turn, suggests that PayPal's earnings growth remains nicely on track. The Case for PayPal StockGiven the fact that PayPal's guidance actually looks attractive, PayPal stock looks appealing. The shares trade at about 34 times the midpoint of the company's 2020's EPS guidance. That's a reasonably high multiple,  but not when the company's profits are growing at an 18%-plus clip, particularly in this market.Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is trading at a higher multiple to its expected 2020 EPS and its growth rate is lower. Visa's (NYSE:V) price-earnings ratio is nearly  30&#92;. Square (NYSE:SQ) does have more growth potential, but its valuation is much higher than that of PayPal stock.On a relative basis, then, being long PYPL stock makes sense at these levels, particularly with the shares trading sideways since June.The shares' valuation alone makes them attractive. A P/E ratio of 33 isn't cheap, but PayPal reiterated that it expects to generate 20% annual EPS growth for some time to come. That growth is more than enough to allow the company to grow into its current valuation -- and beyond.Moreover, the company has additional  opportunities in China and other foreign countries, and  its Venmo business can continue to grow. Its loss of revenue from eBay is a concern, but since eBay accounted for only 14% of its total sales, the impact is more than manageable. PayPal should be able to grow despite that development.PayPal's strong outlook is what makes PYPL attractive -- and its outlook wasn't changed by the Q4 report.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-02-07,"Financial services and mobile payment processor Square (NYSE:SQ) has been flying high in 2020. Just days ago, SQ stock hit $80.90, a six-month high. That represented an impressive 29% gain since the end of 2019.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com However, SQ's winning streak hit a bump in the road on Wednesday. The stock closed at $78.25, down 3.28% on the day. Is this dip the start of a correction? Or is it a buying opportunity in advance of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report? Its Q4 earnings report is slated to be unveiled  after the market closes on Feb. 26. Looking Back to Last Year's Q4 ResultsIt's worth revisiting the company's results for Q4 of 2018 to see how it did and how investors reacted to its report.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare's results for Q4 of 2018 were strong. The company's  earnings per share beat analysts' average outlook, coming in at 14 cents, versus the mean estimate of 13 cents.  SQ's revenue, excluding some items,  grew 53% year-over-year to $464 million, compared to the average estimate of $454 million. The number of active users of the company's Cash App -- which competes against the likes of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay Cash and PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo -- doubled year-over-year.Based on those numbers, I would have expected SQ stock to react positively. Instead, the shares fell. The reason for the negative reaction was the company's Q1 guidance and its revenue growth. The company's top-line growth of 53% sounds great, but it was actually down from 56% during the previous quarter. Slowing growth always concerns investors.  * Earn Income on Investors' Push into Microsoft While Square's revenue guidance was in-line with with analysts' average expectations, Square projected Q1 EPS of between 6 cents and 8 cents. Analysts, on average, were looking for 11 cents per share. Blockbuster Holiday E-Commerce SpendingI detailed 2019's record-setting holiday shopping season in my recent column on Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP), the Canadian e-commerce company that, like  Square, provides merchants with payment processing hardware.Americans spent $7.4 billion on e-commerce on Black Friday. They topped that on Cyber Monday, spending $9.4 billion. That's up 19% compared to 2018 and set a new record for the largest e-commerce sales day in U.S. history. Those numbers are relevant to Square as well, as the company offers online payment services for merchants, in addition to its brick-and-mortar payment processing hardware.Analysts are looking for the strong holiday shopping season to translate into big numbers for Square. On average, they expect its revenue to be in the $1.18 billion range, while their mean EPS estimate is 21 cents -- a big jump over last year. However, as last year showed us, big holiday quarter numbers aren't everything. The market will also likely react to the company's Q1 guidance as well. The Bottom Line on SQ StockMost analysts aren't too bullish on Square's prospects in 2020.   In fact, most are betting that Square won't rise above $80 again this year. However, most of them do feel the stock is strongly positioned and that investors should own it. Among the analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, SQ stock has an average rating of  &quot;overweight.&quot;  Among those analysts, 18 have a &quot;buy&quot; rating and 16 rate SQ stock a &quot;hold.&quot; Their average 12-month price target is $72.43.However, there are firms that have a much more bullish stance on SQ. Less than two weeks ago -- with SQ trading at the $71 level -- Credit Suisse gave the stock an $84 price target.  After SQ reports its results, we'll know if the company delivered the spectacular holiday quarter that's been expected. We should also receive guidance from Square that will at least hint at how the company expects to perform in 2020.

2020-02-07,"The news first hit the internet on February 4. The Wall Street Journal reported that Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), the owners of the New York Stock Exchange, had made an offer of more than $30 billion for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). EBAY stock jumped by more than 8%. Source: Mano Kors / Shutterstock.com For eBay shareholders, it was good while it lasted.  ICE Threw Cold Water on eBay StockTwo days later, ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher announced that the company had broken off talks with eBay. As I write this, eBay is down almost 7% in pre-market trading Feb. 7, 2020. That downward trend is likely to carry into Friday's trading. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen I first saw the news fly across my screen that ICE was making a play for eBay, much like the news Kobe Bryant had died, it took me a few seconds to process.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends Why on god's green earth would the owner of the NYSE want to buy a company that helps people sell stuff? Many of ICE's investors felt the same way, voicing their concerns to Sprecher directly. &quot;Based on investor conversations following today's ICE earnings call, ICE has decided to cease exploring strategic opportunities with EBay,&quot; the exchange said in a statement.From ICE's perspective, its obvious how the attributes of its business of running marketplaces on a large scale could be helpful to big companies looking to reinvigorate their operations or small ones trying to scale up. Sometimes, the unconventional works; this time, it didn't. If you own ICE stock, I wouldn't be concerned about its outside-the-box play for eBay. It shows how management is always considering ways to make ICE better while delivering value to shareholders; that's gold.But as for eBay, it demonstrates how rudderless the company is at the moment.If you own eBay stock, you better hope that some other buyer comes along in the not-too-distant future that is a more conventional fit because there appears few if any catalysts to it higher.  Signs eBay is FalteringCNBC reported February 5 that eBay had ended its employee shuttle service for commuters in the San Francisco Bay Area. That comes after laying off 102 employees in San Francisco and Seattle. The company says not enough people were using the service, but it appears the real reason was to satisfy activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value. According to Bloomberg, Starboard is pushing the company to jettison its classifieds business while also setting loftier expectations for itself, including doing more with less. Hence, the cuts mentioned above. &quot;In order to achieve the optimal outcome, we believe classifieds must be separated, and a more comprehensive and aggressive operating plan must be put in place to drive profitable growth in the core marketplace business,&quot; Peter Feld, the head of research for Starboard Value, stated in a letter to the company.Just as it had no interest in selling out to ICE, eBay appears to have little desire to meet the demands of the activists. At least not to the extent Starboard would like.Frankly, even though I believe that eBay is not a stock worth owning given its lack of direction, I find it amazing that these two investors -- Starboard own a little more than 1% and Elliott owns 1.4% -- who combined have less than half the ownership stake of founder Pierre Omidyar, dare to push their weight around like they own the place. They might have a lot of good points to make, but activism of this kind illustrates how the deck is stacked in favor of the 1%. But, I digress.  Competition is Hurting BusinesseBay continues to fall behind its eCommerce rivals and the addition of sales taxes is only going to make its recovery that much more difficult. As the Financial Times reported in late January, a total of 33 states, including three biggies: California, Texas and New York, have already implemented internet sales taxes and more are expected to follow.  &quot;This rollout happened faster than anticipated and affected small businesses and consumer sellers requiring marketplaces to collect and remit on their behalf,&quot; said Scott Schenkel, eBay's interim chief executive. eBay believes a national internet sales tax makes sense to reduce the burden on small businesses. The reality is that eBay's revenue grew by just 2% in 2019, excluding currency, a figure that hardly instills fear at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) headquarters. Shareholders can be thankful that it still managed to pull in $2.4 billion in non-GAAP profits from its ongoing operations. So, even though it's broken, the lights aren't about to go out in San Jose. The Bottom Line on EBAY StockIn fiscal 2019, eBay had $2.6 billion in free cash flow. Based on a current enterprise value of $30.0 billion, it has an FCF yield of 8.7%. Anything above 8%, I consider value territory. From this perspective, I can see why Starboard and Elliott are interested in eBay stock. It's a value play for sure. But as I said in November, I would still rather own its former stablemate, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Its future is much clearer.

2020-02-07,"While Square (NYSE:SQ) has ushered in a revolution of cashless payments, investors aren't giving it the credit it deserves. Sure, SQ stock's 2020 performance is nothing short of eye-opening, attracting a near-25% gain year-to-date. But shares still sit more than 20% below their highs from October 2018.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I expect the rally to continue once more investors recognize its opportunity. When that happens, Square will return to $100-plus for good.Square's opportunity in payments simply is too large for SQ to keep lagging other stocks in its sector. With new markets only adding to the company's potential, Square should have not just years, but decades, of growth ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven though SQ stock isn't cheap, that kind of growth simply isn't priced in. The Opportunity in PaymentsSquare's simple dongle revolutionized payments by turning any smartphone into a credit card swipe. The company, of course, has come a long way since then.Square has expanded into ever-improved point of sale systems that improve the experience for both the customer and the retailer. Its software offerings go well beyond payments to payroll, accounting and appointment scheduling.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks Under $5 to Buy Now Everything a small business might need, Square now offers. And the company doesn't just serve small businesses anymore. Sellers with over $500,000 in annual revenue now drive over one-quarter of the company's total payment volume.Again, the world is going to become cashless. I personally use cash maybe once a month, if that -- and I know I'm not alone. Square is a big part of the disruption in how American consumers pay for goods and services -- and will benefit from that disruption going forward.More and more small businesses will drive their payments through Square's point-of-sale (POS) systems. Growth in online sales, too, will add to payment volume -- and Square revenue. And the company has barely cracked the international market: overseas revenue was barely 5% of the company's total in the first nine months of 2019.To top it off, Square Cash is seeing increasing adoption. That product seems to be outperforming PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. Square still isn't getting much revenue from Square Cash -- but with billions of dollars in transfers annually, it will. Additional Growth DriversOf course, Square has two key growth drivers beyond payments and Square Cash. The company has been forward-thinking in cryptocurrency, becoming one of the first payment companies to process bitcoin transactions. That's now a big business for Square: bitcoin revenue nearly tripled in the first three quarters of 2019, and totaled nearly $340 million.That makes SQ stock an intriguing play on Bitcoin. And as I've written on this site, I believe the price of Bitcoin will soar, potentially to as high as $100,000. The coming &quot;halvening&quot; should be a huge upside catalyst for the price. Square, more so than any publicly traded payments company, should profit.Square stock offers exposure to another significant trend: cannabidiol, more commonly referred to as CBD. The company launched its CBD offering last year, providing an all-in-one solution for sellers targeting that potentially enormous market.Admittedly, CBD sales have been somewhat disappointing of late, largely due to unclear guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But CBD will be a large and fast-growing market. Square should be at the forefront of that growth. Why SQ Stock Should Catch UpSquare simply has multiple opportunities to drive growth for years to come. Yet, again, that's done little for SQ stock. It's lagged for nearly 18 months now -- while other payment stocks have soared.Both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trade near all-time highs. Each stock has gained more than 40% over the past twelve months. PYPL stock is tracking new highs. Small business play Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has been perhaps the market's best stock in recent years.Even with its YTD run, however, SQ stock is well below its past highs. Admittedly, the stock doesn't look cheap. But a stock with this kind of opportunity simply shouldn't be cheap. Meanwhile, upfront expenses to market to new customers and develop new offerings for existing customers are pressuring near-term earnings.Once investors better understand the opportunity Square has, and look to the long-term earnings potential, SQ stock should rally. Considering the optimism toward the sector, there's no reason why SQ, too, can't reach all-time highs. That suggests another 25% upside from here -- and a stock price in the triple digits for good.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Intuit Inc., the software giant behind TurboTax, is buying personal finance website Credit Karma Inc. for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock.San Francisco-based Credit Karma has garnered more than 100 million users by offering free credit scores since it was founded in 2007. The financial technology startup offers other services too, including the ability to apply for a credit card, find an auto loan or start a savings account. The combination will help consumers manage debt, maximize savings and have better access to credit cards and loans, Intuit said in a statement Monday.Fintech companies are at a crossroads where a number of them are established enough to go public, but a spate of poor-performing IPOs are making acquisitions more attractive. At the same time, incumbent companies aren’t afraid to snap up startups as a way to fuel their own growth. “The fertile M&A market, shift to growth stage investments, and rich valuations open the door for a lot of discussions, as well as distractions,” said Lindsay Davis, an analyst at CB Insights. “Fintech startups will have a choice to take a deal or buckle down and focus on filling product gaps.”Perhaps most similar to Intuit, Credit Karma also launched a free tax-filing platform a few years ago and has been trying to poach customers of Intuit’s TurboTax offering.More than 30 million users log into Credit Karma every week, the company has said. These users don’t pay the company for any of its services, and Credit Karma makes money through an affiliate fee it receives when someone successfully applies for a loan or credit card on its platform. Credit Karma generated almost $1 billion in unaudited revenue last year, up 20% from 2018, Intuit said.Intuit also reported fiscal second-quarter results, with revenue up 13% in the period to $1.7 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.68 billion. Net income rose 27% to $240 million, or 91 cents a share, in the three months ended Jan. 31. The company reiterated its fiscal 2020 outlook for revenue of $7.44 billion to $7.54 billion. The transaction is expected to be neutral or add to Intuit’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes, the company said.The deal is only the latest in a slew of acquisitions in the industry. Morgan Stanley recently announced plans to buy E*Trade Financial Corp. for $13 billion, while Visa Inc. agreed to acquire Plaid for $5.3 billion in January.Late last year, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion and Charles Schwab Corp. is acquiring TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion.QED Investors, Ribbit Capital and Founders Fund were early backers of Credit Karma.(Updates with Intuit earnings results in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Linus Chua, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Intuit Buys Credit Karma for $7.1 Billion in Cash, Stock"
2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Ken Lin co-founded Credit Karma Inc. in 2007 after struggling to find out his own credit score. That’s something he probably won’t need in the future.Intuit Inc. -- the software giant behind TurboTax -- said Monday it’s buying Credit Karma for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock. The firm, which offers free credit scores and help applying for cards and loans, has more than 100 million members and reported unaudited revenue of nearly $1 billion in 2019, according to a company statement.Lin, 44, who owns at least 15% of the San Francisco-based company, is poised for a ten-figure windfall, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the latest fintech founder to strike gold in recent months as more established firms snap up upstarts.It caps a remarkable rise for Lin, who as a child immigrated to the U.S. from China with his parents and was the first of his family to graduate from college. The founder is far from the stereotypical staid financial planner. Described as an adrenaline junkie, he once took his company’s board on dune buggy rides in Las Vegas and is known for hitting the dance floor at his firm’s holiday parties.Credit Karma declined to comment on Lin’s net worth.Others geting windfalls include co-founders Nichole Mustard, 47, and Ryan Graciano, 38, as well as firms such as Silver Lake, Ribbit Capital and QED Investors, a Virginia-based outfit that led the first investment round.The startup’s hefty price tag contrasts with its early days.It initially struggled to raise funding from venture capitalists and its first office was an apartment located by a San Francisco overpass and above Kate O’Brien’s Irish Bar & Grill. The company has since moved to fancier digs near Union Square whose amenities include a nail salon.While Silicon Valley has witnessed plenty of lackluster public offerings recently, there’s still demand for financial tech companies from larger rivals.George Ruan and Ryan Hudson, the co-founders of Honey Science Corp. pulled in $1.5 billion after completing the $4 billion sale of their firm to PayPal Holdings Inc. Plaid Inc. co-founders Zach Perret and William Hockey will collect hundreds of millions of dollars each after selling their company to payments giant Visa Inc. for $5.3 billion in January.Intuit’s share price rose 2.5% to $293.60 at 10:13 a.m. in New York on Tuesday.(Updates with details of Intuit share price in final paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.net;Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven CrabillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Credit Karma Founder to Get Billion-Dollar Windfall From Sale

2020-03-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. named two new directors, appointing Tracey Travis, chief financial officer of Estée Lauder Cos., and longtime McKinsey & Co. executive Nancy Killefer at a time when the board’s role at the social media company is under intense scrutiny.The addition of the two women, announced in a statement Monday, makes Facebook’s board 40% female. Fewer than 10% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of gender representation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adding Travis also means the board has two black women.The directors are joining the technology giant at a time of turmoil, as regulators and lawmakers question whether the company has monopoly powers and whether its advertising business relies too much on users’ personal data. Facebook’s 10-member board still has little control over the direction of the company, where Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg holds the majority of the voting power.“The next few years are likely to shape the internet for generations to come and I hope to contribute to Facebook’s efforts to be a responsible force for good in the world,” said Killefer, who retired from McKinsey in 2013 and has also worked in government, in the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service.Travis, whose experience in the retail industry could help Facebook understand the needs of advertisers, said she was optimistic that the Menlo Park, California-based company could indeed “change our world for the better,” according to the statement. “Building community has never been more important and is fundamental to Facebook’s mission.”Travis and Killefer join Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Peggy Alford on the board that is otherwise made up of men mostly from the tech industry, including investors Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen and a newer addition, Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox Inc. and a friend of Zuckerberg’s.Including Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express Co. who has been a director since 2018, the Facebook board is now 30% black.A California board diversity law, passed in 2018, would have required Facebook to have three female directors by 2021. Women accounted for about 45% of new board seats among Russell 3000 companies based in California, compared with about 31% nationwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Almost half of the open spots at Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies went to women last year, and for the first time they made up more than a quarter of all directors.

2020-03-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial-technology firms including PayPal Holdings Inc. are lining up to help speed lending to small businesses during the coronavirus crisis -- and are pushing for a slice of emergency U.S. government funding.Industry group Financial Innovation Now urged Congress in a letter to provide capital to online lenders including PayPal and Square Inc., and to permit the firms to disperse Small Businesses Administration loans. The group’s members also include Inuit Inc. and Stripe Inc.“Any federal small-business loan program must leverage digital advances in the marketplace to ensure that stimulus can reach those business most in need,” Financial Innovation Now said in its letter. “Millions of truly small businesses, those most likely to fail in the coming weeks, will not be well-served by loan guarantees made available exclusively through financial institutions.”Last week, President Donald Trump said the SBA would provide low-interest loans in affected states and asked Congress to boost funding for the program by $50 billion. Small businesses are losing 80% to 100% of their revenue amid the pandemic, according to another fintech trade group, Innovative Lending Platform Association.“If they all go out of business, we can’t serve them in the future,” Scott Stewart, chief executive officer of ILPA, said in an interview. “We don’t care about making any money on this, but we want to keep them alive so that when this is all wrapped up we can be lending to them in the long term.”Many small businesses have only 10 days of cash on hand or less, according to Sam Taussig, head of global policy at Kabbage Inc., an online lender. While SBA loans can take as long as 90 days, fintech firms are touting their ability to process loans in days or weeks.A Square spokeswoman declined to comment.

2020-03-27,"The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) ETF looks like a mixed bag at this point. Some of its top holdings should perform very well in the coming weeks and months, while others are likely to struggle. Therefore, I believe that investors should avoid the QQQ ETF at this point.Source: Shutterstock To be sure, the ETF has some very good components. Two of the exchange-traded fund's top holdings --Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) which accounts for 10.7% of its assets and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is 8.14% of its assets -- should perform pretty well going forward. The companies are the leaders of the cloud transition.The fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, based on market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I've noted previously, multiple analysts have said that firms are unlikely to stop transitioning to the cloud. That's because the change is core to their IT strategies and it's expected to occur over a period of many years, making it unlikely to be derailed by the relatively short-term outbreak of the coronavirus from China. And of course, Amazon's results will be boosted tremendously by the ongoing e-commerce surge that's occurring amid the coronavirus.Also likely to get a boost from the pandemic are Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which accounts for nearly 2% of the ETF's assets, and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), with a weighting of about 1.5%. Netflix should benefit from increased subscriptions as quarantined people around the world look for more TV options, while PayPal should be helped by the increased utilization of e-commerce. Yet…  * 7 Stocks Insiders Are Buying Big Amid the Market Panic  QQQ ETF Has Some Real DudsWith its very expensive products and its high leverage to Chinese consumers who are angry at Americans, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not a good stock to own now. It accounts for 11.6% of the ETF's assets. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) -- huge cable companies that make up 2.1% and 1.2% of the ETF's assets, respectively -- are being disrupted by cord cutting. As I've written in the past, cable companies' one remaining strong business -- providing internet broadband -- could be totally decimated by Elon Musk's SpaceX which is looking to provide fast internet with satellites. Finally, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), 4.25% of the ETF's holdings, has massive regulatory problems and has been badly hurt by a change that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) made to Chrome's privacy standards. Further, Facebook's ad business will be negatively affected by the recession. Two Much-Better ETFs to BuyThe Global X E-commerce ETF (NASDAQ:EBIZ) &quot;focuses on companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of e-commerce as a distribution model,&quot; according to the fund's sponsor. Among the portfolio's largest components are e-commerce website Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Canada's Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) which enables small businesses to easily launch e-commerce websites and up-and-coming Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Not surprisingly, the ETF has outperformed tremendously during the coronavirus crisis; it's little changed since March 12. As hundreds of millions of people globally continue to stay at home much more than before the outbreak, the ETF's outperformance is likely to continue in the coming days and weeks.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Once the Market Bottoms Another good fund to buy at this point is the Kraneshares CSI China Internet (NYSEArca:KWEB). China is reporting that it has almost no new cases of coronavirus brought about by contagion within the country, i.e., community spread. Meanwhile, signs continue to mount that the country's economy is rebounding. Among the ETF's largest holdings are several companies likely to benefit from increased e-commerce, including giants Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), along with JD.com. iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ), the company that has been called &quot;the Netflix of China,&quot; and video game maker NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), two other companies that should benefit from the stay-at-home trend, are also among the fund's largest holdings.The Global X E-Commerce ETF and Kraneshares CSI China Internet have much more exposure to strong, positive trends than the QQQ ETF.

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- A fellow co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. said Elon Musk and others probably regret comments they made dismissing the seriousness of the novel coronavirus, adding that he’s hopeful the billionaire will now help in the relief effort.“Everyone who has made fun of this thing as a tougher flu or a silly problem that is going to go away with the first ray of sunshine is probably slightly embarrassed by those comments,” Max Levchin, who at 23 co-founded a company that would eventually become PayPal, said Monday on Bloomberg Television. “That excludes no one.”Musk, who now runs Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, initially downplayed the virality of the coronavirus and fatality rates related to Covid-19. He called panic over the illness “dumb” and predicted that overreaction would do more harm than the disease itself before starting to help by donating masks to hospital workers and buying ventilators.Musk has told his Twitter followers that Tesla can be most helpful by purchasing ventilators and helping deliver them more efficiently. While he tweeted that he had an engineering discussion with ventilator maker Medtronic Plc on March 21, it’s unclear whether Tesla or Space Exploration Technologies Corp. will play a role in manufacturing the desperately needed medical devices.“You do have this spirit of Silicon Valley, that when given direction or given a good idea, we know how to mobilize and inspire and go through walls and build something,” Levchin, who’s now chief executive officer of fintech company Affirm Inc., said on Bloomberg TV. “And so in that sense, I think if Elon is committing to build ventilators, by god he’s going to build a lot of ventilators, and they’re probably going to be quite good.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal Co-Founder Chides Virus Skeptics, Hopes Musk Makes Good"

2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Cash is dirty. Credit cards may be even dirtier. That’s a problem in this new germophobic world created by the coronavirus. There will likely be new winners and losers as consumers shift to products and services that help them keep their social distance even after this outbreak subsides. Is it finally time to embrace the digital wallet?Take Apple Inc.’s Apple Pay, a service that stores your credit-card information and lets you pay for purchases via your iPhone. The tech giant launched the product six years ago, but it didn’t bring about the revolution it hoped it would, where mobile payments lead the move toward a cashless society as it had in China. Here in the U.S., there just wasn’t a compelling enough reason for many consumers to change their entrenched routines. Now, though, Apple Pay’s ability to let customers shop inside physical stores and pay for things without having to make physical contact with a counter or card-reader may be the catalyst it needs to finally disrupt the payments industry.My own habits are noticeably changing on this front. Though I had my card information inside Apple Pay for years, I rarely ever used it. Old habits die hard, and I simply didn’t mind pulling out my credit card and paying for things the usual way. Nowadays? Not so much. Due to virus fears, I would rather not tap on a payment terminal’s numeric key pads or use my finger to sign for purchases when there is a much cleaner alternative. As a result, Apple Pay has now become the main way I pay for things whenever I venture outside.The way Apple Pay works is, you type in your credit card information into the Apple Wallet app. Once entered, you can pay for items at most physical store retailers by double-clicking the power button, authenticating using Face ID or Touch ID and then hovering your iPhone a few inches above the payment terminal. Google Pay and Samsung Pay work similarly on their respective smartphones. This type of proximity-based mobile payment enables consumers to pay for items without touching or handing over anything.  Traditional paper bills and physical card payment alternatives are filthy in comparison. An academic study cited by Mastercard found the average cash note has 26,000 bacterial colonies. And according to LendEDU, a personal finance products comparison website, credit cards contain even more germs than cash or New York City subway poles. It makes sense as cards are often put on tables, inside restaurant bill folders and are rarely cleaned, while cash is constantly circulated by hand.Yes, the credit-card companies are rolling out their own version of contactless or “tap-to-pay” payments. Visa and Mastercard both said in their most recent reported quarters that about one-third of global transactions are now contactless. But the usage rate of the new cards is much lower in the U.S. as many Americans have yet to receive them. Further, it still requires touching the physical card and tapping the terminal (or at least getting the card within a couple of inches). This year, Apple Pay will command 47% of the U.S. proximity-based mobile payment market, with Google capturing 19% and Samsung Pay 17%, according to an eMarketer forecast.Admittedly, the U.S. market is still small, and expectations were relatively muted heading into this year before the pandemic struck. Only about 33 million Americans were expected to use Apple Pay’s proximity-based payment feature in 2020, or 14.5% of smartphone users, according to an eMarketer forecast made in September. But things are a lot different now.If Apple Pay and its brethren do take off, there will be deeper ramifications across the industry. Credit-card companies will do fine because their card networks are still being utilized by the smartphone maker’s service. But it could be a negative for PayPal Holdings Inc., the payments company that dominates the adjacent market of digital checkout buttons for online retailers.PayPal’s e-commerce checkout button enables its users to pay for online orders on retailer websites without having to re-type address or payment information, reducing friction to complete orders. It is a critical cash cow for the company and accounts for nearly 90% of its earnings, according to MoffettNathanson.But Apple Pay also offers a competing digital checkout feature. And if Apple Pay became increasingly used inside physical stores, it seems likely customers will be inclined to use the service for e-commerce transactions as well, eating into PayPal’s business.With new consumer habits being formed in a coronavirus world, Apple’s gain may be PayPal’s pain.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-09,"With the stock market gaining momentum, it's becoming more difficult to find bargain-priced stocks to upgrade your portfolio. Electronic payment processor PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one such company whose share price has risen 20% from where it bottomed in mid-March. But PYPL stock is still trading 15% lower than its February highs, making it a worthwhile pick right now.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Discounted or not, PayPal makes for a solid core holding because of it's solid operations and promising long-term growth runway. The electronic payments space is growing rapidly as e-commerce continues to replace traditional retail. For that reason, PayPal is worth a look despite its rapid rise over the past few days. PYPL Stock Is a Bet on the Future of PaymentsAs an early entrant into the digital payments space, PayPal has the benefit of existing relationships with a variety of merchants as well as consumers. That has given the firm a strong jumping off point and made it difficult for rivals to compete. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far, we've seen PayPal grow exponentially alongside e-commerce, a segment that's expected to continue growing over the next few years. PayPal has seen active users grow consistently over the past few years. In Q4 the firm reached an important milestone by surpassing 300 million active accounts. CEO Dan Schulman says the firm's next goal is 1 billion users.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential The firm is also looking to expand beyond just e-commerce; the company has been growing its platform to include in-store transactions as well. That's an important growth runway as more than 80% of retail sales in the U.S. came from brick-and-mortar stores last year.  The Power of MobilePayPal has dipped its toe in physical sales over the past few years with its reward-heavy Venmo debit card. This year, the company is planning to expand that avenue with a credit card option some time this year. However, PayPal's latest project is expanding mobile payments that are likely to become the future of in-store transactions.PayPal has been working to develop a QR code-based payment system with the help of GoPay, a Chinese payment company. QR codes are a common payment option in China and the experience is considered frictionless -- PayPal seems to be betting that will be the next major leap in the payments space. PayPal has also been working to keep up with the growing trend of contactless payments, though competition in that space is much tougher as phone companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) promote their own payment methods. The Power of CashlessIn order to be a winner in the payment processing space, PayPal needs to establish itself within in-store transactions. Be it through QR codes or contactless payments, cashless payments are a key growth catalyst. The U.S. cashless payment market is expected to grow to $184.5 billion transactions in 2020 -- PayPal needs to be a top dog in this space to keep up with its monumental growth.So far, despite the firm's lag on contactless payment technology, it seems PayPal is doing a pretty decent job of maintaining a spot at the front of the pack. Although the company hasn't resonated as well with younger generations, a Macquarie survey showed that the firm's usage trends are outperforming competitors like Apple. PayPal's inability to wow younger millennials thus far is worrying, but all that could change as the firm continues to update its value proposition. The company recently acquired Honey, a rewards platform, that could significantly improve PayPal's engagement among young people. The firm is even considering expanding Honey's capabilities to include in-store offers, making PayPal payments more enticing. The Bottom Line on PayPalPayPal won't be immune to the sharp pullback in consumer spending that's expected to show up in Q1 results. That weakness could also persist and weigh on PayPal's results through the rest of the year. However, PayPal's solid cash position and relatively strong cash flows make it one of the better choices with uncertainty looming over the market.PYPL stock was a great option in the payments space back in February, and now that it's trading at a 15% discount, it's an even better buy.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial-technology firms PayPal Holdings Inc., Square Inc. and Intuit Inc. are starting to lend to small businesses that couldn’t get access to coronavirus relief funds through the biggest U.S. banks.Fintechs had been pushing to provide emergency loans to small businesses since mid-March, more than a week before passage of federal legislation that created the Paycheck Protection Program. The companies have said that they can approve loans faster than traditional banks and reach the most vulnerable businesses but ran into obstacles before getting Small Business Administration approval.“The PPP program has manual checks and processes that require time, and we’re doing the best we can despite having tech that can operate at scale and efficiency,” said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, an industry group that counts PayPal and Square as members. Fintechs have had to “retool their lending programs to make PPP work.”PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman was on calls with the Treasury Department for weeks prior to getting PPP approval Friday, including speaking directly with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to a company representative. They discussed PayPal’s capacity and capabilities to get funds in a timely manner to small and midsize businesses, particularly those from disadvantaged areas or demographics.One reason it took fintechs longer than traditional banks to participate in the PPP was that they had to wait on final authorization from the Small Business Administration, said Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former SBA administrator. The Treasury Department and the SBA didn’t release the application form for fintech and other non-bank lenders until last week.“I think the fintechs were working very hard on the front end, but the back end of the pipe that hooks up to the fire hose of money, they had to wait for the Treasury for that,” Mills said.The SBA didn’t provide an immediate comment.PayPal, Square and Intuit all serve small businesses that are often overlooked by large banks because it’s costly for them to underwrite very small loans, according to Jo Ann Barefoot, chief executive officer of the Alliance for Innovative Regulation.Smaller LoansAs many as 70% of PayPal’s small-business loans go to U.S. counties that have lost 10 or more banks since the financial crisis in 2008, according to Schulman. The company’s loans are generally less than $25,000 each -- something true as well for small businesses seeking help from PayPal under the PPP, Schulman said in an email.Square also serves borrowers that “have been locked out of the financial system,” said Jackie Reses, Square Capital lead. Women make up 55% of Square Capital borrowers, and 37% are under-represented minorities, she said in an interview.Under the PPP, financial institutions including Bank of America Corp. have been favoring existing small-business customers because the process is easer if a borrower has been previously approved. On Monday, a federal judge ruled that preferential treatment under the CARES Act wouldn’t be barred after Bank of America was sued by a number of small businesses for being left out.Florida Senator Marco Rubio said Monday on Twitter that the main challenge with PPP is no longer lender confusion, but that more lenders, including non-bank lenders, are needed to speed up distribution.Fintechs are starting to take part in the PPP when almost three-quarters of the $349 billion program has already been allocated. The funding may run out as early as Thursday, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. An effort to add an additional $250 billion has stalled in Congress.PayPal is offering access to the PPP to its existing 10 million merchants through a relationship with WebBank, a Salt Lake City-based bank that it already partners with for its Working Capital business. The company’s first emergency-loan borrowers include a chiropractic office in Kansas City, Missouri; a nail salon in Bayonne, New Jersey; and a shoe store in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the PayPal representative said.Automated ProcessIntuit is using QuickBooks Capital, its existing business-loan platform, to automate and expedite the PPP application process, according to a company statement. Square’s program is first being offered to users of the Square payments platform, but the company said it plans to extend it to other borrowers once processes start moving more efficiently. The company has yet to approve any PPP applications.“We launched when we were confident we could provide a smooth processing experience for all applicants, to give sellers more transparency around the status of their funds,” Reses said. “This is also why we’ve staggered our application rollout to Square sellers, as loan reviews are still a manual process.”Now that fintechs have PPP approval, the next challenge is getting enough funding from the federal government to reach everyone in need, said Mills of Harvard Business School.“I’m encouraged by the progress,” she said, “but we are not quite at the point we need to be where billions of dollars are flowing seamlessly to smaller and more vulnerable businesses.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal, Square Start Lending to Small Businesses Hurt by Virus"

2020-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and its partners said their Libra cryptocurrency project will now support multiple versions of the digital coins, the majority of which will be backed by individual fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, as part of changes made to appease skeptical regulators worldwide.The Libra Association, the governing body overseeing the proposed project, redesigned the currency and made other changes responding to financial regulators concerned the effort could undermine the power and control of central banks. The group said Thursday it plans to support multiple Libra stablecoins, with each working like a digital version of a country’s existing currency.The organization has also begun talks with Swiss regulators for a payments license, and hopes to register with FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as a “money services business,” according to Dante Disparte, head of policy for the Libra Association. “We’re working toward a late 2020 readiness timeline” to launch the Libra network, Disparte added.When Facebook unveiled Libra 10 months ago, it intended to create a single global currency that would be pegged to a basket that included fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar and euro, and securities like treasuries. That plan faced criticism from politicians and regulators worried that Libra could usurp some power from central banks, who use money creation as a tool to influence and protect markets, or be used for black-market purposes, like money laundering.After months of discussions, the Libra Association has backpedaled on those initial plans, though it still hopes to create a version of the Libra currency made up of “a digital composite of some of the single-currency stablecoins,” the organization wrote in a white paper published Thursday. Bloomberg previously reported on the association’s plans to offer multiple versions of the Libra currency. Facebook has said it won’t launch Libra without regulatory approval, but it’s unclear whether the changes will appease critics and financial officials.“Which currency will be adopted and used will vary by use cases,” said Christian Catalini, head economist for Facebook’s Calibra division, which created the project. He suggested that when sending money across borders, the multicurrency Libra could be a better option, whereas the single-currency stablecoins would make more sense for everyday purchases in a consumer’s home country.The restructuring could help Libra with regulation. The original plan led some to characterize Libra as a security, a designation that brings much greater regulatory oversight. Some central banks also worried that a popular coin backed by a basket of currencies would undermine their ability to manage fluctuations of their home currency, a concern the Libra Association acknowledged in its white paper.The changes could also potentially clear the way for more companies to join the association as members, perhaps lowering the risk of backlash from regulators. Many of the original high-profile participants left the organization before it signed a charter, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Disparte said that adding banks as partners on the project is a “massive priority.” The association will need banks, for example, to help manage the reserve funds for the Libra currency. “We’re not a banking institution and we don’t aim to be,” he said.Included in the association’s update was a change in plans for its Libra blockchain. Last year, the group said it planned to eventually let anybody participate in running its network -- not just members -- the way anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network. Now Libra is backpedaling to say that anyone who wants to verify transactions on the network will need to gain certain approvals. The exact approvals process is still being worked out.The Libra association, which was officially formed in October, is still taking shape, Disparte said. The group has added two new members since concluding its charter, including Shopify Inc., which provides e-commerce tools, and now has 22 in total. It also hopes to hire a chief executive officer by the end of the second quarter.Member companies have contributed financially to pay for the association’s operations, Disparte said, adding that Facebook, the largest member and the project’s founder, is providing less than 10% of this money. Still, that means it’s likely paying more than some of the association’s other 21 members. An association spokesperson declined to explain why.(Includes association’s plan to add banking partners in the eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook-Backed Libra Plans Multiple Single-Currency Coins

2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- As coronavirus infections tore across the U.S. in early March, a Silicon Valley executive called the survival shelter manufacturer Rising S Co. He wanted to know how to open the secret door to his multimillion-dollar bunker 11 feet underground in New Zealand. The tech chief had neve­r used the bunker and couldn’t remember how to unlock it, said Gary Lynch, general manager of Texas-based Rising S Co. “He wanted to verify the combination for the door and was asking questions about the power and the hot water heater and whether he needed to take extra water or air filters,” Lynch said. The businessman runs a company in the Bay Area but lives in New York, which was fast becoming the world’s coronavirus epicenter. “He went out to New Zealand to escape everything that’s happening,” Lynch said, declining to identify the bunker owner because he keeps his client lists private. “And as far as I know, he’s still there.”For years, New Zealand has featured prominently in the doomsday survival plans of wealthy Americans worried that, say, a killer germ might paralyze the world. Isolated at the edge of the earth, more than 1,000 miles off the southern coast of Australia, New Zealand is home to about 4.9 million people, about a fifth as many as the New York metro area. The clean, green, island nation is known for its natural beauty, laid-back politicians and premier health facilities.In recent weeks, the country has been lauded for its response to the pandemic. It enforced a four-week lockdown early, and today has more recoveries than cases. Only 12 people have died from the disease. The U.S. death toll stands at more than 39,000, meaning that country’s death rate per capita is about 50 times higher. The underground global shelter network Vivos already has installed a 300-person bunker in the South Island, north of Christchurch, said Robert Vicino, the founder of the California-based company. He’s fielded two calls in the past week from prospective clients eager to build additional shelters on the island. In the U.S., two dozen families have moved into a 5,000-person Vivos shelter in South Dakota, he said, where they’re occupying a bunker on a former military base that’s about three-quarters the size of Manhattan. Vivos has also built an 80-person bunker in Indiana, and is developing a 1000-person shelter in Germany.Rising S Co. has planted about 10 private bunkers in New Zealand over the past several years. The average cost is $3 million for a shelter weighing about 150 tons, but it can easily go as high as $8 million with additional features like luxury bathrooms, game rooms, shooting ranges, gyms, theaters and surgical beds. Some Silicon Valley denizens have already made the move to New Zealand as the pandemic has escalated. On March 12, Mihai Dinulescu decided to pull the plug on the cryptocurrency startup he was launching to flee to the remote country. “My fear was it was now or never as I thought they might start closing borders,” said Dinulescu, 34. “I had this very gripping feeling that we needed to go.” Dinulescu packed his bags and left his furniture, television, paintings and other belongings with friends. He bought the earliest plane ticket available and within 12 hours the Harvard University alum and his wife were on a 7 a.m. flight bound for Auckland. In San Francisco, “the entire international section of the airport was empty—except for one flight to New Zealand,” Dinulescu said. “In a time when pretty much all planes were running on a third occupancy, this thing was booked solid.”Four days later, New Zealand closed its borders to foreign travelers, which could thwart some refugee travel plans. Dinulescu said he has connected with about 10 people in New Zealand who made the jump before the shutdown, but “a lot of venture capital people I know were not afraid enough in time for the border close,” Dinulescu said. “And now they can’t get in.” After the shutdown was announced, however, local press reported a slight increase in private plane landings in the country.Dinulescu is now working for Ao Air, a small startup that's designing an air filtration mask to rival the N95. Its co-founder, New Zealander Dan Bowden, said he’s fielded inquiries from about a dozen hopeful employees from the U.S. tech industry since the start of the pandemic, but that generally he’s wary of these requests. &quot;Some people are scared and reaching out just because they want a visa,&quot; Bowden said. One potential U.S.-based investor even asked if he would be eligible for New Zealand residency if he boosted his investment in the startup. Notably, New Zealand does offer an investor visa for about $6 million for three years.The current travel restrictions complement another order, passed in August 2018, banning foreigners from buying Kiwi homes, partly in response to Americans gobbling up swaths of the country's prime real estate. That’s been a hurdle for New Zealand luxury real estate agent Graham Wall, who said that in recent weeks he’s gotten about half a dozen calls from wealthy Americans hoping to buy up properties on the island. &quot;They have all said it looks like the safest place to be is New Zealand right now,” he said. “That’s been a theory since before Covid-19.”Over the years, the moneyed North Americans who have managed to wrangle properties there include hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson, Hollywood film director James Cameron and PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder Peter Thiel, who has two estates in New Zealand, one of which features views of snow-capped mountains and has a safe room. Though not in a mansion, Dinulescu has no plans to return to the Valley until the pandemic recedes. He is now holed up on Waiheke Island with his wife in a two-floor, three-bedroom house with ocean views for $2,400 a month—more than a third less than what they were paying for their two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco.The couple chose Waiheke, with a population of about 9,000, for the proximity to its other elite residents. Dubbed “the Hamptons of New Zealand,” the island is home to epic cliff-top mansions and world-class wineries. Sir Graham Henry, former coach of the All Blacks rugby team, owns a home there, as does the packaging tycoon Graeme Hart. “Frankly, we were billionaire hunting,” Dinulescu said. “We wanted to figure out where all the other Silicon Valley people would be.” So far, he said he hasn’t rubbed shoulders with any tech elite: “Everyone has been in self-isolation.”Perrin Molloy, a local builder who has lived on the island since he was 11, described Waiheke as a “billionaire’s playground.” Molloy is often called to do repair jobs inside mega-mansions on the island, many of which are empty almost year-round. “These homes are designed to be a sanctuary for wealthy billionaires when they need to get away from what’s happening in the rest of the world,” he said.On Waiheke, it’s common for builders to not know the identities of the homeowners they’re working for, Molloy said, and doomsday-related renovations are fairly routine. One of Molloy’s colleagues helped build a $12 million house in a private bay that had an “air tunnel” marked in the foundation plans that could easily fit four people walking shoulder-to-shoulder. “It was quite obviously an escape tunnel in the basement,” he said. The virus is likely only to fuel the disaster preparedness industry in New Zealand and beyond. “Obviously the coronavirus is making people realize how vulnerable we all are, but what people are really concerned about is the aftermath,” said Vicino, the Vivos founder, who believes the wealthy fear an economic collapse or global depression could lead to uprisings against the top 1%. “They don't want to have to defend their homes when the gangs of looters or marauders show up.”Former Prime Minister John Key was often approached about the country’s popularity as a doomsday location while in office. “I’ve had a lot of people say to me that they would like to own a property in New Zealand if the world goes to hell in a handbasket,’’ Key said in an interview with Bloomberg in 2018.Sam Altman, former president of Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator and chief executive officer of OpenAI, has helped boost New Zealand’s reputation as a respite, previously telling the New Yorker that in the event of a pandemic he planned to escape there with Thiel. However, in an interview last week he said, “It’s a very lovely place, but I don’t know anyone who has run away to New Zealand.” Some fellow entrepreneurs have headed up to Napa Valley, but Altman says he hasn’t heard of any peers escaping internationally because of the virus.Instead, Altman is sheltering in place in his San Francisco apartment, he said. Currently, like so many others, he’s growing his facial hair and watching Tiger King on Netflix.(An earlier version corrected New Zealand’s location.

2020-04-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Google will make product listings on its Shopping service free, part of a broader push to expand in e-commerce and mount a bigger challenge to Amazon.com Inc. as the Covid-19 pandemic drives more consumers online.The Alphabet Inc. unit will let merchants post their wares on Google Shopping for free regardless of whether they pay for Google ads. Before, these listings were all sponsored, meaning merchants paid Google every time someone clicked through to their website from a Google product listing.The move may reduce advertising revenue initially, but it could also entice more merchants to use Google Shopping in the long term. The company turned the service into a paid product in 2012 and it grew into a huge business, generating billions of dollars in highly profitable revenue each quarter.Google is returning to its original free approach for shopping, with some important caveats. The company will still sell Shopping ads, which will give merchants the option to appear in paid slots above the free listings. Product ads will also continue to appear on the main Google search results page, while the free listings will only show up in the less-popular Shopping search tab.“For retailers, this change means free exposure to millions of people who come to Google every day for their shopping needs,” Google said in a blog post on Tuesday. “For shoppers, it means more products from more stores, discoverable through the Google Shopping tab. For advertisers, this means paid campaigns can now be augmented with free listings.”Google has long wavered on its approach to commerce. The company is first and foremost an advertising platform, designed to make money whenever consumers search for things to buy online. But in recent years, consumers have increasingly gone directly to Amazon to begin their hunt, and the online retailer has built an ad business to take advantage of this traffic. Now, Google is trying to reaffirm its position as the go-to place for people to look for things to buy online.“Digital commerce has huge opportunity and it shouldn’t be the case that only a handful get to participate in that,” Bill Ready, head of Google Commerce, said in an interview. Ready, the former chief operating officer of PayPal Holdings Inc., joined Google in January.Ready wants Google Shopping to be a place where consumers can find products from anywhere, whether they’re sold by large or small merchants. A search for hammers could return listings from Home Depot Inc. or a neighborhood hardware store.The Covid-19 pandemic makes good product search even more necessary, as the best-known retailers run out of stock while smaller sellers struggle to stay afloat, Ready said.To get more merchants listing their products on Google Shopping, the company is partnering with Ready’s old company, PayPal. Merchants who already use PayPal to process payments can integrate directly with Google Shopping.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Makes Listing Products on Its Shopping Service Free

2020-04-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With lockdown restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic decimating many U.S. businesses and tens of millions filing for unemployment, it’s no surprise Americans are fretting about their job security. To ease this uncertainty, many technology companies have decided to institute a “no-layoff” policy for their employees during these tumultuous times. Not only is this good for workers — but it’s smart business, too.The list of companies guaranteeing continued employment includes some of the biggest and brightest names in tech. Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang told employees in an email earlier this month that the chipmaker won’t cut staff due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, it’s pulling forward new salary hikes. Likewise, Cisco Systems Inc. CEO Chuck Robbins told Bloomberg News his employees’ jobs were safe, as did management at ServiceNow, an enterprise software provider that is among the number of tech firms reporting earning this week. PayPal Holdings Inc. also made job-protection vows.While the industry isn’t alone in extending these kinds of guarantees — several financial companies including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. have made similar commitments — the number of tech companies doing it is notable. It’s easy to be generous during boon times. But reputations are built during tough times. Promising job security engenders loyalty from one of companies’ most important assets: human capital. Future and current employees will remember how they were treated during this crisis. And by standing firm for their workers, the companies will be able to hire and retain the best talent going forward.Some executives may consider staff reductions because they are worried about their stock price. This may be a myopic move. Over time, the stock market values companies on their fundamental long-term earnings power, not near-term financial results. Further, any benefits from cost cutting may not make up for the loss in institutional knowledge that can generate more future revenue as well.Moreover, the companies that safeguard their employees will benefit from increased productivity, too. It’s simply human nature. When people get worried over job security, the culture tends to grow more toxic. Instead of teamwork and collaboration, employees start to focus on internal politics and everything becomes a zero-sum game. Instead of taking smart risks, serving customers and building better products, workers play not to lose. Removing the uncertainty should breed better creativity and performance.Of course, not every company has the balance sheet strength to make the employment security promise. If a firm doesn’t have financial liquidity, it won’t do anyone any good if the timeline to insolvency gets accelerated by avoiding needed restructuring. Should conditions worsen, it may be necessary for some companies to reverse no layoff pledges. But for companies that can afford to look through the valley and commit to supporting their staff through this difficult period, it can only increase their competitive advantage.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-29,"We do not know what the long-term impacts of this health crisis will be. The market has rallied in recent weeks, but it is still likely we could be in for a sustained economic recession.If there is one rule when it comes to investing in recessions, it's that they tend to clean the market of weakest players and help the strongest players become more dominant. As long as you don't need this money in the next few years, these types of stocks that are dominant players in growing industries can be a good way to go. Growth investing isn't about making a quick buck, it's all about identifying companies that will become dominant before they do. Three high-quality stocks that I believe have years of growth ahead of them are PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) and Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS).PayPalPayPal is positioned as the world's leading digital payments processor. Its recent partnership with UnionPay that gives it access to China has only cemented that lead. Although PayPal is losing its primary payment processor status at eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), it has sufficient activity to compensate for this loss thanks to its other partners, such as Argentinian MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and FIS Global. Between those partnerships, its strong global presence of over 100 million international users, and the continued transition to a cashless society, I believe PayPal is well-positioned for future growth.NikeNike is a well-managed company that's simply masterful when it comes to promoting and growing its brand. Though the pandemic has led to the closure of its stores and factories in China, sales in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 that ended in February were impressive. Digital sales came to the rescue and resulted in strong double-digit growth. Along with expanding margins, well-managed expenses, and impressive earnings per share prior to the outbreak, Nike has proven that it is so much more than a sportswear manufacturer. At this point, Nike is part retail company, part health and wellness brand. And its growing online presence has positioned the company to navigate this storm and come out stronger on the other side.ZoetisZoetis sells medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and biodevices for companion and farm animals. Last year alone, sales in the companion-animal segment that make up half of its total revenue grew a strong 23% excluding currency effects, while full-year revenue grew 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share jumped 16%. This company has the potential to grow even faster over the long term due to its new product innovations and strategic acquisitions, such as medical and veterinary diagnostics company Abaxis acquired in 2018.With some shelters reporting a surge in adoptions during the pandemic as people have been forced to stay at home, it stands to reason that 2020 could be an even bigger year for Zoetis.

Both of those also beat analysts' forecasts of $5.61 billion revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $539.4 million.All that was great. Then the coronavirus happened. Square and the CoronavirusSquare is known for its (not coincidentally) plastic square dongles that are designed to fit neatly in a smartphone or tablet, turning them instantly into a payment processor that can handle most major credit cards.It's the perfect 21st-century solution to anyone running a business, including pop-up stores, landscaping, food trucks, or small companies. According to a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, the pandemic has hurt nearly 75% of small businesses.In the fourth quarter, 45% of Square's overall volume came from businesses with less than $125,000 annualized gross payment volume. So Square is going to be disproportionately injured by any event that hurts small business.Raymond James analyst John Davis cut his rating on SQ stock from &quot;market perform&quot; to &quot;underperform&quot; in mid-April, noting that payment volumes could be down as much as 60%.Because of the coronavirus, last month Square revised its first-quarter guidance, adjusting it downward to a net revenue range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion. Profits are expected in the range of $515 million to $525 million.The company also said it expects to report an EPS loss for the first quarter, and withdrew its 2020 full-year guidance.Analysts will be watching Square closely when it steps up to the earnings microphone on May 6. But even as numbers are destined to disappoint in the short-term, SQ can still be a solid company headed into the second half of 2020. SQ Does Fintech the Right WaySquare's point-of-sale payment processing system is just one way it makes money. There's also the Square Cash app, which is a direct competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and is seeing fast growth of its own.Square Cash allows people to transfer money via their smartphones. At the end of  2019 Square Cash had 24 million active users, compared to PayPal's 52 million active users of the Venmo app.Square Cash also features the Cash Card, which works like a debit card and allows customers to invest in anything from stocks to bitcoin.The Square Cash app represented more than $450 million of SQ's $1.4 billion in revenue in 2019, but company officials think that's just the tip of the iceberg. According to an investor presentation, SQ believes Square Cash is tapping into a $60 trillion market, and is just scratching the surface with a 2% penetration so far. The Bottom Line on Square StockSquare stock was growing fast before the coronavirus, but it's also ideally situated to help small businesses recover as the virus begins to fade away.Already, the stock is beginning its long climb higher, and while first-quarter earnings will be a disappointment, I'll be more interested in hearing about Square's forecast for the second half of the year.SQ stock has a &quot;B&quot; rating today in my Portfolio Grader.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-05-06,"2020 is destined to be known as the year of the coronavirus, when &quot;social distancing&quot; and &quot;WFH&quot; became common parlance.But for investors, we'll also look back at 2020 as a game-changing year for e-commerce stocks. For many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic quickly turned e-commerce from a convenience into a necessity, and changed how we do business, who we shop with and how companies operate.&quot;Whenever we have a recessionary period, disruption increases substantially. Individuals are losing their jobs and they have to make budget decisions,&quot; says David Yepez, lead equity analyst and portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Oklahoma. &quot;What makes this unique is that we're in a recessionary period, but we can't leave the house, a lot of us. So it's even faster.&quot;Online sales accounted for 16% of spending in the U.S. in 2019, with the total dollar number rising from $461 billion in 2017 to $602 billion last year. That upward trend should continue. While people won't always have to shop online out of sheer necessity, the longer people stay indoors for their safety, the greater the chance that new habits will form, bolstering the fortunes of rising e-commerce stocks.&quot;E-commerce giants have risen to the challenge and largely met consumer expectations,&quot; says Jeremie Capron, director of research at New York-based index, advisory, and research company Robo Global. &quot;As a result, we expect an increase in adoption, not only during this crisis but also on the other side of it.&quot;Here, then, are the 11 best e-commerce stocks to buy if you want to capitalize on this unprecedented disruption - not just in the U.S., but across the world.

2020-05-06,"PayPal (PYPL) is scheduled to announce Q1 earnings results today after market close. Going into the print the Street is looking for EPS of $0.75 (-3.8% Y/Y) and revenue of $4.72B (+14.3% Y/Y).However, RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin believes these estimates may prove too optimistic. “Based on our prior work and what we learned intra-quarter, we believe there is downside risk to both our and the Street’s revenue and EPS estimates given the evolving impacts from COVID-19” he writes.The analyst has a buy rating on the stock with a $120 price target- indicating that shares could pullback by just over 4%. He is expecting revenue of $4,758M, EPS of $0.76, and EBITDA of $1,262M. That’s alongside TPV (total payment volume) of $192,418M- significantly below the Street’s expected $196,369M.“We are forecasting TPV of ~$192B (19% y/y growth), a slight deceleration from the year- ago quarter, as we expect impacts from COVID-19 began showing up in its business in mid-late March” the analyst explains.While datapoints suggest e-commerce sales have held up the most, Perlin nonetheless sees a downward bias in the data as efforts to maintain social distancing put downward pressure on consumption and peer-to-peer payments.Looking forward, Perlin believes the largest effects will materialize next quarter (Q2/20).What’s more, the stock has already rallied 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 which is down 11% over the same period. Given this recent rally as well as Covid-19-related risks, Perlin concludes “we believe the setup into the print skews negative.”Overall, PYPL scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus, with 15 recent buy ratings vs just 3 hold ratings. Meanwhile the $129 average analyst price target indicates upside potential of just over 2.5%.

2020-05-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Viva Republica Ltd., operator of South Korea’s largest fintech startup Toss, is planning to raise about $200 million from investors to bankroll its expansion in online banking and security trading services.The company just embarked on its funding round and hopes to complete it in coming months, founder Lee Seung-gun said in an interview, declining to disclose the expected valuation. Lee is also aiming to go public in two to three years, with a listing in South Korea, Hong Kong, the U.S. or two of the destinations, he said.Toss, founded in 2011 and incorporated in 2013, is South Korea’s largest fintech startup with some 10 million monthly active users. It reached its first break-even month in April and is now processing 4.5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) of transactions a month after handling about 9.2% of the country’s online transfers in 2019. The company is planning to start a securities brokerage service in the second half of this year and build an internet bank in July next year, helping it win a bigger slice of the $43 billion financial market in South Korea.“At a time like this, a company that grows fast and makes profit will get more money,” Lee, the 38-year-old dentist turned startup founder, said in an interview. “Our goal is to become a finance super app, making people open Toss for any financial activities without question.”The Seoul-based company was able to cut spending thanks to a new open banking system adopted by the government late last year. That helped shrink commission payments to banks to a third of the original cost. Revenue grew six times in the last two years, and Lee aims to generate tens of billions of won in profit this year and more than one hundred billion won next year.Lee’s goal is make Toss the world’s first super app that aggregates all the services provided by fintech giants such as Paypal Holdings Inc., Robinhood Markets Inc. and Credit Karma. Out of a total of 40 services, Toss’s five major units -- money transfer, loans and credit rating management, insurance, investment and credit cards -- evenly generate most of the revenue and profit.Toss wants to offer securities brokerage services and loans to small businesses and consumers with interest rates between 5% and 15%. By eliminating complicated interfaces and terminology, Lee’s betting that the two services could lure half the country’s population, or about 25 million people, to actively use its app in two years.Lee will hire around 200 workers for the online bank unit and as many as 90 employees for the brokerage service.In a country dominated by family-run conglomerates, Toss stands out for advocating policy change. Lee said the government is now encouraging more “destructive players” to innovate in the finance industry.“The founder dreams big, but he’s also great with execution and quick to deliver on his promises,” said He Tiantian, vice president of Sequoia Capital China, which invested in 2018 and followed up in every ensuing round. “Korea’s financial market is very well developed and the market potential for fintech is huge.”Toss has raised a total of more than $350 million and was valued at $2.4 billion in its previous fund-raising round. It’s also backed by PayPal Holdings Inc., Goodwater Capital, GIC Pte, Altos Ventures.Lee is looking for expansion outside of South Korea. The company started a reward service in Vietnam, giving people monetary incentive for completing tasks such as walking thousands of steps a day. It’s lured 300,000 monthly active users. It’s exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia and Japan as well.For Lee, this is the first time he has broken even in his 10-year startup career. A yoga enthusiast, Lee said he’s planning to take a trip to Hawaii with his employees -- all 350 of them -- to celebrate the turnaround when the virus outbreak settles.“There were concerns among the market whether fintech is a profitable business,” said Lee. “Toss proves that it can achieve fast growth and make profits at the same time.”(Updates with fundraising timeframe and transactions growth from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",38-Year-Old CEO of Korean Fintech Leader Seeks $200 Million

2020-05-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. rallied as much as 13%, reaching a record high in early trading on Thursday, with analysts zeroing in on the payments company’s strong April trends and growth in electronic transactions across the board.Square Inc. rose as much as 8.6% to the highest since early March, as it benefited from some of that, too. But worries about credit and its small-and-medium sized business market factored in as well.Both are outperforming the market so far this year, with PayPal soaring 34% and Square up 19%, even as the S&P 500 has shed 11%, stung by the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteFor PayPal, “April really took off,” Faucette wrote in a note, “as consumers settled into modified behaviors.”Surging online activity and changes in behavior mean there’s a chance the firm can boost offline acceptance, which is key to maintaining its “pole position in the development of digital wallet services,” he said. That’s along with a big jump in new account activations, which quickened the pace of existing business growth.On the other hand, the downturn “makes Square look like a bank,” Faucette said, with loss reserves wiping out profit.

Also, management commentary pointing to “durable” consumer shifts to online spending bolstered his view that the “current crisis only accelerated the longer-term, secular, consumer shift to e-commerce.”Del Gross sees PayPal as a “longer-term winner post-Covid.”However, Square’s expenses were materially higher than forecast due to a higher loan loss provision, and April’s worse-than-expected gross payment volume update signaled “material deceleration.” Plus, April’s Cash App new user growth may be “transitory once the effects of stimulus payments wane,” he added.He rates PayPal shares buy, with a target of $150; rates Square sell, with a target of $50.Guggenheim, Jeff Cantwell“Payment flows are shifting to e-commerce and digital as the world economy reorganizes in response to Covid-19,” Cantwell wrote, leaving PayPal “extremely well-positioned to grow TPV rapidly.”Bullish developments included adding a record number of net new active users in April at 7.4 million and record levels of customer engagement on the platform. Cantwell raised his PayPal price target to $152 from $123 and rates shares buy.KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani“We believe the payments industry is a beneficiary of the post Covid-19 changes society will implement, which will include a diminishing dependence on cash and check usage,” Sakhrani wrote. “Within that paradigm, PayPal should be a disproportionate beneficiary.” He rates shares outperform and lifted his price target to $152 from $120.(Updates first through third paragraphs for trading.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal Soars, Square Gains With Focus on Latest Trends"

2020-05-08,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the few that is near its all-time highs, NVDA stock has added more than 25% so far this year.  And to keep up the growth, CEO Jensen Huang has been doing something that is fairly different for his company: acquisitions.Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com There are clear benefits to the strategy. First of all, the technology creation process can take too long and this could mean missing out on big-time opportunities. Next, without acquisitions, there is the potential danger that the culture will get too insular. What's more, M&A can expand the monetization opportunities and result in a more robust customer base.OK then, so let's take a look at the deal for Mellanox Technologies -- which should be a nice driver for NVDA stock. It's actually the biggest acquisition in the company's history, at about $6.9 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips NVDA Stock and MellanoxFounded at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, Mellanox Technologies was created by former executives from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Galileo Technology.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now The initial focus was on the development of integrated circuits. But over time, the founders realized there was an opportunity with high-compute environments, involving Ethernet, switches, servers, and InfiniBand networks. And yes, the timing was spot-on as various trends started to emerge, such as for cloud computing and mobile computing.Consider that Mellanox's technology provides major benefits like low latency, high throughput and reduced database recovery time. Just some of the use cases include: real-time fraud detection for PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), image recognition for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and high-speed streaming for Neflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).What about the market opportunity? It's enormous. Mellanox estimates it at $19 billion.In fact, here's what Huang had to say about the deal:&quot;The expanding use of AI and data science is reshaping computing and data center architectures. With Mellanox, the new NVIDIA has end-to-end technologies from AI computing to networking, full-stack offerings from processors to software, and significant scale to advance next-generation data centers. Our combined expertise, supported by a rich ecosystem of partners, will meet the challenge of surging global demand for consumer internet services, and the application of AI and accelerated data science from cloud to edge to robotics.&quot;But the Mellanox is not the only acquisition that should help NVDA stock. The company also acquired Cumulus Networks, which has built an open platform for network switches (the company raised $134 million in venture capital from investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital).Keep in mind that Cumulus and Mellanox have forged a strong partnership as well. So with Nvidia's ownership, there should be even more seamless integration in terms of software and hardware - helping to further boost penetration in the data center. Bottom Line on Nvidia StockNow it's true that acquisitions can be risky. After all, Nvidia is paying top dollar for Mellanox, but it's important to keep in mind that both companies have had a long-standing relationship. This should help mitigate potential issues.But the recent dealmaking is a clear indication of Nvidia's confidence in its business. Huang realizes that the data center opportunity is secular and that customers want comprehensive solutions.&quot;Machine learning and AI is changing how Nvidia is becoming a second reliable compute provider in this market,&quot; said Omer Cheema, who is the Head of Technology Strategy at Samsung's semiconductor business. &quot;In order to be a leader -- who defines the next-gen data center architecture -- the company needs to build deep capabilities in connectivity and storage areas. Their recent acquisitions are the first steps towards this long-term goal.&quot;Granted, when it comes to NVDA stock though, it is far from cheap. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 39X. Yet the shares deserve a premium because of its long-term growth profile, which has been boosted with its recent dealmaking.  And the acquisitions for both Mellanox and Cumulus look spot-on.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-05-08,"Some think of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) as a recession play. That is, when money is tight and people need something to eat -- either for substance or for comfort -- the Golden Arches is there. However, McDonald's stock hasn't acted in that way.Source: Nixx Photography / Shutterstock.com While some stocks continue to surge to new all-time highs, McDonald's isn't one of them. The stock is still down more than 18% from its 2020 high.However, that doesn't make it one for investors to pass on. Instead, they should be looking at McDonald's stock as a buying opportunity. The question they need to ask themselves is, &quot;at what price?&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sizing Up McDonald's StockRestaurants, fast-casual diners and fast-food operators are forecast to struggle this year. That ranges from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Wendy's (NYSE:WEN) and yes, McDonald's stock.Analysts forecast earnings to fall 27% this year to $5.69 per share. That's alongside a 14.4% decline in revenue. That's really not that bad, particularly when compared to some of its peers.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months However, 2021 is forecast to be a rebound year. Consensus expectations call for earnings growth of roughly 40%, along with revenue growth of 15.5%. Like anything, there are positives and negatives with these estimates -- and unknowns.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of Statista, Source from GeekWire; Gravity Payments For starters, we don't know if the novel coronavirus is done wreaking havoc on the economy. If it continues, 2021 estimates will likely need to come down.It's good to see earnings estimates for 2021 surpass that of 2019 ($7.92 per share vs. $7.84 per share). While it's always possible that McDonald's doesn't achieve this figure next year, it's a step in the right direction; it's a positive. The negative is revenue growth.Unlike something like 5G -- where investment spend will happen regardless of whether it's delayed -- when burger sales dip because restaurants are closed, those sales are gone. No one is buying two Big Macs at their first Mickey D's stop in May because they were deprived in April.McDonald's stock trades at about 30 times this year's earnings estimate, which is a bit pricey. But it trades at just 22 times 2019 earnings and 2021 estimates once we return to some normalcy. That's really not a bad price to pay for a high-quality company that yields about 2.8% -- particularly when 10-year Treasury yields are at just 0.63%. Buy the Dip  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMcDonald's stock will still be standing when Covid-19 blows over, but that doesn't mean investors should pay any price for it. It's not a bad price now, but it doesn't have the momentum that other stocks do.For instance, one of our favorites in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) just hit new all-time highs. The same can be said for Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP). But McDonald's is under pressure.Shares couldn't reclaim the $185 to $190 area. So far, it's being rejected by this zone, leaving investors to wonder if it can eventually power through or if a larger pullback could be brewing.Check out the $165 area on the chart above. Technically, this has been a significant level over the past few years. Plus, the rising 200-week moving average comes into play near $161.In this area, McDonald's stock will sport a dividend yield north of 3% and trade closer to 20 times 2021 earnings estimates (and 20 times 2019 earnings). It will also give investors a better risk/reward setup with a lower cost basis.Remember, the stock has not only paid, but raised its dividend for more than four decades. That has been the case since it first started paying its dividend in 1976.McDonald's stock isn't one of the most exciting names out there, let's be honest. But it's a high quality, consistent company with a great global business. Management has done a great job pivoting the business back toward growth and investors should consider it an excellent long-term anchor in their portfolio.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-08,"PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares surged 14.5% higher on Thursday as the company's first-quarter earnings report suggested it is set to grow during and after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 66 cents, 12% below the average analyst estimate of 75 cents.It posted a total revenue of $4.6 billion, missing the Wall Street estimate of $4.74 billion by nearly 3%.Regulatory Framework Change Caused Low EPS RBC Capital Markets Analysts noted that the first-quarter adjusted EPS missed the expectations due to the new Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standards mandates. Absent the regulatory change, PayPal would have posted an EPS of 83 cents, up 9% from what the analysts had estimated.&quot;The change was a result of the deteriorating economic factors and the company feels the current level is conservative,&quot; Rosenblatt Securities analyst said. &quot;This will be an area to watch going forward as unemployment has continued to worsen but stimulus checks have improved payment trends, highlighting there are a variety of factors the company will have some leeway in assessing.According to Wells Fargo Securities analysts, a similar CECL loss is &quot;unlikely to occur to the same degree&quot; in the coming quarters.'April Really Took Off'The payments company suggested an estimated revenue growth of 20% in April, something that analysts see as a sign of the company's ability to take advantage of the digital business boom caused by COVID-19.&quot;As consumers settled into modified behaviors after implementation of social distancing measures, [which] started in the US and Western Europe in March, PayPal's business really took off,&quot; Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.Net new account activations soared to 7.4 million in April, almost twice than the numbers in March, and compared with 10 million organic net new account activations in the entire first-quarter, the analysts noted.PayPal also estimated a total portfolio value growth of 22% in April, which Morgan Stanley analysts found impressive, given that they had estimated a travel-related drag between 6% and 8% for the company. The payments company further reported May 1 to be its biggest transaction day ever.View more earnings on PYPL&quot;For us the better subscriber growth trajectory combined with higher initial engagement should translate into better compounding growth,&quot; they said.Things Look Good Beyond Pandemic Effect Analysts noted that PayPal's growth trajectory looks good beyond the surge caused by the pandemic.&quot;The market increasingly looks to PYPL as one of the clear secular winners on the other side of the current crisis with the anticipation of higher earnings power warranting higher valuations,&quot; Wells Fargo analysts said.Morgan Stanley analysts noted the company's numbers from Austria and Germany, two countries among the first to ease coronavirus-related lockdowns, suggest that PayPal's usage didn't see any change even as social distancing measures were relaxed.The company's usage is still running at two to three times of pre-coronavirus level, the analysts said.PYPL Ratings, Price Targets Wells Fargo has an overweight rating and raised its price target from $120 to $150.Rosenblatt has a buy rating and increased its price target from $117 to $145.RBC Capital Markets has an outperform rating and increased its price target from $120 to $142.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating and a price target of $131.PYPL Price Action Paypal closed 14% higher at $146.29 on Thursday and added another 0.5% in the after-hours session.

2020-05-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For financial markets, March 23, 2020, is a day that will go down in history.On that day, the S&P 500 Index fell to 2,191.86, easily wiping out all the gains since President Donald Trump was sworn into office. It also marked what as of now appears to be the turning point in the coronavirus crisis. Not because of any epidemiological breakthrough, mind you, but rather because the Federal Reserve announced an array of programs in conjunction with the Treasury Department that went above and beyond the response to the 2008 financial crisis. Most notably, the central bank unveiled a facility to buy U.S. corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds tracking that market.Since then, investment-grade bond issuance has rewritten the history books. Encouraged by the Fed’s backstop, the final week of March catapulted supply to a record $260 billion, only to be topped by April’s $285.6 billion onslaught. The first full week of May brought an additional $93 billion to market. Credit spreads are wider than they were before the pandemic, but on average remain 160 basis points tighter than their March 23 peak.Remarkably, this all happened without the Fed buying a single corporate bond.This seven-week period of all talk and no action will end Tuesday, with the New York Fed announcing that its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will begin buying eligible ETFs invested in corporate debt. It will be the first Fed program using the $454 billion in total equity funding from the federal stimulus law to actually get off the ground.Make no mistake, that’s a milestone in and of itself. These $750 billion corporate credit facilities are new terrain for the central bank, as opposed to purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities that are old hat from the last downturn. To get the program started in less than two months, while juggling several others, is impressive.Still, it’s worth stepping back to say that the Fed is still mostly offering financial markets a placebo at this point. For better or worse, investors have mostly turned around the fortunes of risky assets entirely on their own.Consider the Fed’s Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which would buy debt directly from issuers, rather than on the secondary market. The central bank said only that it would start up “in the near future.” Currently, there’s almost no need for it, given the record-breaking barrage of bond sales. According to the term sheet, any eligible bonds or syndicated loans will be subject to a 100-basis-point “facility fee.” The central bank will also only purchase debt due in four years or less, which might be an unappealing option to many companies that are looking to extend maturities over the coming decades. Just on Monday, PayPal Holdings Inc. and Walt Disney Co. priced 30-year securities, joining a broader trend in the credit markets.Relatedly, the terms for the Fed’s Municipal Liquidity Facility are also seen as overly constraining. As Bloomberg News’s Amanda Albright and Danielle Moran reported, even states and localities with top credit ratings would pay an extra 150 basis points above an overnight indexed swap rate to borrow. The Bond Dealers of America, in an April letter to the central bank, suggested a pricing penalty of benchmark index rates plus 10 basis points for double-A borrowers. Some state finance officials were taken aback:Ben Watkins, Florida’s director of bond finance, said he was surprised by the pricing levels released by the Fed, thinking originally they were going to be lower. He said the rates may deter eligible issuers from tapping the facility and support the view of the Fed as a backstop if the market isn’t working properly.“From an issuers perspective the first thing we ask ourselves is: ‘What is the cheapest source of funding?’ and that is what you go to every time,” Watkins said.The question for bond traders is whether they’re comfortable being the cheapest source of funding for strapped cities and companies at this point in the coronavirus crisis. If the Fed’s facilities truly are meant as a last resort, rather than an additional source of large-scale buying power, is that consistent with the current yield levels in credit markets?I contemplated this question of “buy the rumor, sell the news” in a column two weeks ago. Since then, the largest ETF tracking the investment-grade market, known by its ticker LQD, has only fallen further. It declined on Monday to the lowest level since April 8, the day before the Fed widened its corporate-bond buying facilities to include “fallen angels” and high-yield ETFs. It jumped in early trading on Tuesday. The largest muni ETF (ticker: MUB) is also lower than it was a month ago, with some $2.5 billon of deals considered “day to day” in a sign that issuers are skeptical of market conditions.“We’re no longer in a market of panic, so participants can decide on a relative value basis whether they want to own investment-grade corporates or not,” David Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp., told Bloomberg’s Molly Smith and Katherine Greifeld. The same appears to be the case for munis.And yet, according to an agreement with BlackRock Inc., the secondary-market credit facility will buy corporate bonds and ETFs in three stages: a “stabilization” phase, an “ongoing monitoring” phase and a “reduction in support” phase. It’s odd to think that a market with back-to-back months of record supply needs any sort of stabilization.All this feels somewhat circular. The markets aren’t panicked because the Fed has said it will provide a backstop. But so far, it hasn’t had to do much in the way of support. Current pricing and the details of its facilities suggest borrowers may not need — or want — the central bank’s help. Therefore, the backstop could be much smaller than anticipated. The idea that the Fed will suddenly “turbocharge credit” seems misplaced.In the long run, a light touch from the Fed is probably ideal. But those buying into the red-hot debt markets now should recognize that they’re on their own and understand the central bank’s efforts for what they are — a last resort. If companies and municipalities are flocking to the Fed’s facilities, something has probably gone wrong.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-05-13,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) has turned to the corporate bond market to raise $4 billion, a May 11 filing reveals.The new debt raise consists of four tranches, each of $1 billion, as follows: 1.35% notes due 2023, 1.65% notes due 2025, 2.3% notes due 2030 and 3.25% notes due 2050.The offering is expected to close on May 18, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, says the filing.Following the new bond issuance, Fitch Ratings affirmed its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for PayPal at ‘BBB+’ with a Stable Outlook.Fitch also assigned a ‘BBB+’ rating to the announced senior notes, which will be senior unsecured securities and pari passu with existing senior notes.“Proceeds from the notes will be used to repay $3 billion outstanding under its revolver as well as for other general corporate purposes including share repurchases, capex, strategic investments and M&A” says Fitch.It notes that PayPal has fared particularly well through the coronavirus pandemic to date, with revenue and total payments volume (TPV) growing 5% and 7%, respectively, in March despite the global economic shock, accelerating to 20%-22% in April.“Fitch believes PayPal’s strong leadership role in digital payments and e-commerce as well as its solid profitability will position it well in the years ahead” the ratings agency explains.Indeed, the stock also boasts a Strong Buy analyst consensus, with 21 recent buy ratings vs just 4 hold ratings.

2020-05-15,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is poised to benefit from new trends spurred by both the novel coronavirus pandemic and the e-commerce revolution. Moreover, PYPL stock is far more attractive at this point than rivals Square (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com With e-commerce exploding, PayPal should get a lift as millions more customers utilize it to pay for their online purchases. And importantly, PayPal has heavy exposure to many of the large e-commerce businesses whose sales are currently booming. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are among the companies with huge e-commerce revenues that accept PayPal.While PayPal still can't be used as a payment method on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the biggest e-commerce player of them all, I think Jeff Bezos could decide to accept PayPal within a year or two. PayPal continues to expand. Soon, Bezos won't want to lose sales by continuing to refuse a partnership.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis exposure to huge companies should largely insulate PYPL stock from the bankruptcies of smaller businesses during the recession. That isn't the case for Square and Shopify, which earn a majority of their revenue from small and medium businesses. PYPL Stock Will Benefit From Market Share GainsPayPal looks poised to take significant market share from the large credit card networks, including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Of course, the e-commerce boom will contribute to that phenomenon. But I believe that, as the pandemic continues, many smaller businesses will start accepting PayPal payments alongside credit cards.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future When customers pay for products or services with credit cards, they often have to come fairly close to cashiers or whoever is carrying Square's payment machine. And to use credit cards, consumers have to press buttons on the same machine that many other people have touched.Of course, PayPal allows users to pay for products and services without touching a shared machine. Therefore, I believe that many businesses will look to accommodate consumers who are very worried about the virus by accepting PayPal as a payment method. Strong April ResultsAs most of the U.S. and Europe went into lockdown in April, PayPal's business soared.  In conjunction with its first-quarter results, PayPal reported that its net new active users had jumped 140% in April versus January and February.It also added 7.4 million net new customers in April, and CEO Dan Schulman provided guidance for ""15 million to 20 million net new active accounts [that] we anticipate adding in Q2.""As the company continues to add new users, a virtuous cycle should be created. Specifically, as more users are added, more businesses will accept PayPal. And as consumers see that more businesses are accepting PayPal, more of them will sign up for the service. That cycle should accelerate over time. PayPal's Honey CatalystHoney, an app which PayPal acquired last year, automatically provides users with discounts and notifies them when the prices of items they're interested in drops by a certain percentage. Schulman believes that the data that Honey generates will be lucrative for merchants, and he thinks that the app will eventually be able to automatically purchase products for consumers when items fall to a certain price.Honey is already quite valuable for consumers because of its ability to automatically apply coupons. As a result, the app will likely spur many more users to join PayPal.If Honey can make automatic purchases at certain price points, PayPal will become even more valuable to consumers. And PayPal may be able to generate meaningful revenue by selling the data that Honey collects to merchants. Valuation and the Bottom Line on PayPalPayPal is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average 2020 earnings per share estimates, of 43. That's a bargain for a rapidly growing tech name like PayPal.Moreover, the company's actual forward P/E ratio may be meaningfully lower because, given its rapid growth recently, many analysts are probably underestimating its 2020 EPS. Square, by contrast, trades at a forward P/E ratio of 133.PayPal's shares trade at a trailing price-sales ratio of 9.4. In comparison, Shopify stock trades at a trailing P/S ratio of 48.Given PayPal's positive catalysts and relatively low valuation, investors should buy PYPL stock now.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

2020-05-22,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has been a huge winner in 2020. The company has suffered only a modest negative impact from the novel coronavirus. And while the company has had to increase reserves for potential credit losses due to the virus, it's made up for that and more with a huge surge in payments activity. As a result, its shares are up an astounding 39% year-to-date. And for anyone that bought at the March lows, PayPal has soared 76% since the bottom.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com That said, the good news is that Paypal stock could have further to go still. That's because PayPal is one of the best-positioned companies out there for dealing with the current economic environment. With the virus still a lingering threat, who wants to be handling grimy physical cash right now? Many transactions have moved online, and PayPal is there to facilitate them.In the span of a few months, we've seen years worth of economic activity move into the digital realm -- and PayPal is right at the heart of the action. That said, it gets even better. PayPal is seeing demand soar even while the credit card companies are witnessing declining volumes for a reason we'll discuss in a moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, PayPal is in the sweet spot, and its shareholders are reaping the benefits. Leading The Contactless Retail RevolutionPayPal should be a huge beneficiary of post-coronavirus ""contactless"" retail practices. While contactless retail may seem like a simple phrase, it encompasses a ton of territory. You have traditional e-commerce, curbside pickup, cashier-less checkout in stores, in-app payments and more. The good news is that many of these options put PayPal on equal footing with the credit card networks. Therefore, plastic's traditional monopoly on digital payments is breaking down.  * 10 Stocks on a Bankruptcy Watch Contactless retail is hardly just a U.S. phenomenon either. In the United Kingdom -- for example -- thanks to the coronavirus, a major card company raised the limits on transaction sizes for many contactless payments. For British pound-based commerce, the limit increased from 30 pounds to 50 pounds per transaction. Following the increased limit, the average contactless transaction size has jumped nearly 50%, to 14 pounds each, and the contactless channel is earning tremendous market share, picking up nearly half of purchases within that price range.Of course, skeptics will say that this sort of uptake is happening primarily due to the crisis. And once it passes, people may return to their old ways. Some will, undoubtedly, but many won't. And once people become accustomed to the ease of contactless payments, many shoppers will stick with it forever -- thus increasing PayPal's share of the overall ecosystem. Astounding ResultsOverall, we can see this playing out in the company's most recent operating results. During April, PayPal gained 7.4 million new accounts and grew processed payments 18%. Given the sharp overall drop in economic activity, these are staggering figures. The total commerce pie shrank dramatically during April, yet PayPal managed to produce strong double-digit growth.This is in stark contrast to the major credit card companies. In fact, both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) suffered 20% or greater declines in transaction activity over the same period.This shows another advantage to PayPal, as it tends to be favored by younger and more online customers who have rising earnings power as they get older. Visa and Mastercard are undoubtedly great brands. However, some of their most profitable business is tied to established business customers who will be reining in spending for the foreseeable future.Up until this crisis, Visa and Mastercard were widely viewed as the most powerful and entrenched payments companies out there. However, as PayPal gains market share, its valuation will continue to catch up with the credit card titans. Paypal Stock VerdictSimply put, PayPal is an innovative market force that will continue to lead. The company was already producing fantastic results before the current pandemic started, and what's going on with the health crisis will be an unbelievable shot of adrenaline for the war on cash. Therefore, as long as people are being careful, PayPal will take more market share -- not only from cash, but also from credit cards.Yes, Paypal stock is rich. It is trading at 46 times forward earnings, and nearly 10 times revenues. Both of those are way up there, but it is deserving of its premium price. The company has grown its earnings at more than 30% a year compounded over the past five years, and analysts see 20% earnings per share (EPS) growth going forward. These are tremendous numbers in any environment, and especially so with the coronavirus-induced recession causing slowdowns for so many other leading companies.Even the credit card companies have been showing signs of weakness thanks to the economic situation. Yet, Visa and Mastercard routinely trade for more than 30x earnings, and were trading for as much as 20x sales prior to the March market crash.Collectively, PayPal doesn't look bad at all by comparison, so don't let its valuation scare you too much.

V stock is up almost 50% from the lows, but could it have more to go?Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com I like Visa for a couple of reasons, but here's the main one: It can function with an open or closed economy.Obviously a prolonged recession doesn't do credit card companies any good. That will lead to a selloff in Visa, but also in MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). For now though, we're not looking at a prolonged shutdown, which bodes well for the group.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reopening AmericaA number of stocks -- from Carnival Cruise (NYSE:CCL) to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) -- have been hammered. That's as much of the U.S. and many parts of the world entered multi-week and multi-month lockdowns. That's a clear detriment to their business model. For Visa though, there's at least a silver lining. The company benefits from online sales too.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure So as consumers sign up for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and shop on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), those credit card sales are ringing up.

Click to EnlargeIs this enough to offset all of the lost sales over the past few months? No, not completely. But it helps quite a bit. Combine that with the country beginning the reopening process -- and seeing fast action by the public -- and it's no wonder V stock is in demand. Taking V Stock a Step FurtherThe country is reopening and that's an obvious boon for credit card companies. But let's not forget, Visa has cemented itself in a long-term secular trend. As we digitize our wallets -- shifting to more online sales, using cryptocurrency, etc. -- this is only going to benefit Visa and others.However, Visa also benefits from a secular shift from cash and check to credit and debit. This trend has been in play long before the novel coronavirus came along and will remain in trend long after it's gone.Further, Covid-19 will likely accelerate tap-to-pay, touchless pay, money sharing and other technologies that don't rely on physical money handling. Put simply, Visa has a hand in all the different future versions of payment -- different formats of which continue to pop up.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO Dan Shulman says digital payment trends are accelerating at a rapid pace.

Because it will continue to fuel top- and bottom-line growth for companies like Visa. Valuing VisaFor now, current estimates call for revenue to fall 4% in 2020 to approximately $22 billion. On the earnings front, estimates call for a 7% decline this year. If we could see break-even results this year, it would bode well for investors and V stock. Particularly as this is a core holding in many portfolios.While Visa does have roughly $17.8 billion in total debt, remember, this is a $425 billion market cap company. That's a small sum for a company of this size. Further, total assets of $72.8 billion are almost double total liabilities at $38.2 billion.There's just one other point I want to make. We often praise Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for its margins and profitability. The company sports trailing gross margins 81.72% vs. Visa at 81.55%. However, when it comes to net profitability, Visa dominates. Its net margins are all the way up at 52.26% compared to Facebook at ""just"" 28.57%.Combine that with an economic reopening and it's no wonder V stock is rallying.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-29,"With reopening America on the minds of investors and consumers alike, many beaten down stocks are on the mend. One of the biggest names in that regard has been Carnival Cruise (NYSE:CCL). CCL stock has given investors hope, more than doubling from its March low.Source: Ruth Peterkin / Shutterstock.com But is there a false sense of security with the stock's move? After all, the entire stock market hardly seems to notice the fact that 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment in two months. Or that GDP is plunging. The world isn't ending, but it's far from flourishing at the moment.While we're expecting to see a sharp but short recession due to the novel coronavirus, it's hard to ignore the facts of what's going on. For Carnival, it may have very well bottomed. But that doesn't mean it should be a go-to investment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Digging Deeper on CCL StockCarnival faces a clear disruption to its business line. When the country -- and most of the world -- went under lockdown, cruise lines, airlines and travel companies took a big hit.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure Unlike many retail outlets, be it Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Target (NYSE:TGT), business did not continue to come through the door. Companies like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) also saw revenue dry up, but it didn't completely shut off.In the case of Carnival, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) and others, revenue shut down as ships were docked and sailings were cancelled. Customers called in for refunds, while maintenance and ship costs were still being logged. This creates a severe drag on cash and put the companies' liquidity at stake.While Delta and other airlines are also experiencing notable cash burn, they have been operating and can get back up and running more quickly. Maybe running at such low capacity is worse for their cash situation -- it's a worthy debate. But arguing about which industry has it less bad is far inferior to researching the industries that are doing the best right now.In that sense, I'd rather invest in companies that are seeing unshakable growth, or even accelerating growth despite the impact from the novel coronavirus.Because of this cash burn, CCL stock has had to seek outside funds. It raised $5.75 billion in debt due in 2023 and roughly $500 million in an equity offering. The company has also seen solid demand for its cruises later this year, provided they sail.Between rising bookings and a big cash infusion, Carnival should avoid a liquidity event and live to fight another day. For investors, that's all they can ask for at this time and the stock has responded in kind. Valuing Carnival Stock  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThis is perhaps the most difficult part of the puzzle: Valuation.How do you value a company that, almost overnight, had its sales funnel shut off while expenses continue to bleed on? Further, how long will the country remain reopened? Will there be a second wave of Covid-19 or another series of lockdowns?These types of unknowns translate to discounts in the stock price, which is exactly what we've seen in CCL stock. Factor in the additional debt -- where long-term debt was at ""just"" $9.7 billion at the end of last quarter -- and it becomes even trickier.We've seen shares trade down to and bounce twice at $8 now. That's what technicians call a ""double bottom."" Given the state of the company and uncertainty at that time vs. where Carnival is now, that may very well be the bottom. So why up at $16, double that prior level, do investors want to buy in now?In that respect, I want to go with the businesses that are working. I want to invest in companies with strong balance sheets and solid growth this year and next year. Yes these companies command higher valuations, but they justify the premium because of that strong growth.I'm talking about companies like Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). There might be an opportunity in CCL, but I don't want to speculate, I want to invest, and I'm doing it with the best of the best.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

The size of the investment wasn’t disclosed.The investment is made as part of Gojek’s current fundraising round. Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL) and Tencent are also among the list of investors.Since launching its app in 2015, Gojek has brought hundreds of thousands of merchants onto its platform, giving them access to more than 170 million people across Southeast Asia. Its payments business processes billions of transactions each year and owns the largest e-wallet in Indonesia.Facebook said Gojek is Indonesia’s first and fastest growing app for ordering food, shopping, commuting, and making digital payments across Southeast Asia. With this investment the social media operator seeks to “support the growth of millions of small businesses”.The investment is the first it has made in an Indonesia-based business as it wants to have a foothold in the country, including through its Whatsapp service. Just over a month ago, the social media giant announced a $5.7 billion investment for 9.99% of Jio Platforms Ltd., an Indian telecommunications company.Gojek said the new investment will help its target to boost Southeast Asia’s digital economy, with a focus on payments and financial services in the region.As part of a commercial agreement, PayPal’s payment tools will be integrated into Gojek’s services and the two companies will also collaborate to allow customers of GoPay, Gojek’s digital wallet, to gain access to PayPal’s network of more than 25 million merchants around the world.“Southeast Asia is at an inflection point in digital adoption that creates new opportunities to deliver financial services to previously unbanked merchants and consumers,” PayPal’s Farhad Maleki said in a statement.Five-star analyst Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank yesterday raised PayPal’s price target to $183 (16% upside potential) from $147 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, amid expectations that the company will sustain elevated payment volume growth rates above its medium term guidance driven by higher e-commerce user adoption.Keane adds that business improved further into early May and he believes that PayPal likely hasn't seen any material change in ""strong"" growth rates as global economies are starting to gradually reopen.The Wall Street analyst community has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy consensus is backed up by 21 Buy versus 6 Hold ratings. The $151.73 average price target set by analysts forecasts 3.7% downside potential after shares almost doubled since March.

2020-06-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. are investing in Gojek, a big boost for the Indonesian startup’s digital payments business that propels the U.S. companies into a fast-growing Asian internet arena.It’s the second international investment Facebook has made in the past six weeks with a goal of getting more local businesses online, after the social media giant paid $5.7 billion for about 10% of India’s Reliance Jio. It plans to build a commerce and payments business around WhatsApp, on top of letting businesses use the messaging service to interact with customers.The deal announced Wednesday marks Facebook’s first investment in an Indonesian company and is a major boost for the country’s largest startup, a ride-hailing giant that’s morphed into a provider of services like payments and meal delivery. Gojek is now backed by some of the world’s largest internet companies from Alphabet Inc.’s Google to China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., helping it compete against Singapore’s Grab Holdings Inc.“WhatsApp in particular can be instrumental in creating a more digital Indonesia by bringing more people into one of the fastest growing digital economies in the world,” WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema said in a blog post. The company didn’t specify how much it is investing and a spokesperson declined to share details.Indonesia is one of the world’s most promising internet markets, fueled by rapidly expanding smartphone adoption and economic growth. It’s the largest country in Southeast Asia, anchoring a regional internet economy estimated at more than $100 billion in 2019 and tripling by 2025.

This recovery came after all major indices collapsed on global shutdown concerns. From the period of February 19 to March 23, the Nasdaq-100 lost roughly 30%. This recovery has received mixed reactions from investors, as much of the rebound has been propelled by the unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Unemployment has also risen drastically, with other macroeconomic figures like GDP and Durable Goods sinking.Within the Nasdaq-100, several names have contributed to the momentum behind this rally. As of May, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) remains one of the best performers, up roughly 106% YTD and over 86% in 2020 alone. In the month of June so far, the electric vehicle manufacturer is up over 3%. Another top name in the Nasdaq-100 is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: REGN). Although the biotech name has seen shares fall over 2% in June thus far, shares are still up nearly 60% YTD as the company has been a benefactor in contributing to a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

2020-06-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Gojek and Grab Holdings Inc. have been battling it out for years in the brutal business of ride hailing and food delivery. They’ve burned billions of dollars in venture-capital money (thanks, SoftBank!), and created hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout Southeast Asia in the process. Yet talk to executives at either company and they’ll tell you that the real future of their businesses isn’t shuffling people, food and goods across the disparate lands of Southeast Asia. The big opportunity — read, profit — will come from all the other services they can tack on such as payments, loans, ticket sales, supply-chain management, and advertising.Which makes me think that in some markets it will make sense to park the vehicles.The role of taxis (and motorbikes) in this “ecosystem” paradigm is twofold: first, to use transport and food delivery as a door to the company’s broader product offering; second, to provide a reason to open the app multiple times a day, building consumer habits and brand recognition.One square centimeter of app logo on a smartphone screen is the most valuable piece of real estate in the modern world. It doesn’t really matter whether you’re selling taxi rides, a conversation with friends, or cheap goods. Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. built addiction to the latter two, and leveraged it to offer China’s dominant payments platforms.In Southeast Asia, transport is the service that found most traction, thanks to VC-funded subsidies and a brutal pricing war that saw even Uber Technologies Inc. beat a retreat. For all the talk of a dual rivalry, only Singapore-based Grab can be considered a truly regional player. It offers taxis in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and elsewhere. Gojek, the hometown hero in Indonesia, has struggled to find traction elsewhere.But that assessment is only true if you limit it to mobility — measured by their competing green logos on vehicle fleets across Asia’s sprawling metropolises. If you think of the battle as being about the far more important metric of smartphone-screen real estate, then Gojek can still be a solid international player. Grab’s non-transport businesses, such as payments, are nowhere near as established as its taxi services in most markets.Recent investments by Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. hint at Gojek’s direction. Facebook, which crucially also owns WhatsApp, put $300 million into Gojek’s latest funding round and now has a 2.4% stake in the Jakarta-based company’s payments business GoPay, The Ken reported last week, citing a venture-capital investor with knowledge of the deal. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Tencent have the same stake while PayPal holds 0.6% in GoPay, according to The Ken. As my colleague Andy Mukherjee wrote recently, Facebook’s interest in Asia extends beyond mere social networking. India, for example, is becoming a test bed for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s foray into payments and e-commerce. Its $5.7 billion investment in Jio Platforms Ltd. is less about getting a stake in Mukesh Ambani’s new telco, and more about tapping into India’s vast potential for content and commerce.Reliance Jio’s dirt-cheap wireless connections serve the same role as Tencent’s WeChat, Alibaba’s Taobao, or Grab and Gojek’s transport: They’re on-boarding mechanisms for consumers and businesses to then buy a broader array of services. This is why Facebook brings a lot more than just money to Gojek. The social media service is the top app in many parts of the region, WhatsApp is a key communication channel, and Instagram adds millions more users to the picture. If Gojek and GoPay can be combined with Facebook’s products for commerce or payments, then the Indonesian startup suddenly expands its smartphone real estate.PayPal is an important part of this strategy. The payments provider will be integrated into Gojek’s services while GoPay users will be able to tap into the U.S. company’s network of more than 25 million merchants globally, the two companies announced last week.With global leaders in the fields of social networking, instant messaging, advertising, and payments all now buying into the Gojek vision, it’s up to co-CEOs Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi to ride their Indonesian unicorn further afield. They can stay at home and battle over cheap rides and food, or ditch the taxis altogether and take on the rest of Asia. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

That includes companies such as ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., which last week raised $1.07 billion including the so-called greenshoe shares.Twenty-one IPOs have raised $6.8 billion in the past month, accounting for 44% of the total on U.S. exchanges this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, Palantir’s software mines troves of personal and commercial data and looks for patterns. The company, founded in 2003, got its start interpreting intelligence for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon and then moved on to banks, helping them watch for suspicious behavior. In-Q-Tel, the venture arm of the CIA, is a Palantir investor.Dozens of law enforcement and government agencies around the world use Palantir to compile and search for data on citizens with the intent of combating crime, hunting terrorists and in recent months, tracking the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic has boosted business, particularly with businesses using the products to help determine how to reopen.However, Palantir is highly controversial for the way its tools have been used to compromise privacy and enable excessive surveillance. Its use by police and immigration officials, in particular, has sparked numerous protests.IPO ResistedThe company had long resisted a public offering to avoid getting valued as a consultancy, and to stay out of the public eye as it worked toward profitability, people familiar with the matter have said.Its dependence on engineers customizing software for each client and bloated cost structure also resulted in consistent annual losses. That heightened the possibility that it wouldn’t be valued as a software company despite its Silicon Valley credentials.That changed last year, with customers using a new more automated product that has put Palantir on the path toward profitability.The company could go public within a year, Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp said in an interview with Axios Media on HBO last month.Palantir’s funders include Founders Fund, the venture capital firm started by Thiel. Other investors include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock Inc. and Tiger Global Management.PayPal, FacebookThiel, a co-founder of Pay PayPal Holdings Inc., has helped launch or advance Silicon Valley firms including Facebook Inc., where he has been a board member since 2004. Through Founders Fund, his influence has been extended to an array of technology companies.The billionaire has also served as an adviser to President Donald Trump, chastising other technology companies, in particular Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for their reluctance to work with the Defense Department.Palantir is in the process of expanding its board -- composed of Thiel and three other men -- to improve corporate governance and diversify perspectives. The company is interviewing candidates and intends to elect at least two independent members by the end of the year, people familiar with the matter said in April.(Revises description of Palantir’s tools and the controversy surrounding them starting in the 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Palantir to File IPO in Weeks For Possible Fall Debut
2020-06-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Two of Indonesia’s top fintech startups have agreed in principle to merge to create a stronger challenger to Gojek’s GoPay, according to people familiar with the matter.Digital-payments company Ovo and digital-wallet provider Dana ironed out differences over valuations and structure as they aim to reduce cash burn, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The signing of the deal was delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak and could happen soon after finalizing details, the people said. The terms and timing could change or the deal may still fall apart, they said.The Indonesian deal is a proxy battle between global powers. Ovo is part of the SoftBank Group Corp. empire and Dana is backed by an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., while Gojek’s investors include Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. A merger between the first two would tighten the alliance between SoftBank and Alibaba, and consolidate the Indonesia digital payments market to fewer major players. Ovo is backed by the Singapore-based ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings Inc., whose primary venture backer is SoftBank.If completed, the deal would help Grab compete with archrival Gojek on its home turf of Indonesia in digital-payment services. Both companies see digital payments as a crucial way to gain customers before offering them an array of financial products, which are aimed at helping the companies move toward profitability.An agreement would end months of negotiations over control and valuation. Ant Financial, the Alibaba financial services affiliate behind Dana, was reluctant to cede control of business, according to the people familiar with the matter. Ant has ambitions to expand its business across Southeast Asia, where it has local partners in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Under the proposed structure, Ant would remain a shareholder in the merged entity, while some of the major existing shareholders would see their stake trimmed, one of the people said.Representatives for Grab, Ovo, Dana and Ant Financial declined to comment.Read more: Banks, Startups Build a $38 Billion Southeast Asia Fintech ArenaThe merger is likely to create the biggest digital payments platform in the world’s fourth most populous country. Both Gojek’s GoPay and Ovo claim they are Indonesia’s largest e-wallet platform.Indonesia’s e-wallet players have all been mired in a bruising battle for leadership, mirroring the fight in the ride-hailing industry in the past. Ovo, which was started by Indonesia’s Lippo Group, is valued at $2.9 billion, according to CB Insights. Dana -- owned by Ant Financial and Indonesia’s media conglomerate Elang Mahkota Teknologi, better know as Emtek -- doesn’t publicly disclose its valuation.Gojek is moving quickly to expand its digital financial services. Indonesia’s largest startup scored Facebook and PayPal as new backers and launched a new online gold investment service this month. Gojek’s app has been downloaded 170 million times and was the mostly widely used on-demand app in Indonesia in 2019, according to App Annie. Ovo is present in 115 million devices.Related story: Facebook, PayPal Back Gojek’s Asia Digital Payments PushSoutheast Asia has seen a rapid adoption of digital finance since Grab and Gojek funneled some of the billions they raised into in-app payments and financial services.

2020-06-12,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has been on fire all year long. In 2020, PayPal stock is up 45% on the back of accelerating e-commerce and digital payment adoption, due to the novel pandemic.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Through most of PayPal's rally, I've been bullish on it. Indeed, towards the beginning of the year, I said that PYPL stock would rally to $150 in 2020. But the shares now trade closer to $160, and we are less than halfway through the year.So it's time to be less bullish on the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's nothing wrong with the company's fundamentals. It's still a dominant player in the hyper-growth digital payments space. And it can generate rapid revenue and profit growth for the next several years. That strong growth will result in powerful gains by PYPL stock.But there is something wrong with the stock's valuation today. At $160, PayPal stock is fully valued. And the shares could come under pressure over the next few months as e-commerce and digital payment adoption growth eases with the reopening of brick-and-mortar stores.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now As a result, I believe the huge 2020 rally of PayPal's stock is on its last legs. I'd avoid chasing the stock at its current levels. PayPal Is a Long-Term WinnerI've said it before and I'll say it again: PayPal stock is a long-term winner because it's a pure play on the non-cyclical transition away from cash and towards digital payments.In essence, over the past decade, consumers pivoted aggressively towards online shopping. Consumers can't buy things with cash online. So, out of necessity, digital payment platforms like PayPal were born to facilitate e-commerce.Now PayPal is the main payment platform of global e-commerce. Global e-retail sales in 2019 came in at $3.5 trillion. PayPal's total payment volume measured $712 billion. So PayPal effectively controls 20% of all e-retail sales.That has been true for the past several years. It will remain true over the next several years, too, as PayPal continues to improve its core product and branch out into mobile payments with Venmo.As a consequence, PayPal is a dominant pure play on the digital-payment revolution. To that end, the company will sustain robust revenue and profit growth over the next few years, keeping PYPL stock on its long-term uptrend. PayPal's Valuations Risks Will Be Highlighted by Its Slowing GrowthAlthough PayPal stock is a long-term winner, it does tend to get ahead of itself every once in a while. That's what happened in January 2018,August 2018, and July 2019.June 2020 appears to be another one of those times.Today the stock is as richly valued as it's ever been, across every major valuation multiple. Its trailing sales multiple is above ten, a record high and about double its historical average. The forward price/earnings multiple is near 50, also a record high and more than 50% above the historical average. The trailing P/E multiple, the price-book multiple and the price-EBITDA multiple are all also in the same situation.I understand that growth stocks can have long periods of extended valuation as long as the news flow surrounding them remains overwhelmingly positive.That's exactly where PayPal is today. Consumer spending is rebounding. E-commerce sales are soaring. The company reported its strongest month ever in April. And its growth and engagement trends have only improved since then.But that news flow still stop being so positive soon.The hysteria about Covid-19  is moderating. The physical economy is reopening. And as restaurants, shops and theaters reopen over the next few months, e-commerce growth and digital payment growth  will moderate. Consequently, PayPal's record-high growth rates will fall.Against that backdrop, the stock's valuation will be a problem, so PYPL stock could give back some of its gains. The Bottom Line on PayPal StockPayPal looks like a classic case of near-term pain, long-term gain.Over the next few months, I expect the stock to be choppy as investors worry about its valuation and as Covid-19-related e-commerce tailwinds ease. The dust from that choppiness will settle within a few months. Once it does, the stock will consolidate, bottom, and then power to new highs.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-06-26,"Crypto could take another step towards mainstream adoption if new reports from CoinDesk turn out to be true.On June 22, unconfirmed reports began making the rounds indicating PayPal (PYPL) will facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrency on its Venmo and PayPal platforms. With 325 million active accounts, the move – which could take place over the next three months – will position the company as a direct competitor of Square’s Cash App. Since launching Bitcoin trading in 2018, the Cash App has been a storming success.The move is not an unexpected one, claims Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kenneth Hill.“We are not surprised by the potential addition, and we believe a crypto offering will fit well with PYPL’s user base (particularly Venmo users). SQ’s Cash App monetization efforts serve as an effective blueprint of how to better monetize what had been a historically P2P user base. As the product evolves, we expect to see more substantial efforts made to extend product functionality to further engage and attract clients, in addition to adding services geared at monetizing those on the platform,” said the 5-star analyst.Although PayPal subsidiary Venmo boasts more users than its P2P competitor, with it estimated to have 50 million MAUs (monthly active users) vs. the Cash App’s roughly 30 million, Square has been able to better monetize its platform. Hill reckons Cash App’s average revenue per user (ARPU) is more than 3x that of Venmo’s, illustrating the potential of the new initiative.The addition of Bitcoin to the Cash App has resulted in increased engagement levels, and brought in more customers, a fact that is not lost on Hill.“We believe a crypto trading offering will drive higher levels of engagement among Venmo’s young user base and potentially lead to improved monetization over time,” the analyst concluded.Accordingly, Hill reiterated a Buy rating on PayPal, accompanied by a $163 price target. The figure, though, implies downside potential of 6% from current levels. (To watch Hill’s track record, click here)Based on 23 Buys and 7 Holds, PayPal has a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, as is increasingly common in the current bubbly market, PayPal has just notched an all-time high (while also up by 60% year-to-date), so targets have been left eating dust.

2020-07-02,"This is the most enthusiasm I've ever seen in stock markets. Not from the size of the rally, but rather because the indices are setting all-time highs in the face of the toughest economic conditions ever. We still have 20 million people unemployed, if not more. Yet Wall Street is blindly buying tech ETFs in droves. The equity markets have already recovered in a &quot;v&quot; and more. The government aide packages are hiding the deep wounds that still exist in our economy. Just this morning, Congress passed the extension of the Paycheck Protection Program.Much of the risk appetite is favoring high risk momentum stocks. These are companies whose products and services serve the new world order of digital delivery and subscription models. Some of the ones making new highs are Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and even the older gurus like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The Nasdaq recovered best out of the quarantine crash, and in fact it has already set all-time-highs this morning with no let-up in sight.The bulls are tag-teaming MVP's, so they sell one group to rotate into another. For a while they chase mega-cap tech like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Then on other days when they sell those, they roll their profits into frothier tickers like ZM and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI am usually optimistic about the stock markets, but I have serious worries these days. Last year, I wrote about buying every dip stemming from the China trade war headlines. This is different because the U.S. went from full employment last year to maximum unemployment this year. The economic reports may look fine, but the wound from the quarantine is bleeding internally. This is not evident while the government is spending trillions of dollars supporting the deficit. The election season will pass and the politicians will lose interest in quantitative easing programs.Caution is warranted while markets behave like it's 1999. Investors should fade this extreme exuberance in the Nasdaq using the following three exchange-traded funds. I feel a little guilty for my negative tone, but in my defense, I suggested going long on the April 21 dip. Back then, it served as the base for this incredible 25% rally in these tech ETFs:  * Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)  * VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH)  * Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK)I will start by sharing my order of preference on these bearish bets. Out of these three tech ETFs, the SMH seems the weakest because it has the most lower-highs in the last two weeks. Then the XLK because it has at least one recent failed breakout. Finally, only the QQQ is in open space and has no recent fails since it just made new highs. Tech ETFs to Trade: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)Source: Charts by TradingView The QQQ is the main Nasdaq ETF that traders most often use. It is heavily concentrated with the top dogs and they are the great American companies led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The top five make up almost half of the the entire basket. The call today is to fade the rally into the Fall season. Placing a bearish bet on the QQQ stock is simple when using options. Shorting the stock outright is too risky because it opens unlimited risk for as long as the rally continues.I realize that doing this now is going against the grain because it suggests fighting the Federal Reserve and the tape. Using options, investors can buy a long-term debit put spread to capture at least a 10% correction. This is a directional position that needs a drop to profit and time is its enemy. At the close of yesterday, traders could buy the December $242 / $232 debit put spread for $3 debit. This is the maximum potential loss per contract. To win, the QQQ has to fall ideally through both legs. The maximum upside potential is then $7 per contract. Those who have a bigger risk appetite can buy the $232 put naked for a cost of $12.80 per contract. In this runaway market that's a big ask.To lower or eliminate the entry cost, an alternative method is sell bear call spreads, which would leave room for error. The advantage here is that profits can come without a correction. All it needs to win is that the QQQ not rally more than 10% from here. For example, the December $280 / $285 credit call spread could pay $1.50 per contract. The advantage of this is that the price can rally and it can still win. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Source: Charts by TradingView The XLK is another popular tech ETF and it is also heavily weighted with Microsoft and Apple, which make up more than 40% of it. But the XLK is also heavily influenced by Fintech. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to name three make up almost 15% of it. This complicates matters a little bit for the bears because they would be shorting two different hot concepts. Wall Street is not only in love with tech, but they are almost even more enamored with Financial Tech. PYPL stock rallied 115% off the Covid-19 low and is now miles above its prior highs. This is a good illustration of my concern.I understand the concept of momentum trading very well, but I usually prefer chasing a specific breakout. In this case, the bids are system wide and investors are buying whatever regardless of thesis. Investing is not that easy and there will be pain for many. The first step is to avoid chasing into such froth, and placing a few bearish bets makes sense. Both concepts here are over extended, so they are vulnerable to hiccups.Again, here the easy method is to buy some downside scenarios in the put options out until the end of the year. Placing shorter-term bets could pay quicker but then time becomes a worse liability. The XLK stock is just as exposed as the QQQ, so it comes down to a matter of taste. I find it easier to manage my trade with the QQQ than this one.The XLK has support through $100 per share, but if they lose it, the bears could try to target another $5 drop. Once again, my call today is not one of doom and gloom, but it would be normal to retrace prices back to the May breakout levels without changing the overall bullish thesis. The bulls can retain control for as long as they maintain the higher-low trend. Meaning, I would buy the dips when they come. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)Source: Charts by TradingView Another concept that investors are loving this year are chip stocks and they are best represented by the SMH. This tech ETF is heavily weighted by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). These three account for almost 30% of the fund. I am a big fan of Intel and Nvidia stock and I wrote about buying every dip in them. Like the XLK, SMH's chart has support just below current levels and a pivot zone at $142 per share. The bulls will defend the zone vigorously because they are an emotional bunch over these stocks. To short the SMH from relative safety, buy the Nov $130 / $120 debit put spread for under $2 per contract. This is a reasonably priced opportunity to capitalize on a correction this Fall.As noted earlier, these ideas go against the grain when it comes to tech ETFs. In addition, the Nasdaq is going into a seasonally bullish period. Although, I don't usually trade hype like this, it is important to acknowledge that this is yet another reason why shorting this insane rally caries unusual risk. The methods discussed today use finite potential, so they are not reckless. There are dozens of other ways to approach tech ETFs today, but simple vertical put spreads are the easiest to explain and execute.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-07-02,"I've been recommending Square (NYSE:SQ) for this entire year. Admittedly, at first that call looked a bit shaky. The novel coronavirus pandemic sent stocks plunging -- and Square stock wasn't immune.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com The company's exposure to small businesses suggested significant risk if the broader economy went into a tailspin. At the lows, Square stock incredibly traded near $30.Of course, the market has rallied since then. Fears of a recession and record-high unemployment are moderating. Another record jobs report no doubt helps.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare stock has been one of the biggest winners in the bounce since March. It has now gained over 250% from its lows. And with the parabolic gains of late, I can see why some investors might be looking to take money off the table.I'm not one of those investors. To me, the story behind Square is just getting started. And the fact that Wall Street, which is often late to these kind of growth stories, is coming around is one more piece of evidence to support that conclusion. Wall Street Gets Behind Square StockOn the whole, analysts aren't bullish on Square. In fact, they're bearish. The average price target for the stock is just $80.But that's starting to change. Just in the last week, two analysts have upgraded Square stock and raised their price targets.KeyBanc led on June 29. Analyst Josh Beck moved his target to $125, the highest on the Street. Two days later, Rosenblatt's Kenneth Hill followed. He estimated that the stock could get to $121 over the next twelve months.These are not going to be the only two upgrades. More are coming. Wall Street firms have their use, but they notoriously tend to exhibit herd behavior. Only the most stubborn analysts will be comfortable with an $80 or even $90 price target on a stock trading at $115.  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends This cycle has played out in recent years so many times with high-flying, high-moving stocks. We've seen it with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). We've seen it with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).The market outpaces the Street. The Street catches up, and then the market prices in the new, higher targets. It's a cycle that suggests that the gains in Square stock could, and probably should, continue. An Investment, Not a TradeBut that's a trading argument, not an investing one. What's helpful, however, is that both upgrades highlight a growing understanding of the long-term bull case.Rosenblatt, for instance, focused on Square's Cash App. Even excluding bitcoin, the firm sees Cash App revenue more than tripling over the next five years.Cash App is a huge driver for Square stock, as I wrote in May. It's clearly taking share from rival Venmo of Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL).The coronavirus only accelerated Cash App adoption. That's a big reason why Square stock has rallied. Investors first started focusing on &quot;pandemic plays&quot; like Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), and then began to look for companies whose tailwinds were less obvious. Square is one of those companies.KeyBanc, too, called out Cash App strength. But that firm also made the broader case. Digital finance overall will be &quot;one of the purest beneficiaries of our digital acceleration thesis.&quot;The world is going to change faster than it would have otherwise because of the current pandemic. Companies like Square are going to benefit.That's why Square's stock has rallied 85% so far this year despite pressures on small business customers. And that's why the rally can continue. Look AroundThe natural inclination is to take profits in a stock that's rallied like Square has. For those investors on the sideline, the hope is always to catch &quot;the next dip.&quot;I wouldn't begrudge any shareholder who sold some of her stake. Nor would I question an investor who was hoping for the &quot;next dip.&quot;But I'd point to the history of this market in recent years, and in the last three months. Quality companies just don't go on sale very often. The March dip, as I argued strenuously at the time, was an enormous opportunity. There's no guarantee another such opportunity is coming any time soon.That dip aside, winners generally have kept winning. Investors on the sidelines waiting for a better entry point generally have stayed on the sidelines -- and missed out on upside.That pattern might not repeat this time around. Square stock certainly isn't cheap. But quality companies with a massive long-term opportunity aren't going to be cheap very often. And as the rally in Square shows, when they are, it usually doesn't last for long.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-07-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. said it filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for a public stock listing, taking a major step toward a market debut that has been many years in the making.The secretive Silicon Valley company, which sells data analysis software used by governments and large companies worldwide, is seeking to go public by the fall, Bloomberg previously reported, though the timing could change.Palantir has been weighing a direct listing of its shares on an exchange against an initial public offering, people with knowledge of the deliberations have said.The company said in a statement Monday that it had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a “public listing” of its stock, wording that has been used by other companies planning to pursue a direct listing. Such announcements typically specify a company is planning an IPO when that is the case. Palantir may still decide to pursue a traditional IPO to raise capital for the business.Palantir is in the process of raising $961 million, $550 million of which it has already secured, according to a filing earlier this month with the SEC. That includes a $500 million investment from Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. and $50 million from Fujitsu Ltd.Those sums make listing the stock directly a more accessible path for Palantir, following in the footsteps of Spotify Technology SA and Slack Technologies Inc.A direct listing wouldn’t let Palantir raise money by issuing new shares, but it would allow it to bypass an investor roadshow and other formalities of an IPO, while letting current stockholders sell their shares at the opening bell rather than waiting until the end of a lock-up period.Billionaire Peter Thiel founded Palantir in 2003 with a group of business partners including Alex Karp, the chief executive officer. In 2015, Palantir reached a valuation of $20 billion, though in recent years stockholders have sold blocks of shares for much less. It isn’t clear what valuation the company would seek in going public.Breaking EvenThe company told investors this year that it expects to break even in 2020 on revenue of about $1 billion.In June, Palantir added three directors including the first woman to serve on its board, former Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Wolfe Schiff.Dozens of law enforcement and government agencies around the world use Palantir to compile and search for data on citizens with the intent of combating crime, hunting terrorists and in recent months, tracking the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic has boosted business as companies use its products to help determine how to reopen.However, Palantir is highly controversial for the way its tools have been used to compromise privacy and enable surveillance. Its use by police and immigration officials, in particular, has sparked numerous protests.Valuation ConcernThe Palo Alto, California-based company had long resisted a public offering to avoid getting valued as a consultancy, and to stay out of the public eye as it worked toward profitability, people familiar with the matter have said.Its dependence on engineers customizing software for each client and bloated cost structure also resulted in consistent annual losses. That heightened the possibility that it wouldn’t be valued as a software company despite its Silicon Valley credentials.That changed last year, with customers using a new more automated product that has put Palantir on the path toward profitability.Palantir’s funders include Founders Fund, the venture capital firm started by Thiel. Other investors include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock Inc. and Tiger Global Management.Thiel, a co-founder of Pay PayPal Holdings Inc., has helped launch or advance Silicon Valley firms including Facebook Inc., where he has been a board member since 2004. Through Founders Fund and other investments, his influence has been extended to an array of technology companies. Thiel has also served as an adviser to President Donald Trump, chastising other technology companies, in particular Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for their reluctance to work with the Defense Department.(Updates with statement details in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Palantir Moves Toward Stock Listing With Confidential Filing

2020-07-13,"Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares were trading higher on Monday after a BofA Securities analyst predicted the payment company will deliver a &quot;big beat&quot; in the second quarter. The PayPalAnalyst: Jason Kupferberg reiterated a Buy rating on PayPal with a price target lifted from $194 to $215.  Previewing PayPal's Q2: PayPal is set to deliver a big second-quarter beat given that the massive growth in e-commerce is likely to drive significant upside potential to total payment volumes, Kupferberg said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.)Consumer spending behaviors have shifted online during the coronavirus pandemic, he said. Aggregated credit and debit card data shows that U.S. e-commerce spending excluding travel remained robust in June, growing 78% year-over-year versus 86% in May, Kupferberg said. Total second-quarter e-commerce spending rose 79% year-over-year, and this is by far the highest quarterly growth rate in BofA's dataset going back to 2011, the analyst said, adding that it represents a huge acceleration from 18.5% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Why PayPal Remains Strong: The stock has been strong, with shares more than doubling since its March lows verus a 42% rise in the S&P 500, Kupferberg said. &quot;Going into the second-quarter print, there is the possibility that certain metrics don't have quite as much upside as some expect, which could potentially result in some profit taking.&quot; The analyst said he expects any weakness in shares to be limited and short-lived, adding that PayPal's shareholder base has grown sturdier in recent months.The company is the best e-commerce pure play and will continue to take share from the larger in-store market, he said. &quot;We believe PYPL represents a differentiated investment opportunity, as a $120 billion market cap company with upper-teens organic revenue growth, structural industry tailwinds, solid and improving margin profile, and balance sheet optionality.&quot;  PYPL Price Action: PayPal shares were trading 0.35% higher at $179.02 at the time of publication Monday.

2020-07-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus stock market, like Covid-19 itself, is something never experienced before. Get used to it.Since March, when the global pandemic became an American catastrophe, the U.S. economy has been a shadow of its 2019 self. Yet some of the most-followed measures of equity set records while an explosion in infections showed no sign of peaking and the 14.7% unemployment rate in April was the worst since the Great Depression. The seeming contradiction of simultaneous exuberance and disaster reflects a durable change in the way investors look at U.S. companies even as wishful politicians yearn to return to an old normal.The market’s best performers are champions of remotely engaged commerce quite different from most of the companies comprising the favorite benchmarks, which lag by comparison. There’s nothing surprising about the five biggest contributors to the stock market’s resilience this year because they happen to have the greatest weighting in the Bloomberg U.S. Large-Cap Price Return Index, and their products and services facilitate online communication and transactions: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Another smattering of high-profile U.S. companies such as Zoom Video Communications Inc., Netflix Inc., Roku Inc. and Twitter Inc. have also had rising stock prices during the pandemic because of the popularity of the services they offer to people working and playing at home.But the top 10 winners among the largest 500 U.S. companies during the second quarter increasingly are setting the course as a new breed of stay-at-home stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York City-based Datadog Inc., up 142%, provides tools for monitoring infrastructure, application performance and log management for cloud computing firms and music-streaming companies. San Francisco-based cloud-computing powerhouse Twilio Inc. is up 145%. Stockholm's Spotify is up 113%.San Francisco-based Square Inc., up 100%, and San Jose-based PayPal, up 82%, provide digital and mobile payment services, enhancing online payments. DocuSign Inc., up 86%, provides electronic signature solutions, reducing the need for in-person contract signing meetings. Santa Monica-based Snap Inc., up 98%, provides social media services, enabling communication throughout the Internet. Every one of these companies can be a customer of Sunnyvale, California-based CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., up 80%, which provides cybersecurity platforms to protect against attacks.Palo Alto, California-based Tesla Inc. appreciated 106% in the second quarter and became the largest automaker earlier this month with a market capitalization of $278 billion. Climate change and Covid-19 paved the way for this avatar of the technology-driven economy, characterized by remote engagement and artificial intelligence. With its battery-powered, zero-emission vehicles,Tesla is the undisputed leader in online sales, touchless delivery and perpetually downloaded vehicle enhancements.Shares of the 500 largest U.S. companies measured by market capitalization gained 44% between late March and mid-June after declining 24% when the pandemic first struck. Although the market remains higher than at almost any point prior to 2020, the S&P 500 rally this year is unlike any preceding it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since March, fewer than 10 of the biggest companies hit their 52-week high on a daily basis. The figure was 31 in 2019, 27 in 2018, 40 in 2017, 24 in 2016 and 21 in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only way the S&P 500 could advance with so much disappointment throughout corporate America is with a small group of exceptional companies led by Tesla.During the two years prior to 2020, when the U.S. expansion became the longest on record, the stock market’s top 10 performers included medical equipment designer DexCom Inc., apparel store Lululemon Athletica Inc. and restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Such diversity was similar during the past decade when biotechnology, industrial, energy, restaurant and medical equipment providers also led the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Ordinary investors, many of whom own exchange-traded funds, will continue to benefit from their familiar and substantial holdings of Tesla and the five tech giants. As ETFs increase their investment in the stay-at-home group of firms, the seemingly narrow rally will become broader.The American stock market in the second quarter also bore no resemblance to its counterparts around the world, especially among the developed countries in Asia and Europe that have had more success containing Covid-19. As a result, the best-performing companies in the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index reflect the expectation that a return to business as usual is coming soon, and they include health-care suppliers, tourism, shipbuilding, technology and bicycle manufacturing. Similarly, the top 10 stocks in Europe include insurance firms, industrial companies and jewelry stores in addition to technology.For the first time, the U.S. stock market has gone its own way, led by investors who believe the coronavirus is here to stay.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",A Stay-at-Home Stock Market Kept Investors Afloat

2020-07-20,"Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) is reportedly partnering with New York-based cryptocurrency broker Paxos to let users on its platform purchase or sell virtual assets, according to CoinDesk.What Happened Paxos offers an API that makes it easier to sell, purchase, hold, and send cryptocurrencies, CoinDesk noted. The broker is also purportedly permitted to hold digital assets on behalf of institutional investors.Last week, it was reported that PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo, a mobile payment service, plan to launch direct sales of cryptocurrency to their user bases. The Palo Alto-based company later confirmed the move.London-based Revolut, a fintech startup with more than 120,000 customers, launched cryptocurrency trading in 49 U.S. states in partnership with Paxos last week, Mashable reported.Why It Matters There is no clarity yet on what cryptocurrencies the payments company plans to offer on its platform. The fintech firm would be joining Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and Robinhood among the mainstream platforms to be involved with virtual assets.PayPal previously exited Facebook Inc.-led (NASDAQ: FB) Libra cryptocurrency project in 2019, as it faced increased regulatory scrutiny.The company's Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said late last year that virtual assets are too volatile, and there's little demand for them on PayPal's platforms.&quot;On the [cryptocurrency] side, it's still very volatile, and therefore, we don't have much demand for it by merchants because merchants operate on very small margins,&quot; he said.Price Action PayPal shares closed about 2.4% higher at $173.92 on Friday.See more from Benzinga  * Cisco Consolidates Cloud Software Foray, Acquires ThousandEyes For Nearly B(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-22,"The ongoing digital acceleration has prompted an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets to adopt a positive stance on e-commerce and e-commerce-enabling companies such as Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP), Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Wix.Com Ltd (NASDAQ: WIX).The E-Commerce Ratings:  Josh Beck maintained Overweight ratings on Shopify, Paypal and Wix.com.The analyst upped the price target for Shopify from $1,000 to $1,125.Beck hiked the price target for PayPal from $190 to $200.The analyst also increased the price target for Wix.com from $275 to $325.The E-Commerce Thesis:  The momentum of digital acceleration is holding up, with sustained above-average growth in June, Beck said in a Tuesday note. (See his track record  here.)The June data, though suggesting a deceleration in year-over-year growth, is far above historical levels and investor expectations, the analyst said. The analyst forecast a combination of near-term momentum and an acceleration of long-term initiatives due to increased awareness and adoption.See also:  KeyBanc Upgrades Wix On Digital Acceleration Tailwinds Shopify Sees Volume Gains:  Shopify's  volumes continue to benefit from retailers and merchants racing to launch online initiatives in the wake of brick-and-mortar shutdowns and favorable relative exposure, Beck said.Factoring in gross merchandise volume growth in the mid-30s for 2021 and given the ongoing benefit from near-term merchant gains, the analyst raised his estimates for the company.Analyst Says PayPal 'Marquee' Payments Stock:  KeyBanc is upwardly adjusting estimates for PayPal, factoring in low-20s total payment volume growth and sustained user and merchant gains for 2021.&quot;We believe PYPL should be a marquee payments weighting and a premium to peers is warranted due to a further elevated strategic position enabling the future of commerce,&quot; Beck said. Wix's Potential For Structural Growth Improvement:  The analyst said he expects slightly better average revenue per user trends for Wix.com in 2021, resulting in mid-20s-plus revenue growth.KeyBanc's model does not include an incremental benefit from the official Editor X launch targeted toward pros and agencies, or the Wix e-commerce launch that bundles omni-channel commerce, payments, fulfillment and marketing capabilities, he said. Beck raised his Wix estimates and price target due to the potential for structural growth improvement, as well as increased initiative consideration.The E-Commerce Price Action: Shopify shares were down 1.16% at $940.51 at last check Wednesday. PayPal shares were moving up 0.55% to $176.54. Wix.com shares were down 0.7% at $273.77.

2020-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Google unveiled a major initiative to woo Amazon.com Inc. merchants on Thursday, part of a broader quest to be the main place people go when they want to buy something online. The search giant said it will eliminate the fees it charges retailers to let people buy directly through the Google Shopping service. It’s the latest in a series of moves the company has made to make it easier and cheaper for retailers to get products in front of millions of people who use Google’s search engine every day.Google is the world’s dominant search engine, but almost half of Americans start looking for things to buy on Amazon, while only 22% start on Google, according to a survey last year from research firm CivicScience.Google Shopping has been around for years, but until recently retailers had to buy ads to list their products, and if people bought directly on Google the seller was on the hook for commissions of as much as 12% of the transaction. The company is nixing both these barriers, and has also started showing free product listings directly in the main search results.In terms of functioning as a online marketplace, Google is nowhere near Amazon. Google Shopping had about 3,700 stores and other merchants at the end of 2019, compared with 3 million active sellers on Amazon, according to e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. Without these merchants, Google won’t have enough product listings to be a leading e-commerce destination.Google’s new shopping push coincides with rising complaints from some small businesses that Amazon is squeezing them for more fees. As much as 40% of every dollar in sales generated by third-party merchants on Amazon goes to the e-commerce giant. That includes warehouse storage fees and ads that push their products higher in product search results.The Alphabet Inc. unit is rushing the changes to market to make them available for the massive wave of small businesses forced to sell online by Covid-19 lockdowns, said Google Commerce President Bill Ready. Searchers who want to support local or small businesses can add filters to find these types of merchants, he added.Google said on Tuesday that merchants can upload their products to its shopping site in the same format Amazon requires, making it easier to list on both marketplaces.Ready wouldn’t comment on competing with Amazon, but said Google’s vision is to make it as easy and affordable as possible for businesses to sell online. The company also announced integrations with Shopify Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. to help merchants manage their inventory and sell directly on Google. More integrations are coming, Ready said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Is Coming After Amazon’s Marketplace Merchants

2020-07-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The world’s largest fintech unicorns are preparing for their debutante balls. Billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group is seeking a valuation north of $200 billion in a landmark dual public listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Lufax, backed by Ping An Insurance Group Co., is going one step further, braving the U.S. Senate’s new Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and targeting to raise at least $3 billion in New York.Billion-dollar initial public offerings are encouraging news for market sentiment. But we can’t help but wonder: Is this really a good time to celebrate their success, when tension between the U.S. and China is escalating into a war for capital?At first glance, the timing couldn’t be better. China’s regulatory environment has become friendlier as Beijing, pinched by the coronavirus, loosens its purse strings. Meanwhile, stock markets are rewarding tech companies that consumers use every day. California-based PayPal Holdings Inc., for instance, has soared about 60% this year. In China, Ant Group’s ubiquitous mobile payment product, AliPay, fits the bill. Paper money is dirty in the Covid-19 era and no one wants to handle cash.But by listing this year, Ant and Lufax run the risk of exposing how volatile and unsteady China’s financial regulations can be, potentially adding fuel to speculation that the nation’s Lehman moment is drawing nearer. Beijing first vowed to clamp down on private-sector debt in late 2017, with the People’s Bank of China pointing fingers at rising risks in asset management and internet finance. It followed with far-reaching rules for the financial industry in April 2018.Since then, regulators have blown hot and cold on practices in the online lending industry, leading to significant uncertainty for loaning out money and the availability of consumer credit. Going public in 2020 means that Ant and Lufax will have to explain what happened to their business models in 2018 and 2019.Both behemoths took a hit. For most of 2017, consumer micro lending was a lucrative business for Ant, accounting for almost 20% of the group’s income, Bernstein Research estimated. But that cash cow’s milk turned sour that December, when Beijing suspended all unsecured online cash loans. Ant could no longer offer asset-backed securities exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Issuing such bonds had been a capital-efficient way for Ant to pass its loan books on to funds.The change was painful. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which has a one-third equity stake, received a payment of 193 million yuan ($27.6 million) from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the three months ending in September. Lufax, China’s largest peer-to-peer lender, also saw seismic changes. Until late 2017, the country’s online financing business was driven by P2P, with total outstanding loans peaking at 1.1 trillion yuan. Regulatory tightening practically killed this model. Nowadays, facilitation — essentially matchmaking — is the norm, with banks accounting for about 45% of online consumption loans, according to CLSA Ltd. estimates. Last July, Lufax substantially scaled back its core P2P business.These IPOs will expose the true state of millions of consumer balance sheets. Thanks in part to the rise of companies like Ant and Lufax, Chinese are no longer debt-free. At the end of last year, household debt totaled more than 60 trillion yuan, or 62% of gross domestic product. Their ability to repay is worsening. Data from the central bank show that while consumption loans drawn from financial institutions rose over 13% in June from a year earlier, disposable incomes are shrinking, unemployment is rising, and the cash flows of borrowers are looking smaller.Investors may find that the picture wasn’t all rosy, even before Covid-19. For instance, Qudian Inc., a smaller lender, noted that its D1 delinquency rate, a real-time representation of its portfolio asset quality, rose to 13% at the end of last year from 10% in the previous three months. Sure, financial distress at Qudian’s customers might appear minor in the bigger picture, but it could seem much less idiosyncratic when public offerings reveal such details from Ant and Lufax. They respectively account for 32% and 13% of online lending, according to CLSA. It’s not clear why Beijing would want to let these two cats out of the bag. The coronavirus will muddy the waters further, especially for those seeking to borrow online. Asset-backed securities sponsored by banks did better than those by finance companies, potentially reflecting the less-prime nature of the latter’s customers. A significant increase in delinquencies may leave online lenders short of capital. There will be lasting pain.Six-year-old Ant was once known as the firm that threatened the stranglehold of China’s giant banks. One of its main offerings has been the systemically important money-market fund, Yu’e Bao, which has more than 600 million Chinese investors. Lufax had 44 million customers on its platform at the end of 2019, with 347 billion yuan of their assets under management. Its loan book stood at 462 billion yuan, up 23.3% from a year earlier. If the two firms had waited a few more years, they wouldn’t have to explain the awkward period of 2018 and 2019. By allowing early investors and company insiders to cash out now, Ant and Lufax will lay bare the ugly side of China’s financial industry. Foreigners will be sifting through the prospectus of each offering, wondering what China’s subprime consumers look like in the Covid-19 era – and for years to come.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-07-29,"On Wednesday, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) saw unusual options activity. After the option activity alert, the stock price moved up to $182.04.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $150.00  * Volume: 1371  * Open Interest: 16853 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual option activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another gauge of unusual option activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual option activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish option activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 29, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-29,"Earnings season is in full swing, and investors are waiting – eagerly – for the results. So far, the first 26% of companies to report results have showed a 4 to 1 split in favor of positive earnings surprises, beating the forecasts. It’s a good result, but only partially a result of good performance. The bar was set low for Q2, especially after Q1’s grim results. 1H20, encompassing the coronavirus crisis and the associated economic shutdowns, saw GDP contract dramatically, and earnings and revenues – in absolute numbers – have reflected that.One measure of the damage that coronavirus did is the aggregate decline in earnings year-over-year. Looking at S&P 500 companies, that figure is 42%. If the trend holds, it will make Q2 2020 the worst since the 69% decline in Q4 2008.But not every company is putting lipstick on a pig. Three Big Techs are reporting this evening, and early analyst reports have set a mood of guarded optimism. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the details. Here is what to expect.Facebook, Inc. (FB)A range of notable names are lined up to report results this evening. One worth watching is social media giant Facebook. The stakes are high for the company, as its stock has been soaring nearly 60% since March’s novel coronavirus selloff. But it didn't come easily. The company faced serious inquiry into the platform’s practices regarding hate speech – which brings us back to questions of corporate censorship which always seem to dog the company – and potentially hundreds of advertisers are threatening to boycott the company. This comes just as Mr. Zuckerberg is being summoned before Congress again.On a positive note, Facebook saw gains in both Monthly Average Users and Average Revenue per User, two key metrics in measuring a social platform’s performance. The social lockdowns of the first half of the year kept people at home – and many turned to Facebook for solace and connection. The result was greater traffic, and more ad clicks.And that has Wall Street expecting year-over-year gains for the social media giant. Revenues are expected to grow 3%, to $16.9 billion, while EPS is expected at $1.39, up an impressive 53% from last year. 5-star analyst Lloyd Walmsley, of Deutsche Bank, takes a favorable view of Facebook’s near- and mid-term prospects. He writes, “Attention around FB has primarily been related to the social unrest in June and boycott in July and how it may impact 2Q results as well as the outlook / tone on the Facebook call. We trim our estimates but still remain above-consensus for Facebook and view the shares favorably positioned for the second half.”Regarding advertiser boycotts, Walmsley believes that these will more likely than not turn out to be a blip: “While we do recognize that certain national brand advertisers are staying off FB with medium- or longer-term intentions, we have heard in checks that advertisers heavily dependent on FB to reach certain demographics, seem to have no choice but to continue their ad spend on the platform.”In line with these comments, Walmsley rates FB shares a Buy, with a $275 price target representing a 18% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Walmsley’s track record, click here)The conventional wisdom agrees that Facebook shares are Buying proposition. FB has an analyst consensus rating of Strong Buy, based on 30 Buys against just 4 Holds. The stock is selling for $231.55, and the average price target, $259.40, suggests an upside potential of 12% from that level. (See Facebook stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)Next on our list, PayPal, had an obvious path to succeed during the corona crisis: when life moved online during the shutdown policies, the major online payment processor saw business boom. PYPL shares rose steeply during the pandemic period, in sharp contrast to the general market turndown, and outperformed the market by a wide margin. PYPL is up an impressive 42% since the February/March market crash, compared to the S&P 500 which is down a net of 4.9% over the same time frame.During the first quarter, which saw the strongest shut-down measures and greatest fears regarding the pandemic, PayPal did see earnings contract. EPS fell from Q4’s 67 cents per share to 44 cents. But the Q2 forecast is looking better; analyst estimates predict a rise back to 61 cents per share. At the top line, the expected revenue of $4.99 billion should represent 16% growth year-over-year. The big metric, however, will be in the total payment volume, a key measure of the company’s business performance: analysts expect it to reach $210 billion, up 10% from Q1, and 22% year-over-year.Writing for Piper Sandler, 4-star analyst Christopher Donat initiates coverage of PYPL shares with an unequivocal bullish tone: “We view PayPal as one of the best-positioned companies to take advantage of changes in consumer purchasing behavior due to the pandemic. We would encourage investors to build or add to positions in PYPL, especially in any future pandemic-related market pullbacks. We expect PayPal to be one of the better revenue growth stories in the payments sector in coming quarters.”Donat’s rating, of course, is a Buy, and his $210 price target implies a one-year upside of 15%. (To watch Donat’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on PayPal is based on 33 reviews, including 27 Buys and 6 Holds. The shares have appreciated recently, and the $181.80 trading price is pushing up to the average target of $184.14. (See PayPal’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)Last on our list today is Qorvo, a semiconductor chip maker with a solid reputation for quality integrated circuits in the networking communications niche. The company’s products are used in PCs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets to enable wireless connections, and are also found in older hardware such as cordless phones and industrial radios.The essential nature of Qorvo’s niche has insulated the company, and shares recovered from the market crash well. QRVO is currently trading back at levels seen in early February. And, despite a sequential drop in EPS for Q1, Qorvo reported an earnings beat in the last quarter; the EPS of $1.46 beat the forecast by 24%. The calendar first quarter typically has Qorvo’s lowest EPS of the year, so it’s important to note that Q1 2020 showed a 28% gain year-over-year.Looking ahead to tonight’s calendar Q2 release, analysts are less sanguine. The company faces headwinds from a series of bottlenecks related to the pandemic: manufacturing slowdowns, supply and distribution chain disruptions, and lower sales. EPS is expected to come in at 96 cents. On a positive note, the company is well positioned to benefit from the shift to wifi 6 for IoT apps, and the shift to 5G which will require new modem chips.Rajvindra Gill, from Needham, sees those last positives as overbalancing the headwinds in the long term. He writes, “We view QRVO as a major beneficiary of the expected upgrade cycle at Apple and Samsung with 5G phones. Although we expect QRVO's RF content to remain relatively flat at Apple, it is benefiting from higher builds, plus QRVO has multiple 5G engagements at four of the largest Chinese OEMs. Moreover, we expect QRVO's margin profile to benefit from a higher mix of IDP sales, which include 5G infrastructure and IoT.”Gill’s upbeat stance and Buy rating are backed by a $160 price target, indicating a robust upside potential of 41% in the year ahead. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here.)Qorvo has 13 Buys and 4 Holds behind its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The stock’s $124.47 average price target suggests an upside potential of nearly 8% from the trading price of $115.37.

2020-07-29,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. climbed after executives said a surge in digital payments on its platform in the second quarter marks an accelerating and permanent shift away from cash in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The technology giant, which has been signing up consumers spooked by the virus, said Wednesday it now expects revenue to climb 25% this quarter while payments volume surges 30%. It sees full-year revenue climbing 22%.“This is our time,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman told analysts on a conference call. “We intend to seize the moment.”Lockdowns to prevent viral infections, and the ensuing shift to online commerce, spurred people to learn how to make digital payments. That helped boost the number of net new active accounts to 21.3 million. The company said it now expects to add 70 million active accounts in the latter half of the year.“The big competition for e-commerce was cash, and there was inertia around moving to online and people not being familiar with it,” Schulman said in an interview. “Now that they’ve experienced it -- and people don’t want to handle cash anymore -- there’s been an explosion of digital payments.”Total payment volume jumped 30% to $222 billion in the second quarter, topping the $208 billion average of analyst estimates and helping the company notch record revenue. Throughout the quarter, the company consistently saw the type of spending it usually only sees in the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, Schulman said.PayPal shares rose more than 5% at 6:44 p.m. in extended New York trading after hitting a record high earlier in the day. The stock has climbed 71% this year, compared with the 17% advance of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Payments volume on Venmo -- the firm’s digital wallet that became popular among millennials for splitting restaurant bills or the cost of vacation rentals -- jumped 52% to $37 billion. With the pandemic stifling social interactions, users turned to the wallet to pay for online fitness classes or other forms of digital entertainment, executives said Wednesday.The firm added about three times as many merchants to its platform than during a typical second quarter, which gave it confidence that consumers’ widespread adoption of e-commerce is more permanent than originally thought.“What at first felt like a potentially short-lived phenomenon resulting from initial panic and pantry packing and even stimulus checks has become a much more durable and profound behavioral shift,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said during the conference call.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Volume Surges With Consumers Flocking to Online Shopping

2020-07-30,"Payments company Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported Wednesday afternoon with second-quarter results highlighted by an EPS, revenue and total payment volume beat.Here's how PayPal analysts are reacting to the company's results and outlook.  The PayPal Analysts: Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri maintains an Outperform rating on PayPal's stock with a price target lifted from $200 to $220.BofA Securities Jason Kupferberg maintains a Buy rating on PayPal's stock with a price target lifted from $215 to $235.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kenneth Hill maintains a Buy rating on PayPal's stock with a price target lifted from $196 to $204.Raymond James analyst John Davis maintains an Outperform rating on PayPal's stock with a price target lifted from $171 to $218.Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly maintains an Outperform rating on PayPal's stock with a price target lifted from $140 to $230.Wedbush On PayPal's 'Monster' Quarter: PayPal reported a &quot;monster&quot; quarter that marks the early stages of success in new monetization initiatives, Katri said in a note.Revenue of $5.26 billion beat estimates of $5 billion; EPS of $1.07 beat estimates of 87 cents; and the non-GAAP EBIT margin of 28.2% was up 500 basis points.TPV showed a 30% growth rate on a constant currency basis, while active accounts grew 21% from last year to 346 million, including 26 million merchants, the analyst said.Venmo TPV was up 52% from last year to $37 billion, while its active base rose by 60 million users, according to Wedbush.

Encouragingly, the momentum could continue, as the COVID-19 pandemic merely accelerated the penetration of e-commerce spending by several years, in the analyst's view. &quot;We remain bullish, given PYPL's significant scarcity value and structural benefits from the pandemic.&quot;Rosenblatt On PayPal's In-Store Update PayPal signaled a &quot;sharper focus&quot; on investments related to in-store capabilities, Hill said in a note.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated PayPal's efforts across multiple initiatives, including point-of-sale, in-store, buy online, pick up in-store, order ahead, pay at table and home delivery, the analyst said. PayPal is also heavily investing in QR code technologies, and the company is looking to introduce an integrated POS QR feature in the U.S. and Europe this quarter, he said. Most notably, PayPal or its Venmo QR codes will be featured at 8,200 CVS retailers across the U.S., according to Rosenblatt. Raymond James Says PayPal's Guidance 'Even Better'PayPal's second-quarter print was impressive, and its guidance was &quot;even better,&quot; Davis said in a note.PayPal reinstated its 2020 guidance above what the buy-side community expected, and this suggests its recent momentum can be sustained, the analyst said. PayPal's third-quarter and bottom-half 2020 guidance calls for FX-adjusted revenue growth to remain elevated at a conservative estimate of 25%, he said. Oppenheimer Says PayPal's Premium Valuation Justified PayPal's report makes it clear the company is leveraging its large network to become the best-positioned payments company in the fast-growing space, Kelly said in a note.A premium valuation on the stock is justified, the analyst said. Oppenheimer's $230 price target is based on 40 times 2022 estimated EPS, representing a premium of five times to the three-year average.PYPL Price Action: Shares of PayPal hit a new all-time high Thursday morning at $198.64 and were seen trading higher by 4.41% to $192.75 at last check.

2020-07-30,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) posted a 69.2% decrease in earnings from Q1. Sales, however, increased by 13.92% over the previous quarter to $5.26 billion. Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest PayPal Holdings is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible. In Q1, PayPal Holdings hit $854.00 million in earnings, whereas sales totaled $4.62 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in PayPal Holdings's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, PayPal Holdings posted an ROCE of 0.02%.View more earnings on PYPLIt is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows PayPal Holdings is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For PayPal Holdings, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings PayPal Holdings reported Q2 earnings per share at $1.07/share against analyst predictions of $0.86/share.See more from Benzinga  * PayPal Holdings: Q2 Earnings Insights  * Understanding PayPal Holdings's Unusual Options Activity  * Earnings Scheduled For July 29, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-31,"Don't look now but Square (NYSE:SQ) is closing in on an all-time high. Considering SQ stock traded as low as $32.33 during the mid-March correction, the 280% recovery from its March lows is something to behold.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com If you were one of the brave souls to buy in the low $30s, I would commend you for your nerves of steel. You've been amply rewarded for your conviction bet.The question is whether those late to the Square party still have an opportunity to benefit from one of the great fintechs operating today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Cybersecurity Stocks Hard At Work While We Work From Home Is it too late to buy Square stock? I don't think so. Here's why. Cowen Analyst Right About SQ StockBack in mid-March, amid the bloodbath, Cowen analyst George Mihalos upgraded Square to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;market perform,&quot; stating, &quot;[Right now is] the most compelling entry point in the stock in over three years,&quot; Mihalos said July 17.Mihalos believed that things would get worse before they got better, arguing that a slowdown in U.S. discretionary spending due to the novel coronavirus would hurt Square's revenue by 8% to 12% and its adjusted EBITDA by 40% to 60%.However, despite the near-term headwinds, the analyst thought Square's revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 would be approximately 25% while also generating higher margins and more money to the bottom line.For these reasons, despite cutting his 12-month target price by $12 to $70, he felt there was still plenty of upside.Well, in hindsight, we know there was 280% upside. It's Come a Long WayIn April, I suggested that investors interested in buying Square, consider waiting until it fell into the $50s. It was in the low $60s at the time.&quot;While I get Davis' argument, I remain a Square booster. Over the next 2-3 months, I could see SQ stock falling below $50 for a stretch, providing interested investors with a better entry point. If you're holding for the long-term (2-3 years), anywhere in the $50s should work out just fine,&quot; I wrote on April 20.Talk about cutting too fine a line. Over the next three months, Square stock more than doubled in price. Market timing cuts both ways. If you're holding for two to three years, the difference in unrealized gains by buying at $59 rather than $61 will be minuscule.Sometimes, we media pundits get a little too cute. This was probably one of those times.On May 12, I recommended that buyers of Square stock in mid-March consider taking profits off the table. At the time, the stock had more than doubled from its mid-March lows. Since then, it's gained an additional 64%.Like a Kentucky Derby-winning thoroughbred, sometimes you just have to let it run.However, when I see that the very same analyst who was bang-on about Square being undervalued, downgraded its stock July 9 to market perform from outperform because of its massive move since mid-March -- Mihalos did raise target price by $40 to $119 -- I wonder if the man is about to strike oil a second time.Mihalos believes that Square's Seller business will require several years of recovery due to Covid-19, which has severely affected small- and medium-sized companies, the company's bread and butter. As a result, he believes PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and other payments companies make more sense at the moment. It's Not Too Late to BuyIf you buy today at $129, where it's trading as I write this, and you hold for three to five years, I don't think there's any question you'll get a reasonable return on your investment.On the other hand, it probably doesn't hurt to wait for Square to report its second-quarter 2020 results on August 5, to get a better understanding of what Covid-19's meant to both its Sellers business as well as the entire company before jumping into a long-term financial commitment.As I said in May, long term, SQ stock is a strong buy. Nothing's happened to change my mind.As Warren Buffett says, &quot;Price is what you pay; Value is what you get.&quot;With Square, you get a lot of value.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-08-06,"Recent developments indicate major shifts may be ahead in the cryptocurrency market, with the importance of stablecoin growing, PayPal rumored to announce a partnership with Paxos to offer crypto trading, and Mastercard expanding its own cryptocurrency program. In an economy still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, replete with lockdowns, shifts to telecommuting and business closures, cryptocurrency trading is becoming an attractive alternative to many businesses and investors alike. With recent moves to introduce or expand crypto-based services by more established and commonly-used payment providers, a mainstream adoption of digital currencies may not be far off. Here is what you need to know about it. The Drift towards Stability on the Cryptocurrency Market: Stablecoins Recently, stability has increased as a factor of importance in the cryptocurrency market.After the massive value growth of cryptocurrencies throughout 2017 and the subsequent bursting of the bubble in early 2018, the market see-sawed until the beginning of 2020. Just when it seemed another growth spike was taking off, the pandemic stock market crash sent it tumbling again. Since April, crypto values have roughly returned to February levels.Throughout this period, one sector of the cryptocurrency market has outpaced the others in terms of growth - stablecoins. Unlike currencies whose value is volatile and driven by supply and demand, stablecoins are typically bound to a fiat currency, although some are pegged against other cryptocurrencies. Prominent examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), or Binance USD (BUSD), all equivalent to $1.Stablecoins have been on the rise, measured by market cap and transaction volume, since the 2018 crash. This indicates their buyers value both their innate crypto advantages and the much lower volatility of fiat currency. It also suggests the use of cryptocurrency as a vehicle for speculation is now giving way to actual use for transfers and longer-term holding.In the tailwind of the crisis, many of these stablecoins have been doing well. For example, immediately after the stock crash in March, Tether's daily transaction volume shot up from around $50 billion to nearly $100 billion. This spike was fueled by buyers converting both from USD and other cryptocurrencies, leading the currency issuers to make several billion new USDT available, for a total market cap now exceeding $10 billion. Now, as the volatile currencies are approaching pre-crisis values, USDT transaction volumes are sinking again.Breaking into the Cryptocurrency Market - PayPal partnering with Paxos Though official confirmation is still lacking, it has emerged that payment processor PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), with its mobile payments division Venmo, is now set on breaking into the cryptocurrency market. A letter from PayPal to the European Commission, leaked earlier this week, shows that the payment provider was working on crypto capabilities even before March.Now, it seems, the process is coming to fruition, with an announcement by PayPal expected as early as the end of this week.Reportedly, it has picked the Paxos Trust Company, a regulated financial institution that digitizes and mobilizes assets, as its partner in offering the service, over principal rival Coinbase.Less than a week ago, Paxos introduced Paxos Crypto Brokerage, a new API-based solution that allows companies to integrate cryptocurrency buying, selling, holding, and sending capabilities into their own applications. Paxos takes care of the underlying regulatory and technological complexity.Paxos had previously struck up partnerships with fintech leaders such as Square (NYSE: SQ), Robinhood, and Revolut. Some of these have been highly profitable, with Square reporting its first-quarter revenue from Bitcoin-based services at $528 million, surpassing its mainstream financial services. A PayPal partnership is a step up for both Paxos and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. With over 300 million users globally, PayPal is among the largest payment facilitators - and now set to become a key gateway into the cryptocurrency market for millions of its clients.Bringing Cryptocurrency to Everyday Life - Mastercard Delves Deeper into the Market Another push towards the mainstream is aided by Mastercard (NYSE: MA) recently announcing an expansion of its cryptocurrency partner program. A practical limitation for many cryptocurrencies, until recently, was that they're accepted by only a few brick-and-mortar businesses. From gas stations and supermarkets to hairdressers and pharmacies, cryptocurrency holders find themselves stymied when it comes to using their holdings to purchase services and products.Mastercard's announcement means that crypto-wallet providers can now issue secure, compliant, Mastercard-branded payment cards to their customers. Thus bringing cryptocurrency into everyday life.The initiative was launched as part of Mastercard's Accelerate program, with the London-based cryptocurrency platform Wirex as its first major partner.Technically, Mastercard does not enable clients to spend cryptocurrency directly with merchants. It converts cryptocurrency into fiat first, which is then used for transactions. This saves users from the effort and time needed to convert to fiat themselves for a given purchase. With the notorious short-term volatility of some cryptocurrencies, the automation of the conversion process is a welcome relief to many.Overall, this increase in fungibility marks a defining shift towards legitimacy in the still-nascent cryptocurrency market.&quot;The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today's digital economy,&quot; Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive vice president for digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships, said in a comment.Mastercard is in good company. In a pioneering effort, Coinbase launched its own card in 2019 - in partnership with Visa, Mastercard's principal competitor. The Drift towards Stability and the Mainstream Altogether, recent developments suggest an overall drift towards stability in the cryptocurrency market, as well as an accelerating movement towards opening it up to the mainstream. The wider implications of this shift in the cryptocurrency market remain to be observed. It seems clear that the increased proportion of stablecoins in the overall market is making other cryptocurrencies relatively less attractive. At the same time, that market is expanding rapidly, and one major use of stablecoin is easier trading of other cryptocurrencies.Other questions - such as whether PayPal users will widely adopt cryptocurrencies, or whether crypto owners will want to expend their holdings on everyday purchases with Mastercard's offer, rather than speculate or hold onto them as investments - remain open. Overall, the situation is summed up well by Simon Taylor, head of ventures at fintech consultancy firm 11:FS, in an interview with CNBC: &quot;This is less a watershed moment and more part of a broader, slow and steady legitimization of crypto as the global regulators increasingly put systems and controls in place.&quot;See more from Benzinga  * 10 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In America Since 2010  * Are Drivers Staying Out Of The Market To Collect Unemployment?

2020-08-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. unveiled a new group to pursue payments and commerce opportunities and put David Marcus, co-creator of its Libra cryptocurrency project, in charge of the initiative.Called F2 internally, short for Facebook Financial, the team will run all payments projects, including Facebook Pay, the company’s universal payments feature that it plans to build inside all of its apps.Marcus will continue running Novi, the division that is building a digital wallet to hold the Libra cryptocurrency. He will also be involved in WhatsApp’s payments efforts in countries like India and Brazil. Facebook has hired former Upwork Inc. Chief Executive Officer Stephane Kasriel to serve as a payments vice president under Marcus. Facebook shares slipped 1.5% to $264.26 on Monday, after hitting a record late last week.This is the latest step in a companywide effort to bring Facebook’s individual products and apps closer together. In the past two years, it re-branded Instagram and WhatsApp so people know they are owned by Facebook, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to integrate all the company’s messaging services.“We have a lot of commerce stuff going on across Facebook,” Marcus said. “It felt like it was the right thing to do to rationalize the strategy at a company level around all things payments.”The belief is that if users can make purchases on Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, then Facebook’s advertising will grow more valuable, and users will spend more time inside the company’s apps. On Facebook’s second-quarter earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said he was “quite excited” about commerce inside of messaging apps. “As payments grow across Messenger and WhatsApp, and as we’re able to roll that out in more places, I think that that will only grow as a trend,” he added.Read more: Facebook’s Zuckerberg Recommits to Commerce With ‘Shops’Marcus is a payments veteran, and a trusted executive inside the company. He joined Facebook in 2014 from his role as president of PayPal Holdings Inc., and ran Facebook Messenger for four years before taking on Libra.One priority will be getting payments running inside WhatsApp in India and Brazil. The company has invested heavily to make WhatsApp a destination for commerce in those markets, but regulation has stalled its payments efforts in both countries.Marcus was most recently working to get Libra off the ground as a cryptocurrency for cross border payments. That required negotiations with regulators, and the experience could help with Facebook’s other payments initiatives.“It’s helpful to have specific expertise in financial services regulation to build things the right way from the get-go,” he said. “In the financial services world, it’s very different than traditional technology companies that are not regulated.”(Adds Facebook shares in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Financial Formed to Pursue Company’s Payments Plans

2020-08-20,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $197.38 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $195.00  * Volume: 3048  * Open Interest: 60223 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-28,"Collectively, Square (NYSE:SQ) has been one of the year's hottest tech stocks. It sits at the perfect juncture of finance, e-commerce and technology -- and this has allowed Square to be a natural winner coming out of the novel coronavirus. And while SQ stock bottomed around $32 per share in March, its shares have more than tripled since then. Traders had originally feared that Square would be crushed as small businesses closed down. However, the success of Square's Cash App has made up for that risk and more.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com So, for new investors, is it too late to get onboard?Well, while Square certainly isn't as cheap as it was, the company could still be in the early innings of a long and fruitful story. And it all starts with the company's platform.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Started With PaymentsOverall, Square is a leading payment processor that is attempting to become the go-to digital bank for tech-savvy clients. It is doing this by building out its digital wallet capabilities.From its inception, Square has provided payment-processing services to small merchants. It got its start with a point-of-sale hardware device, which allowed small merchants such as taxi drivers, hairstylists, massage therapists and so on to process credit card payments.  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run Additionally, Square has built on that success by offering a mobile app that broadens its payment-processing capabilities.This business grew rapidly for many years, but has been slowing recently. The coronavirus has caused a notable slowdown, as Square's payment volumes rolled into negative territory this past quarter. That's understandable, as many small businesses had to suspend operations due to the virus. Fortunately for shareholders, though, Square has other plans in addition to the payments business. A Payments Player Expands Its EcosystemMost importantly, the company operates fast-growing digital banking services via its Cash App. And because this business has been growing at triple-digit rates year-over-year, it now accounts for about one-third of Square's gross profits.Cash App is a money transfer platform that allows users to send, store and/or receive cash. There's more to it than just that, though. Square continues to add features to make it more competitive in the marketplace. And so far, Square's bitcoin brokerage service has been one of the key features.Moreover, Square's huge Q2 revenue beat was primarily driven by far higher-than-expected bitcoin trading on the company's app. Square earns a 2% commission on these bitcoin trades. Thus, while it isn't a huge profit center for the company, it's a fantastic tool for attracting new users to the Cash App.In all, Square is rolling out plenty of additional features. It has a brokerage that allows users to trade stocks and other regulated financial products. And reports suggest that Square will be launching a direct lending program to consumers soon as well. Square Becomes an Online BankThe company has already created quite a financial marketplace on the Cash App, and it's set to move even further in that direction next year. That's because, in March, Square obtained its long-awaited banking license.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) approved Square's application, which means the company can now launch a commercial bank. Opening in 2021, Square's bank will be based in Utah, and be allowed to receive deposits from its clients. This is a huge step, since Square will be able to pay interest on those deposits and have FDIC insurance for its bank accounts. It is hard to function as a true one-stop digital wallet without that insurance backstop, but now Square will have it.In addition, the banking license gives Square broad authorization to make commercial loans just as other banks do. This clears up a lot of red tape around Square extending financing to the small businesses that use its payments platform.Put it all together, and Cash App and related banking functions should account for half of Square's gross profits within two years. Yes, there's much more here than just the payment-processing angle nowadays. SQ Stock VerdictCollectively, if Square can execute on Cash App and the banking platform, it will deliver huge gains. That said, don't overlook its peers. Online payments and banking will be a huge market in the future. As such, there is plenty of competition vying to become consumers' first choice in digital wallets.In fact, this is the biggest risk to SQ stock. Square competes against PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo app, Zelle, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and more.These are all sophisticated offerings from large and well-funded competitors, and Square has made its mark against these rivals so far. However, there's no guarantee that it will remain the leader forever.Another risk is that the company is prioritizing revenue growth and market share over profitability. Some of Square's recent moves, such as bitcoin trading, have added far more revenues to the top line than actual operating profits. In turn, the assumption is that Square can generate more profitability over time as customers become more comfortable with Cash App. Still, though, Square hasn't yet proven that its new trading clients will eventually transition into higher margin services.Even so, Square has been generating robust free cash flow. And assuming the company's core payment-processing business maintains slow and steady growth once the pandemic passes, Square should be set to go. The digital banking business can generate high double-digit growth, making SQ stock a winner.Eric Fry does not own the aforementioned securities.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous &quot;10-bagger&quot; calls -- in good markets AND bad.

PayPal Holdings earned $398.00 million, and sales totaled $4.62 billion in Q1.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in PayPal Holdings's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, PayPal Holdings posted an ROCE of 0.05%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on PYPLROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows PayPal Holdings is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In PayPal Holdings's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Recap PayPal Holdings reported Q2 earnings per share at $1.07/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.86/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 27, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-06,"Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) recently announced a partnership with TSYS, a global payments company, that will allow customers to use their Mastercard to split transactions into installments before, during or after checkout.Mastercard Joins Paypal: Three out of four Americans have used installment plans during the pandemic and will continue to do so in the future, Mastercard said in a press release, citing its own research. Mastercard, which is accepted in 210 countries, said it's &quot;creating a future where payments keep pace with the way we live.&quot;An Installment Trend: This announcement comes on the heels of Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) announcing it's adding an interest-free installment payment plan option on certain purchases in a new program called &quot;Pay in 4.&quot;Both of these companies are joining the &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; industry and players such as Affirm and Afterpay.Affirm is partnered with companies like Wayfair Inc (NYSE: W) and ADIDAS AG/S ADR (OTC: ADDYY).Mastercard's installment plan is notable for being available wherever Mastercard is accepted, and not only with certain partner companies, as with Affirm. The Credit Environment: Last month, consumer spending slowed after months of large increases. And credit dependence has dropped in recent months.The New York Fed released a report earlier this summer that said credit card debt has decreased nationwide. This was attributed in part to added government transfer payments intended to provide relief during the coronavirus pandemic. Competition Or Desperation? Mastercard's foray into the &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; world may be an attempt to drum up usage of their cards and perhaps convince users to try other Mastercard services, outside of a desire to be competitive with PayPal and Affirm.PayPal does charge a late fee if a payment is missed in their &quot;Pay in 4&quot; program; the official release from Mastercard did not indicate if a late fee would be charged if a payment was missed.Be on the lookout for other partnerships from major credit card companies.

With shares at all-time highs, here's what you need to know about investing in SQ. SQ Stock: An Accidental SuccessThings weren't always so bright for high-flying Square. Despite growth averaging 43% per year between 2013 and 2019, the company failed to cover its massive overhead costs. And for good reason: Square had to fight against industry heavyweights: Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN).Together, the three incumbents made Square's life hard. Client retention rates are high in the point-of-sale (POS) industry, forcing Square to heavily discount (and give away free products) to gain precious market share.  * 7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before They're Blasting Off Again In other words, Square was in the wrong industry.The company, however, stumbled upon its own success in 2017. Cash App and Network EffectsIt was admittedly a slow start. Square launched Cash App in 2013 to a relatively muted reception. The app itself was relatively simple. Users would link their debit card to a Cash App account, create a $cashtag username, and send money to anyone else with a $cashtag.However, few people used the app because no one else did.As anyone who's ever used a fax machine knows, fax machines are only useful if your intended recipient also has one.All that changed in 2017. And it wasn't the fax machine.In a brilliant marketing blitz, Square created &quot;Cash App Friday,&quot; a weekly giveaway of money to people who tweeted to Cash App's account. Note that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is also owned by Square's CEO, Jack Dorsey.Giving away free money might sound like a strange business strategy to some. But it worked. By 2020, the company boasted 22 million users. Then Came the Coronavirus …… And Cash App's popularity went through the roof.By making it easy for individuals to accept stimulus checks and unemployment benefits, Cash App had stumbled on a magic formula. Deposits shot up 250% to $1.7 billion, and users topped 30 million.Almost overnight, Square has moved away from POS and into online payments processing, a far better industry. And that's the reason investors should take a closer look at Square stock for 2021. Can Cash App's Success Last?Cash App's network effects create a virtuous cycle in good times: adding more users makes the network better, drawing even more users, and so on.But the same flywheel can also run in reverse. MySpace and AOL chatrooms quickly collapsed as users left for other services.So, what are the three things that might cause Cash App's flywheel to run in reverse? Risk 1. Banking Regulation Could Shut Cash App DownAs I've previously written, fintech companies had an unexpected helper in their success: banking regulations.After the 2008 financial crisis, governments created a slew of new laws to prevent a repeat. Among those was Basel III: regulations that forced banks to hold far more capital.Non-bank fintech companies skirt these new rules. For instance, non-bank Rocket Mortgage (NYSE:RKT) can write mortgages virtually without limit, while its banking competitors face stiff capital requirements. That's how, in just three years, Rocket has become the largest U.S. mortgage originator.Square also sidesteps banking regulations. But it's starting to look more like a bank. Unsatisfied with generating 1.5% off transactions, the payments company began to invest a portion of its customer funds in short-term marketable securities in 2019. Today, 56% of Square's deposits are invested in less-liquid government securities.And where banking regulators &quot;giveth&quot;, they can also &quot;taketh&quot; away.If regulators categorize Cash App as a bank, Square's high-growth business model will come to a screeching halt. Risk 2. Bad Loans Might Sink the CompanyIf that weren't enough, Square has also decided to dip its toe in lending. In August, Cash App announced a feature that would allow select users to borrow $200 for four weeks at a 5% interest rate. While 5% might sound low, it comes to 60% APR, or around three times higher than the average credit card. And that opens Square up to usury lawsuits.To me, however, there's one even more pressing issue: Cash App has started Square down the path of pure banking. Rather than offload loans to other lenders (as Lending Club and Prosper do), Square seems poised to keep loans on their own books.And lending is risky.That's why banking startups like SoFi and OneMainFinancial are valued at just 4 times revenue, compared to Cash App's 8.3 times. If Square starts overextending credit, it could quickly collapse in a financial crisis. Risk 3. Bitcoin Prices Could PlummetFinally, Cash App has a little surprise for any would-be investor: 45% of Q2's net revenues came from bitcoin transactions.That's because Cash App makes buying bitcoin easy.* Tap the Investing tab on your Cash App home screen* Tap Bitcoin* Press Buy* Select an amount or tap … to enter a custom amount* Enter your PIN and select ConfirmThere's no cryptocurrency wallet to worry about … no hashed passwords … In fact, it's the simplest way to buy bitcoin I've ever seen. Even Robinhood investors need to create a separate crypto account. Bitcoin alone could be a massive winner for SQ stock. Here's a company that's finally found it's &quot;green-pasture&quot; in fintech.But reliance on bitcoin also comes with significant risks.If bitcoin prices suddenly plummet, it could become a PR disaster for Cash App as customer crypto accounts get wiped out. In 2018, a similar story played out at Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency platform, when user numbers collapsed as crypto prices fell. What's Next for Square Stock?Despite these three risks, Cash App still looks poised to succeed in 2021.Since 2008, U.S. banking regulations have carved out a niche for &quot;non-bank&quot; fintech companies that provide bank-like services. Cash App falls squarely in that space.That said, I'd like to caution readers about Square stock. As Cash App grows, Square WILL be tempted to look more like a traditional bank. That's because, absent banking regulations, few companies have ever resisted the siren's call of using customer deposits to make more money.History is littered with examples. In the 1990s, Savings & Loans (S&L) failures lost investors billions as they collapsed. Two decades later, leasing arms of companies from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to General Electric (NYSE:GE) would almost bring their parent companies down in the 2008 financial crisis.So, if Square's balance sheet starts to resemble a traditional bank, I would sell immediately. The stock will perversely keep going up (Square will be raking in extra cash), but its risk profile would quickly worsen. What's SQ Stock Worth?Assuming for a moment that Square resists the urge to become a traditional bank. In that case, we can use standard discounted cash flow (DCF) modeling and NOT worry about putting in a significant banking risk discount.Analysts currently estimate Square's EBITDA to grow from $83 million in 2019 to $1.4 billion by 2023. Using those numbers come to a fair value of around $132, or a -4% downside.However, Wall Street's estimates might show a massive lack of imagination (an issue rarely seen at venture capital firms).Suppose Cash App integrates with other payment systems. It's not hard to imagine Square generating PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) like revenues down the road. (PayPal earned $5.4 billion revenue in Q2). Increasing SQ's EBITDA to $2.7 billion in 2023 and $11.9 billion by 2029 raises fair value to $240, a 75% upside from today. How to Play Square in 2021Investors looking to cash in on Cash App's growing popularity might seriously consider buying Square stock.But there are three caveats to this super-charged stock.Firstly, investors should make sure Square never takes on too much bank-like risk without the needed capital. Secondly, Cash App is only as powerful as its network; the moment we see a decline in active users, it's time to get out. Finally, investors should watch out for new banking regulations that could force non-bank financial firms to start acting more like banks.  * 10 Buyout Stocks With Long-Term Potential Get all three right, and investors will likely win in 2021 with SQ stock.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.

2020-09-11,"In a sudden and sharp reversal on Wall Street that many have been warning about for months, red-hot tech stocks have fallen off a cliff in early September, with the Nasdaq shedding 10% in a matter of days. This selloff has been widespread and indiscriminate, dragging down even high-quality and fairly valued tech names like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com But the  recent weakness of PYPL stock is little more than a golden buying opportunity for long-term investors.This selloff of tech stocks will end soon. When it does, tech stocks will resume their longer-term uptrend. That will be especially true for PayPal stock, since the company is  supported by robust, long-term growth fundamentals, and its valuation is now discounted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo,when it comes to PYPL stock, forget the noise. Buy the stock on weakness, . weather the storm, and hold onto the shares for long-term gains.Here's a deeper look.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America Reopens  Strong FundamentalsPayPal's long-term growth fundamentals are rock-solid.The transition from physical to digital shopping -- and by extension, the transition from physical to digital payments -- has been underway for several years. That change has caused PayPal's volumes, revenues, profits and stock price to rise rapidly.By closing down physical shopping channels and forcing everyone online. Covid-19 meaningfully accelerated this transition.This acceleration is permanent. Technology has improved to the point where the online-shopping experience is just as good as in physical stores. When shopping on websites, consumers can get products delivered on the same day or the next day, get help from AI-powered chatbots, and leverage augmented reality  technology to visualize items.But of course, online shopping is still significantly more convenient than going to physical stores because consumers don't have to leave their homes when they're shopping online.Consequently, over the next decade, e-commerce's penetration of total retail sales in the U.S. will rise from about 10% today to 20%, 30%, 40%, and higher.Of course, as that transition occurs, the volume of digital payments in the U.S. is going to soar, since consumers cannot use cash to pay for things online. PayPal is the king of digital payments, with an ecosystem that dominates both desktop payments through its PayPal products  and mobile payments with its Venmo offering.Importantly, this ecosystem is protected by multiple competitive advantages,  including tons of partnerships, unparalleled convenience, seamless access across the the internet landscape, a household brand name and second-to-none payment technology.Therefore, over the next decade, PayPal will continue to generate robust volume, revenue and profit growth. All of that growth will, in turn, fuel continued gains by PYPL stock. The Discounted Valuation of PayPal StockThe attractive aspect of PayPal stock now is that the recent, indiscriminate selling of tech stocks has plunged the shares into undervalued territory.  Yet there have not been any material changes to its fundamentals, so the downturn has created an attractive entry point in PYPL stock.PayPal will leverage the growth of global digital payments through its flagship PayPal system and its expanding presence in the mobile payment world through its Venmo offering to generate 20%+ revenue growth for the next few years, and 10%+ revenue growth into 2030.Its expenses will continue to increase around 15%, in-line with the historical average,for the next few years, before dropping to less than 10% subsequently. That will pave the way for consistent profit margin expansion up to and above 30%.Based on those assumptions, I estimate that PayPal's 2030 earnings per share can reach about $17.40.Using a forward earnings multiple of 25 times, which is average for the sector,  results in  a 2029 price target for PYPL stock of $435. Discounted back by 8.5% per year, that results in a 2020 price target for PYPL stock of nearly $210.Nothing about these fundamentals has changed over the past week. The shift from physical to digital remains robust. PayPal's dominance remains unparalleled, and interest rates are still zero.The only thing that has changed is that the PYPL stock price has dropped from above $210 to below $190.So buy the shares on weakness, as this attractive dislocation of PayPal stock won't last for long. The Bottom Line on PYPL StockThe recent tech sector selloff is offering up some golden buying opportunities to investors.PYPL stock is one of those golden buying opportunities.So buy this long-term winner while it's on sale, weather the storm, and sell it at much higher prices in the future.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2020-09-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is in talks to invest $3 billion in Southeast Asian ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.The Chinese e-commerce giant, a sole investor in the round, will spend a portion of the funds to acquire some of the Grab stock held by Uber Technologies Inc., one of the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. The deal may represent one of Alibaba’s biggest bets on Southeast Asia since its first investment in Lazada in 2016.China’s largest corporation has previously had limited forays in ride-hailing but a potential tie-up with Grab gives it access to data on millions of users in eight countries, a growing delivery fleet as well as a stake in digital wallet and financial services. One specific plan under discussion is to integrate Grab’s delivery network into Lazada, giving the Singaporean startup access to a wider network of consumers, one of the people said.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s potential $3 billion investment in Southeast Asia’s Grab, as reported by Bloomberg News, could boost the user growth of e-commerce subsidiary Lazada, which has been losing ground against Tencent-backed Shopee. Lazada may tap the sizable ride-hailing and food-delivery user base of Grab, whose services typically have higher usage frequency than e-commerce.&#92;- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchRead more: TikTok Owner to Spend Billions in Singapore After U.S. BanThe funding -- about a fifth of Grab’s last known valuation of $14 billion -- comes amid growing questions over the company’s ability to live up to its lofty price tag as it grapples with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Anthony Tan said the company is facing its “single biggest crisis,” while co-founder Tan Hooi Ling warned in May of a “long winter.” Existing investors have also been frustrated by what they see as value-destroying competition with Grab’s regional arch-rival Gojek.The world’s biggest ride-hailing companies have waged years of costly battles in each others’ territories before they agreed to stay out of each others’ core markets. The truce left Uber with considerable stakes in its rivals worth more than $9 billion, including a 23.2% stake in Grab at the end of 2018. Under the terms of a deal that Uber struck to exit Southeast Asia, Grab is on the hook for more than $2 billion to the San Francisco-based company if it doesn’t go public by mid-2023.Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., an investor in all of the world’s biggest ride-hailing companies, is at the center of the discussions. The Japanese company has used its position as a major shareholder to push Uber to unload stakes in Grab, Didi Chuxing of China and Russia’s Yandex, the person said. Uber said in April it would write down about $2 billion in those investments after the coronavirus pandemic upended the ride-hailing business. Representatives of Grab declined to comment, while Uber and SoftBank didn’t immediately reply to queries. Alibaba offered no immediate comment.SoftBank has also pushed Grab to make peace with Gojek. Even as speculations about a possible merger have re-surfaced, the two are far from reaching a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The negotiations are hampered by a hostile relationship between the two companies and the complexity of coordinating between so many investors, they said.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is advising Grab and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising Gojek, other people familiar with the matter said. One scenario discussed in the past is potentially combining only the companies’ transportation business in Indonesia, one of them said. Grab and Gojek, valued at $10 billion, are fierce rivals with an ambition to create an all-in-one “super app.” They also compete in food delivery and financial services.Indonesia, by far the largest and the most promising market in Southeast Asia, remains the key sticking point in any potential merger, with both companies wanting a majority stake in the merged business there, according to the people. Gojek, seen as Indonesia’s national champion, won’t be squeezed into a deal, according to another person familiar with the discussions. It has in the past denied merger speculation. Grab is ahead of Gojek in Indonesia, based on the total number of app downloads to date, according to App Annie. Gojek was the most widely used on-demand app by Indonesians in 2019, based on App Annie’s “2020 State of Mobile Report.”Any deal would also likely face regulatory hurdles because it would combine the top two players in the region, reducing competition in ride-hailing and newer fields like food delivery and finance.The pandemic and lockdown measures have battered both companies, forcing them to cut jobs and streamline their businesses. Still, Gojek pulled in new capital from Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., a show of confidence in its efforts to create a digital payments platform in the region.(Updates with mobile app data in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Alibaba Is in Talks to Invest $3 Billion in Grab

2020-09-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Klarna AB, a Swedish payment provider for online shoppers, is still setting its sights on an initial public offering even after its latest funding round left it roughly twice as valuable as it was a year ago.“Over time, with the amount of shareholders we have, it’s probably going to be the natural evolution,” Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said in an interview on Tuesday.He spoke after Klarna brought in $650 million in equity funding from a group of investors led by Silver Lake. ​Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund​ GIC, BlackRock Inc. and HMI Capital also participated, as did Merian​ Chrysalis, TCV, Northzone and Bonnier. The funding round gives Klarna a valuation of $10.65 billion, it said.The company has achieved enormous popularity, especially in the U.S., thanks to its buy-now-pay-later service. Klarna has hinted at its intention to do an IPO in the past, suggesting in December that a timeline of one to two years seemed reasonable.Siemiatkowski said Klarna tries to be “less dependent” on the macroeconomic environment, “and more [on] when we think it makes sense for the company and the right timing for us.”He described the latest funding round as “a great opportunity to continue building a great offering for our consumers.” Klarna now wants to expand in Europe, with France identified as an important market, he said.Klarna’s other backers include Permira Holdings, Sequoia Capital and Rapper Snoop Dogg, who stars in the company’s commercials encouraging users to “get smoooth.”Online CompetitionKlarna’s success in the online payments market has turned it into a key challenger to firms like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. The Swedish firm’s customers can delay payments or make interest-free installments when they shop from brands like H&M or Adidas. Retailers pay Klarna a cut of purchases. Klarna’s shopping app also alerts shoppers to deals or price-drops.But the Swedish firm has faced regulatory pressure, amid concern its marketing tactic of buy-now-pay-later encourages reckless spending, especially among young people. Earlier in September, the U.K.’s Advertising Standards Authority launched a probe into Klarna’s marketing practices.Klarna says demand for its services from both retailers and consumers has soared during the pandemic. The company says it added around 200 new retailers per day in the first half of the year, but has still set aside a reserve of cash to act as a buffer given the economic climate.A Klarna listing would take place in the U.S., where its business is growing fast, according to the CEO.

2020-09-18,"It was a quadruple witching day, one of four in the year that can create tough trading environments amid choppy price action. With that in mind, let's look at a few top stock trades for next week.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBig tech hasn't been doing great. And with its dominant market cap, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is often atop the list of stocks to watch.Shares violently corrected lower at the start of September. And while that action was initially met by buyers, it has ultimately resulted in a series of lower highs. Now, the stock is failing to hold the two-times range extension and more importantly, the 50-day moving average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith Friday's dip, Apple filled the first of two major gaps from late July.If buyers consider that &quot;good enough,&quot; look to see if they can reclaim the 50-day moving average. Above opens up this week's high at $118.83 and the 20-day moving average.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season Should Apple lose $105, though, it puts the psychologically-relevant $100 mark in play -- followed by a possible gap-fill toward $96. I would love a dip to the latter. Not only will Apple fill both of its post-earnings gaps, it will trade down into the 100-day and 20-week moving averages, as well as the 200-day moving average on the four-hour chart.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comOf the mega-tech stocks out there, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of the slower moving names. After its quick pullback earlier this month, shares almost instantly failed to hold the 50-day moving average, while also struggling with its pre-coronavirus highs. The stock almost just as quickly lost the 100-day moving average. There are investment arguments to be made for owning this name. However, from a technical perspective, it's in no man's land right now. If uptrend support breaks (blue line) -- and it's not a level I would put a ton of faith in -- then it puts the 200-day moving average on the table. If it holds, however, we need to see GOOGL reclaim the 100-day moving average, then $1,500. That sets up a test of the 50-day moving average. In a nutshell, traders either need a larger pullback into support or some rotation to the upside that shows commitment.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Norwegian Cruise (NCLH)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) tried twice to breakout this month, but both times it was rejected by the 23.6% retracement.Now fading from that level, it's coming into a key area. While the failed breakout is disappointing, to see Norwegian hold the 20-day and 50-day moving averages would be quite constructive.Above these marks keeps a retest of the September highs in play. If they fail as support, though, it puts $15 in play.This is where things get a little dicey. If Norwegian were to close below $15, it would open the door to (although not guarantee) a test of the August low, near $12.50.  * 4 Biotech Stocks to Buy for Big Gains in 2020 Overall, stay on your toes with this one if you're trading it. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 4: PayPal (PYPL)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnlike Alphabet, which is in a state of limbo, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is now trading down into a reasonable risk/reward level. That's not to say this is an all-in long -- no stock ever is when trading -- but just that the setup is attractive right here. The stock is down almost 20% after declining in eight of 11 trading sessions (if we include Friday). Now fetching a bid at the 100-day moving average (and the 200-day moving average on the four-hour chart), bulls have a defined low (at $171.63, Friday's low). Those who are buying want to see PayPal stay above that mark while looking for rotation over the two-day high at $178.75.Above that mark almost immediately puts $180 back in play to fill Thursday's small gap. A move over that mark opens the door back to the 50-day moving average, which has been resistance. If PayPal breaks Friday's low and can't reclaim it, it puts the two-times range extension in play at $166.83, and potentially lower.

2020-09-23,"The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating digitalization and has led to a spike in online transactions and e-commerce sales. According to PayPal, the penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales in the first half of 2020 outpaced prior external forecast by 3 to 5 years. Both consumers and merchants are increasingly adopting digital payments as contactless transactions have become increasingly important amid the current crisis.The rapid penetration of digital payments led to double-digital revenue growth in the second quarter for PayPal and Square. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place these two fintech payment firms alongside each other to assess which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal, which was spun off from eBay in 2015, has emerged as the digital payment leader. In the second quarter, PayPal added 21.3 million net new active accounts, reflecting a 137% Y/Y rise and marking the strongest growth in the company’s history thanks to a surge in e-commerce and digital payments. As of the end of 2Q, PayPal had 346 million active accounts with over 26 million merchant accounts.The company’s 2Q revenue surged 22.2% Y/Y to $5.26 billion. And adjusted EPS rose 49% to $1.07 as the adjusted operating margin expanded 504 basis points to 28.2%. Total Payment Volume or TPV, which indicates payments processed through the PayPal platform, grew about 29% to $222 billion. Venmo, Paypal’s mobile payments platform, witnessed a 52% growth in its TPV to $37 billion.Following the strong 2Q momentum, PayPal reinstated its 2020 guidance and in fact, raised it. The company expects revenue growth of 20% and adjusted EPS growth of about 25%. It anticipates adding 70 million net new active accounts this year.To boost its top-line further and promote touchless payments, PayPal launched QR Code technology in 28 markets globally in May. CVS Pharmacy will be the first retail chain to offer its customers the option to use PayPal and Venmo QR codes at checkout in its US stores. The company will also launch Venmo credit card this year.PayPal has also expanded its Visa Direct partnership globally to accelerate real-time access to funds for small businesses, consumers and partners across its platform. This collaboration enables PayPal to extend global white label Visa Direct payout services through PayPal and its Braintree, Hyperwallet and iZettle platforms.On Sept. 22, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev reiterated a Buy rating for PayPal with a price target of $285 as the Mizuho E-Commerce Tracker showed that unique views across key PayPal partner sites (like Etsy, Groupon and Wayfair) remained strong in July and August and also pointed to potential signs of life in the beleaguered travel category.The Tracker also indicated that PayPal’s unique views continued to grow ahead of partner websites in the last two months, reflecting persistent share gains for the checkout button. Overall, the analyst expects strong July and August e-commerce trends coupled with share gains to bode well for the company’s second-half TPV. (See PYPL stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal stock has rallied about 74% year-to-date and could rise further by 17% in the coming months as indicated by the average analyst price target of $219.77. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus based on 28 Buys, 5 Holds and no Sell ratings.Square (SQ)Payment facilitator Square is growing rapidly as consumers and businesses are migrating online at a faster pace amid the pandemic. From February through August 2020, there was a 13.2 percentage point increase in the share of Square sellers accepting online payments and by August, over 40% of all Square sellers were accepting online payments. Also, by August, more than 7 in 10 Square sellers were accepting contactless payments.The company’s Cash App ecosystem delivered $1.2 billion in revenue in the second quarter, reflecting a whopping 361% Y/Y growth. The Cash App had over 30 million monthly transacting active customers in June. Aside from the accelerated digital migration, Cash App also gained from the impact of Fed stimulus, unemployment checks and tax refunds.Second-quarter revenue grew about 64% Y/Y to $1.92 billion. But excluding bitcoin revenue, net revenue of $1.05 billion was flat Y/Y. Meanwhile, 2Q adjusted EPS declined 14.3% to $0.18. The strong growth in Cash App revenue was offset by the 17% decline in the company’s core higher-margin Seller business to $723 million. Square’s gross payment volume or GPV fell 15% Y/Y to $22.8 billion.The Seller segment was impacted by lower volumes as several businesses were forced to close amid the shelter-in-place orders triggered by the pandemic. However, the company stated that the Sellers business improved with each month in the quarter as restrictions eased and more sellers adapted to the contactless platform.Meanwhile, GPV from online channels grew over 50% and accounted for 25% of the Seller GPV reflecting the rapid adaption of online solutions by the sellers. (See SQ stock analysis on TipRanks)Recently, the company announced two new features called On-Demand Pay for employees and Instant Payments for employers. These new features will further integrate Square’s Seller and Cash App ecosystems to offer financial services and simplify payroll.Loop Capital analyst Kenneth Hill has just initiated coverage of Square with a Buy rating and a price target of $169. The analyst sees a great deal of upside ahead in the fintech company, driven by further investment in the business and monetization of the Cash App. Hill also believes that on the Seller side, the SMB network should &quot;hold in well and continue a sustained recovery.&quot;The Street has a cautious Moderate Buy consensus for Square with 14 Buys, 12 Holds and 2 Sells. Square stock has risen a stellar 149% year-to-date, so the average analyst price target of $151.77 indicates a possible downside of 2.5% ahead.Bottom lineBoth PayPal and Square have strong growth prospects in the digital payments world. If we look at the Street’s consensus and further upside potential, PayPal stock appears to be a better choice than Square currently.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters.

2020-10-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Venmo, the popular mobile payment network owned by PayPal Holdings Inc., on Monday unveiled a digital-focused credit card, entering the fray of financial-services providers looking to leverage smartphones.The Visa credit card, issued by Synchrony Financial, will be managed through Venmo’s smartphone app, but accompanied by a physical card printed with a QR code. The primary methods of making purchases will be via a credit-card number for online shopping or the physical card in stores, Venmo said Monday.One of the card’s key differentiators is its rewards structure, which gives users 3% cash back for their top spending category each billing cycle, 2% for the next highest and 1% for all other purchases, said Venmo Senior Vice President Darrell Esch and Dennis Bauer, who leads the Venmo and PayPal partnership at Synchrony. The eight categories include bills and utilities, travel, groceries and dining and nightlife.The rewards are the same whether purchases are made online or with the physical card, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Apple Card awards just 1% for physical-card purchases where Apple Pay isn’t accepted.PayPal also has been rolling out QR code scanning for credit-card purchases at some retailers, including CVS Health Corp. drugstores, as another payment method. The physical Venmo card’s QR code, however, will be reserved for card activation and for other Venmo users to send card customers a payment.The card can also be used in both the Google Pay and Samsung Pay apps for tap-to-pay purchases at retailers. Venmo is in discussions with Apple Inc. for support in Apple Pay on iPhones, Esch and Bauer said in an interview. The card, which doesn’t have an annual fee, will be rolled out to 5% to 15% of Venmo users this year, and available to the rest in the first quarter of 2021.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Venmo Unveils Digital Credit Card to Leverage Smartphone Use

2020-10-06,"A big reason the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKF) is higher by 71.32% this year is the growth of digital wallets, such as PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and Square's (NYSE: SQ) Cash App.What Happened: The actively managed ARKF is the king of exchange-traded funds when it comes to Square exposure, allocating 12% of its weight to that fintech juggernaut, more than any other ETF. PayPal is the ETF's 11th-largest holding at a weight of 3.26%.That's a favorable trait at a time when Venmo and Cash App are posting growth rates traditional banks could only dream of.""PayPal's Venmo and Square's Cash App have amassed roughly 60 million users organically in the last 10 and 7 years, respectively, a milestone that took J.P. Morgan more than 30 years and five acquisitions to reach,"" according to ARK Invest research.Why It's Important: With ARKF up more than 71% this year, it would be easy for investors to assume they've missed the ""easy money"" and the big growth here. Good news: Digital wallet growth data suggest otherwise.""According to ARK's research, during the next five years the number of US Digital Wallet users will more than double to 227 million, generating a market capitalization of roughly $830 billion if investors value each user at roughly $3650, the average valuation per US bank customer at year-end 2019,"" notes ARKF's issuer.Investors are showing a willingness to back ARKF.

2020-10-07,"The market’s main indexes are climbing back above key points, after posting losses in September. The S&P 500 has climbed back above 3,400, the Dow Jones is back above 28,000, and the NASDAQ is over 11,300. Since the indexes hit bottom on September 23, trading has been volatile- but trending upwards.By appearances, the market has corrected itself, and looks to be returning to the bullish tendency it showed through the summer. The September jobs report showed that the economy continues to recover, albeit at a slowing pace, from the coronavirus-inspired downturn of the spring. President Trump’s COVID diagnosis threw investors for a day, but his return to the White House and his path to recovery offer a calming effect.In all, it has investors looking to buy back in. And for those investors who are still nervous, Wall Street’s analysts have picked out stocks with plenty of momentum propelling them forward. Each is up at least 30% year-to-date, and has a Perfect 10 from the Smart Score. The Smart Score is a data analysis tool, which uses the real-time information collected in the database. The stock data is collated according to 8 separate factors, each of which is known to predict growth and share appreciation. The factors are averaged together, and given as a single-digit score, on a scale from 1 to 10, letting investors know at a glance the likely way forward for a stock.And a perfect Smart Score, a 10, is a signal that investors should pay attention to. Here are the details on three such stocks, along with corroborative commentary from the analysts.ANGI Homeservices (ANGI)First up is a tech company in the internet services niche. ANGI Homeservices owns a range of online services brands, mostly in the home improvement realm, including HomeAdvisor, HomeStars, and MyBuilder. The company’s brands operate in the US and Europe, and bring in well over $1 billion in annual revenue.With the social lockdowns put in place to combat corona, homeowners are turning in greater number to do-it-yourself resources. ANGI’s revenue reflects this – the company’s top line has grown from $321 million 4Q19 to $343 million in 1Q20 to $375 million in 2Q20. Earnings, which had dipped negative in the first quarter, turned back positive in Q2. The 2-cent EPS reported beat the 1-cent loss expected by 300%. For the third quarter, projections are a 2 cent per share profit.The stock’s price appreciation has also borne out the company’s strong position. ANGI is up 50% this year, and has fully erased any losses seen during the mid-winter turndown.Jake Fuller, 5-star analyst with BTIG, writes of ANGI: “Results were strong and we model ongoing elevated revenue levels but there simply wasn't much room for anything less than a beat-and-raise for the pandemic ‘winners’ like ANGI. The stock reaction notwithstanding, we don't see anything broken here.”Considering these comments, Fuller rates the stock a Buy, with a $19 price target to indicate a potential 49% upside for the coming year. (To watch Fuller’s track record, click here)Overall, the analyst consensus on ANGI is a Strong Buy. The stock’s 12 reviews include 11 Buys and 1 Hold. ANGI trades for $12.74, and the $16.80 average price target implies a 32% one-year upside to the stock. (See ANGI stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal Holdings (PYPL)Next on the list is PayPal, which has become instantly recognizable and the market leader in online payment services. PayPal saw $17.77 billion in revenue last year, with a net income of $2.46 billion. High and growing revenue has attracted investment cash, and PayPal boasts a market cap of nearly $228 billion.Despite everything that has hit the markets this year, 2020 is turning out to be a great year for the company. Q1 revenue and EPS dipped, but not deeply, and both turned back upwards in Q2. The second quarter top line was $5.26 billion, with earnings of 76 cents per share, the highest in more than two years. Share prices are up, as well, with PYPL gaining an impressive 80% year-to-date. Generally rising volumes of online sales, and the concomitant need for digital payment services, provide a continuing boost for PayPal’s income and share position.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane put a $234 price target on PYPL, suggesting a 20% one-year upside, and rates the stock a Buy. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here.)Backing his stance, the 5-star analyst writes, “PYPL should be able to offset any moderation in online spend and accelerate growth by monetizing new users, driving higher engagement and benefitting from deals ramping… In addition, existing daily actives are up 40% Y/Y… Although the influx of new users is initially dilutive to engagement overall, the new users are more engaged than ever before and should flow through the engagement waterfall faster driving accelerating engagement metrics in FY21 and beyond keeping growth strong even as net adds potentially moderate.” Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on PayPal is based on 32 reviews, including 27 Buys and 5 Holds. The shares are selling for $194.61, and have an average price target of $220.27. The shares’ recent appreciation has pushed them close to that target, leaving a 13% one-year upside potential. (See PayPal’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Darling Ingredients (DAR)Darling Ingredients, the third company on our ""perfect 10"" list, occupies a unique niche in the food industry. The company focuses on recycling, collecting the by-products of animal processing along with used restaurant oils and grease and manufacturing them into tallow, usable yellow grease, and meat and bone meals. Darling sells these products in the US and abroad.In the second quarter, DAR beat the earnings forecast, showing 39 cents EPS against an estimate of 37 cents. More importantly, this represents a 143% year-over-year gain. Revenues through the first half of year have been stable, at or near $850 million, and in-line with the 2H19 figures. DAR has beaten earnings forecasts in three of the past four quarters.The shares have outperformed, as well. DAR is up 41% this year, and the stock’s trajectory shows no sign of stopping. Its recovery from the market collapse of mid-winter has been real and sustained.Writing from Stephens, analyst Ben Bienvenu writes, “…we believe the business is on the verge of a significant inflection in earnings potential… and the company’s vertically integrated model provides it with an unmatched position in the industry. We have high conviction that shares are substantially undervalued as the market under-appreciates this inflection. Further, we think the company should be a core holding for investors looking for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investments…”Bienvenu’s comments support his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $54 price target implies an upside of 36%. (To watch Bienvenu’s track record, click here)With 6 recent reviews, including 4 Buy and 2 Hold, Darling gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The $42.40 average price target suggests it has room for 7% one-year growth from the current share price of $39.71.

2020-10-08,"Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been a top performer in 2020, gaining 78.1% year to date. This week, Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg hosted a bull-bear debate concerning PayPal, and he highlighted the major takeaways in a note to clients.Kupferberg said PayPal was already benefiting from structural shifts in payments prior to the pandemic, but the pandemic has served to accelerate digital payment demand. PayPal's growth has accelerated across the board since April, and the stock's bullish momentum reflects that phenomenon.What Investors Say: Kupferberg said the 150 investors that participated in the PayPal debate were decidedly bullish on the stock overall, suggesting investor sentiment is fairly strong at the moment.However, PayPal bears highlighted the stock's lofty valuation, signs that e-commerce growth is slowing and the potential for extremely difficult comps in 2021 as reasons to avoid the stock.Related Links: Wall Street Loves Square's Cash App GrowthIn a survey conducted prior to the debate, 75% of participants indicated they were long PayPal, while only 4% indicated they were short. The median investor estimate for non-GAAP fiscal 2020 EPS was $5.98, slightly ahead of Bank of America's estimate of $5.74.What The Analyst Says: At the end of the debate, Kupferberg said he remains squarely in the bull camp.""We view PayPal as the best pure-play on e/mCommerce, which we believe will continue to take share from the much larger in-store market,"" he wrote in the note.Bank of America has a Buy rating and $235 price target for PayPal.Benzinga's Take: Perhaps the bulls best case for avoiding the stock is simply how bullish the group of debaters seemed to be overall. Investor sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator for stocks, and the fact that there was such bullish sentiment during the debate could be a sign that PayPal may soon take a breather from its 2020 rally.Latest Ratings for PYPL  DateFirmActionFromTo  Oct 2020KeyBancMaintainsOverweight  Aug 2020MizuhoInitiates Coverage OnBuy  Jul 2020Keefe, Bruyette & WoodsMaintainsOutperform    View More Analyst Ratings for PYPL   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Citron's Latest Long Idea Is A Magic Mushroom: 'It's One Of Those Big Concept Stocks'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin surged past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019 after PayPal Holdings Inc. announced it will allow customers to use cryptocurrencies.The largest digital coin increased $950, or 8% during tradition trading hours in New York. It climbed another 2% to $13,119 in early Asian trading. Gains among so-called alt coins were even bigger on Wednesday, with Litecoin jumping more than 13% and Bitcoin Cash surging more than 9%.PayPal customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. Shares of PayPal jumped 5.5% to $213.07, the biggest increase since May.Mike Novogratz, who runs Galaxy Investment Partners, on Twitter called it “the biggest news of the year in crypto,” adding that banks will embark on a race to service digital currencies. “We have crossed the Rubicon,” he said.The news sparked an exuberant response from crypto fans who pointed to a string of recent announcements that suggest wider acceptance by old-school financial mainstays. Two public companies -- Square Inc. and MicroStrategy Inc. -- said recently that they invested in Bitcoin. And Fidelity Investments announced in August that it’s launching its first Bitcoin fund, adding its establishment name and star power to the often-maligned asset class.PayPal said it plans to make the features available as a funding source for purchases at its merchants worldwide and plans to expand it to Venmo soon. Merchants will be paid in traditional currencies such as the dollar rather than in cryptocurrencies when PayPal customers make purchases.Dan Schulman, the firm’s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement that “the shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly.”Users do face some limitations on PayPal. They can’t transfer coins in and out of accounts and can only hold cryptocurencies that they bought on PayPal. Any crypto coins held in an account can’t be transfered to other accounts, PayPal said.PayPal is stepping into crypto only a year after pulling out of the Libra Association, an effort started by Facebook Inc. to develop a digital currency. David Marcus, who leads the initiative for Facebook, used to be president of PayPal.Bitcoin’s been on a hot streak this month, rising about 19% in October. Still, the use case for the cryptocurrency remains limited. Data from blockchain researcher Chainalysis Inc. last year showed hardly anyone used Bitcoin for anything beyond speculation.Partly it’s due to its wild price swings. The coin is up about 75% this year but is still around $7,000 away from its all-time high of about $20,000 set in December 2017. In March, during a coronavirus-induced selloff, it fell 31%.(Updates prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Surges to Highest Since July 2019 After PayPal Embrace

(NYSE: JPM) is entering the fintech ring dominated by players like Square Inc (NYSE: SQ), PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ: FISV), with a service for small business owners, reports CNBC.What Happened: JPMorgan is introducing a fast-funding fintech service paired with a checking account called QuickAccept, which will allow businesses to take card payments seamlessly via a mobile app or a contactless card reader. Users of the service will receive proceeds in their Chase accounts, the same day.QuickAccept's highlight is free of charge fast-funding, unlike competitors, which charge 1.5% in fees to make instant transfers.&quot;Our competition either doesn't have same-day funding, or they charge for it. We think it's a great differentiator for businesses because getting money into their account quickly is so important as they manage their cash flow,&quot; Max Neukirchen, CEO of JPMorgan's merchant services arm, said in the interview with CNBC.Why It's Important: Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey found an opportunity in the struggle of small businesses to accept card payments in 2009 and launched Square, which is now a leader in the space managing payment volumes of $100 billion annually, according to CNBC.&quot;They came out with this whole dongle to process stuff and it was a great idea. They did all stuff we could have done that we didn't do,&quot; JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at a conference in 2019.The bank is getting deeper into the fintech space, thanks to its 2017 acquisition of payment processor WePay. JPMorgan wants to migrate more than three million small business customers to the QuickAccept service and is targeting new customers, with annual revenue of less than $500,000, who want to avoid paying fees, reports CNBC.&quot;We know there are obviously those that are using competitors' products, we can see them settling into their deposit accounts. Our hope is that through this more integrated experience, they will migrate their business over to QuickAccept through Business Complete Banking,&quot; said Chase business banking unit CEO Jen Roberts.Do you think this JPMorgan move has implications for Square, PayPal, and Fiserv?

2020-10-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin appears to be a bit overheated.After surging past $13,000 on Wednesday for the first time in more than 14 months, price charts followed by technical analysts suggest the largest cryptocurrency may be due for a pause in the wake of the exuberance triggered by the announcement that PayPal Holdings Inc. will let customers use cryptocurrencies.The rally pushed Bitcoin’s 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading to 80, a level that chartists consider overbought. Additionally, Bitcoin is well above the upper limit of a trading range that would normally trigger a reversion to the mean, which may indicate the digital coin needs to pause before continuing to advance.Bitcoin gained as much as 3% to $13,241 during Asian trading hours, before retreating back below $13,000 in New York on Thursday. It has surged about 20% this month.The trend is keeping advocates bullish even with the muted gains on Thursday.“Something unanticipated needs to occur to trip up advancing Bitcoin, as we see it, yet the crypto may need a new catalyst to sustain above $14,000, wrote Mike McGlone, a commodity strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Absent a reversal in key metrics showing increasing demand and adoption, breaching resistance should be a matter of time.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Bitcoin Reaches Overbought Territory After Piercing $13,000 Mark"

2020-10-22,"The adoption of e-commerce and rise of digital payments have been some of 2020’s key trends. PayPal (PYPL) has been one of the prime beneficiaries. The evidence was clear to see in its Q2 performance - PayPal’s strongest quarter since becoming an independent public company.The market has rewarded the performance, and shares are up by 97% year-to-date.Heading into Q3’s earnings announcement on November 2, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Keane expects PayPal’s excellent execution to continue.“We expect PYPL to deliver solid 3Q20 results with potential for upside and strong continued momentum over the next few years as the company monetizes new users, drives expanding engagement, benefits from new wins ramping up, and delivers on new products and initiatives such as Venmo monetization, including the recent Venmo Credit Card launch, QR codes in-store, and Pay in 4 installments solution,” Keane said.The monetization of Venmo - PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment app – has been very valuable to the company. Keane expects the recently launched Venmo Credit Card to “gain significant adoption.”“Importantly,” Keane notes, “The credit card will carry better economics than the debit card, driving incremental revenue, better take rate, and margins.”Venmo has been a stellar act this year. Its user base grew from approximately 52 million in FY19 to over 60 million in 2Q20.Keane expects Venmo revenue to increase by 73% year-over-year in FY20 to roughly $647 million “despite instant transfer fees being waived through the pandemic and PYPL doubling the debit card cash back rewards.”But on top of the growing demand for PayPal’s products and services, the opportunities presented by the pandemic have led the company to focus on other initiatives.The viral outbreak has resulted in further adoption of contactless in-store payments. The recent launch of integrated QR code functionalities in PayPal’s digital wallet in 28 countries “could drive strong volumes over time for PYPL and Venmo complementing the company’s digital wallet and physical cards in-store.”And while 2020’s macro environment has been challenging to many, Keane believes “the shift in consumer behaviors has created a unique opportunity for the company’s long-term strategy on becoming an everyday essential service.”All in all, Keane reiterated a Buy rating on PYPL shares along with a $234 price target, which implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here)There’s similar sentiment across the Street. Based on 25 Buys and 5 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy.

""People are finally developing solutions to comply with [the Travel Rule] but [PayPal is] not there yet,"" said Brito.""The easiest thing to do is not engage in transfer and take on that compliance risk,"" he added, pointing to the fact that cryptocurrencies would probably be a small part of PayPal's business.Stephen Palley, a partner at the Anderson Kill law firm, told Coindesk that PayPal is ""going to be cautious, and they're going to roll it out slowly.""Nevertheless, there's no convincing the most ardent believers of the decentralized currency.

PayPal might consider other potential targets if the negotiations fall apart.BitGo, a California-based digital assets custodian, offers multi-signature wallet services. Multiple signatures generated from unique private keys are needed for routing transactions through such wallets.The terms of the deal are unknown.

The company is partnering with cryptocurrency firm Paxos, who will be responsible for the trading and custody of the assets.The move should be a win-win both for PayPal and crypto enthusiasts who can make use of PayPal's huge network of merchants on a platform that currently boasts 325 million active accounts.The service should become available to US users over the coming weeks while the Venmo app and several international markets will be added during the first half of next year.Allowing for Bitcoin trading has already been a boon for rival digital payment company Square (SQ). Square’s Cash App enabled Bitcoin trading in early 2018 and since then has significantly increased engagement and monetization, estimated to be 3 times as much as that of Venmo, PayPal’s equivalent.PayPal has obviously been keeping an eye on developments and hopes to emulate its success.However, Rosenblatt analyst Sean Horgan tempers investors’ expectations of a large uptick in profit.“While we view this as a positive development for PYPL, we remind clients that bitcoin trading is an engagement driver and is likely to provide indirect revenue via customer acquisition/engagement,” the analyst said. “While revenues may see a large step up similar to SQ has, accounting rules require the reported (and perhaps misleading) revenues will likely represent an immaterial amount of operating profit as bitcoin volumes are virtually priced at cost.”Overall, Wall Street loves this stock, earning a stellar analyst consensus rating, as TipRanks analytics demonstrate PYPL as a Strong Buy. Out of 30 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 25 are bullish, while 5 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 9%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $223.54.

Some make the argument that fintech and digital-focused companies like PayPal and Square deserve a premium valuation compared to traditional credit cards, Sanchez said.But there is a major flaw in this thesis, she said: both groups are driven by consumption.""You need transactions in order to support all of these plays, and so I would argue that psychologically you can tell yourself that [justification] but I don't know that it's going to play out over a period in your portfolio.""Counter Argument: Joule Financial President Quint Tatro offered the other side of the argument and said PayPal and Square's stocks aren't as overvalued as they may seem to be.PayPal, for example, continues to show very rapid growth, along with strong free cash flow generation of $3.9 billion in 2019 that is modeled to grow to $5.95 billion in 2020, Tatro said.

2020-10-24,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bitcoin hype machine is back in overdrive.The digital token spiked above $13,000 this week for the first time in over a year, touching off Twitter dance parties, new sky-high predictions and even some tattoo flashing. Back are proclamations that crypto is the currency of the future, that the dollar’s days are numbered and blockchain will reorder the financial universe.A mid-week announcement that PayPal Holdings Inc. will allow transactions in crypto set off the craze, adding about $19 billion to Bitcoin’s value over the following two days. It was the latest in a series of mainstream acknowledgments that digital tokens exist and clients want to trade in them. Wall Street stalwarts like Fidelity Investments have crypto investment products and two public companies -- Square Inc. and MicroStrategy Inc. -- recently said they bought Bitcoin.But for all the hype, there’s little evidence that Bitcoin and its digital brethren are any closer to displacing fiat currencies. The use case -- what you can actually buy with Bitcoin -- remains flimsy. Instead, some critics argue, digital tokens have simply morphed into another asset class, similar to gold, and the sheen of institutional acceptance is simply proof that financial firms want to get in on the market for trading cryptocurrencies.“The recent news regarding large corporations investing in BTC is helpful for sentiment and PR, but it is not something that most traditional investors will assign much value to,” said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares.For many bystanders, some of the excitement this week elicited memories of the coin’s record run just a few years back, when super-hype took it to $20,000 and a subsequent crash popped all the champagne bubbles at industry parties within a matter of weeks. Still, some prominent investors have bought in and global central banks are starting to show smidgens of interest.For a while, predictions of greater acceptance failed to materialize thanks mostly to volatility in crypto prices and reputational blows on the back of hacks and scams.Analysts say PayPal’s expansion can be seen as a catch-up play to competitors such as Square and Robinhood who already offer similar features. It could also drive engagement and revenue for the company, draw in a wider user base and open up a new way for consumers to use their digital assets, says Darrin Peller, a managing director at Wolfe Research.But, “other than being used as a speculative currency, one of the biggest roadblocks still is the volatility of the currency and the ability to use it -- the point of sale is tough,” said Peller.Data from blockchain researcher Chainalysis Inc. has shown hardly anyone uses Bitcoin for anything beyond speculation. At the start of 2019, only about 1.3% of economic transactions came from merchants, a trend that was little changed over the prior two years.Some analysts predict that could change via PayPal, though users do face some limitations on the platform. They can’t transfer coins in and out of accounts and can only hold cryptocurrencies that they bought on PayPal. Any crypto coins held in an account can’t be transferred to other accounts, the firm said.“Despite a lack of real merchant adoption, it was an easy positive PR story for PayPal because it makes them look progressive,” said Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at Clearmatics. “But the announcement has very little substance since the coins can’t be moved to any outside party.”Institutional AcceptanceTo Matthew Edwards, chief executive officer at Dalpha Capital, an investment-management firm specializing in digital assets that’s gearing up to launch its first fund early next year, speculation might be enough of a use case. If institutions can own and trade Bitcoin in a way that adds value to their allocations, then that could be “more than enough reason to play,” he said. But until the trend evolves, “this is simply another asset class to trade.”Fidelity said it has received interest from a “a wide range of institutional investors, including family offices, RIAs, hedge funds, pensions, foundations, and other institutional investors.” The Boston-based firm declined to be more specific.Grayscale Investments said recently it raised more than $1 billion for its investment products in the third quarter, a record for the digital-asset management firm. The Bitcoin trust from Grayscale (ticker GBTC) has attracted more than $2.8 billion since December 2017, including $2 billion in 2020. That’s better than about 97% of exchange-traded funds currently listed in the U.S., according to data compiled by James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence.But PayPal’s announcement and others like it won’t move the needle in terms of investment allocations into digital assets, according to Demirors. CoinShares sees significant interest from traditional multi-asset fund managers, but larger ones are reluctant to be first in the space and say they prefer the safety of the herd, she said. Institutions might start paying more attention should an ETF be approved, for instance.Regulators have been slower to embrace cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declined to approve a Bitcoin ETF, despite applications repeatedly filed since 2013. PayPal’s announcement won’t nudge them to change their stance, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade.“These things do not move that fast -- regulators will not allow cryptos to replace fiat currencies,” Aslam said. “If anyone is thinking of that, then they can continue to hope for this for the rest of their lifetime.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Resurgence Leaves Institutional Acceptance Unanswered

2020-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin’s scorching rally lost steam on Wednesday amid widespread risk aversion, falling the most in a month.The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value slumped 3.1% to $13,201 as of 2:40 p.m. in New York. Alternative coins including Litecoin and Monero also posted declines, while the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index dropped 3.7%.“This broad, risk-aversion-trading session is triggering widespread panic selling, which is seeing every risky asset, like gold and Bitcoin, really start to plummet,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. Wednesday’s high of $13,857 only narrowly exceeded Bitcoin’s most recent peak, set in June 2019. While some chartists say Bitcoin could be forming a bearish double-top pattern, it also could be taking a breather after its 14-day relative strength index reading passed 70, signifying the coin was overbought.“I think that $14,000 is a very key threshold,” said Moya. “Once that level is taken out, there is going to be a lot more upside here.” Before Wednesday’s pause, Bitcoin had gained roughly 15% since an announcement last week by PayPal Holdings Inc. that it will allow customers to use cryptocurrencies.But Bitcoin advocates say the coin’s decline may not be cause for concern. Many argue cryptocurrencies -- and Bitcoin in particular -- could eventually stand to benefit in an era of rampant central-bank money printing and the potential for an inflationary spike.“The way we see it, something unexpected has to reverse increasing adoption of Bitcoin as digital store-of-value such as gold, or the price has few options but to rise,” Mike McGlone, a strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Falls the Most in a Month Following Red-Hot Rally

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Monday's Q3 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see PayPal Holdings reporting earnings of $0.94 per share on sales of $5.41 billion. PayPal Holdings reported a profit of $0.61 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $4.38 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the &quot;consensus estimates.&quot; A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an &quot;earnings surprise&quot; and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on PYPLIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Monday, earnings would be up 54.1%. Revenue would be up 23.57% from the year-ago period.

In 2015, eBay decided to spin-off PayPal into its own public company. Under the terms of the spin-off, which came after pressure by activist investor Carl Icahn, each eBay investor as of July 8, 2015, received one share of PayPal stock per eBay share owned.PayPal opened its first day at $41.46. By late 2015, PayPal had dropped as low as $30, its all-time lowest price.

2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rebounded from the worst week since March as investors bet on the energy, materials and industrial sectors ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election. Crude oil rose the most in more than three weeks.Dip buyers helped the benchmark S&P 500 finish up 1.2%, though it closed down from the highs of the day. It slumped 5.6% last week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 lagged behind, weighted down by Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as investors rotated from so-called work-from-home stocks and into sectors that would benefit from more stimulus.“There’s a lot of general positioning before this event, investors are a little bit jittery,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. “You layer in a few of the other uncertainties -- it’s still the Covid situation, with things going on in Europe and parts of the U.S. in the Midwest, investors were reminded that the uncertainty in that situation can still dominate markets.”With one day before the American presidential election, volatility returned, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, or fear gauge, remaining elevated. Polls continue to show Democrat Joe Biden ahead, though battleground states remain tight. The U.S. reported a slight slowdown in virus cases over the weekend, but several states continued to notch record numbers of infections.Once the U.S. election passes, investors will contend with the Federal Reserve delivering a policy decision Thursday before the October jobs report Friday.

Russia, which depends on crude as a key export, saw the ruble weaken to the lowest level since March against the dollar.Virus developments are also front and center, with daily cases continuing to surge in many parts of the world. The U.K.’s prime minister ordered England into a four-week partial lockdown, all but shuttering the economy, while other European countries prepared to increase restrictions.“Going into an election, there’s always, always jitters, there’s volatility,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But we have the question mark regarding the surge of the coronavirus.

2020-11-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season is revealing cracks in some of this year’s top stocks, a worrying sign for a market that has relied on a smaller pool of big winners to fuel gains.PayPal Holdings Inc., the payments company that has become a market darling this year, fell as much as 6.9% on Tuesday after reporting slower user growth and a lackluster sales forecast.While other industries struggle with pandemic-driven changes in consumer behavior this year, many companies whose products and services make it easier to interact and transact remotely have thrived. That’s fueled share price gains and rising investor expectations that the boom times for internet-related companies will continue. PayPal, for example, had gained 82% this year through the end of September as user growth and payment volume surged. The stock’s gains created more than $100 billion in market value.This reporting season, financial results for several of these companies have come in below expectations, which may weigh on the outlook for the broader market. Firms like Netflix Inc., Shopify Inc., Fastly Inc. and Twilio Inc. reported results that were met with waves of selling.Technology and internet stocks tumbled last week, extending a recent slide after results from the biggest technology companies failed to live up to expectations. Tech giants like like Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. released quarterly results that beat estimates by some measures, but they weren’t viewed as strong enough to justify lofty valuations. That helped send the S&P 500 down 5.6% last week, its worst performance since March.To be sure, some of the year’s banner stocks have posted results that commanded even higher prices. Pinterest Inc. and Snap Inc. both soared after user growth and sales smashed expectations as brands shift ad budgets to online platforms during the coronavirus epidemic.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Earnings Letdowns for Stock Market Pandemic Winners Are Mounting

2020-11-03,"PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported earnings after the close yesterday, beating on the top and bottom line. The company's guidance predicts EPS growth of 27%-28% and revenue growth of 20%-21% in 2020. It also said Venmo's Total Payment Volume was $44 billion, up 61%. Consumers have turned to online payments and e-commerce as the pandemic limits shopping in person and with cash, and that explains some of the growth PayPal has seen. However, consumers have plenty of choices: credit cards, CashApp, Zelle, and others all compete in the space.So, what's PayPal doing to gain this kind of growth?It's become ubiquitous at the online check-out counter. Everywhere from Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), and so on allow users to use PayPal instead of a credit or debit card at checkout. Facebook, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: FB) Messenger even has an option for users to pay each other using either a debit card or PayPal. No other payment app has this sort of reach, and the company advertises secure payments for consumers who might be nervous about typing in card numbers. The question is whether it can keep its lead in this competitive field and continue a strong growth rate.Photo by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Monday's Market Minute: What To Watch Into Election Week  * Friday's Market Minute: Perspectives On GDP(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The stock price moved down to $187.76 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: NEUTRAL  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $155.00  * Volume: 555  * Open Interest: 1303Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * PayPal Holdings: Q3 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For November 2, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

For the fourth quarter, PayPal expects adjusted profit to grow in a range of 17% to 18%, below analysts' estimated growth of about 24%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2020-11-03,"PayPal shares are falling 3.9% in pre-market trading today as the company’s 4Q earnings outlook lagged analyst expectations.The payment platform’s 3Q revenue surged 25% Y/Y to $5.46 billion as the pandemic fueled digital transactions across the world. Also, PayPal’s (PYPL) adjusted EPS increased by about 41% to $1.07 driven by 377 basis points Y/Y expansion in the adjusted operating margin to 27.2%. PayPal exceeded analysts’ revenue and EPS expectations of $5.43 billion and $0.94, respectively.Meanwhile, the company added 15.2 million net new active accounts and ended the quarter with 361 million active accounts, marking a 22% growth. Total Payment Volume or TPV on the company’s platform increased 38% to $247 billion.Following the strong 3Q numbers, PayPal raised its full-year revenue growth guidance to the range of 20%–21% from the prior outlook of about 20% growth. Also, it now predicts adjusted EPS growth between 27%–28% compared to the previous forecast of about 25% growth.For 4Q, the company anticipates revenue growth of 20%–25% and an adjusted EPS increase of 17%–18%. Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS growth of about 24%. Speaking about the 4Q guidance on the conference call, the company highlighted the uncertainty related to COVID-19, the US presidential election and potential social unrest.With regard to the 4Q guidance, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer noted, “PYPL’s guidance of 4Q20 adjusted EPS growth in a range of 17% to 18% was far below the 41% growth rate it reported in 3Q20, and it translates to an adjusted EPS range of $0.97 to $0.98 versus the consensus estimate of  $1.07. Management said PYPL’s outlook was impacted in part by incremental investments during 4Q20.”The analyst reiterated a Hold rating for PayPal saying, “Our non-consensus view on the stock is based on our belief that PYPL’s valuation already reflects much of the good news the company reported today and that questions about the sustainability of its growth trajectory in a post-pandemic world are likely to seep into discussions about the stock. As such, we would look for a better entry point before re-engaging with PYPL shares.” (See PYPL stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street is bullish about PayPal with a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 15 Buys versus just one Hold. The average analyst price target of $228.31 indicates an upside potential of 21.6% in the coming months.

2020-11-04,"Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares fell 4.23% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings beat but said its growth would likely slow in the fourth quarter.A flurry of large PayPal option trades were mixed in nature on Tuesday as investors decide whether or not the PayPal earnings dip is a long-term buying opportunity.The PayPal Trades: On Tuesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received 24 option alerts related to unusually large trades of PayPal options. Here are a handful of the biggest:  * At 9:44 a.m., a trader bought 544 PayPal call options with a $177.50 strike price expiring on Friday near the ask price at $5. The trade represented a $272,000 bullish bet.  * Less than a minute later, a trader bought 530 PayPal call options with a $177.50 strike price expiring on Friday near the ask price at $4.749. The trade represented a $251,697 bullish bet.  * At 10:26 a.m., a trader sold 516 PayPal call options with a $230 strike price expiring on Jan. 15 at the bid price of $2.101. The trade represented a $108,411 bearish bet.  * At 12:00 p.m, a trader bought 250 PayPal put options with a $187.50 strike price expiring on Nov. 20 above the ask price at $9.155. The trade represented a $228,875 bearish bet.Of the 24 total large PayPal option trades on Tuesday morning, seven were calls purchased at or near the ask or puts sold at or near the bid, trades typically seen as bullish.Another 16 trades represented calls sold at or near the bid or puts purchased at or near the ask, trades typically seen as bearish.One trade was executed near the midpoint of the bid-ask spread, a price typically considered neutral.Related Link: Here's How Much Investing ,000 In PayPal's 2015 Spinoff Would Be Worth TodayWhy It's Important: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively small size of the largest PayPal trades by institutional standards, they were likely not institutional hedges.Disappointing Guidance: By most measures, PayPal had an impressive third quarter from a financial standpoint, beating analyst expectations for earnings and revenue. Yet the negative market reaction on Tuesday suggests care much more about the prospect of slowing revenue growth in the fourth quarter.PayPal reported third-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07 on $5.46 billion in revenue. Analysts had been expecting 94 cents and $5.41 billion, respectively. Revenue was up 25% from a year ago, and PayPal added 15.2 million net new accounts in the quarter. PayPal reported 4 billion payment transactions, up 8% from the second quarter.PayPal also reported 36% growth in total payment volume, beating analyst estimates. However, PayPal guided for fourth-quarter EPS growth of between 17% and 18% and revenue growth of between 20% and 25%, implying significant slowdowns from third-quarter levels.Prior to Tuesday's drop, PayPal shares were up more than 70% year-to-date. Much of the selling pressure may simply have to do with investors' extremely high expectations for the company after such a strong rally.

In fact, it’s been celebrating the prospect of gridlock in Washington D.C. as the Senate appears it will remain in Republican control. The Dow rose 6.2% this week through Thursday and is taking a breather today.
BABA IPO Falters
While the elections consumed most of the media’s bandwidth this week, China’s online and mobile commerce leader, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) made headlines Tuesday when its potential subsidiary, the financial services company Ant Group, had its IPO on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges suspended two days before the planned public debut.
The IPO was set to become the biggest of all time, topping Saudi Amarco’s 2019 public offering that raised $29.4 billion.
Ant Group is widely known for operating China’s most used digital wallet, Alipay, which has over 900 million users in China alone. Alipay launched in 2004, and is also known for running one of the largest money market funds in the world. It’s more recently expanded into wealth management, micro loans and other financial technology services.
In 2011, Alibaba sold Alipay to a group owned by Alibaba co-founder, Jack Ma. In 2018, Alibaba then bought a 33% stake in Ant Financial, Ant Group’s earlier incarnation.
Ant Group’s impending IPO was scuttled shortly after Ma apparently made public statements criticizing China’s financial regulators and banks, which he claimed were holding back growth and are in need of reform.
China’s regulators didn’t take kindly to Ma’s public criticisms and suspended the IPO indefinitely. As a result, the stock dropped like a rock – falling over 8% the same day.
On Thursday, BABA released results for its second quarter in fiscal year 2021. Annual active consumers on Alibaba’s sites climbed to 757 million and mobile monthly users rose to 881 million, as the company’s “domestic core commerce business continues to grow steadily” in the wake of the pandemic in China.
The stock bounced back a bit today but is still down for the week.
Bitcoin Hits Multi-Year High
The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin (BTC), soared to its highest level since January 2018 on Thursday, piercing through $15,000. So far this year, bitcoin is up nearly 109%.
According to Coindesk, the number of accounts holding the cryptocurrency keeps rising with the price, which likely means more and more retail investors are dipping into the crypto market.
Indeed, digital payments and financial services company Square (NYSE:SQ), which announced it beat analyst estimates for revenue and earnings in the third quarter Thursday, reported its popular Cash App generated $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue and $32 million in bitcoin gross profit, up about 11X and 15X, year-over-year. That was almost 80% of the company’s total Cash App revenue for the third quarter.
The company is leading a trend of facilitating bitcoin purchases for everyday customers.
Square competitor, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), has also begun selling bitcoin. The company recently announced it will allow customers to buy, hold and sell bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrencies held in PayPal accounts can be used to pay for purchases at 28 million stores around the world.
Interestingly, companies have even begun storing some of their own cash reserves in bitcoin.
In October, Square joined firms like MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust by adding $50 million worth of bitcoin to its own treasury. Grayscale currently owns about $6.7 billion worth of bitcoin and has plans to keep ramping up its supply.
While that all appears to be great news for the sector, personally, I’m not a fan of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.
Instead, I prefer fundamentally superior stocks that have outstanding earnings and revenue growth.
And with an absolutely stunning third-quarter earnings announcement season underway, my Growth Investor portfolio is teaming with opportunities in cutting edge technology sectors.
Take 5G wireless connectivity …
The Bigger 5G Picture
From artificial intelligence and virtual reality to smart factories and robotics, remote surgery, self-driving cars and connected cities, 5G is the keystone technology that supports and enhances the buildout of the others.
And the 5G rollout has already arrived. Currently, 100 mobile operators in 44 countries or territories have launched 5G services to some degree, according to the Global mobile Suppliers Association. And there are now 138 million 5G connections worldwide, representing a 116% increase from the first quarter of 2020.
This is big business. Nokia believes 5G-enabled industries are poised to generate $8 trillion worth of economic activity by 2030.
The bottom line: 5G is what’s helping keep us all connected in the modern economy. If you live somewhere without reliable broadband access, you might have trouble keeping up with shopping or even finances in the “new normal.” That is, until ultrafast 5G wireless changes all that for you.
Now that we’re all upgrading to 5G from coast to coast, and around the world, it’s mind boggling to consider all the technology involved. And, particularly, all the new hardware that will be required. This is where the best opportunity for investors comes in.
For my money, I’m not going to bet on any one application of 5G. Or even one provider of 5G. I want the companies who make all of it possible.
The King of 5G “Turbo Button” Technology 
Mobile providers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) need 5G to maintain their edge — and get people into new smartphone contracts. But the big profits will come from the companies that help create 5G.
One such company I like now is much lesser known than the Big Telecom companies but has excellent growth prospects.
This company is already one of the biggest semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the world. These days, its products for machine learning, optics, sensors and analytics are getting deployed for all sorts of next-generation technologies: the self-driving cars, robotics, cloud computing and the larger Internet of Things (IoT).
This is the kind of stock that can help you profit from all the 5G infrastructure that’s popping up everywhere.
And the time to invest is now.
The company released its third-quarter report last week and beat Wall Street’s expectations for the top- and bottom-line. It’s climbed 11.9% over the past month, and blew past its 52-week high this morning.
I recommended the stock to Growth Investor subscribers back in December 2019, and it’s sitting pretty on my Buy List with a 44.7% gain.
But there’s plenty more upside remaining.
Analysts are anticipating 9% sales growth and 19.5% earnings growth in the upcoming quarter.
So, if you’re looking to invest in this growing 5G company, your window to get in while the stock price is still low is closing quickly.
For all the details, simply watch my free briefing on 5G and join us at Growth Investor today. As soon as you do, I’ll send you a copy of my special report, The King of 5G “Turbo Button” Technology, that will tell you everything you need to know about this company and 5G.

2020-11-13,"Snowflakes. Soy boys. And other pejoratives, many of which are unrepeatable in polite company. These are some of the lesser grievances that liberals have had to endure during the four years of the Trump administration. Barring unlikely and bizarre circumstances, President-elect Joe Biden will take over the White House, leading to much joy among the left. In this exuberance, it’s tempting to configure your long-term stocks to buy based on the election results.
However, that would not be the wisest course of action. Don’t get me wrong — the transition to Democrats taking control of the executive office is wildly significant. As CNN reported, Biden plans to issue executive actions that will undo outgoing President Trump’s policies. Among them, controversial issues such as immigration reform will be top on the list. With such promised large-scale changes, of course it will have an impact on long-term stocks.
But it’s important to not get myopic. Although you might want to direct your long-term stocks toward companies that will largely benefit from Democratic rule and avoid those that perform better under Republican stewardship, Biden probably won’t have full control of government. Even if he did, the Democrats can’t afford to alienate Americans who did not vote for the former Vice President.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
To be fair to Trump’s non-stop accusations of voter fraud, the electoral race was tight. Despite the federal government’s poor handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Trump still won over several million voters across all demographics, largely due to his economic policy strengths.

So, don’t buy into exclusively politically motivated narratives. Instead, for strategic portfolio allocation, consider companies that will do well irrespective of who’s in office. Based on large secular trends, these long-term stocks to buy should have an extended pathway to profitability.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Disney (NYSE:DIS)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)
Ford (NYSE:F)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP)
Finally, a word of advice that’s not financially related. Nothing is as bad as it seems nor is it as great as it seems. Besides, if Biden wants to make his stay in the White House last longer than four years, he’s got some compromising to do. Therefore, approach these long-term stocks to buy agnostically.

Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)

Under ordinary circumstances, the concept of Amazon being a leading candidate among long-term stocks to buy is almost sacrosanct. For one thing, you can look at the incredible resilience of AMZN stock over the years. Despite many bumps and bruises, against all manners of accusations of antitrust behaviors, the e-commerce giant has continued to forge ahead. It’s the disrupter that is often the bane of small businesses, yet it’s our disrupter.
Recently, though, Amazon’s status as the pinnacle of capitalistic success has put it in hot water. Sure, the company’s CEO Jeff Bezos may have clashed with President Trump. It’s no secret who Bezos supports. But just because Biden is in office doesn’t mean it’s clear skies ahead for AMZN stock. No, Biden must answer to the Democrats. Traditionally, the left has championed workers’ causes, including unionization, which isn’t favorable to Amazon.com.
So, does that mean investors should axe Amazon from their list of long-term stocks to buy? Not at all. Indeed, when you look at the growing prominence of e-commerce, Amazon plays a pivotal role. No matter who’s calling the shots, AMZN will remain a force to be reckoned with.

Disney (DIS)

Although the cruise ship and airliner industries arguably represent the face of suffering from the novel coronavirus, Disney has been one of the most deeply impacted names among long-term stocks. After all, people travel from all over the world to attend its vast theme park empire. In addition, the disruption to Hollywood hurt Disney’s pocket badly, making DIS stock a questionable investment.
Therefore, it’s no surprise that encouraging developments from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) on the coronavirus vaccine front gave the Magic Kingdom a much-needed boost. Should a vaccine provide a viable solution, high-contact businesses could once again flourish, particularly from pent-up demand. Further, the return of theme parks is going to be vital for many local economies as Disney was forced to lay off tens of thousands of employees.
But should the coronavirus worsen — or an even scarier proposition, another pandemic arises in the near future — Disney has unlocked the key to its potential success. From the company’s Star Wars franchise was derived The Mandalorian, which has been a runaway success. But not many lay observers know that the production team filmed half the scenes in an ultra-advanced semicircular LED-based studio, which allows for real-time visualization that’s far superior to greenscreen technology.


					7 Battery Stocks That Hold the Keys to Next-Gen Innovations				

In addition to the actors’ benefit, this LED system allows Disney to film in its own cocoon, sheltered from the outside world. That means the company can produce content even during a severe pandemic, which is a huge catalyst for DIS stock.

Costco (COST)
Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com

	
During the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans rushed to their local Costco stores to pile up on the essentials. Cynically, the demand was great for the warehouse retailer on one hand because the company experienced Black Friday-like crowds every day. Of course, not all Costco members abided by the mitigation protocols, which made for interesting viewing on social media.
Now, the U.S. is again making Covid-19-related headlines for all the wrong reasons. Recently, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that on Nov. 6, new daily infections hit just under 133,000 cases. At time of writing, the seven-day moving average has breached the 100,000 case level. That is simply wild, which suggests that we could see greater demand for COST stock.
However, I’m not interested in Costco simply as a play on the pandemic. While the numbers look bad, there is an argument to be made that people are getting used to the crisis. Further, with Biden at the White House, it’s possible that more folks will take the health crisis seriously.
No, my interest in COST stock is that the underlying company caters to the well off. If we have a K-shaped recovery, this is one of the names that should belong in your list of long-term stocks to buy.

PayPal (PYPL)

Another company among long-term stocks that has direct exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic, PayPal has seen its profile rise as people added one more reason to avoid cash: potentially, handling physical money could result in higher risk for coronavirus transmission. To be clear, we don’t know precisely how long the coronavirus sticks to surfaces such as paper money.
However, this is more of a common-sense approach. Cash is germ friendly so unless we’re Scrooge McDuck, we shouldn’t be handling it too often. Still, this is just a one-dimensional factor for PYPL stock.
I say this because whether we’re dealing with a pandemic or not, society is increasingly becoming cashless. Sure, there is the odd cash-only business that is still viable, such as your neighborhood pizzeria. But with digitalization comes multiple contactless payment options. At a certain point, you’d imagine that such business luddites will eventually go out of business if they don’t adapt.


					10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in November Under $10				

Further, PYPL stock is a compelling opportunity because of how the underlying company addresses the unbanked and underbanked communities. Lack of access to the financial system is a detriment to our connected ecosystem. Thus, PayPal is doing some social good by helping to even the playing field.

Ford (F)

Prior to the election when the opinion polls showed Biden having a consistent lead over President Trump, many investors had the same idea regarding long-term stocks to buy: pivot to companies that have strong clean energy implications. For many, that meant piling into electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). To be sure, TSLA has absolutely dominated the markets. But in my view, this dominance also leaves the door open for Ford.
True, American car companies have been languishing for years. However, Ford made a strong push to EVs with the Mustang Mach-E. Granted, automotive enthusiasts didn’t care for an SUV wearing the iconic Mustang badge. Still, demographic and consumer trends indicated that two-door pony cars were on their last legs. For F stock, the electric SUV just made business sense.
Over the long run, I believe Ford can capture significant market share from Tesla. After all, Ford is a car company first. They’ve been in the business for a long time and understand what motivates the automotive market. Further, the Ford dealership and service center empire is vast, providing superior support for customers. If you love contrarian thinking, you may want to give F stock a good look.

Nvidia (NVDA)

One of the true no-brainer investments among long-term stocks, Nvidia offers extensive exposure to relevant markets. First and foremost, the company is renowned for its advanced graphics processors, powering some of the most groundbreaking video game systems.
For those that are not familiar with the industry, video games have transitioned from niche consumer segment into a mainstream giant. As the coronavirus disruption demonstrated, games are no longer just for entertainment purposes. For example, racing simulators help Formula 1 drivers acclimate to tracks with which they’re not familiar. That has been even more crucial this year due to global shutdowns of live sporting events.
Additionally, Nvidia powers the future through various artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. An area of increasing competitiveness is autonomous driving. With so many players, it’s difficult to know which one will emerge victorious. But the underlying platforms will require advanced processors, which should boost demand for NVDA stock.


					7 Penny Stocks That Are Ready to Take Off				

Finally, connectivity solutions will pave the way for smart city infrastructures. Again, Nvidia finds itself as one of the leaders in this space, a market which will likely only grow in importance. Therefore, if you’re not worried about day-to-day price swings, keep NVDA stock in your drawer.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)

Joe Biden is hardly what you would call a perfect candidate. Although he has proven himself to be mentally fit, at his age, cobwebs have inevitably developed. And they’ve come out at some inopportune times. For instance, during the second and last presidential debate, President Trump hit him hard on his confused stance on fracking and other environmental issues.
Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, Biden must answer to the Democrats. Consistently, the party has pushed issues such as addressing climate change. Therefore, one of the logical long-term stocks to buy is Brookfield Renewable Partners. Clearly, Biden would not be popular within his own party if he broke rank and decided to go all fossil fuel on everybody.
Not surprisingly, BEP stock has put on a tremendous performance this year, gaining nearly 58% year-to-date. Further, the raging wildfires we suffered this year raises the importance of sustainability, which should bolster Brookfield.
But I don’t see BEP stock as being a catalyst levered exclusively to Democrats. The reality is that younger people care deeply about the environment. Therefore, the next generation of Republican leaders can’t afford to alienate whole swathes of voters. Ultimately, that’s great news for Brookfield and other sustainability oriented companies.

2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- “Competition is for losers.”That’s Peter Thiel talking, again and again, about his big rule for success.It means go where other people haven’t yet, something he famously did in the 1990s by co-founding PayPal Holdings Inc., and then even more famously, in the 2000s, by throwing $500,000 at a hoodied Harvard kid and something called TheFacebook.His iconoclastic streak has made Thiel a rich man -- richer than ever, in fact, with his data-mining company, Palantir Technologies Inc., soaring on the stock market. Today he’s worth $5.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.But if, after a point, money is just a way to keep score, even his latest coup with Palantir can’t disguise this fact: Peter Thiel may be one of the best investors in Silicon Valley, but his track record is decidedly mixed.The same against-the-grain approach that has paid off so handsomely, with early bets on SpaceX, Spotify Technology SA and Airbnb Inc. has also backfired spectacularly from time to time. Next to that Harvard kid, Mark Zuckerberg, Thiel’s fortune is a pittance. Zuckerberg is worth $104.1 billion while Elon Musk, another techno-contrarian whose initial fortune was born from PayPal, has a net worth of $102.9 billion, up $75 billion this year alone.Thiel didn’t respond to multiple emails and calls to a spokesperson requesting comment.His biggest win, Facebook Inc., was also his biggest miss. He sold most of his stake in 2012 through a prearranged stock-trading plan at an average price of less than $20 a share. His foray into hedge funds ended in disaster after he misread the global economy and the markets.Thiel founded Clarium Capital around the same time he sold out of PayPal. He started the hedge fund with $10 million, mostly his own money, and positioned it to profit off market swings caused by global events, placing bets in line with his contrarian worldview.Clarium initially thrived as several of Thiel’s predictions bore out, particularly the rising cost of oil and the collapse of the U.S. housing market. At its peak in mid-2008, the fund managed $7.2 billion.Read more: Clarium hedge fund shrinks 90% as Thiel has third losing yearBut in 2010 returns declined about 23%, its third-straight year of losses, as the economy recovered and oil slumped. Though some of his calls were broadly correct, his timing wasn’t. Clarium’s assets fell and Thiel ended up converting the fund into a private investment vehicle for primarily himself.“His principal failure was wanting to be proven right intellectually,” said Simon Kerr, publisher of industry newsletter Hedge Fund Insight. “It was a bit of hubris. His macroeconomic framework and concept were correct, but how it was affected in markets wasn’t.”A German-born lawyer by training, Thiel backed into a career as an investor, drawn by the opportunities to identify and solve problems. While a student at Stanford University, he latched on to the ideas of professor Rene Girard, a philosopher who claimed that humans form their desires based on what others want. In other words, by copying one another.Libertarian LeaningsThat premise has influenced his investment targets -- consider the user behavior on Facebook -- and shaped his heterodox thinking. He co-founded PayPal in the belief that people needed a form of payment that was convenient, secure and protected from government whims. But his professed libertarian leanings have at times clashed with his actions, such as his embrace of President Donald Trump in 2016 and his co-founding of Palantir, which relies on government contracts for much of its revenue.The company’s “software is mission critical to various U.S. agencies,” Morningstar Inc. analyst Mark Cash wrote in a note Monday. Palantir posted its first earnings report as a public company on Thursday and said it expects sales growth to slow next year. Still, the stock jumped 6.5% at 1:16 p.m. in New York and the shares have more than doubled since its September IPO.Read more: Palantir’s red-hot rally since election faces first big testThiel has also poured money into moonshot projects seemingly ripped from sci-fi films. He co-founded the Seasteading Institute, a nonprofit promoting the creation of man-made floating islands that are politically autonomous, and donated to a foundation focused on extending human lifespan “by making 90 the new 50,” according to its website. Confirming his pessimism about the world’s future, he bought property in New Zealand, a favorite among doomsday escapists.He also got back into finance, putting $100 million into Mithril Capital, an investment firm founded by a former Clarium employee that generated more headlines for its legal woes than its returns.Not all of his forays have been intended to make money. Yet even those that aren’t reflect a distinctly Thielian form of philanthropy, advocating nonconformist solutions for, as he sees it, an innovation-starved world stifled by politics and the misguided elite. His Thiel Foundation sponsors a fellowship that grants $100,000 to a student on the condition that they skip or drop out of college to “to build new things.”Facebook StakeHe was revealed to be the backer of Hulk Hogan’s successful invasion of privacy lawsuit against website Gawker in 2016. The jury awarded Hogan $140 million, bankrupting both the site and its founder, Nick Denton.Even his most successful investment is one he never fully realized. At the time of Facebook’s 2012 initial public offering, Thiel’s pre-offering stake was 2.5% and valued at $1.7 billion. That holding would today be worth $12.3 billion had Thiel, a board member, not sold more than a third of it in the IPO. He offloaded most of the remainder later that year.Yet there’s little evidence that wealth in and of itself is the goal for Thiel.“I think Peter is motivated genuinely by a certain curiosity, almost as if he’s moving pieces around on a chessboard,” said Ryan Holiday, author of “Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker and the Anatomy of Intrigue.”“You might not always agree with the moves, but it’s hard not to respect the boldness of the style.”(Updates with Palantir share price in 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Peter Thiel is Richer Than Ever as Tech Eclipses Macro Mess

2020-11-16,"Thematic exchange-traded funds are all the rage this year as investors pile into funds focusing on everything from fintech to sports betting to video games and much, much more.Such ETFs hauled in $2.5 billion already this month, putting the group on pace for $20 billion in 2020 year-to-date inflows, according to Bloomberg. The phenomenon is largely attributed to retail investors and the Robinhood crowd, but $20 billion is a big number to pin on smaller number investors.Even if that's all retail money (it's not), that figure implies professional investors are really missing out when it comes to fintech ETFs.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Now that Asia has stitched together the world’s biggest trading bloc, U.S. financial and tech firms ought to be more than a little worried. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, will bind the 10 economies of Southeast Asia with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, creating a prototype of what my colleague David Fickling describes as “a sort of Pax Sinica,” a Beijing-led global order.To provide a counterweight, the U.S. needs the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Donald Trump backed out four years ago.(1) Japan is keen for Joe Biden, as the next president, to reverse the exit. But the goal of a U.S. pivot to Asia can’t solely be to encircle China. The objective must be to establish rules for ownership and use of Asian consumers’ financial and e-commerce data, a commodity that is set to become more valuable in this century than perhaps even oil was in the last. The main risk to U.S. firms from Washington’s isolationism isn’t trade. Both as the world’s consumer of last resort and provider of the currency in which most things are bought and sold, the U.S. might retain enough leverage on global commerce. It can offer bilateral deals to important trading partners who’ll jump at the chance of getting easier access to the American market. But multilateral agreements like TPP are useful for establishing standards. That’s important when those are sorely lacking, which is the case for data, the raw material that consumers in Asia provide for free to the likes of Visa Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., as well as to Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Take the agreement on financial services in the new trade deal. It says that signatory nations will not prevent “transfers of data by electronic or other means, necessary for the conduct of the ordinary business of a financial service supplier in its territory.” However, in the two subsequent paragraphs, we learn that countries can still insist on local copies of records. They can also restrict cross-border transfers that flout their regulations on “personal data, personal privacy, and the confidentiality of individual records.” Ditto for electronic commerce: There are rules, but with broad escape hatches. A shopping website can freely send data overseas, and it won’t be required to maintain servers in the countries where it’s doing business. All of that can change if there’s a “legitimate public policy objective” or an “essential security interest.” If that wasn’t vague enough, e-commerce will only be brought under the RCEP’s proposed dispute settlement mechanism after a review. It’s a formula for endless delay, and even then, will only apply to countries that accept external adjudication. Anti-free-trade groups like bilaterals.org have noted that TPP’s stricter digital trade rules would have won more ironclad  guarantees for dominant tech companies. The RCEP has put a brake on that by tilting power back toward governments.But from a globalization perspective, this is America’s retreat from its historic standards-setting role in everything from accounting to food safety, a development that worries scholars like Evan Feigenbuam at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Silicon Valley firms should also be nervous. Their business model is to sell access to processed information — and its predictive power — again and again.As Columbia Law School professor Katharina Pistor argues in her paper, “Rule by Data: The End of Markets?”, Big Tech treats raw information as “wild animals: things that belong to no one but can be claimed by whoever catches them first.” This lawlessness can’t last. Governments are threatening to wield the stick, at least against the more egregious use of market power that comes from owning data. The European Union is investigating whether Amazon uses sales records of independent sellers to give an unfair advantage to its own retail arm. Potential fines can be as high as 10% of annual sales.Being in the driving seat of an accord like the TPP means that the U.S. can help write the rules. The diplomatic goal would be to strike a bargain: force U.S. tech and financial services firms to share a part of their supersize profit from algorithms with consumers both at home and overseas, while ensuring that trading partners don’t put arbitrary curbs on access, storage, transfer and processing of raw data. Should Washington not want to shoulder this responsibility, Beijing gladly will. Maybe not today, but in 10 years. And those rules, which will come into effect by closing (or not closing) the escape hatches of the RCEP, would be shared by 2.2 billion people. They would hardly favor U.S. interests.The cheerleaders of globalization obsessed over tariffs and non-tariff barriers and didn’t pay enough attention to the supply-chain revolution, most notably in China. To continue to view the world of trade from this outdated prism would once again cause the woods to be missed for the trees. Biden needs to bring the U.S. back to Asia, and for the right reason.(1) TPP was then modifiedto Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement between Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Mike Novogratz, famous for making the jump from Wall Street to cryptocurrencies, has regularly drawn a link between the global pandemic, financial stimulus and the allure of Bitcoin as a safe haven. “Now is the time to invest in Bitcoin,” his crypto firm Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. thundered in a newspaper ad in August. “I’d be much more nervous [about a price drop] if I thought we’re going to cure Covid and all of a sudden everyone’s going to be fiscally conservative,” Novogratz said at the time.He got one thing right. Bitcoin is now trading near $18,000, up almost 100% in six months and it’s flirting with an all-time high reached in 2017 (which, given it was followed by an ugly crash, faithful Bitcoiners would rather forget). Shares of Galaxy have done even better, rising by 380%. Total assets at Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the biggest trust provider in the cryptocurrency, have risen fourfold this year to $8.4 billion.But is this really being driven by people seeking protection from a more uncertain world? A Covid-19 vaccine is getting closer; Donald Trump, whose one-time adviser Steve Bannon cheered Bitcoin as part of a “global populist revolt,” is on his way out. Global equity markets are near all-time highs.If anything, Bitcoin looks much more like the stock market on steroids than it does a digital version of gold, which has barely budged since the end of October as confidence about a Covid cure has gradually improved. You can see why hedge fund skeptics like Ray Dalio are dubious of Bitcoin’s charms.The cryptocurrency’s recent above-average correlation with equities is fine when everything’s going up, but not in times of stress: In mid-March, for example, a flight to safety triggered by Covid cut Bitcoin’s price in half. A recent Kansas City Fed study comparing bonds, gold and Bitcoin between 1995 and Feb. 2020 found Treasuries behaved “consistently” as a safe haven, gold “occasionally” and Bitcoin “never.”Behind the talk of digital gold is the reality of an erratic, still-speculative asset with the potential for big price swings. Serious investor money is changing hands on crypto exchanges partly because a risky trading opportunity is in the air: Charismatic hedge fund convert Paul Tudor Jones compared Bitcoin to “investing in Google early.” Right behind the smart money are the excited retail punters who apparently used their $1,200 pandemic stimulus checks to buy Bitcoin.While digital payment firms such as PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. have launched Bitcoin applications, this price jump is not about people buying cappuccinos. Data from Chainalysis estimates merchants made up only about 1% of crypto activity in North America between mid-2019 and mid-2020, while exchanges accounted for almost 90%. In East Asia, the world’s biggest crypto market, Bitcoin trading is driven by Tether, a token used as a U.S. dollar stand-in that’s embroiled in a New York lawsuit over alleged covered-up losses.Crypto is still a heady bet on life-changing wealth, not a disruptor of how normal people use money.Hence the confusion of Dalio, who wondered this week if he was “missing something” after dubbing Bitcoin a bubble back in 2017. Nothing had fundamentally fixed Bitcoin’s weakness as a currency or store of value, he says, and if it ever became a threat to governments and central banks it would be keelhauled by regulators. He has a point: Bitcoin still looks like an asset with bubble-like price dynamics, exaggerated by the artificial scarcity of its 21-million supply cap and a “HODLing” mentality among its acolytes, who hoard an estimated 60% of outstanding coins.Sure, you could call a lot of things bubbles, including stock markets supercharged by Tesla Inc. and blank-check SPACs. But the unique power of Bitcoin hype is demonstrated when celebrities such as JK Rowling and Maisie Williams ask publicly for crypto tips on Twitter. The likes of Novogratz and Elon Musk are happy to offer bullish advice.Given this exuberance, does the 2020 price spike mean a 2021 crash? Not necessarily. But the forces that drive Bitcoin’s price aren’t as straightforward as its defenders insist. Novogratz feels this year is a milestone: “We’ve crossed the Rubicon … Bitcoin is now an asset,” he said in August. But it will take more than a second trip toward $20,000 to truly convince big banks and consumers that it’s a stable one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- In the seconds after headlines flashed an abrupt halt to what had been billed as the world’s biggest initial public offering, a chat shared by a group of Chinese friends exploded in disbelief. China had just delivered a public drubbing to billionaire Jack Ma, one of its most-revered entrepreneurs, days before his Ant Group Co. was to be listed.The friends on WeChat understood well the sweat, tears, and brazen audacity it had taken to build Ant into a financial-services juggernaut in less than two decades: They used to work there, after all. The listing, expected to value Hangzhou-based Ant at $315 billion, would have delivered a long-awaited payday to many current employees just as an earlier IPO had enriched the chat group members. Then regulators slammed on the brakes.One of the people on the WeChat group was Yuan Leiming, a 14-year Ant veteran who left the company in 2019. He recalls heading for Hangzhou and Shanghai, expecting IPO celebrations in both places. “Ant staff were promising to buy me dinner,” he says. “Now I have to buy them dinner to placate their wounded hearts.”Yuan is among three dozen Ant tong xue—classmates—who meet regularly, usually in Shanghai, and have formed a powerful alumni network. Many of them became millionaires after Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns about a third of Ant, went public in 2014; others sold their Ant options back to the company when it was valued at $150 billion two years ago. All resisted the urge to hold on for Ant’s IPO. For employees who did hang on, or who joined the company more recently, the suspension threw their plans for a bonanza up in the air.Perhaps the intervention from President Xi Jinping’s government was to be expected. Ten days before it happened, Ma took to a conference stage in Shanghai to deliver a stinging rebuke of regulations that stifled innovation. The company soon came in for a deluge of criticism on Chinese state media. Commentators faulted Ant for straying from its core payments business and called out Big Tech generally for misleading users to consume beyond their means. Guo Wuping, head of consumer protection at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said fintech companies used their market power to set exorbitant fees. QuickTake: Why China Changed the Rules on Jack Ma’s Ant GroupThree days before the planned listing, the China Securities Regulatory Commission summoned Ma to a conference room and informed him that Ant’s time as a beneficiary of relaxed government oversight and minimal capital requirements was over. Just before 9 p.m. the following day, the fintech company’s trading debut was suspended, with the securities regulator saying later that preventing a “hasty” listing while significant regulatory changes were afoot was a responsible move for potential investors.The Ant tong xue call their WeChat group “The Best Has Just Begun—Alipay Mafia,” the last bit a pointed reference to the moniker once hung on the founders of PayPal Holdings Inc., including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who left and went on to establish successful tech enterprises. The Ant veterans chose to use the know-how gained in building the company’s ubiquitous Alipay-app ecosystem to reshape pockets of Chinese business with their own startups.They took their cues from Ma, the charismatic onetime English teacher who’s achieved cult status in China not just because of his $54 billion fortune but also because of the combative culture he fostered across his e-commerce and financial-services empire.Ma has lauded the Chinese tech industry’s notorious 996 workweek—9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week—as “huge bliss,” a driving spirit crucial to a take-no-prisoners battle that disrupted the powerful state-owned monopolies’ control over the economy. In the early days, when Alipay operated in a legal gray zone—private companies were technically not allowed in finance—Ma encouraged his employees to press on, telling them, “If someone has to go to jail, I’ll go.”Over the years, Ant and its alumni were hugely influential in reimagining China’s financial plumbing. Now, as Ma navigates once more the boundaries a communist state can impose upon private enterprise, these Antrepreneurs—almost all men—are learning new lessons, particularly about the systemically sensitive realm of finance, where fresh rules are being crafted to curb Ant and companies like it. Here are three of their stories.The Golden BoyA business management graduate of Shanghai’s elite Fudan University, Bill Deng joined Ant in 2010 after working for Visa Inc. in Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. He soon became a favorite of Chairman Eric Jing, who directed him to focus on competitive pricing for Alipay’s services: Before Alipay expanded into the fintech giant that is now Ant, it was a scrappy online payments company trying to onboard merchants.That put Deng in regular contact with small-business owners in industries from finance to gaming to e-commerce. Immersing himself in the Yangtze and Pearl River delta regions where Chinese export manufacturers cluster, he gained insight into the challenges of operating cross-border businesses without the support of a global payments infrastructure. China’s internet boom, which would eventually fuel Alibaba’s growth into a $700 billion behemoth, was just beginning.By 2017, talk of an imminent IPO abounded. Gatherings of Ant employees—at after-work dinners, during two-minute cigarette breaks—became opportunities for staff to trade their startup aspirations, Deng says, though Ant’s “golden handcuffs” prevented most from acting on their dreams. Flush with stock options, Deng timed his departure strategically. “I figured that if I waited until Ant listed to create my own startup, I would be competing with an exodus of extremely talented Ant staff,” he says. “If I did it early, most of these people would still be working at Ant, which could provide me a network of strong allies.”Later that year, he and five former colleagues founded XTransfer Ltd., which handles cross-border financial transactions for small and medium-size businesses. The venture built on Deng’s experience of spearheading expansion in Thailand and on his relationships at work. “Ant pretty much corralled all the top talent there was in China fintech,” he says. “I was working with these men side by side in the trenches.”XTransfer works with about 80,000 clients, mostly in China, helping them adhere to international standards against money laundering and terrorism financing. It’s also built a global, low-cost payments network that lets buyers transact in their local currency and enables merchants to be paid within 24 hours—a service banks rarely offer small companies directly. The company has raised at least $30 million from investors including the Alibaba-backed Electronic World Trade Platform initiative and Beijing-based Gaorong Capital; XTransfer was valued at more than $500 million in 2019.Deng, 39, says having his own startup has helped him generate 10 times more wealth than he would have if he’d stayed at Ant. But that doesn’t mean he’s put his former boss behind him. “Jack Ma once said that he wanted to make sure even the janitor had company options,” Deng says. He got the message: At XTransfer, even the front-desk clerk has stock options.The PioneerOne of Deng’s role models is Yuan Leiming, a product pioneer in the mold of Silicon Valley explorers such as iPod creator Tony Fadell. A Peking University law major, Yuan, now 44, gained a reputation at Ant for meticulous planning and for his audacity in striking out into new areas of business.Yuan spearheaded Ant’s online-payments infrastructure, as well as its Yu’ebao money-market fund, which grew into the world’s biggest within five years of its launch by appealing to hundreds of millions of mom-and-pop savers. In the early years, Yuan worked alongside Ma himself, negotiating collaborations with China’s largest banks, cementing Ant’s role as a matchmaker shaking up the old ties between borrowers and lenders.Even before leaving Ant in 2019–and with Ant’s blessing, as there was no conflict of interest–Yuan zeroed in on transforming how Chinese pay for higher education. In China, tuition, though a fraction of what U.S. universities charge, is still unaffordable for many. “There’s something fundamentally wrong with the concept of student loans,” Yuan says. “We need to invest in ourselves most when we are young, but that burden falls predominantly on the family.”Yuan, who gets around by subway and rents bikes when he travels, persuaded a dozen current and former Ant colleagues to put a total of $7 million into a blockchain-based charity called Justsure that he believes can be a model alternative in the student loan market. Built atop Ant’s blockchain, justsure.com supports prospective students based on need, not academic excellence. Borrowers who end up making more than $18,000 a year are expected to repay their loans to the nonprofit at no more than 5% of their salary. If they don’t honor their commitment, they could be blacklisted by the government and deprived of certain rights, including air travel.“We are applying essentially a venture capital model to nurturing talent,” Yuan says. He expects just a small percentage of extremely successful students to account for the majority of repayments, not unlike the VC model of relying on a small number of winners to generate big returns.The Risk GuruTang Kewei researched artificial intelligence applications in finance during his Ph.D. studies at the University of Nottingham in England. He later moved to London with Barclays Plc as a data scientist concentrating on machine learning and AI. As China’s entrepreneurial scene thrived, Tang was bitten by the startup bug but worried he was out of touch after 12 years in the U.K. When Ant recruited globally in 2015 for a chief risk control officer for its fledgling internet bank, he jumped at the chance.At Ant’s MYbank, he built tools to analyze the risk of financing businesses in China’s rural heartland, then a greenfield market that would rapidly become heavily contested. The weight of expectation within the company was immense, Tang says, with senior executives counting on Ant’s expansion into the countryside to drive its valuation to 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion).“I thought working for a global foreign bank was already stressful, only to find out work hours at Ant were even more intense,” says the 41-year-old, who still often works well past midnight. “It was like fighting a war every day.”Sometimes a single business-development team would be pursuing as many as five initiatives simultaneously. It was common, Tang recalls, to find frontline salespeople arguing with back-end and support teams over differences in vision, banging their fists on tables or calling people out for underperformance in front of their bosses. “Some ‘sea turtles’ couldn’t stand it and left,” he says, using a colloquial term that describes Chinese people who return home after overseas educations. “To some it seemed like a lack of planning, but Ant was like that, always embracing change.”Tang and Yuan Leiming became friends at Ant, working together to build risk-control models for bank loan issuance and explore new businesses. They still catch up at dinner, nowadays to share insights on their startup lives.Tang left Ant three years ago to create Fullink Technology Co., which uses deep learning and image-recognition technology to build risk controls for companies in niche markets. Fullink has raised at least $10 million from BlueRun Ventures and Source Code Capital. In one of its projects, his team is working with a state-owned entity to create tools to evaluate the creditworthiness of cattle farmers in China’s northeast. In another, it’s joining hands with a city government to incorporate municipal data such as pension contributions, taxes, and utilities into a credit-scoring service.“Some sectors in rural finance are too niche for a giant like Ant,” Tang says. “It also needs partners like us to open up new markets.”China has changed profoundly since Ma, backed by $60,000, started Alibaba.com in 1999 as a business-to-business marketplace. A slowdown in economic growth, along with the pandemic, has created challenges as well as opportunities. The bruising back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing has choked the free flow of capital from American endowment and pension funds that used to nurture young Chinese startups. Boosted most recently by the advent of 5G and AI, challengers to Ma’s empire—and to his giant rivals, such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.—have multiplied dramatically in the two decades since he showed that business territories once dominated by powerful Chinese state-owned firms can be reshaped.And yet, as the slap-down of the Ant IPO illustrates, an age-old test hasn’t gone away: reading the Beijing tea leaves. Even as the world’s second-largest economy opens its markets and produces global technology champions, the Communist Party’s grip on power hasn’t loosened and the issues of social and financial stability are nailed to the top of Xi’s agenda.With the shock of the regulators’ rebuke to Ma still fresh, someone on the Alipay Mafia WeChat group shared a meme showing how the government is cutting Ant down to size, one rule at a time. The phrase pan ta—rein him in—was joined to an emoji of an animated cartoon character’s bottom being scrubbed over and over.Not so fast, says Tang: “This thing is not a thing.” Don’t underestimate Ma, the tong xue, or any of his legions of tech disciples. “Ant folks,” Tang says, “are super tenacious.”Chen covers investing for Bloomberg News in Hong Kong. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Ant Alumni Who Cashed Out Before IPO Flop Have Big Ambitions

2020-11-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Pandemic-driven lockdowns, shuttered malls and stuck-at-home consumers have hurt retailers in 2020 as Covid-19 ravaged the economy. With Black Friday almost underway, equity traders are bracing for a holiday season where brick-and-mortar businesses that lack strong digital platforms could suffer.For the first time ever, more consumers intend to shop online than in stores, a Deloitte survey shows. U.S. online holiday sales will total $189 billion, shattering all previous records with a 33% boost from last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s equal to two years’ growth in one season.“This year is unlike anything else,” said Ken Perkins, president and founder of Retail Metrics. “People are going to be really adverse to come into stores on Black Friday, so traffic will be relatively more modest. Curbside pick will be extremely important this holiday season. Impulse buying will also fall off as online shopping tends to be very targeted.”Mall-based retailers have been among the most battered stocks of 2020 amid rapid changes in consumer behavior as lockdowns resulted in less need for some items and accelerated the shift toward e-commerce and away from physical stores.But with promising vaccine trial results coming through, signaling consumers might be ready to go back to the mall, retail stocks have been soaring. The S&P 1500 Apparel Retail Index erased its pandemic-spurred losses earlier this month, while the S&P 1500 Retailing Index hit a record high in October.Here’s a look at some potential stock winners and losers in an unprecedented holiday shopping season. Year-to-date stock performance follows each name.ElectronicsWith the release of new Xbox and PlayStation devices, gaming consoles are coveted and will be “almost impossible to get your hands on,” Perkins said. In addition, home-related electronics will be extremely popular.Electronics like personal computers, televisions, tablets and virtual-reality accessories have also been in high demand, according to a recent data analysis from NPD Group/Retail Tracking Service.Key stocks: Best Buy Co. (+30%), Rent-a Center Inc. (+24%), Aaron’s Holdings Co. (+13%), Conn’s Inc. (-7.3%) and Acco Brands Corp. (-13%).ToysPandemic spending earlier this year, won’t hold parents back from holiday shopping. They are likely to spend “the same or more” on toys this season, according to DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser, who cited research done by Mattel Inc.‘s executives.“The pandemic did not represent a pull-forward of holiday demand,” Weiser said. Furthermore, Mattel’s core brands probably added shelf space as retailers are “filling their aisles with traditional evergreen brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels” because there are fewer toys this year that are based on entertainment properties.Key stocks: Mattel (+16%), Hasbro Inc. (-13%), Amazon.com Inc. (+72%), Walmart Inc. (+28%) and Target Corp. (+40%).Home GoodsThe boom in suburban living has resulted in strong sales at home furnishing companies. “Even with the vaccine coming, people are moving out of the city, into the burbs, and they need to fill their homes,” Perkins at Retail Metrics said.Williams-Sonoma Inc. said on a recent call that demand for its products had continued into November, while TJX Cos. executives said on its third-quarter call that HomeGoods will be “one of the healthiest divisions” moving into the new year.Key stocks: Williams-Sonoma (+53%) and TJX (+2.9%).E-commerce & FintechOnline transactions are likely to continue to surge as Covid-19 cases rise globally, and with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling shopping in crowded stores during the holiday period a “higher risk” activity.Read more: Virus Spreads Out Black Friday Shopping, Puts Digital at ForeInternet retail names that target a more affluent consumer also stand to gain, KeyBanc said in its holiday outlook report. In addition, companies that have added customers during the pandemic could convert them into holiday shoppers, while others are well positioned to steal market share from struggling retailers if lockdowns continue.Key stocks: Square Inc. (+240%) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (+98%), Farfetch Ltd. (+417%), Nordstrom Inc. (-33%), Peloton Interactive Inc. (+276%), Etsy Inc. (+228%), Amazon, Walmart and Target.Lockdown HurdlesDepartment store retailers will face hurdles this holiday season, according to several Wall Street analysts. All department stores saw “steep” drops in online traffic ahead of Thanksgiving, said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky, while Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal said early Black Friday sales and holiday shopping would give department stores “a much-needed boost.”Cleveland Research was turning cautious on the holiday outlook for department stores, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Matthew Boss recently cut fourth-quarter same-store sales estimates to below-consensus levels. Meanwhile, Marshal Cohen, NPD’s chief industry adviser for retail expects fashion and beauty categories to be “faced with the challenge of making up lost ground in hopes of a healthy finish to 2020.”Key stocks: Macy’s Inc.

2020-11-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin plunged on Thursday in a sell-off that saw other digital assets fall more than 20%, a slide likely to stoke speculation about the durability of the latest boom in cryptocurrencies.The largest token fell as much as 14% in Thursday trading, heading for one of its worst days since the pandemic-spurred liquidation in March.The rout began just hours after Bitcoin rose to within $7 of its record high of $19,511, the culmination of a more than 250% surge in past nine months. Fears over tighter crypto regulation and profit-taking after a frenetic rally were among the reasons cited for the sudden drop.The sell-off gathered pace late Wednesday after Coinbase Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong tweeted about speculation the U.S. is considering new rules that would undermine anonymity in digital transactions.“News that the Trump administration may clamp down on crypto might have been a trigger for the drop,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of Nexo in London, which bills itself as the world’s biggest digital-coin lender. “But any asset that rallies 75% in 2 months and 260% from the March lows is allowed to undergo a correction.”Other coins including XRP tumbled as much as 27%, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.After garnering more support from Wall Street money managers and fund providers, the rally in cryptocurrencies had looked over-heated. The fierce retreat could stir yet another debate over the their value in diversifying portfolios.“Conditions are very massively overbought and bound for a correction,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore. “So I don’t think it’s unusual.”Crypto believers tout purchases by retail investors, institutions and even billionaires, as well as the search for a hedge against dollar weakness amid the pandemic, as reasons why the boom can last.Skeptics argue the cryptocurrency’s famed volatility portends a repeat of what happened three years ago, when a bubble burst spectacularly. Some see signs of retail investors piling in to chase momentum for fast gains, storing up an inevitable reckoning.Concern about potential U.S. crypto rules help explain Thursday’s price drop across most major digital assets, said Ryan Rabaglia, global head of trading at OSL brokerage in Hong Kong.“It’s also not unusual to see a short-term pullback following periods of significant, accelerated gains as traders look to take profits before resetting once volatility subsides,” he said. “Once the dust settles, we’re back to business as usual with all medium to long-term bullish indicators still in play.”Proponents of digital assets say the current focus on cryptocurrencies compared with three years ago is different because of growing institutional interest, for instance from the likes of Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase & Co.Just this week, Van Eck Associates Corp. launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra exchange. In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. said it would allow its customers access to cryptocurrencies.There is also a buzz around Ethereum, the most-actively used blockchain in the world, which is set for a network upgrade that would allow it to process a similar number of transactions as Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. The shift to the new system could curb the total supply of Ether, whose price has quadrupled so far this year.Luno’s Ayyar said he expects Bitcoin to stabilize and achieve all-time highs. But that would be followed by a larger drop in the cryptocurrency, he said.Soravis Srinawakoon, chief executive of Bangkok-based Band Protocol, said the plunge in crypto was healthy.“This is just a normal pull back after seven weeks straight of Bitcoin in the green, due to many people over-leveraging.”(Updates prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Plunges Along With Other Coins

However, over the past month, the stock increased by 12.90%, and in the past year, by 97.86%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 2.77%.  The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

2020-11-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin and many of its major peers slumped on Friday in the wake of some of the biggest declines since the onset of the pandemic, a selloff that has stirred fresh doubt about this year’s craze for cryptocurrencies.The most-traded digital coin slid 3.1% to $16,522.61 at 11:05 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index extended a two-day plunge to about 19% -- its biggest since mid-March. The rout was kicked off by worries over the prospect of tighter crypto rules in the U.S. and profit-taking after a big rally, investors said. Even with the slump, Bitcoin has more than doubled this year -- an advance that has split opinion.Crypto believers tout a broadening investor base and the search for a hedge against dollar weakness as reasons for a durable boom. Critics point to a history of big swings, including a spectacular boom and bust three years ago.“We will see some choppy water in the short term as the market finds new levels before attempting another assault on the all-time high” said crypto analyst Jason Dean at Quantum Economics. “The pullback so far would not concern experienced Bitcoin traders or holders to any significant degree.”Read more: Bitcoin Fights Back With Power, Speed and Millions of UsersProponents of digital assets say the current focus on cryptocurrencies compared with 2017 is different because of growing institutional interest, for instance from the likes of Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Just this week, Van Eck Associates Corp. launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra exchange. In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. said it would allow customers access to cryptocurrencies.FOMO“After big rallies in shares and various other assets, they are all vulnerable to a bit of a pause,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “Bitcoin more than most, as it surged higher far more and had become far more frothy with speculative interest.”Others see signs of retail investors piling in to chase momentum for fast gains, storing up an inevitable reckoning. The rout in Bitcoin began just hours after it rose to within $7 of its record high of $19,511 set in December 2017.Profit-taking was inevitable and there are still factors in favor of Bitcoin as an asset class, according to Byron Goldberg in Sydney, who runs the Australian operations for Luno, the cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform.“It continues to attract both institutional and retail attention as a 21st-century substitute to the gold play,” he said.Crypto ‘Whales’A few large holders often referred to as whales own most Bitcoin. About 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control 95% of the digital asset, according to researcher Flipside Crypto. That structure points to the risk of big price swings if major investors offload some of their stakes.“Bitcoin may be a victim of its own success,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Plc in Sydney. “Traders suggested several large holders moved to lock in gains as the cryptocurrency reached for all-time highs.”AMP Capital’s Oliver said the depth of the recent plunge shows Bitcoin is “hardly a secure store of value,” adding it may be vulnerable if Covid-19 vaccines lead to a sharp global recovery next year.“Money printing and the debasement of paper currencies that Bitcoin enthusiasts are seeking to protect against may start to fade as an issue,” Oliver said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Extends Decline After Biggest Slump Since Pandemic Hit

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Libra Association, a cryptocurrency project started by Facebook Inc. that drew regulatory blowback worldwide, is hoping a new name offers a fresh chance to win over regulators and gain a foothold in the emerging market.The group will now be known as Diem Association, named for the word “day” in Latin, with its subsidiary Diem Networks serving as the payment system operator. It’s readying a currency that will be called the Diem Dollar.“We like the connotation of it kind of being a new day for the project,” the group’s chief executive officer, Stuart Levey, said in an interview. “We wanted a new start.”Almost immediately after Libra launched in June 2019, politicians and regulators raised concerns about the effort. They worried about privacy, money laundering and companies like Facebook taking power away from central banks. Supporters like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Visa Inc. fled the project, which initially hoped to attract 100 members before launch.The new Diem, which has 27 participants today, has abandoned the 100-member goal by launch and is taking things more slowly. The group plans to issue a stablecoin -- a digital currency pegged to an outside asset -- that’s tied to the U.S. dollar. Later, Diem may pursue additional fiat-based cryptocurrencies, Levey said.Initially, Libra had proposed creating a cryptocurrency supported by a basket of government-issued fiat currencies and securities.The group no longer needs 100 members to launch, though it’s still hoping to expand its ranks, Levey said.The association also no longer plans to eventually transition to a so-called permissionless blockchain, which would have let anyone participate in verifying transactions.Other inner workings of the project may have changed as well. Levey declined to comment on whether investors in the association will end up receiving a special governance coin, as per an earlier plan.With the project’s ambitions scaled down, its appeal may have dwindled. There’s plenty of competition from existing U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, such as Tether and USD Coin. One rival, called Celo Dollar, is also governed by an association, which attracted many of the same companies that initially flocked to Libra.Facebook has more than 2 billion users, some of whom may be persuaded to give Diem a try. But the social-networking giant has previously worked to distance itself from Libra. In May, it renamed its Calibra blockchain group Novi to make it sound less like Libra.The Novi team is building a digital wallet that will eventually hold Diem coins, Levey said.The Diem effort is waiting to be issued a license by Swiss regulators to launch, Levey said. Diem is also in talks with U.S. federal and state regulators, but isn’t waiting for any specific licenses or approvals from them, he said.To satisfy regulators, Diem’s system will honor Western sanctions and regulatory reporting requirements.“All of these design features we think make for a project we think that regulators will welcome,” Levey said, adding that he hopes central banks may wish to use the infrastructure in the future to issue their own digital currencies.(Updates with CEO’s comment in seventh paragraph.

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. has had a monster year in almost every way. The video-conferencing upstart got a huge boost in the spring amid Covid-induced lockdowns, and it’s still a must-have for many as the resurgent pandemic reinforces stay-at-home habits and remote-work trends. Sales and profit have consistently beat estimates every quarter, and the company keeps raising its guidance.The latest numbers continued the trend. Zoom late Monday reported fiscal third-quarter financial results that beat the Wall Street consensus, including a more than fourfold rise in sales from a year earlier, and it raised forecasts again. But Zoom shares fell about 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release, a different reaction than in prior quarters.It’s understandable. The stock is already up an astounding 600% this year, including 47% alone since its prior earnings release. The higher Zoom’s valuation rises, the more that’s needed for even diehard bulls to add to their positions. And the positive developments on Covid-19 vaccines give less of a reason to bet on Zoom benefiting from a longer outbreak. All that said, Zoom’s long-term prospects remain strong and may prove durable beyond the pandemic.  Zoom, the leader in its field, has become synonymous with video-conferencing the way Kleenex is another word for tissue, and the company continues to win market share for its ease of use and reliability. Last week, social media was filled with grateful Zoom Thanksgiving posts, many expressing gratitude toward the company for lifting its 40-minute meeting limit during the holiday. It is likely people will continue to use Zoom to stay in touch with friends and family even when the Covid-19 crisis subsides.In terms of business clientele, the work-from-home trend could be a lasting structural shift. Last week, PayPal Holdings Inc. CEO Dan Schulman told Bloomberg Television the pandemic has spawned changes that could permanently favor remote work. The executive expects the “vast majority” of his workforce to work from home at least a couple of days a week. It also may take longer than expected for the vaccines to roll out. Schulman said it could be late summer 2021 or early fall before PayPal asks its employees to return to physical offices.Schulman isn’t alone among business leaders predicting such changes. Earlier this month at the New York Times DealBook conference, Bill Gates said he expects that more than 50% of business travel and more than 30% of days in the office will “go away.” I agree with that sentiment. Business behavior and its norms are vastly different from pre-Covid-19 era. In most instances, a video conference call will now suffice for the in-person sales meetings that were often required pre-pandemic. This new standard bodes well for Zoom.It’s been a heck of a year for Zoom. Its stock isn’t cheap, trading at nearly 45 times next year’s estimated 12-month sales after its big rally this year. But the technology market is typically a winner-take-all or winner-take-most proposition for category leaders such as Zoom. If the company can continue to dominate its space for years to come, Zoom can grow into its valuation. As of now, there are no signs it will give up its No. 1 position anytime soon.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

However, I expect the company to come out of this crisis unscathed and for its stock to recover.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In the meantime, it’s an excellent opportunity for investors to scoop up BABA stock at a discount.
BABA stock is currently trading at $276, roughly 13% lower than its value in late October. Analyst estimates for the stock are almost 22% higher than its current stock price. Additionally, its forward PE ratio is at 24.4, which is significantly lower than its peer group average of 292.


					7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar				

Despite posting an earnings surprise in each of the past four quarters, BABA stock remains undervalued. The recent episode with Ant Group has further pushed down its value presenting a rare chance for investors to get on the BABA train.
Another Strong Quarter
With greater consumer spending and e-commerce recovery, Alibaba’s second-quarter results remained strong. Revenues rose 30% year-over-year to $22.84 billion, along with a 37% increase in its earnings per share.
Additionally, non-GAAP net income was at $6.9 billion, from the $6.74 billion it made in the first quarter. Retail active consumers also improved sequentially to 757 million from 742 million in the first quarter, along with 881 million mobile monthly users.
Moreover, the company’s cloud business reported a 60% year-over-year increase of $2.19 billion. Demand remains stable, but it’s still operating at a loss, which should turn a profit by the end of the fiscal year. In August, the company launched three new data centers with a $28 billion investment in cloud infrastructure for over three years.
With a long-term growth forecast of over 25% and China’s booming online shopping industry, expect Alibaba to continue its growth story. Moreover, political tensions are also expected to ease with the election of Joe Biden as the President-elect of the United States.
Hence, the bilateral policy’s predictability between China and the USA could be a tailwind for the company’s progression.
Moreover, the company recently launched two of its 11.11 shopping festivals, drawing “hundreds of millions” of consumers in the company’s words.
The Ant Group Conundrum
Ant stock’s much-anticipated listing on China’s stock exchanges was halted after Jack Ma, Alibaba’s co-founder, criticized its financial regulators.
In his speech at a government forum last month, he talked about how the country needed a new financial platform for those with insufficient collateral. Ant was expected to have a valuation of over $300 million, making it the most lucrative IPO in history.
Earlier this month, The Chinese financial regulators set new draft rules for online micro-lenders, including Ant. It directly impacts Ant’s CreditTech segment, which accounts for roughly 40% of its revenues.
The move will impact the company’s loan growth and return on equity. Ant has been on a roll of late with a 38% growth in revenues in the first half of 2020. Such numbers are comparable to established Fintech companies such as Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).
Alibaba has a 33% stake in the company, and a successful listing could have opened the door for more IPOs for its affiliate companies. Additionally, getting on the wrong side of the Chinese authorities is not a good idea either.
It will be interesting to see how the situation develops, but, likely, it won’t affect Alibaba in the near-term. Its core business remains strong, and its non-core business, such as its cloud segments, continues to grow impressively.
Bottom Line on BABA Stock
Alibaba’s investors have had a few things to consider, but it seems that they are blowing things out of proportion. Ant Group’s IPO delay and the new restrictions are noteworthy, but they shouldn’t impact its near-term performance.
Alibaba needs to assess the situation with Ant Group and its regulatory troubles. Apart from that, its core and non-core businesses are doing incredibly well, and its stock is trading at significantly lower than mean estimates. Therefore, it’s best to grab BABA stock at this time.

2020-12-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Jamie Dimon appears restless. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief executive officer is imploring investment bankers — those most tireless of salespeople — to ring him up and pitch M&A ideas. It’s the clearest indication yet that the biggest U.S. bank would prefer not to sit on its excess capital. That’s a nice problem to have, but one the lender is struggling to solve. The worry is that this pushes it toward a transaction at any cost.Barred by regulators from buying back stock because of the pandemic and from acquiring a deposit-taking institution in the U.S. because of its size, the Wall Street giant could look to expand in commercial banking outside its domestic market.When asked if he’d take a look at a European lender, Dimon has said — correctly — that it makes little sense for the world’s most profitable bank to add branches in such a fiercely competitive market, where returns are barely half what JPMorgan makes. Instead, he’s reportedly looking at starting a digital bank in the U.K. He may even try to buy an upstart British challenger, Starling Bank, according to some press reports. But that would be small fry.In Asia, acquiring a lender such as Standard Chartered Plc might propel JPMorgan into higher-growth emerging markets, but taking on the balance-sheet risk and the difficulty in integrating vastly different business cultures would be hard at the best of times. The pandemic just adds to the perils.Elsewhere, there’s not much point expanding JPMorgan’s capital-intensive investment banking businesses. There’s only so much growth the firm can tap into to put its abundant reserves to work. Over the next year, investment bank activity is expected to shrink after a blockbuster 2020. While the industry remains fragmented, JPMorgan’s dominant trading unit already has an outsize share of many markets. Hedge funds and other big clients might not be so keen on yet more exposure to one firm.That leaves Dimon with two natural areas of expansion: fintech and asset management. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital payments, a business Dimon regrets not having built up sooner. Unfortunately for him, soaring fintech valuations mean large acquisitions would be expensive. Shares in Square Inc., for example, have jumped more than fivefold since March. PayPal Holdings Inc.’s 78% price rise since February and JPMorgan’s 11% decline has closed the valuation gap between the two from about $285 billion to roughly $120 billion.Better to wait for the reopening of economies and see whether there’s a readjustment of prices among payment providers.Asset management valuations might be more attractive. Prices aren’t far off their five-year average, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, even after Morgan Stanley’s Eaton Vance acquisition and Macquarie Group Ltd.’s purchase of Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., which both pushed BI’s forward price-earnings multiple for large-cap asset managers up to about 15.6 times.For JPMorgan’s $2.6 trillion asset manager, smaller acquisitions may be easier than adding real scale. It could expand its private-market business, a pocket of growth as yields remain depressed. Or it could target passive investment. The bank only ranks 10th in exchange-trade funds in the U.S. Societe Generale SA wants to sell its Lyxor fund manager, which runs about $180 billion and has about 7% of the European fund ETF market. While that might be nice to have, it wouldn’t be a big enough deal to solve Dimon’s capital problem.The trouble for JPMorgan — now outside the top-five asset managers — is that there are few feasible takeovers that would put it in the top three, other than State Street Corp. Many of the bigger managers are either privately owned or part of larger companies. It’s not clear they would be for sale at a compelling price. Taking over State Street would put JPMorgan on the ETF map alongside Vanguard and BlackRock Inc., though regulators may object.With three large mergers under his belt as CEO, Dimon knows what dealmaking entails. The lure of sealing another one before his eventual retirement shouldn’t cloud his better judgment.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Elisa Martinuzzi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering finance.

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A coalition of states is suing to try to break up Facebook Inc. — the latest event to call the company's future into question. If Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust ordeal is at all analogous — over three years from suit to settlement — it could be a long time before the outcome of all this is known. And it could be years more until we see the ultimate impact on Facebook.For investors in the social media company's stock, the future might look different from the kind of innovation and industry dominance we've seen over the past decade. But it could still turn out well for shareholders if the company's focus shifts more toward optimizing its operations for near-term profitability with an emphasis on financial engineering.Despite its enviable growth rate and online advertising duopoly with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook's stock has a relatively pedestrian valuation. While there's considerable uncertainty about how economic growth will play out next year, Facebook shares are valued at around 24.5 times adjusted earnings estimated for 2021, compared with the S&P 500 as a whole trading at 21 or 22 times 2021 earnings estimates. Facebook's multiple is lower than companies like Walmart Inc. or Coca-Cola Co., perhaps suggesting that a fair amount of regulatory risk is already built into the stock.Of the various possible outcomes of Facebook's antitrust challenges, one might be that it remains a company whose core advertising business is secure, while its ability to encroach on emerging fields is limited. That's arguably what happened with Microsoft, which famously missed out on the internet, social media and smartphones in the 2000s while its core cash cows of Windows and Office remained intact. Despite being sidelined during all that innovation, Microsoft's revenues grew from $15.3 billion in 1998 to $60.4 billion in 2008. In the same way, a less innovative Facebook is still likely to reap years of revenue growth from riding the secular trend in digital advertising growth.So while a breakup of the company — however likely that might be — would be humiliating for Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and strip him of power, it could be a value-creating event for shareholders similar to the split of EBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Facebook shareholders would get shares in the separated entities: the main social network referred to as Facebook Blue, as well as Instagram and/or Whatsapp. Blue could be to Facebook what eBay’s marketplace business was to eBay, a slow-growth business that generates a lot of profit. Blue is also the business line that gets the company in the most trouble with respect to political and controversial content. If it were split off from the rest of the company, it could institute a dividend and focus on cash generation and stock buybacks. With interest rates as low as they are, the company could even borrow tens of billions of dollars at cheap interest rates to opportunistically buy back more shares, similar to what Apple has done in recent years.Meanwhile, growth-centric investors could get access to faster-growing, undermonetized Instagram and Whatsapp without the messiness of Facebook Blue. Both companies seem on the verge of doing a better job of generating revenue from their platforms, with Whatsapp showing particular promise in countries like India. And as the businesses mature, they, too, could get into the dividend and buyback game.Facebook doesn't need any more world-changing innovations for its stock to work for investors. While emerging platforms like TikTok and Snapchat are growing ad revenue, and Amazon has developed a multibillion-dollar ad platform, there's no evidence that Facebook is in any danger of seeing its network fade away anytime soon.If innovation-focused investors get skittish about antitrust risks and dump Facebook's stock, value investors should be there to pick it up, with the investment case tied more to returning capital to shareholders than taking over the world. That's the kind of win both Wall Street and Washington could get behind.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Buying Expertus will allow IBM to help banking clients meet those challenges while controlling expenses and complying with regulatory requirements, he said.“Payments represent a very profitable part of their franchise, and they want to continue to ensure they hold onto and not see erosion in that business in this new digital-banking environment,” Ramamurthy said in an interview.More than 1,000 banks, credit unions, regulatory agencies and corporations use Expertus’s payment platform.

2020-12-16,"On Wednesday, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $228.52.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-24  * Strike Price: $240.00  * Volume: 10338  * Open Interest: 446Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For December 7, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Now that Bitcoin has topped $20,000 for the first time, should you shift your hard-earned cash into digital currencies? History suggests caution should be your watchword, no matter how strong the fear of missing out may be.News on Wednesday that One River Asset Management has set up a fund company that will have about $1 billion in Bitcoin and fellow digital coin Ether by early next year suggests that institutional investors are starting to take cryptocurrencies more seriously.There’s clearly serious money involved. Chief Executive Officer Eric Peters told our Bloomberg News colleague Erik Schatzker that billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard is buying a stake in the new business, called One River Digital Asset Management.But before you race to open a digital wallet, look back to what happened to Bitcoin last time it approached these levels. A surge of 1,000% in 2017 took its value to $19,000. A year later, it had dropped to less than $3,500.Hedge fund managers can afford to dabble in crypto. The language Peters used to describe the trade is the stuff of macro hedge fund shop talk, such as the “convexity” of volatile trades that soar in relation to other indicators like interest rates. That’s reminiscent of other wealthy investors climbing aboard the bandwagon, such as Paul Tudor Jones, who compared Bitcoin to “investing in Google early.” Even if they get burned on a big bet, it’s money they won’t miss.But the Robinhood crowd — retail investors who may have made out like bandits this year by trading U.S. stocks from their sofas —should beware a bonfire of their vanities. While Bitcoin is great as a billionaire’s speculative plaything, it’s hardly a useful digital currency or safe haven investment for the average punter. Few people are going to buy pizza or coffee using a method of exchange that is capable of falling almost 50% in U.S. dollar terms in a matter of days, as it did in March when Covid-19’s first wave hit the West.Even as payments companies like PayPal Holdings Inc. or Square Inc. strive to bring Bitcoin trading to the masses, very few merchants directly touch the stuff. Data from Chainalysis estimates merchants made up only about 1% of cryptocurrency activity in North America between mid-2019 and mid-2020, while exchanges accounted for almost 90%.None of this bothers the champions of “digital gold,” who push the narrative that Bitcoin serves as some kind of metaphorical mattress under which everyone should stuff rapidly depreciating dollars or euros.But how safe is this safe haven? A study by the Kansas City Fed comparing bonds, gold and Bitcoin between 1995 and Feb. 2020 found that Treasuries behaved “consistently” as a safe haven, gold did so “occasionally” and Bitcoin got a “never.”The artificial scarcity that underpins Bitcoin — from its mining algorithm to the behavior of HODLers, who refuse to abandon their investment no matter how low it goes — helps push its price higher in the boom times; it does nothing to prevent a tumble when whales cash out. Those who follow in the footsteps of Peters, Howard and Jones will have to hope they’re in this for the long haul.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2020-12-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said it has filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public it what’s anticipated to be a break-through moment for the industry.The San Francisco-based company said in a statement that it expects its draft registration filing to become effective after the SEC completes its review process. The company didn’t provide further details of its listing plans and a representative declined to comment beyond the announcement.Coinbase was valued at more than $8 billion in 2018 after a $300 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management.The company, started in 2012, has raised more than $500 million from backers that also include Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator and Greylock Partners, according to its website. Coinbase said it has has more than 35 million verified users in more than 100 countries and more than $25 billion in assets on its platform.Kyle Samani, co-founder of MultiCoin Capital, said he expects Coinbase going public to be a “huge event” for the industry.“It is a watershed moment for the asset class, both as a form of legitimization, and by providing a way for investors to bet on the crypto industry without betting on a specific asset,” said Samani, who is an investor in Coinbase.Bitcoin hit an all-time high Thursday of more than $23,000, and has more than doubled this year. PayPal Holdings Inc. has begun letting consumers use the cryptocurrency in transactions, and companies including Square Inc. and MicroStrategy Inc. have made Bitcoin investments, prompting speculations that more institutional investors will jump into cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin BetOne River Asset Management, a hedge fund specializing in volatility bets, has quietly bought $600 million worth of the digital currency, Bloomberg reported.As cryptocurrency prices have risen, Coinbase has experienced performance issues this week, including connectivity problems and delays.A Coinbase listing would be “a major exit for many early employees,” said Nic Carter, co-founder of crypto researcher Coin Metrics. Those employees would have liquidity for angel investments and the means to start their own startups, Carter said.Several cryptocurrency-related companies, particularly exchanges, are already earning hundreds of millions or even billions in annual revenue, and more crypto startups are expected to go public or be acquired in the coming months.Coinbase’s announcement comes at the end of the biggest year ever for initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges. Newly public companies have raised more than $175 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IPOs reached an all-time high this month for December, with 63 companies raising more than $23 billion in new listings, the data show.Roblox, InstacartThe IPO line-up for 2021 already includes high-profile companies such as online video-game company Roblox Corp., online dating service Bumble, grocery delivery platform Instacart Inc. and online mortgage lender Better.com, Bloomberg has reported.Software maker UiPath Inc. said Thursday that it had filed confidentially for an IPO. Online used clothing marketplace Poshmark Inc. also filed Thursday for an IPO.If Coinbase moves ahead with its plans, it will have to disclose details of its operations and finances in public SEC filings.The company lost about 60 staffers this year after Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong banned political activism at work. Armstrong told staffers in September that he would offer a generous severance package to those who didn’t want to comply.Armstrong was a software engineer at Airbnb Inc. before co-founding Coinbase with Fred Ehrsam.(Updates with valuation history in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Cryptocurrency Exchange Coinbase Says It Filed to Go Public

2020-12-18,"With the markets rallying to or even above all-time highs recently, it’s hard not to get a little bit skeptical. I understand that the enthusiasm is tied to encouraging developments with the novel coronavirus vaccines. Because the pandemic has roiled the economy, a long-term solution implies a return to normal. Nevertheless, with headwinds such as a looming eviction crisis, prospective buyers may want to consider game-changing stocks.
Indeed, maybe they ought to consider game-changing stocks exclusively. According to Caller.com editorialist Heather Loeb, Covid-19 created the “greatest mental health crisis in generations.” Although you might be tempted to declare this hyperbole, Loeb introduces startling statistics, such as suicide rates occurring at 1.6-times every 1% increase in unemployment during the Great Recession. With so much devastation, you know that people are becoming desperate.
And that’s what is most stark about the dichotomy between Wall Street and Main Street. If I remember my history books correctly, people jumped off of buildings during the Great Depression because equities collapsed. Frankly, I’ve never heard of anyone wanting to be done with it all because they scored a bunch of ten-baggers. But that’s just me. Your mileage may vary, as the kids like to say.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Having assessed the strange contradiction, if you still want to bet on the markets, again, go with game-changing stocks. Using my definition, these are securities tied to businesses that are not just profitable but offer transformative solutions to society. Perhaps they disrupt an old, antiquated platform of getting something done. Or they may offer access to opportunities to disenfranchised individuals.


					7 Growth Stocks You Don't Want to Sleep On				

Although the present circumstances appear bleak in many instances, this is also a time of remarkable technological breakthroughs. In fact, the Covid-19 vaccine race, where a solution was delivered in less than one year, is a testament to human ingenuity, irrespective of outside negative circumstances. Thus, your foray into the market should include these game-changing tech stocks:
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)
Lemonade (NYSE:LMND)
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS)
Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AAXN)
Fujifilm (OTCMKTS:FUJIY)
Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT)
Eat Beyond (OTCMKTS:EATBF)
Cyberdyne (OTCMKTS:CYBQY)
Some of these names you might know and some of them you might not. But each is bringing a quality to the table that could potentially revolutionize the integration of technology and society. So, it’s not all bad news, especially with these game-changing stocks to buy.

Game-Changing Stocks to Buy: PayPal (PYPL)

Although luddites might cry foul, technology is becoming a ubiquitous medium for everyone, so much so that it’s nearly impossible to thrive without it. Granted, this has some negatives, such as cybersecurity and online privacy concerns. But by and large, technology helps improve our lives. And this is perhaps no more evident in the financial realm than PayPal.
Indeed, if you’re looking for permanently relevant game-changing stocks, the payment-processing specialist is a great place to start. For one thing, the number of the unbanked could rise and fairly significantly if the economy doesn’t recover as quickly as we’d like.
Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation indicates that between 2009 and 2011, households without a bank account increased from 7.6% to 8.2%. If we see such an increase moving forward, demand for PYPL stock could rise.
Further, if we avoid an economic catastrophe, PayPal is positioned to advantage the gig economy. Thanks to its user-friendly interface and wide market adoption, PYPL stock has few direct rivals. Therefore, whatever your perspective on the years ahead, this is one of the game-changing stocks to watch closely.

Lemonade (LMND)

Insurance can be a hassle, especially when you’re changing residences. Whether you’re a homeowner or renter, you’re incentivized to carry insurance — and in many cases, it’s a requirement to seal the deal. But paperwork is the last thing most folks want to deal with, especially in this digitalized age. Fortunately, Lemonade seized this opportunity with an app that streamlines the entire process.
Using artificial intelligence, the company claims to get you insured in 90 seconds. Further, with renters insurance starting at $5 and homeowners insurance starting at $25, LMND stock is perfectly levered to the millennial and emerging Generation Z demographics. As well, the company offers pet insurance starting from $10, which is a huge business. Most Americans love their four-legged friends, none more so than millennials, where approximately 70% report owning at least one pet.


					7 Alternative Energy Stocks With Massive Potential Now and into the Future				

Best of all, demand continues to grow for app-based solutions to traditionally clunky processes. Earlier this month, Lemonade announced that its app launched in France. Now, French users are able to get renters insurance almost instantaneously. While insurance companies usually don’t rank among game-changing stocks, you should make an exception for LMND stock.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS)

During this terribly divisive political season that appears to be worsening, it’s hard to find consensus on anything. Strangely, though, both Democrats and Republicans seem to have consensus on two controversial issues: first, what I will politely term “botanical solutions” and second, national defense. Long story short, the common narrative is that Republicans love spending for war and Democrats love waging it.
If this trend continues — and it’s likely that it will given President-elect Joe Biden’s soft spot for the military — one of the game-changing stocks to buy is Kratos Defense & Security Solutions. While it’s not what you would call dinner room conversation, some of the best innovations have sprouted on humanity’s desire to kill one another. With the underlying advanced warfare machinery underlining KTOS stock, Kratos ensures that the American people are on the side dishing out the business.
Of course, what I’ve mentioned above sounds terribly cynical. But humans are inherently good at self-destruction. With KTOS stock, at least you have the knowledge that our service members have the best chance of survivability, making this one of the more patriotic game-changing stocks.

Axon Enterprise (AAXN)

Staying with the controversial side of game-changing stocks, Axon Enterprise has been in the news recently. As manufacturers of taser smart weapons and body cameras for law enforcement, AAXN stock is not what you would call a feel-good story, considering the brand’s involvement in high-profile incidents. Of course, with the tragic death of George Floyd — which ultimately contributed to calls for social justice — you might immediately brand Axon as a vice play.
Granted, I don’t think AAXN stock will ever lose its “bad boy” image. However, I also believe that Axon Enterprise and law enforcement in general is getting a bad rap. Let me be 100% clear — what happened to Mr. Floyd was disgraceful, no question about it. But I do question the logic of overhauling entire police infrastructures on the basis of a terrible incident.


					8 Stocks That May Be Overpriced				

Naturally, the counterargument is that law enforcement has been involved in many other controversial incidents, many of which have not been circulated widely to the public. I get that. But Axon provides the technology to provide better health outcomes so that criminal suspects can have their day in court. I think that’s a positive even though this is an ugly industry.

Fujifilm (FUJIY)
Source: Shutterstock

	
Although the Covid-19 pandemic has been a nightmare for all of us, if there’s one bright spot, it’s that the crisis caused investors to consider game-changing stocks in the pharmaceutical space. Due to their vaccine development and encouraging clinical data, names like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) put many smiles on stakeholders’ faces. But the biggest long-term beneficiary could turn out to be Fujifilms.
Wait, the camera maker? While Fujifims was a powerhouse back when, you know, film was a thing, not too many analysts discuss FUJIY stock. Largely, this is because shares are traded in the over-the-counter exchange and because Japanese firms for years lost their relevance. But that relevance is coming back, and it’s not because of their cameras, as great as they are.
Instead, FUJIY stock is levered to the biologics production industry. Specifically, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies was selected to manufacture Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine at its facilities located in North Carolina. Also, Fujifilms has a biomanufacturing site in Texas, where it stands ready for vaccine production under Operation Warp Speed.
Not only is the technology to mass produce vaccines vital moving forward, so is the importance of keeping critical medical supply chains in house. Don’t be surprised to see FUJIY’s stock rise, both metaphorically and literally.

Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT)

Heading into the riskier names among game-changing stocks, we have Ocean Power Technologies. A wave energy specialist, OPTT stock is conceptually the most profound clean renewable energy solution in my opinion.
Mainly, you have President-elect Biden’s emphasis on shifting away from fossil fuels toward green energy infrastructure. The problem is that the most common platforms, solar and wind power, are intermittent. If mother nature doesn’t play along according to forecast, these sources can be rendered mute. As well, they’re space-intrusive and are plain ugly.
This is where OPTT stock can truly shine. As an underwater structure, Ocean Power generates usable energy through the ocean’s movements. It solves myriad challenges associated with traditional green power systems, primarily intermittency and aesthetic offensiveness. As well, most of the earth is covered in water, and most of that water is ocean water. Finally, we have the technology to make good use of it.


					9 Stocks to Buy With $5,000 in Starter Money				

Of course, not everything about Ocean Power is ideal. Before you dive in, you should note that the company’s financials leave much to be desired. Still, if you’re tolerant to risk, this could be one of the most groundbreaking of game-changing stocks.

Eat Beyond (EATBF)

Among the top performers of game-changing stocks in recent years has been the plant-based meat phenomenon. I’ve been skeptical about this development as we’ve seen many fads before in the food and beverage space, only for them to peter out ignominiously. But so far, the premium valuation in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has proven me wrong.
But now, I can understand why people are hesitant to engage BYND as the risk of holding the bag has increased, at least from a perceptional standing. Thus, if you want the potential of explosive growth, you may want to consider Eat Beyond and EATBF stock.
On paper, Eat Beyond is an “investment issuer in Canada focused on the global plant-based and alternative food sector.” What this means in laymen terms is that the company identifies and acquires equity in diverse global corporations involved in the plant-based meat market. Therefore, you can get valuable, comprehensive exposure through one investment umbrella.
Most importantly, industry experts believe that value of plant-based meat worldwide will hit $35.5 billion in 2027. Further, the food shortages associated with the Covid-19 crisis appears to have given a branding lift for the alternative meat space.

Cyberdyne (CYBQY)

Chances are, when discussing tech-based game-changing stocks, you’ve heard of augmented reality. But what about augmented mobility? This is an area where Cyberdyne — not to be confused with Cyberdyne Systems Laboratory, which infamously attempted to destroy all humanity — steps into the picture. I’ve been talking about CYBQY stock off and on over the years but it’s only now when shares are truly enjoying their day in the sun.
Frankly, this is a speculative investment, so risk-averse folks may want to wait until prices have cooled down. But if they do, you’ll want to strongly consider CYBQY stock. Primarily, the underlying company developed HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb), which is the world’s first cyborg-type robot. Designed to improve, support or enhance natural physical functions, Cyberdyne is a pioneer of practical augmented mobility.


					7 Alternative Energy Stocks With Massive Potential Now and into the Future				

For now, the company is focused on developing HAL for medical needs, which is a huge business due to the aging population of developed nations. But further down the line, Cyberdyne can perhaps exponentially improve the capacity of human operators, enabling greater performance efficiencies across a variety of economic sectors.

As ResearchandMarkets.com stated in May:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
“People are using digital payment options to avoid contact and spread of infection through direct cash handling, and also to adhere to social distancing to curb the spread of Covid-19. Due to closure of local market places and to avoid public gathering, people are preferring online purchase of essential supplies, which in turn is increasing the demand for the digital payments market.”
As a leader in the digital-payment space, PayPal has, of course, benefited from the sector’s incredible growth. In fact, in Q3, its net revenue jumped 24% year-over-year, versus a 19% YOY jump in the first nine months of the year. Last quarter, its total payments volume jumped an impressive 36% YOY, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.
According to the company, the latter increase represents an all-time record. Further, PayPal added 15.2 million net active users last quarter, and as of the end of the third quarter, it has a total of 361 million active accounts. Finally, the company remains extremely profitable, as it generated nearly $3 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year.
Why PayPal’s Growth Is Likely to Stay Strong
PayPal CEO Daniel Schuman recently said that the pandemic had lowered the time needed to transition to digital payments “maybe three to five years.” After the pandemic, he indicated that he does not expect the e-commerce megatrend to ease.
I think Schuman, who expects e-commerce to retain its current 70% market share following the pandemic, up from 30% before the coronavirus, is a bit off the mark. It’s true that millions of consumers who rarely or never utilized e-commerce before the coronavirus have begun doing so regularly during the pandemic, and that these individuals will utilize it significantly after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Yet since many people like shopping at stores, especially for clothes and large-ticket items, while products can still be acquired more quickly at stores than online, I think we’ll see a roughly 50/50 split between physical stores and e-commerce post-pandemic. Still, that’s a very favorable mix for PayPal.
Also positive for PayPal and PayPal stock is the cycle of “network effects” that it enjoys. In other words, as more consumers use PayPal, more merchants will begin accepting it, which will incentivize even more consumers to utilize it.
In a related note, PayPal has been successfully moving into what it calls “physical retail,” i.e. providing retailers with QR readers that allow consumers to pay for products in stores using their PayPal accounts. Among the retailers that recently joined that program are CVS (NYSE:CVS), Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY).

The Bottom Line on PayPal Stock
PayPal has only scratched the surface of the huge global payments market, which, in 2018, the company estimated was worth about $110 trillion. PayPal’s first-mover advantage in digital payments, combined with the likely continued, rapid growth of the sector, should enable it to meaningfully increase its share of the global-payments market every year.
Consequently, I recommend that longer-term investors buy PayPal stock.

2020-12-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last year’s backlash against Facebook Inc.’s planned digital currency Libra would have been most CEOs’ worst nightmare.Governments and regulators linked arms to repel a perceived threat to monetary sovereignty, financial stability and data privacy. The more Mark Zuckerberg tried to reassure politicians by talking up financial inclusion and innovation, the more he came across like a tobacco boss denying cigarettes are addictive. He even acknowledged the problem: “I get that I’m not the ideal messenger for this.”That hasn’t deterred him. Given Zuckerberg’s tendency to issue half-hearted apologies before going back to breaking things, it’s not surprising that he’s gearing up for a second attempt to launch Libra next year.There have been a few changes: Libra is now called Diem – as in Carpe — and its membership council is headed by Stuart Levey, whose stints at the U.S. Treasury and HSBC Holdings Plc make him a blend of Beltway and banking. There’s no more talk of rewards for members in the form of “investment tokens.”Technically, Facebook is only one of Diem’s 27 members, and Diem says it’s an independent organization — Facebook will be providing an electronic wallet alongside it. But this project was created and funded by Zuckerberg’s company, and the association’s six-seat board includes David Marcus, head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency efforts. The biggest new concession to regulators is that Facebook will no longer create a single global currency. Rather than craft a synthetic Libra out of a basket of euros, dollars and yen — much like the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights — Diem will be made up of multiple single-currency stablecoins, pegged to each one. Converting a dollar or euro into a digital Diem would be a one-to-one transaction, with little chance of wild Bitcoin-level volatility or an overnight disruption of fiat currencies.Facebook is even proposing that central banks one day use the Diem blockchain to issue digital currencies, similar to China’s testing of a digital yuan.This plea for legitimacy suggests Facebook is leaning more toward the kind of electronic cash offered by PayPal Holdings Inc. or Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., than the revolutionary crypto dreams of Bitcoiners. A digital dollar that’s transferable anywhere and at any time could in theory be a draw for consumers (even if in practice it’s regulation, rather than technology, that’s the cause of transaction slowness). Teunis Brosens, a senior economist at ING, reckons Diem may end up like a plain-vanilla “e-money” wallet. Blockchain expert David Gerard has called it “Paypal-but-it’s-Facebook.”It’s the “it’s-Facebook” part that should keep governments on their guard. E-money firms are often start-ups with Visa cards. Facebook, together with its WhatsApp and Instagram platforms, boasts 3 billion monthly users. If they each generate $6 in sales, Diem would represent an $18 billion revenue stream overnight.After U.S. regulators this month accused Facebook of unfairly abusing its market power to monopolize social media, will it compete fairly in this new arena or squash the competition? Imagine if Facebook’s ad contracts were one day tied to Diem, or if it abused its access to customers’ financial data. Trustbusters will be glad Libra didn’t lift off earlier.It’s likely more regulation is needed. As German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz put it, referring to Libra’s name change, “a wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf.” The noose is already tightening around such stablecoins with Europe imposing more bank-like capital requirements, says Simon Polrot, head of crypto-development non-profit ADAN. If it takes off, regulators might also want an inside peek into how Diem manages its cash reserves. As for money-laundering risks, Zuckerberg will no doubt sign up to “know your customer” rules, but how effective will Facebook be in tackling bad actors? And will it enforce the U.S.’s extraterritorial sanctions?Lawmakers may wonder whether Facebook needs a banking license, something it really doesn’t want. Zuckerberg will no doubt argue that Diem is an association, independent of his empire. But it resembles a Potemkin village populated by payments firms, non-profits and venture capital funds. There are no banks, and none of the other FAANGs. Those who left Libra, such as PayPal, haven’t returned.No one should underestimate Zuckerberg’s determination to launch this product. In the face of widespread criticism, he is coming back for more and Marcus. his top financial-services executive, is asking for “the benefit of the doubt” from regulators. That line wouldn’t work in a car-repair shop, let alone a bank. Still, Facebook deserves a fair hearing, given Zuckerberg has changed Libra’s message. If it falls on deaf ears, maybe the problem is the messenger.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

""We think the market is overly focused on this near-term tailwind and competition for online payments will heat up over time.""PayPal is the sixth-largest ARKF component at a weight of 3.75% as of Dec. 21.

					7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021				

Over the last few years and before the novel coronavirus pandemic, a strong economy combined with declining unemployment rates contributed to a decline in the number of the unbanked. Unfortunately, not every segment of society has benefited. According to the Detroit Free Press:
“Millions of consumers — including people of color — aren’t able to easily cash a check or visit an ATM because they’re not customers of regular banks.
“The top reasons given for not having a bank account include not having enough money to meet minimum balance requirements, not trusting banks, bank account fees are too high, bank account fees are too unpredictable.”
Banks are getting creative with their service offerings, attempting to woo new customers. However, nothing can beat out the convenience, intuitiveness and relevance of digital payment platforms. This will continue to lift PayPal stock longer term.
PayPal Stock and the Pandemic
Indeed, digital payments is one of the main catalysts for social equity. On an elemental level, banking access is a problem, particularly with soaring Covid-19 cases. Further, Harvard Health Publishing reported that communities of color have been “devastated” by the pandemic. PYPL’s contactless platform encourages social distancing, keeping people safe and thereby increasing the ESG (environmental, social and governance) cred of PayPal stock.
Moreover, if we have a K- or L-shaped economic recovery, PayPal’s services will be even more crucial for all communities. For instance, the number of the unbanked increased conspicuously following the events that sparked the Great Recession. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) now reports that the financial and labor market pressures from the pandemic could see a rise in the number of the unbanked.
But PayPal stock is more than just an answer to these “negative” catalysts. Even in the best-case scenario (a V-shaped recovery), the underlying platform offers flexibility that traditional banks can’t match. That’s because PayPal is really a brand of the gig economy.

The Great Migration
In recent years, millennials have begun migrating away from large urban centers to smaller or more rural towns. Largely, this is due to exponential advancements in technologies of connectivity. With the ability to work anywhere, there was simply no point for young people to pay the often onerous costs of living in major metropolitan areas.
Naturally, the Covid-19 pandemic will accelerate this migration trend, as the U.S. adopted remote work under a baptism of fire. Now, anyone who wants to hook into the gig economy can theoretically do so. As well, certain states have laws that are far more conducive for the entrepreneurial spirit.
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Matt McCall Research Staff
	
It’s not even close. For example, Utah’s employment level has grown nearly 37% since the fourth quarter of 2003. Other popular destination states for millennials, such as Arizona and Colorado, have seen 33% and 28% growth over the same period, respectively.
In contrast, the U.S. employment level growth since Q4 2003 is a pedestrian 5.7%.
PYPL Is Constantly Evolving
And the migration is another reason why PayPal stock is really the twenty-first-century version of the banking platform. As millennials move to less-populated parts of the U.S. — and perhaps other areas across the globe — PYPL adapts to them, not the other way around.
In other words, as the end-user evolves, so too does PayPal. Essentially, wherever there is internet access, there is access to a robust payments system. Unfortunately, you can’t say the same about the traditional banking architecture.
Therefore, keep close tabs on PayPal stock. No matter which way the economy turns, the underlying company will provide relevant, convenient services.

Value-focused investors might balk at the idea of buying PayPal stock after its incredible run-up. However, the company’s strategic moves indicate that there could be more gains coming.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If 2020 has taught market traders anything, it’s that the e-commerce explosion is a real and enduring phenomenon.
Plus, we’ve learned that stocks in the e-commerce and electronic payments niches can be resilient even during times of international crisis.
So, investors must weigh the high valuation of PayPal stock against the company’s powerful momentum in a time when digital payments platforms are thriving. To help you make a more informed decision, we’ll start with an analysis of the stock’s recent price action.
A Closer Look at PayPal Stock
Throughout the second half of 2020, PayPal stock has rewarded both the short-term dip buyers and the long-term buy-and-hold investors.
With minor corrections along the way, PayPal stock ascended from the $180 area in July to $240 in December. This occurred after the stock price had already risen from the March low of $82.07.
No doubt, this amazing run-up was precipitated by a cultural shift towards electronic payment methods in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.


					7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021				

However, with the incredible bull run there may be valuation-related concerns. The skeptics might point out that PayPal stocks’ trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is rather high at 90.88.
Is it possible, then, for the bulls to provide a justification for the current PayPal stock price?
Accelerated Adoption
It’s safe to say that Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane could be included in the bull camp. Not long ago, Keane hiked his price target on on PayPal stock from $234 to $275.
What would prompt this analyst to lean so bullish on PayPal stock? Evidently, due to the coronavirus pandemic and other factors, Keane is preparing for faster adoption of e-commerce and mobile-payment services.
Keane’s conclusion isn’t just based on guesswork. In fact, the analyst cited a survey of 817 U.S. mobile tech-savvy participants. That survey found that “it’s clear that adoption of e-commerce and mobile payment services has accelerated, driven by the pandemic and expanded fintech value proposition.”
Moreover, the survey found that the use of online channels for retail physical-goods purchases across tech-savvy U.S. mobile payment participants (including PayPal) is around 83%.
On top of that, Keane noted that “about 60% of survey participants are interested in” PayPal and Square (NYSE:SQ) “as a future commerce platform.”
A Smart Move
In order to ensure that PayPal remains competitive during the digital-payment revolution, the company must make payments and other digital money transactions as simple and convenient as possible.
Fortunately, as the U.S. government hammers out a second round of Covid-19 stimulus payments, PayPal is reaffirming its commitment to making digital payments smooth and quick.
To this end, PayPal has decided to waive its cash-a-check feature’s check-cashing fees for recipients of government stimulus paper checks.
PayPal customers will be able to cash their paper stimulus checks remotely through the cash-a-check feature, a process that typically can be done in a matter of minutes.
This, I believe, is a smart move that will generate good will among PayPal’s users. It could even induce more people to sign up for PayPal as the word gets out that the company’s helping people get their relief money faster.
The Bottom Line
Some doubters might view PayPal stock as a poster child of 2020’s richly valued e-payment stocks. And, the stock’s price might bother some contrarian investors.
This concern is understandable. I don’t typically recommend buying a stock after a huge price run-up.
Yet, I feel that it’s okay to make an exception for PayPal stock. The digital payment revolution is here to stay, and PayPal remains an essential part of this cultural shift.

2020-12-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The rare activist moment staged by China’s central bank was too late and too crude.For years, when it came to innovative business ideas, Beijing’s stance has been to let them flourish — there would always be room to regulate and rein things in later. And thus gig economy superstars blossomed. China’s version of Uber Technologies Inc., DoorDash Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. are even more ubiquitous than their U.S. counterparts at home. The other side of the coin is that billions of dollars in paper gains can be made and destroyed within days thanks to regulatory whims. Here, Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. is a cautionary tale.On Sunday, China’s central bank released a statement saying that Ant has “little legal awareness,” “despised” regulators’ compliance requirements and engaged in antitrust behavior. Ant needs to go back to its core payment business, the People’s Bank of China said. In the first two trading days since then, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns roughly one-third of Ant, lost over 15% of its market value. Even before the PBOC’s interference into Ant’s business models on Sunday, Alibaba's shares were whacked by a terse, one-sentence announcement from Beijing about probing the company’s antitrust behavior on Christmas Eve. Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares are entering the year-end just 1.4% away from being in the red. That’s a further blow to Ma, whose blunt words, likening China’s financial system to pawnshops, cost him the world’s biggest initial public offering in early November. Ant had been on track to raise $35 billion, with a valuation of more than $300 billion, until regulators pulled it two days before its trading debut.The company’s digital-payment business has become commoditized. The newer, faster growing consumer-lending operation, which the PBOC now seeks to limit, is Ant’s high-margin cash cow. So even if the company can somehow regain Beijing’s favor and look to go public again, its valuation will be questioned. Ant will no longer be China’s MasterCard, but merely its PayPal, which has a lower market value. As a longtime observer of Ant, I have often marveled that it ventured to become a public company at all, because it operates in such treacherous regulatory waters. In July, my colleague Anjani Trivedi and I wrote that its IPO would run the risk of exposing how volatile and unsteady China’s financial regulations can be. A blockbuster listing felt almost too good to be true. This isn’t the first time Ant has had a run-in with regulators. The PBOC noticed its flawed lending model as early as 2017. Back then, Ant was packaging consumer loans into asset-backed securities and selling them to institutional investors — often banks. The central bank, worried about the underlying quality of securitized products — which had collapsed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. — called a halt to that practice. So Ant found another way to build its business. Currently, Ant connects banks with consumers, and almost all of the loans it originates sit only on banks’ balance sheets. With China being one of the most indebted nations in the world — its debt-to-GDP ratio is edging close to 300% — the PBOC is justifiably worried about bad loans. By asking Ant to put in a capital buffer itself, as Sunday’s statement implies, the central bank is essentially telling Ma not to get too clever. But why is the PBOC making this public statement now? If only it had published a vaguely worded warning three months earlier, investors and bankers wouldn’t have whipped up such frenzy over Ant’s IPO and come out this disappointed. The fact is, the PBOC does see problems, but often lacks the political capital to do anything about them.Consider the backdrop. Ant first sought a dual listing in July, when China’s tech stocks were staging a bull run, even as the economy struggled to recover from the Covid-19 lockdown. Back then, Beijing was fast-tracking unicorn IPOs, hopeful that a tech infrastructure build-out could stimulate growth. Granted, the PBOC stepped back from open-market operations as early as June, worried that earlier rounds of easing would spur speculative bubbles, but bureaucrats bit their tongues on Ant. President Xi Jinping didn’t want to hear about risk control then. Fast forward to December. China’s economy has recovered, and curtailing debt once again tops Beijing’s economic agenda. The 67-year-old Xi, who is virtually president for life, always wanted to deleverage China, because he doesn’t want a Minsky Moment to blow up during his lifetime. He started that campaign in late 2017 — around the time the PBOC halted Ant’s securitization of its microloans — but got derailed by Donald Trump’s trade war and Covid-19. Now that both hurdles are gone, the risk managers at the PBOC have found their voice. Of course, it should come as no surprise that China’s central bank lacks independence. But that trait matters to global investors, who have piled into China this year because it’s the only major economy growing in the pandemic era. Ant is a good reminder that Beijing’s politics matter. A vaguely worded statement after years of inaction can wipe out billions of dollars in a blink. Ma’s fiasco has turned into a farce, just as ESG investing turned a corner and became a major trend this year. For all the big investment houses rushing to enter China, it’s perhaps time to step back and ask: is the country really ready for the global stage?(Updates in fifth paragraph with effect of the People’s Bank of China’s statement on the shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-12-30,"On Wednesday, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $231.38.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-08  * Strike Price: $242.50  * Volume: 298  * Open Interest: 709Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The New York Stock Exchange initially set a reference price of $7.25 per share, but on its first trading day, Palantir stock opened at $10 and closed at $9.50.
On Nov. 27, Palantir stock saw a record high $33.50 and are now flirting with $25.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Denver-based Palantir was founded in 2003 by a group of executives led by Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). He was also one of the early backers of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Palantir’s initial works, especially with government agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have been regarded as controversial and even secretive.


					Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year				

Today’s article looks at what investors can expect from the company. Although PLTR is relatively overvalued, those investors with a long-term horizon can regard any dip toward $22.5 or even below as an opportunity to go long PLTR stock. Here’s why.
Government Contracts and Palantir Stock
Since 2003, Palantir has expanded the customer base to other governments as private corporations. For instance in November 2019, Palantir and Japan based insurer Sompo (OTCMKTS:SMPNY) formed a joint venture together. Then in June 2020, they launched the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health and Wellbeing.”
Recent academic research by Roxana Akhmetova of University of Oxford, claims the “partnership is problematic” because Thiel is a Trump adviser.
In September, Palantir was awarded a $44.4 million worth, three-year contract by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It will provide data management and analytics services to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), which focuses on potential new medicines.
Beginning of December, Palantir announced a cooperation with the government of Greece. The country is working on improving its COVID-19 response efforts by integrating more data and analytics in the decision-making process.
Recently, Palantir has developed a tool for the U.S. government for monitoring the manufacturing of coronavirus vaccines as well as their distribution.
The UK National Health Service has also been working with Palantir. In the summer, CNBC reported, that Britain’s NHS gave Palantir access to millions of UK residents private personal data. Palantir recently signed a two-year contract with the NHS. It will now provide the organization a software platform for data processing.
In fact, a recent company press release highlights, Palantir is “supporting a diverse range of institutions as they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and adapt for the future.”
How Palantir’s Recent Earnings Came
In mid-November, Palantir released Q3 results. Revenue was $289.4 million, up 52% YoY. Net loss of $853.3 million translated into diluted net loss per share of 94 cents.
As of Sept. 30, the total of cash and equivalents were $1.8 billion. Management raised full-year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% YoY.
The company emphasized its international expansion in the quarterly statement. Co-founder and CEO Alexander C. Karp cited, “Sompo’s work is vital to Japan’s welfare and security, and Kengo Sakurada, the company’s group chief executive officer, has been a critical and trusted partner as we work with Sompo to expand our reach in Asia.”
Palantir stock’s forward P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios are 208.33, 42.58, and 37.0 respectively.
PLTR stock is frothy, even for a growth stocks that is able to get an important number of government contracts. Given the metrics, it is currently one of the most expensive software stocks on the Street.
For instance, the trailing P/E and P/B ratios for the SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (NYSEARCA:XSW) are 30.62 and 6.63.
The Bottom Line
Palantir is a growth stock and is likely to create shareholder value for many years to come. However, it is richly valued and expensive. Therefore long-term investors could consider buying the dips, especially if the price declines toward $22.50.
Are you currently a shareholder? You may think of initiating a covered call position in PLTR stock. Then, you could possibly protect some of your paper profits. For example, an ATM covered call that expires on Jan. 15 would decrease portfolio volatility and offer some downside protection.
Investors could also consider by an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that also holds Palantir stock in its portfolio. Examples include the Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO), the First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX), the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:VO), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), or the BNY Mellon US Small Cap Core Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:BKSE).

2021-01-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s ride-hailing and payments giant Gojek is in advanced discussions about merging with local e-commerce pioneer PT Tokopedia, ahead of a planned initial public offering of the combined entity, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The country’s two most valuable startups have signed a detailed term sheet to conduct due diligence of each other’s business, said the people, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private. Both sides see potential synergies and are keen to close the deal as soon as possible in coming months, they said.The merged entity would create an Indonesian powerhouse with a valuation of about $18 billion, with Gojek and Tokopedia pegged at around $10.5 billion and $7.5 billion respectively in the talks, according to the people involved. Their businesses range from ride-hailing and payments to online shopping and delivery -- a local mashup of Uber Technologies Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and DoorDash Inc. It plans to go public in the U.S. and Indonesia.“This is potentially a blockbuster deal,” said Usman Akhtar, a partner at Bain & Co. in Singapore. “The deal would have a lot of impact outside of these two companies and have ripple effects that aren’t even all known right now.”Gojek and Tokopedia have considered a potential merger since 2018, but discussions accelerated after deal talks between Gojek and arch-rival Grab Holdings Inc. reached an impasse, the people said. Grab Chief Executive Officer Anthony Tan continues to resist pressure from SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son to give up some control in a combined entity with Gojek, said the people.Southeast Asia’s two most valuable startups -- together worth about $25 billion -- held on-and-off talks to combine after years of fierce competition in ride-hailing, food delivery and financial technology. As recently as December, the companies were said to have made substantial progress in working out a deal to combine, people with knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg News at the time. But they clashed over how to manage Indonesia, the key market in the region.Read more: Grab, Gojek Are Said to Close In on Terms for Merger DealSon, who had been a steadfast supporter of Tan in the past, is losing patience with the Grab co-founder’s reluctance to cede some control and is now supporting a merger between Gojek and SoftBank-backed Tokopedia, the people said. The two home-grown tech pioneers have common investors, including Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and Sequoia Capital India. Tokopedia is also backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which has its own e-commerce unit in the region, Lazada.Representatives of Gojek and Tokopedia declined to comment.The firms are currently discussing merger ratios that would give each side substantial equity ownership, the people said. Founders of the two companies have been friends since their inception more than 10 years ago and anticipate an amicable alliance. Grab and Gojek discussions were more contentious and had not progressed enough for them to sign a term sheet, the people said.A combined Gojek and Tokopedia would dominate in Indonesia, one of the world’s fastest-growing internet economies. Their planned U.S.-listing would provide global investors an alternative to Sea Ltd., the only major Southeast Asian internet company listed in the U.S. Sea’s shares climbed almost 400% last year, boosted by the growing popularity of its mobile gaming and online shopping platform.A deal between Gojek and Tokopedia is likely to face less regulatory opposition than the deal previously under consideration. The combination of Grab and Gojek would reduce competition in ride-hailing, delivery and digital payments in Southeast Asia, a prospect over which government officials have already expressed reservations.The companies are contemplating several options for a public offering. They could choose a traditional IPO in Indonesia and the U.S. or work with a blank-check company for the U.S. listing, one of the people said. A handful of blank-check companies have held discussions with the two companies in recent months, the person said.“Southeast Asia’s unicorns are entering a stage of maturity where investors require an exit, such as a trade sale or IPO,” said Mark Robinson, Asia Pacific head of technology, media and telecom at international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. “It is driving companies to look at a host of options, some novel and challenging.”Tokopedia said last month it hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. as advisers to help accelerate its plan to go public, following a Bloomberg News report that Bridgetown Holdings Ltd., the blank-check company backed by billionaires Richard Li and Peter Thiel, is considering a potential merger with the e-commerce giant. The special purpose acquisition company is exploring the structure and feasibility of a deal with Tokopedia. Bridgetown shares were down 2.6% at 1:48 p.m. in New York on Tuesday.“We have not decided yet which market and method, and are still considering options,” the Jakarta-based company said in a statement on Dec. 16. “SPAC is a potential option that we could consider but we have not committed to anything at the moment.”(Updates with shares in 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Gojek in Talks With Tokopedia for $18 Billion Merger, Sources Say"

But don’t be fooled. Ethereum looks set to break out in 2021. As its technological advantages gain steam, Ethereum investors could see $1,500 in the near term and $2,500 sometime by the end of 2021. But strap on your seatbelt and hold on tight; it’s going to be a wild ride.
Summary:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Ethereum sits on a superior technology.
ETH has greater room to grow.
Volatility will remain high.
Ethereum 2021: Better than Bitcoin
The future of ethereum wasn’t always so bright. In June 2016, the infamous DAO Hack sent $55 million of ether into hacker’s hands. And a rash of bitcoin clones like bitcoin cash and dogecoin made ethereum look like yet another shiny bauble in a massive cryptocurrency soup.

But ethereum quickly recovered. To handle the DAO Hack, the ethereum community decided to effectively roll back its blockchain to undo the damage. It regained its #2 position by 2018.


					10 of 2020's Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks				

Ethereum holds several technological advantages over its older bitcoin and altcoin siblings. Firstly, the cryptocurrency acts more like a contract than a coin. That makes it more like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Wallet or Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, rather than a $100 bill. For instance, an e-commerce buyer might hold ETH in an escrow that automatically releases payment on receipt of goods. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers no such mechanism.
Secondly, ethereum solves the thorny problem of speed. While bitcoin takes about 15 minutes to complete a transaction, ETH will do the same in under 15 seconds.
Finally, it has a theoretically unlimited supply, unlike bitcoin’s 21-million-coin cap. That means ETH won’t run into a mining “wall” and run out of coins to reward miners.
Up, Up and Away
That makes ethereum one of my favorite cryptocurrency plays of 2021. With a $132.5 billion market capitalization, the cryptocurrency is still only one-fifth the size of bitcoin. And as adoption spreads on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and other payment processors, the forgotten middle child could quickly catch up to its older brother.

But just like bitcoin, there’s a wrinkle to the ethereum story. Unlike gold or bonds, ethereum is NOT a safe-haven asset. Instead, it’s a “risk-on” asset that tends to rise when times are good and fall otherwise.
The data backs this up. The correlation between ethereum and the S&P 500 now sits at 64%, meaning that stocks explain almost two-thirds of ethereum’s monthly returns.
Not convinced? Consider March 2020, the month the stock market fell out of bed. As the stock market tumbled 30% on coronavirus fears, cryptocurrencies provided no cushion. In a matter of weeks, bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies lost over half of their value. (The same pattern happened during the December 2018 market wobble.)
But there is a silver lining: Ethereum also tends to magnify stock market gains. With more fiscal stimulus on the way, that also means higher stock valuations. Cryptocurrencies will naturally follow.
How High Can Ethereum Go?
Make no mistake: Ethereum is as volatile as a moody teenager. $10,000 invested in January 2018 would have melted to $830 in a year. But the same $10,000 invested in January 2020 would have rocketed to $85,000. Without an underlying hard asset, ethereum’s value has no basis in the real world.

That makes the cryptocurrency’s valuation more of a popularity contest than a technical exercise, at least in the short term. The cryptocurrency could easily double to $2,500 in 2021 if more users keep jumping on board. But it could also crash to $500 if a major hack shakes investor confidence. (More likely, a 25% loss would cause investors to panic-sell, sparking a self-fulfilling downward cycle.)
Ethereum prices also tend to reverse course in the near term. Since 2015, ethereum returns have doubled-back almost 60% of the time, when a winning month gets followed by a losing one and vice versa. Even in its 2018 peak, the coin never notched more than two consecutive months of gains.
Don’t Miss the Forest for the Trees
However, like a maturing middle-child, ethereum is starting to find its footing. Since April, Ethereum has only notched one losing month. And despite its huge 2020 run, the cryptocurrency still trades 16% below its all-time peak in 2018. (Bitcoin, meanwhile, is up about 110%.)
Plenty of troubled middle-children eventually became stars. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates both overcame early stumbles. And ethereum, with its superior architecture, could one day become a staple of payments processing. Its ability to complete transactions within seconds (versus bitcoin’s minutes) makes it a viable alternative to Visa (NYSE:V) and other online payment processors.
In short, don’t miss this boat. If the broader cryptocurrency market has a good 2021, you can be sure ethereum will have an even better one.

What Happened: Affirm is a fintech company providing installment loans to online shoppers and is led by PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) co-founder Max Levchin.The IPO values Affirm at $11.9 billion based on outstanding shares. Its fully diluted valuation, including options and restricted stock units, is about $15 billion, as per Bloomberg.The company is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""AFRM"" on Wednesday.Affirm is one of the first in a list of several companies to go public this year. Affirm's IPO shows that the market is hot for tech companies, continuing from 2020, which saw businesses raise more than 9 billion.Affirm was founded in 2012 by Max Levchin. The PayPal co-founder is the second-biggest shareholder in Affirm, according to filings.Why It Matters: Affirm is popular among online merchants, with more than 6,500 using the platform according to the company's prospectus.Affirm offers a ""buy now, pay later"" product that appeals to online shoppers for buying big-ticket items and spread out payments. In return, Affirm charges merchants a fee, the Financial Times reports. Affirm makes most of its money from merchant fees, which results in customers paying zero interest. It also offers interest-based loans without late fees.A chunk of Affirm's business comes from sales through fitness company Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON), accounting for 28% of its 12-month revenue through June 2020.Affirm clocked a revenue of $510 million for 12 months through June 2020 and reported losses of $113 million.A boom in online shopping has led to the popularity of Affirm.

2021-01-15,"Frequently known as the silver to bitcoin’s (CCC:BTC) gold, the time may be right for investors to invest in litecoin (CCC:LTC). One of the oldest altcoins, litecoin has jumped over 85% since Dec. 10. But unlike other times when crypto values have surged, this time may be different. Source: Shutterstock For a brief moment in early January, the value of the cryptocurrency market topped $1 trillion. Not surprisingly much of the attention has been on the value of bitcoin. And that makes sense. It sounds more appealing to throw out the fact that bitcoin is trading at more than $36,000 per coin. And according to Forbes, one bitcoin may be worth up to $500,000 by 2030. However, litecoin correlates nearly perfectly with bitcoin. According to Coin Predictor, the correlation coefficient of their prices is 0.83. On range of -1 to 1, a score of 1 represents the strongest positive correlation. And you can buy litecoin for literally a fraction of what it costs you to buy bitcoin.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon But why is now different? One of my favorite sayings is that life happens while you’re busy making other plans. I frequently see trends that emerge, seemingly overnight, but if you were paying attention the groundwork was laid. And that’s what I believe is happening with litecoin in 2021. From Fear to Fun Cryptocurrency is maturing and it has nothing to do with the value of the digital currency. It’s maturing in its messaging. When bitcoin first began capturing the imagination of investors, it seemed too complicated for the average investor to bother with. And in truth it was. You needed to be extremely technologically literate to invest in litecoin. But that’s not the case today. Whereas a few years ago, you needed to know programming to initiate a crypto wallet (a digital wallet for a specific cryptocurrency), today there are mobile apps that make it easy to buy and sell cryptocurrency. While ease of access is important, there’s a psychological component as well. Keep in mind, that when bitcoin hit the scene in 2009 the world was still reeling from the effects of the Great Recession. The Federal Reserve had begun its process of quantitative easing that would last nearly a decade. Wealth, in the form of fiat currency, was crushed. It was the perfect storm for an alternative currency to arrive. The problem was that while some investors may have had a fear of missing out. The greater fear was in getting involved and losing an entire investment. There will always be an audience that buys litecoin and other currencies for as a hedge against the devaluing of fiat currency. But part of cryptocurrency growing up means that it’s going mainstream. For example, the divisibility of crypto currency is ideal for Robinhood investors who can buy litecoin and other cryptocurrencies directly from the app. Litecoin Is Becoming a Medium of Exchange One of the benefits of owning cryptocurrency is that there are a finite number of coins that will be in circulation (for litecoin that number is 84 million). But one of the obstacles to mainstream acceptance has been a lack of utility to ownership. The currency wasn’t remotely close to being widely accepted. In that regard, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is helping litecoin and other digital currencies take a big step towards legitimacy. By making a limited number of cryptocurrencies, including litecoin, available on its platform, it should expand the use case for litecoin. And that’s perhaps the biggest argument for litecoin and other cryptos. When I first started using PayPal, it was great for peer-to-peer transactions. But ultimately I had to move funds to my bank account for there to be utility. Today, I have a PayPal debit card (that provides minimal rewards) and PayPal is a common method of payment. Simply put, it’s just as efficient to use my PayPal account as opposed to my traditional bank account. And that’s another reason to consider litecoin. The altcoin was first created as “the better blockchain,” but nobody knew what advantage there was to processing transactions faster than bitcoin meant. As cryptocurrency gains more utility, users will appreciate litecoin’s security and speed. The Big Money May Be Coming At some point, the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrency may become more well defined. When that occurs, it’s likely that the institutional investors will bring the big dollars into the crypto markets. That’s why now is the time for investors to buy litecoin. The pandemic may have allowed some of us to blink on cryptocurrencies. But now that we’re opening our eyes, the landscape has changed and cryptocurrencies are growing up. Investing in litecoin is not without risk, but if you have room in your portfolio for a little speculation, this may be the optimal time to buy.

2021-01-15,"One of the major investing themes coming out of 2020 is the soaring price of bitcoin (CCC:BTC). However, the cryptocurrency slid as much as 21% over a two-day period to as low as $32,389. Since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, it’s the biggest two-day drop, wiping off nearly $140 billion in total market capitalization. Source: Shutterstock In a nutshell, investors reacted to the stronger dollar and growing political uncertainty. The cryptocurrency is still up roughly 89% on a trailing one-month basis. Nevertheless, the drop did send shivers down the spines of investors. Peaks and valleys will always be part and parcel of investing in bitcoin. But I believe this is just a momentary blip, and normal service will resume soon enough. Covid-19 is surging once again in Asia, and the impeachment of President Donald Trump is jolting the markets. The strengthening of the dollar and higher bond yields are also an important contributing factor in the fall in bitcoin prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips However, all these factors are temporary in nature. In the long run, bitcoin will continue to climb higher. Financial institutions are increasingly allowing users to buy, store, and sell cryptocurrencies. That’s why in a recent Bloomberg Crypto monthly report, analysts are predicting that bitcoin could more than double from its current value in 2021. Bitcoin Finally Gaining Widespread Acceptance The recent surge in bitcoin prices is due to multiple factors. A weaker dollar, economic optimism, big-ticket investment banks backing the scarce digital currency against inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar are some reasons. However, I believe the biggest contributor is higher institutional interest. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Square (NYSE:SQ), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) all provide exposure to the cryptocurrency to their users. All of these companies are large diversified conglomerates. Therefore it’s hard to pinpoint how much money these companies are making through bitcoin. However, considering the surge in its price, it will be a significant contributor to the bottom line looking ahead. Just as an example, Square’s Cash App generated $1.63 billion of bitcoin revenue and $32 million of bitcoin gross profit during the third quarter of 2020. This was up approximately 11x and 15x year-over-year, respectively. Pantera Capital research shows PayPal and Square are securing all the new bitcoin added to the market daily. That’s great news, particularly for PayPal users. The online payments system provider allows its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum for as little as $1. Similarly, a range of mid- or high-end graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is selling out, leading to a shortage in the markets. It’s mainly due to cryptocurrency miners purchasing them in bulk to build machines to mine bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. CME Group, which is the biggest largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. Up until Dec 16, 2020, 8,560 CME Bitcoin futures contracts – equal to roughly 42,800 bitcoin – traded on average each day. Simultaneously, the institutional interest keeps increasing. The number of large open interest holders reached a record of 110 in December. Here to Stay We have been here before. Dizzying highs and lows are not a new phenomenon for bitcoin. However, the cryptocurrency is now finally gaining institutional support, which eluded it for a long time. The pandemic certainly helped. During the widespread lockdowns, online commerce and payments ballooned, increasing interest in digital currencies exponentially. Bitcoin was always volatile. But the past year has shown that every asset class can become wobbly in an uncertain environment. It was always regarded as an interesting store of value due to the ultimate ceiling of 21 million and the difficulties in mining it. But its wider acceptance is bringing a sense of credibility and stability that was hitherto missing. For me, that is what makes it an interesting asset to hold, despite the risks that come with it. The prospect of central banks issuing their own digital currencies will always be there. However, now that financial institutions as large as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are warming up to it, the future looks very bright for bitcoin.

His new target is higher than all those listed on FactSet. ""Both our survey and management commentary unveil a dramatic increase in engagement due to crypto,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""As evidence, PayPal recently said that 50% of its crypto users are opening the PayPal app daily."" Dolev sees the potential for PayPal to generate nearly $2 billion in revenue from bitcoin in 2023, which equates to 10% upside over his current overall revenue estimate for the period. Dolev's survey work indicated that those engaging in bitcoin trading through PayPal's platform demonstrate PayPal app usage that's three times higher than non-bitcoin traders. They also have higher cash balances, he said. PayPal announced in October that it would begin letting users buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through its app. MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis is also upbeat about the opportunity in bitcoin.

Long-term Stocks To Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey. Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running. When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you. Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question. Clorox (CLX) Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it. Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock. During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead. JD.com (JD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge. Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head. But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors. Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This is the company that launched Elon Musk before he became the maverick CEO we all know today. Even back then Musk was a handful, getting deposed as CEO after a couple years but still holding more stock than anyone else when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PYPL in 2002. That became the seed capital for Musk’s later ventures. But beyond the personality, PYPL is a pioneer in electronic payments and now in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments with its Venmo app. Time and again Wall Street has dismissed PYPL as not having the kind of financial reputation or muscle to take on the big financial institutions in the digital space. And time and again, PYPL has proven them wrong. The past year has been a boon for PYPL’s model and has showed that big banks weren’t altogether ready for the quick and massive shift to digital. And PYPL now has credit services as well as other payment platforms. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up over 113% in the past 12 months and it’s now here to stay. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com We’re well ensconced in the Mobility Age at this point. By that I mean what started as the digital revolution has now moved to the point where wireless networks keep us connected nearly all the time, much to some people’s chagrin. But the fact is, despite the downsides, there are plenty of upsides too. And now that 5G telecom tech is upon us, data will be flowing even faster than before. One the beneficiaries and leaders in pushing digital mobility further is QCOM, one of the world’s leading telecom companies. Its business model is unique because it develops chips and telecom equipment but makes money licensing the technology for others to manufacture and also taking a cut of sales. Both U.S. and Chinese (and others) phone makers rely on state of the art QCOM chips, especially for 5G. QCOM just signed a new deal to rekindle relations with Chinese phone makers earlier this week. As long as mobility is a thing, this is a long-term stock to own. The stock is up 75% in the past 12 months, yet the stock is trading at a P/E of 35. Shopify (SHOP) Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com With unemployment nearing 6.7% and many states admitting that the pandemic has hampered their ability to accurately count the unemployed, there are a lot of Americans trying to figure out how to bring in a paycheck. Many have turned to driving Uber or Lyft, although passenger numbers are down significantly now as well. And taxis are even worse. That has led many to try their hands at turning their hobbies into businesses. And that’s where SHOP comes in. It’s a cloud-based platform that helps small and mid-sized business build out professional websites. The stock is up nearly 1000% over the past three years, and much of that has come in the past two years, as the economy has slowed. Vaccines may be on the way, and the government is working through another stimulus package, but the damage done to the economy has yet to be seen clearly given all the other issues facing the nation. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon This stock is up 167% in the past year and has plenty of potential growth ahead.

Along the way, it has moved into the entertainment industry, on both the content and equipment sides.

The spike  in trading volumes seen in recent weeks by the itBit cryptocurrency exchange that powers  PayPal's crypto initiative  suggests crypto could add more than $1 billion to PayPal's annual revenues in 2022, he said. This bodes well for PayPal's active account growth and engagement, Palmer said. PayPal's Feb. 3 earnings report will likely provide affirmation of the initial success and significant promise of the effort, the analyst said.Related Link: PayPal Becomes First Foreign Company To Fully Own A Payments Platform In China ""While PYPL CEO Dan Schulman recently stated that the company has a goal of 1mm active users on its platform, the company could sustain and accelerate its growth through increased engagement alone, in our view,"" he said.

2021-01-21,"Shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. are up 1.2% in premarket trading Thursday after BTIG analyst Mark Palmer upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing traction for the company's cryptocurrency platform. PayPal announced in October that it would start allowing users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies like bitcoin through the PayPal platform, and Palmer said that Paxos, a private company powering PayPal's crypto efforts, ""has seen its trading volumes rise impressively in recent weeks."" He expects that ""the vast majority"" of volume on Paxos's itBit crypto exchange reflects trades for PayPal customers, leading to his projection that crypto could add upwards of $1 billion to PayPal's annual revenues by 2022. ""Much more importantly, the traction seen in itBit's rising crypto volumes bodes well for PYPL's active account growth and engagement,"" he wrote. PayPal also will be allowing customers to make online purchases using their cryptocurrency holdings, which Palmer said would represent a lower-cost funding mechanism for PayPal compared to when people use its service to fund online purchases with their credit cards. ""The upshot is that the lower-cost funding associated with the use of crypto in funding merchant transactions could provide a boost to its take rate and margins,"" he wrote, while setting a $300 price target on the stock.

2021-01-22,"When so many changes and challenges are happening all at once, there is always great opportunity and great risk. But what we’re seeing in the market now is that a new class of stocks — mega-cap stocks — has been created that capitalizes on both. They are the new market titans, but they are also the stocks that investors turn to when times get worrisome. Generally, once “new rules” get set in the market, a correction comes along and resets the rules back to the long-term standard. And before I utter the words, “it’s different this time,” I will simply say that these stocks represent some of the most widely held stocks in the world. They are held by institutions and individuals alike on such a massive scale it’s hard to imagine any of them falling off a cliff. Now, they may have tough times, as some already have, but these seven mega-cap stocks with solid foundations are long-term stocks that will continue to deliver come what may.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Each and every stock on this list has either an “A” or “B” rating in Portfolio Grader. Let’s take a look: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Mega-Cap Stocks: Apple (AAPL) Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.com At the beginning of August 2018, AAPL was the first stock to break the $1 trillion market capitalization ceiling. That was pretty amazing. You know what is even more amazing? It only took two years before it was the first stock to break the $2 trillion market cap ceiling. That is some incredible growth. And in that time, the company didn’t do much differently than it usually does, upgrading products and shuffling its product line. It didn’t launch a new line of products or move into a new sector. It simply became a stock that everyone wanted for both growth and safety. Apple represents the best of big tech but is also well established — the perfect long-term stock. And the talk about moving into electric or self-driving vehicles is pretty exciting stuff for the decade ahead. In the past year this behemoth is up a whopping 73% and still has a dividend that is better than most bank certificates of deposit (CDs). Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are two things that founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has developed that have launched Amazon into the stratosphere of mega-cap stocks and made it one of the most reliable long-term stocks in the market — a focus on customers and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The former was there from the very beginning. When the company was young and faced off against Barnes & Noble, the biggest bookseller in the world at the time, Bezos told his small crew to worry about the customers, not the competition. And after building a thriving book business and moving into consumer goods, Bezos and his engineers built a massive database that turned into the most successful cloud-computing businesses in the world. 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts With a $1.66 trillion market cap, AMZN continues its expansion. And so does the stock, up 75% in the past 12 months. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Launched by super-investors Elon Musk, Peter Theil, Musk’s brother and a handful of others, PYPL is one of the forefathers of the fintech movement. And it continues to expand its horizons today, even after the founders have moved on to new ventures. The launch of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments platform Venmo wasn’t fully embraced when it started, but now it has spread like wildfire and is one of the dominant P2P payment platforms in the world. At this point, PYPL would be a big fish to swallow by a big financial or tech firm, but it could do some interesting joint ventures or even buy a bank and get into a broader range of traditional bank offerings. That’s a trend in fintech now, and a merger of equals could be interesting. The stock is up 113% in the past 12 months. It’s not exactly cheap, but it has some really exciting long-term prospects to boost its growth. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com One long-term trend sped up last year — the adoption of the digital economy. Between lockdowns and self-imposed isolation, reaching out was done more with electronic devices than in-person interactions. It’s no surprise then that chipmakers had a very good 2020. And that isn’t over. These are long-term stocks that will continue to grow, because we’re not going back to a less digital world when the pandemic is over. There are chips in everything now, from toaster ovens to earbuds. Server farms are getting bigger as the demand for cloud computing and 5G telecom expands. And the largest chipmaking foundry in the world is TSM. You can name almost any major fabless semiconductor maker and it is a client of TSM, including AAPL and NVDA in this article. The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In The Dow Jones Today The stock is up 123% in the past year, yet it’s still trading at a P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 36. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Next on my list of mega-cap stocks, with a $1.5+ trillion market cap, is Microsoft. It wasn’t that long ago that MSFT was teetering between prominence and afterthought. But no longer. It has built its own fast-growing, high-margin cloud-computing division, created its own line of industry standard computers and leveraged its world-renowned software applications. And it now stands as one of the premier long-term tech stocks on the planet. The dominance that Apple displays within its closed garden, MSFT has in the open world beyond the AAPL world. And even there, the two titans have come to a grudging realization that they both need each other for continued growth and support. The crazy thing is, for all the power and promise that MSFT has, it hasn’t risen as quickly as other big tech in the past year — it’s “only” up 37%. It also has a reliable 1% dividend. NVIDIA (NVDA) Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com Graphic processing units (GPUs) were a pretty niche market for a long time. Gamers would pay up for high-performance GPUs, as would research facilities and IT departments in tech-dependent firms. But it wasn’t a major growth sector. And that was good news for NVDA, which dominated the niche. And when it blew up with more digital commerce and mobility, the company was the biggest game in town. As server farms grew to supply big data, cloud computing, 5G and the internet of things, NVIDIA was supplying the chips to run the machines that kept everything buzzing along. That also includes the bitcoin boom. At this point, this GPU firm continues to set the industry standards for performance and quality. Certainly, there are competitors, but NVDA has proven it can deliver time after time. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up 120% in the past year and will continue to be one of top long-term tech stocks in the market. Walmart (WMT) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com After all these sexy big-tech stocks, the world’s largest retailer seems like an oddity on this list of mega-cap stocks. However, it has been WMT’s adoption of tech that has kept it relevant, especially in the past few years. As one of the leading “big-box retailers” there was a significant threat to its business model when the pandemic hit. But WMT had already seen the power of online retail and the threat that AMZN posed if the company didn’t make an effort to develop its own robust e-commerce presence. That has helped keep Walmart a powerhouse. In 2019, the company racked up $340 billion in retail sales. Amazon had $112 billion. AMZN still has a strong lead in online sales (about 38% vs. 5%), but people are shopping again. And they get value for their money when they shop at Walmart. The stock is up just 26% in the past 12 months, is well valued and delivers a solid 1.5% dividend.

2021-01-22,"On its face, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock looks like anything but a buy. Looking even to 2021 earnings, Square stock looks prohibitively expensive. And few stocks, even in this torrid market, have posted bigger rallies off March lows. Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Indeed, SQ has rallied an incredible 603% off its March lows. Its market capitalization now is over $100 billion; ten months ago, it was at $15 billion. A big part of the gains have come from investors applying an ever-higher multiple on the company’s profits. Even in 2019, before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit 2020 (and likely 2021) results, SQ generally traded in the range of 50x or 60x forward earnings. Based on consensus estimates for 2021, that figure now is 200x.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s certainly possible that the rally has gone too far. Valuation indeed looks like the biggest risk. But investors across the market have been rewarded for paying up for growth. For several reasons, those investors still willing to follow that strategy should keep Square stock on their watchlists. The Pandemic, Investment and Valuation Square’s enormous forward price-to-earnings multiple can’t be explained away just by the pandemic. But the pandemic is a factor in that multiple. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day After all, 2021 revenue and earnings are going to be depressed. Square has a significant number of customers that are small businesses and/or restaurants. Many of those businesses remain closed, and no doubt will see decreased traffic even once some semblance of normalcy returns. Lower traffic means lower sales for the business — and lower revenue for Square. And the nature of a platform business means that modestly lower revenues can lead to sharply lower profits. (Of course, the reverse is also true, a key reason why investors are willing to pay a premium for the likes of Square.) It’s not just the pandemic that will reduce 2021 profits. Square is investing behind its business. It’s almost certainly not charging the exact highest rates it could. Research and development and marketing spend all are elevated, as the company looks to spend in the short-term to attract customers that will be hugely valuable over the long haul. Of course, that spend isn’t going to just to the legacy business. Initiatives like Cash App and Square’s bitcoin business both require upfront investment. Over time, as those businesses both grow, Square will benefit both from higher revenue and higher margins — an attractive one-two punch. Cash App To be honest, I personally am not terribly bullish on Square’s legacy point-of-sale business. The market is intensely competitive, and it’s not as if Square is a clear leader. It’s worth noting that Square processed $31.7 billion in Seller GPV (gross payment volume, or the amount of merchant sales run through the platform) in the third quarter. Clover, part of payment processor Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), did $33 billion at a higher growth rate (30% for Clover versus 12% for Square). Fiserv is worth roughly 75% as much as Square, and FISV stock trades at just 20x forward earnings. But Square has two big initiatives that have real potential, and can attract still more growth investors. The first is Cash App. The business has posted absolutely torrid growth, and seems to so far have outcompeted Venmo from rival PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The move into business-to-business has been a huge success, with business GPV up 332% year-over-year in Q3. Cash App as a whole more than tripled gross profit on the back of 154% growth in subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App is a hugely valuable business, but one that likely is a minimal contributor to overall profit at this point. But with nearly $1 billion in gross profit over the past four quarters, an optimist could argue that Cash App alone supports a reasonable chunk of the current $105 billion market capitalization. In this market, a software company generating $1.5 billion in revenue at 70% gross profit might well have a market valuation above $25 billion. An investor reasonably could argue that Cash App, were it a standalone business, deserves to be at least in that ballpark. Bitcoin and Square Stock And, of course, there’s bitcoin. Now, it’s possible that the continued rally in Square stock is coming from investors buying the stock solely as a bitcoin play. For bitcoin skeptics like myself, that might be a red flag. That said, Square stock hasn’t exactly gone nuts. Over the past three months, it’s gained 21%. Bitcoin has rallied over 160%. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has soared 236%, and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) has gained an incredible 575%. So, at least in the past few months, SQ hasn’t exactly been part of the bitcoin bubble (assuming it is a bubble, an assumption with which bulls obviously would disagree). And there is real potential value in the company’s bitcoin efforts, even beyond its current holdings of the cryptocurrency. Indeed, Square generated $32 million in gross profit from bitcoin in Q3. That figure rose 11x year-over-year. As with Cash App, this is a business that as a standalone would have real value. To be fair, there is a question as to whether there’s enough value in bitcoin and Cash App to justify a market capitalization over $100 billion. And if this market turns south, SQ stock is going to take a big hit. But that’s been true for a while now, and particularly true over the past year. Yet Square stock is up 232%. Investors betting that the optimism toward growth stocks will hold might not want to get off this ride just yet.

Nike considers itself a digitally-led company, and CEO John Donahoe, who took the helm last year, has a tech background, previously serving as the CEO of eBay.",3 Stocks That Could Set You Up for Life
2021-01-29,"A few months ago, I began prodding around the idea of, “What are the future FAANG stocks?” We’ve seen Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other tech stocks swell from modest winners to worldwide behemoths. These stocks went from $100 billion to $1 trillion in market capitalization. So many people talk about what it would be like if we had bought Apple in the 1980s or Amazon in 1999. While anyone who did and was able to hold on until now is ridiculously rich, they also sat through a ton of volatility. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Further, investors could have waited until after Apple’s iPhone moment or Amazon’s clear dominance of e-commerce and still made a 10x or more return on their investment. Don’t believe me? Apple is up over 1,000% over the past decade, while Amazon is up 1,760%. Over just the last five years — when it was absurdly clear these two were established leaders — Apple and Amazon are up 463% and 442%, respectively. That led me to ponder, what are the next tech stocks that could become new FAANG leaders? Specifically, I am looking for companies in the $50 billion to $300 billion market cap range that can go to $400 billion to $1 trillion or more. It’s an admittedly wide range, but who cares — these winners are right under our noses. Let’s look at seven tech stocks: 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Tech Stocks to Buy for Future Gains: PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $295 billion Many investors have continued to underestimate PayPal. When it comes to FAANG tech stocks in their younger years, that seems to be a staple observation of them as well. However, PayPal has found a way to become a payment juggernaut. While sending money to friends and family is free and convenient, that’s simply one part of the ecosystem. The company also makes a sliver of sales when involving another business or merchant. It’s become a safe, trusted and convenient way for businesses to sell online or to make subscriptions a piece of cake. PayPal’s acquisition of Venmo and Honey have only added to those layers of engagement, while e-commerce will continue to be the main catalyst behind its growth. For those looking at tech stocks, the power and trend of e-commerce doesn’t need to be explained. Lastly, PayPal’s now in the cryptocurrency game, allowing customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Etherium and Litecoin. Maybe PayPal won’t be able to collect its current “fee” — read: commission — on these transactions forever, based on how stock commissions vanished almost overnight in the brokerage industry. However, for now it should act as an additional growth catalyst. Bonus: At a $100 billion market cap, Square (NYSE:SQ) could also be a consideration as a member of new FAANG tech stocks in this respect. Salesforce (CRM) Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $206 billion. It should go without saying that given the massive gains the stock market has registered over the past nine months, the ideal scenario would be a sizable correction for several of the stocks on this list. However, that doesn’t apply to all of them. Take Salesforce for example. This company keeps on printing money as revenue continues to chug higher. For all the doubt that Salesforce has endured over the years, it has done quite well. It doesn’t seem like management plans on stopping, either. For instance, management is looking to generate $60 billion in revenue by 2034. Most recently, it aims to scoop up Slack (NYSE:WORK), growing its workstation presence and scaling up its fight against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 8 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Your Next Stimulus Check As we are talking about pullbacks, Salesforce is a great example. At the recent low, shares were 25% off the highs. That seems like a great opportunity for a company that continually sports 20%-plus revenue growth. Nvidia (NVDA) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $335 billion Admittedly a bit larger than what we were looking for, Nvidia needs to be included on this list. Almost every major technological trend is growing in demand. More internet traffic is creating strain in the cloud, increasing demand for edge-cloud computing. More data is creating more need for datacenters. Increasing self-driving vehicle capabilities demand more computing power. Better computers demand better graphics. The list goes on and on and Nvidia is there at every turn. The company’s products cater to multiple end markets with impressive secular growth. That’s why, despite the pandemic, Nvidia saw such an extreme acceleration in both earnings and revenue. Its savvy M&A strategy has allowed it to add high-quality names like Mellanox at reasonable valuations. Now Nvidia is going after Arm, a massive $40 billion deal. Nvidia is already nearing an unstoppable state, but with Arm it would be a juggernaut. From a pure antitrust perspective, Nvidia should be fine. However, this “juggernaut” position might cause some hiccups. Either way, this is a high-quality name that will only grow in size over time. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $111.5 billion For Nvidia’s smaller sibling, we have Advanced Micro Devices. At about one-third the size, AMD has quickly climbed the ladder while drastically improving its financials. CEO Lisa Su has orchestrated one of the most impressive comeback stories in the stock market. Once left for dead, AMD was trading firmly below the $2 mark in 2016. Now sporting a 52-week high of $99-and-change, the leadership has been stellar. Like Nvidia, AMD is situated in multiple secular growth themes as rising demand in technology results in rising demand for AMD. Also like Nvidia, AMD saw a massive rise in revenue and profit during the pandemic. In one last final comparison to Nvidia, AMD is also working to close a large acquisition. In October, the company agreed to acquire Xilinx for $35 billion. 9 Stocks Selling at a Discount Right Now While it would require years worth of more growth, it’s not hard to imagine AMD growing to the size of Nvidia ($300 billion). Eventually clearing this level could put it on the lower end of the FAANG status in terms of its size. Roku (ROKU) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $53 billion Roku is a tough one, because it’s certainly the smallest name on this list (by a lot) and it just went on a massive rally. Shares are up 90% over the past three months, as Roku has climbed from a market cap of just $28 billion to where it is today. Additionally, investors just don’t understand this company. They still think it’s going head-to-head with Amazon with its stick players. While that’s kind of true, the story behind Roku isn’t the hardware — it’s the platform. Roku doesn’t care if it’s making money on the hardware. Instead, its focus is on the platform, where it collects fees from content providers and on ad revenue from its free Roku channel. In that respect, growth continues to explode. Analysts expect roughly 50% revenue growth this year, followed by 40% growth in 2021 and 36% growth in 2022. Respectfully, I believe that may be conservative. Bulls will acknowledge that a pullback may be in order (and a potentially large one at that). However, I don’t think the top is in for Roku. For AMD I mentioned the “lower end of the FAANG status,” which would be Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Currently, that’s a $250 billion market cap and remember, NFLX is at a new high. I could see a scenario where Roku pulls back 20% to 25% — giving it a roughly $40 billion market cap — and ultimately roaring on to a $200-plus billion entity. Shopify (SHOP) Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $145 billion There is one problem with Shopify and several other names on this list: The rallies. While the massive rallies great for long-term investors, it makes the stocks susceptible to large pullbacks as well. If and when we get those declines, that’s investors’ opportunity to pounce. For Shopify, the bullish reasoning is multifold. First, Shopify is riding a much large trend — e-commerce — and therefore will continue to benefit from robust growth. When the coronavirus hit, sales were not negatively impacted. Instead, merchants flocked to its platform, driving Shopify’s revenue higher. Second, it’s building out the anti-Amazon business platform — giving merchants big and small power and control of the customer experience. Now the reward here is massive, as Shopify builds out multiple business segments likes shipping, credit, Shopify Pay and others. However, the risk is present as well. That is, can these companies that crave independence from Amazon delivery quality experiences for the customer? In the end, businesses and merchants are at least willing to try. In December 2019 I said investors could buy Shopify despite its lofty valuation. My argument centered on its valuation, saying this name could go from a $40 billion market cap to a $100 to $120 billion market cap in a decade. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times It was not obvious that the more than tripling in its value would take place in just a few months. In the long, long run, it’s not hard to imagine this name being significantly higher. Adobe Systems (ADBE) Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Current market cap: $228 billion Last but not certainly not least is Adobe. This company does a lot more than just Flash or Photoshop. It’s become a mainstay in e-commerce while also becoming a beacon in the graphics, digital and creative landscape. Find me a freelance graphic designer who’s not using Adobe. The stock has quietly racked up enormous gains as well. Adobe is up 140% over the past three years and 430% over the past five years. Over the last decade, the stock has rallied more than 1,300%, as its market cap was around $16 billion just 10 years ago. That’s some impressive action and Adobe doesn’t show many signs of letting up. Analysts expect double-digit earnings and revenue growth this year and next year, while the company gross margins remain solidly above 85%. While its top-line margins have been steady, its bottom-line profit margins have been soaring. Adobe is quickly yet quietly becoming a technology juggernaut right in front of us. Like some others on this list, the stock has been consolidating nicely over the past six months or so. Let’s see if this name can resolve to the upside.

2021-01-29,"While a return to normal is still a distant reality, investors are relying on the biggest pandemic trends when looking at hot stocks to buy for 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic made seismic changes to the way we live our lives. Of course, some trends will eventually fade away. But others are here to stay for the long-haul. For investors, this serves as a great blueprint for picking stocks that show long-term potential. Although unpredictability was the underlying theme of 2020, a few key trends will shape the new normal. To sum it up, this includes e-commerce, music and video streaming, remote work, cybersecurity and at-home fitness. Shifts in consumer behavior reflected many of these trends in 2020 and there is a good chance they will continue to do so long after the pandemic. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times So, based on the trends of the past year, here’s a look at the top stocks to buy in 2021.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Disney (NYSE:DIS) Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021: PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The pandemic brought an end to face-to-face interaction, which meant that paying for goods or services in-person — either with a cash or card — became a thing of the past. This inadvertently led to the rise of digital payment apps and contact-free payments. One of the pioneers in this field? PayPal. The company, founded by Peter Thiel, is a household name in the e-payments sector. While PayPal’s brand name app was once its most famous offering, today the company is best known for its subsidiary, Venmo. The app enables person-to-person digital payment transfers and is compatible with all major devices. More recently, PayPal also announced its cryptocurrency offering, which will allow users to buy, hold and sell the currency on their e-wallet. This will likely incentivize more people to join its payment platform. In terms of the numbers, analyst Dan Dolev of Mizuho Securities says the company’s crypto venture will increase net revenue by 10% in 2023. That’s $2 billion — great news for PYPL stock. Shopify (SHOP) Source: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.com Keeping with the theme of online payments, the pandemic also changed the way we shop for goods and services. Consequently, this forced many businesses to adapt to the digital world. E-commerce — once an option — soon became the primary means to consume or sell products. But what company helped businesses make this sudden transition? Shopify. Shopify is a platform that allows merchants to host their stores online and connect with consumers. This service was crucial for small businesses that had little-to no-online presence prior to the outbreak. In many cases, SHOP became vital to those businesses’ survival. As such, the company’s growth has been spectacular recently (to say the least). Since going public, its shares have grown by a whopping 4000% and 177.6% in 2020. Much of this momentum can be attributed to the high levels of traffic on its platform, which also significantly increased the number of merchants hosting their businesses on Shopify. At this very moment, the company boasts over 1 million merchants on its platform. 8 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Your Next Stimulus Check So, if you had any reason to doubt the potential of SHOP stock before, the numbers speak for themselves. This is clearly one of the top hot stocks to buy in 2021. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com As far as trends go, I wouldn’t really consider Amazon one — it has become more like a part of our daily lives. However, the company’s incredible performance this year earns the e-commerce platform a place on this list. At the onset of the pandemic, Amazon experienced an unprecedented level of demand, forcing it to hire an additional 400,000-plus workers just to keep up. While this hot streak has cooled down a bit since then, customers show no signs of changing their spending habits post-pandemic. That makes AMZN a long-term play worth holding onto. But there’s a second opportunity for Amazon to deliver some incredible returns in the coming years: its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As employees continue to work from home, the cloud computing sector will see some big gains in the coming year (and already has). AWS, which currently holds a 33% market share in the sector, is poised for a solid run. Experts estimate the cloud market will balloon to $331 billion by 2022. Although some investors have shied away from AMZN stock due to its high price, its unique position in multiple sectors and opportunity for growth make it hard to ignore. When it comes to hot stocks, this one is a no-brainer. Disney (DIS) Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com Theme parks and movies are synonymous with the name Disney, but the pandemic practically brought an end to both lines of business. With parks and movie theatres closed for months on end, the company adapted and found its diamond in the rough in the form of Disney+. An emerging business segment prior to the pandemic, the stay-at-home economy catapulted the streaming platform’s growth to new highs. After a dip at the start of 2020, DIS stock has now more than doubled from its 2020 lows and even ended last year with a 25.3% gain. Looking ahead, the future of Disney rests in its streaming platform. By the end of 2020, the company amassed a subscriber base of 86.8 million and counting. This growth can be attributed to its large library of films, which DIS hopes to add to in the coming year. For instance, the company just introduced a new Marvel series and is set to include shows based in its the Star Wars universe. 9 Stocks Selling at a Discount Right Now Basically, the pandemic pushed Disney+ into stardom, allowing the company to stay in the limelight. If you are willing to bet on the power of streaming, Disney is one of the best hot stocks to invest in. Crowdstrike (CRWD) Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com The rise of the remote work environment, while convenient for many, has also paved the way for increased cyber threats. This year, cybersecurity companies like Crowdstrike played a key role in helping employees manage cyber issues. One of the company’s hallmark features is its ability to identify and stop threats before they occur. This is done using its Falcon platform, which uses existing information on the client network to stop a cyberattack. In terms of numbers, Crowdstrike is what I consider to be a high-growth stock. The company’s revenue levels have increased by 85% year-over-year (YOY). Moreover, subscribers to its services grew exponentially. Given that the cybersecurity company is a leader in the space, it’s well-positioned to expand and capitalize on upcoming market opportunities. The only downside to this investment is the price of CRWD stock, which is currently trading at 59.8 times sales at the time of this writing. But, because remote work is a trend that’s here to stay, Crowdstrike is definitely one of the hot stocks with long-term potential. Spotify (SPOT) Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com The great streaming rally of 2020 wasn’t just limited to the movie business — it included music as well. Notably, streaming giant Spotify had a phenomenal run in 2020, earning it a place on this list of hot stocks to buy. For one, the name started the year with a share price of around $150 and closed at over $314. Spotify also saw growth in a number of areas. For instance, monthly active users (MAUs) were up by 29% as of September in a YOY comparison. However, one of the biggest stories to come out of Spotify in 2020 was its big bet on podcasts. While the outcome of these acquisitions is yet to be seen, the company is hoping for some big gains in the coming years. Looking ahead, SPOT also has some major plans for expansion. Adding to its global customer base — which includes Russia and a number of European countries — the streaming service is looking to launch in South Korea next. This is a huge market in Asia and could add substantially to the app’s user base. A larger number of subscribers will also allow the company to sell more ad inventory and keep revenue flowing. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy On The Market Today So, all the arrows point toward greater growth for SPOT stock in 2021 and beyond. Peloton (PTON) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Last on my list of hot stocks to buy is Peloton. That’s because — while some changes brought about by the pandemic appear to be fleeting — the at-home workout trend seems to be here to stay. Peloton’s interactive bikes (which start at around $1,900) were once considered too expensive as far as in-home workout equipment goes. However, after gym closures at the start of the pandemic, PTON’s bikes soon became an appealing option for many. With a $39 monthly subscription that provides access to an array of classes, its bikes make for one of the best gym experiences you can get from the comfort of your home. While one could argue that PTON stock’s rally will end once gyms open up, it’s worth noting that consumer trends are often driven by the convenience factor. To that end, Peloton is convenient. Plus, it’s ability to provide users with world-class trainers at home remains unmatched. Hence, there is a good chance we’re going to be seeing a lot more from Peloton post-pandemic. With its revenue at $363 million in 2020, over 3.1 million subscribers and ambitions for 100 million, Peloton is a great bet on the future of remote fitness.

2021-01-30,"Ladies and gentleman, welcome to “Altseason.” Source: Shutterstock This isn’t like the “holiday season,” or a meteorological season like winter, spring, summer, and fall. This is a season of price surges and wealth creation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s a season I highly recommend you understand and take advantage of … I like to call it Altseason for short, but the longer name you may hear from others is “altcoin season.” Altcoins are any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. Bitcoin was the first crypto and is by far the largest with a market cap of nearly $700 billion. So altcoins are … well … everything else. When companies are worth $700 billion, big stock moves are hard to come by. But if you’ve followed bitcoin at all in recent weeks, you’ve seen it rocket higher … from $10,000 to $40,000 in less than four months. It even doubled from $20,000 to $40,000 in just three weeks. But too many people stop there. Altseason is about recognizing the other, smaller cryptocurrencies — altcoins, which are really the software programs of the future — that few people know about. They may be smaller, but they make bigger price moves. Usually much bigger … Just look at the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. It has made all-time highs of its own. In the same time that bitcoin is up a little over 200%, Ethereum has jumped closer to 300%. As bitcoin continues to make headlines, I think back to when I was pounding the table on buying it below $10k. It was not a popular call with a lot of folks. Many believed cryptocurrencies were a dying fad. Not only were the skeptics wrong then, those who remain skeptical now will miss out on one of the greatest investment trends of the century. Bitcoin $100k is not unrealistic at all. And as the bellwether cryptocurrency sets up for more upside, select smaller altcoins are poised to move even higher. That’s Altseason. This isn’t something I made up. It’s not even new. We’ve had Altseasons before. Altseasons follow an event that’s baked into bitcoin’s software code. It’s called the “halvening” — or “halving” — when the amount of new bitcoin coming onto the market gets cut it in half. Less new supply at a time of strong demand pushes prices higher. But the biggest opportunity by far — and the one few people know about — is in select altcoins. In past Altseasons following bitcoin’s halvenings, the best altcoins not only followed bitcoin higher … they outperformed it. In the typical scenario after past halvenings, bitcoin rallies and breaks out first… and then altcoins follow with even more amazing gains as investors look for the next big winners. Bitcoin has soared after its latest halvening event. And now altcoins look to be beginning their big surge as well. That makes now the time to buy to get in for the biggest gains. Plus, there’s another factor to consider that could make this Altseason the biggest one yet … The big money is coming in. Nearly nine months after the new supply of bitcoin got cut in half, the amount being bought by large firms such as Square (NYSE:SQ), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Grayscale is higher than ever. In addition, several high-profile investors and firms are talking about bitcoin much more positively than before. Among the best known is billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. He called it the best hedge against inflation, and he compared investing in bitcoin now to investing early in tech stocks. He also thinks bitcoin is only in the first inning (out of nine). There’s also Bill Miller, the legendary mutual fund manager who famously beat the S&P 500 every year from 1991 to 2005. He also turned bullish on bitcoin, even urging investors who do not have exposure to buy. This is an important shift. In past years, rallies have been driven more by individual investors flocking to bitcoin. This time, big money is largely responsible for the latest rally. Big money is just now dipping its toes into the world of cryptocurrencies, showing that it is still early in the game with a lot more to come. Remember, cryptocurrencies aren’t fantasy internet money. The technology that bitcoin and altcoins are built on — the blockchain — is the future. Just about everything will one day be built on the blockchain. It’s going to touch virtually every industry on Earth. Sending money around the world will take seconds and cost mere pennies. Buying a home will take days, not weeks — and the transaction will cost a small percentage of what it does today. Even tracking a vaccine from the time it was created to the needle going into your arm will be done on the blockchain. It blows my mind to think about what’s coming, and this transformation is already underway. The blockchain and cryptocurrencies are being used in more and more places all the time, and this massive disruption creates a once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity for smart investors like you who are acting today. Blockchain technology is the software of the Roaring 2020s. The best way to build wealth from this huge trend is through the best and strongest altcoins.

2021-02-01,"Last week’s volatility and market disruption can take a long time to settle down, so strap in. The new month starts with Wall Street in an unfamiliar position: Down for the year. Friday’s selloff accelerated a turnaround that began earlier in the week, putting a red mark on the major indices’ January performance. Heading into Monday, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) was down 1.1% so far in 2021, with the Nasdaq (COMP) off 1.4% and the previously high-flying Russell 2000 Index (RUT) down a sharp 5%. Keep things in perspective, though. The SPX is up about 66% from last year’s lows, and nothing can climb forever without a break. Despite all the wild action last week and so much uncertainty about what would happen—even with the inner workings of the market itself—the market rallied back overnight, and trading seems to be going normally this morning. There may be margin restrictions from some firms, but otherwise it looks like typical trading. Like Ringing A Bell: Volatility Not Necessarily Departing Some of last week’s turbulence and volatility survived the weekend into Sunday night and early Monday. If you were watching the futures market, maybe you noticed how the major indices were down sharply last night before reversing course and charging higher ahead of the opening bell. Usually when there’s trading like we saw last week, it doesn’t get right back to normal, so you probably shouldn’t expect that. Instead, this volatile trading is like a big bell ringing—the reverberations can last a while. More volatility is almost certainly ahead, along with the chance of some dramatic swings back and forth. Anyone planning on trading the market right now should consider taking extra caution and possibly keeping trade sizes smaller than normal. Volatility is slightly lower this morning but that won’t necessarily last. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is still well above 30, compared with the historic average near 20. There’s also a strange relationship going on early today with volatility down but bonds up. In addition, the bond market is on the rise even while stocks rallied an amazing amount from their lows overnight. There’s a disconnect between the bond and the equity market at the moment, so we’ll have to see what the outcome is. It’s not like the bond market is exactly flashing caution, but bonds and VIX being up reinforce the chance for volatile trading. It’s a big earnings week and we’ve got a lot of data coming, too, including Friday’s monthly jobs report. Two FAANGs—Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)—step up to the plate tomorrow afternoon. The hits keep coming. Then there’s the elephant in the room. Anyone paying any attention at all knows about the focus on short squeezes that brought fame (and some fortune) to stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). There’ve been disruptions all over the world, and now the stock market is feeling some disruption and a change of tone. The short squeezes certainly had a lot to do with it. The way people interact with the market is a little different than in the past. There’s a storm of a lot of things coming together leading to a disruption in the market overall. These kinds of disruptions occur every 10 or 12 years and the market has always survived them. Despite the disappointing end to last week, try to keep things in perspective. The SPX is still up 13.5% in the last three months, and remains around 3.5% below this month’s all-time highs. If a market correction is defined as a 10% decline from the high, we’re not even halfway there yet. That might feel reassuring in one sense, but it should also mean caution. There could be more weakness ahead if this downturn is going to become a correction, which can’t be ruled out. The argument against that is there just hasn’t been a lot of interest among investors to really push the market down over the last few months. Every time the SPX dropped to its 20-day moving average since Nov. 1, it met new buyers in what became called a “buy the dip” trade. Last week the SPX actually did fall below the 20-day and then ended slightly below the 50-day moving average near 3716 (see chart below). The question heading into this week is whether any technical support in that area holds, or if selling picks up. Earnings Parade Still Gathering Steam It’s kind of interesting that all this happened at a time when you could point to some actual positive developments in the background. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) both reported earnings that are about as solid as it gets and this week brings Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Other big names penciled into the earnings lineup this week include PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON). The PTON report could be interesting for insight on how the company plans to handle things once people get back to normal following the pandemic. PTON has done well with everyone stuck at home, but will demand remain this strong once people are comfortable going back to the gym? The UPS earnings are probably worth a close look for what they might say about the consumer economy, especially considering the quarter included the holiday season. Speaking of which, AMZN earnings could give clues into holiday sales, too, as well as a look at how AMZN’s cloud growth did in a very competitive environment where Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader. MSFT’s cloud growth was huge in its recent quarter. PYPL could be interesting for what, if anything, they have to say about cryptocurrency. Penn National Gaming, Inc (NASDAQ: PENN) is another one to look out for this week with so much interest in the gaming sector since we all got sent home. CHART OF THE DAY: FINDING NEW SUPPORT. After bouncing off its support of the 20-day moving average (yellow line), the S&P 500 Index (SPX—candlestick) broke below it on Wednesday and has traded below it since then. It’s now moved down to its 50-day moving average (blue line) and closed just a hair below it at 3714.18. It’s too early to tell if this will be the next support level but it’s something to keep an eye on. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Lots of Numbers: Data-wise, investors might want to keep their eyes open this morning for the latest on construction spending and the ISM manufacturing index. The manufacturing sector has generally had a good performance lately, and the ISM headline number last time out was the highest since 2018 at 60.7%. The employment index also grew. Analysts expect the headline number to be just a bit lower for January at 60.1%, according to research firm Briefing.com. The big data gorilla this week is employment on Friday. Jobs are always the number one number to watch, and last month’s report was disappointing. A lot of the losses were in just one sector, however—with Leisure and Hospitality positions falling by nearly 500,000 in December. We’ll dig more into expectations for the January report later this week. Technical Picture: The two big numbers to watch this week could be 30,000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and 3700 in the SPX. The two indices flirted with those levels late Friday, and the $DJI ultimately closed just below 30,000. If they hop back above those levels today and manage to hold on, that would probably be seen as a technical victory that could suggest a little recovery ahead. Longer-term technical support is in a range between 3633 and 3695, according to research firm CFRA. This is where the “buy the dip” crowd meets a test: Will they still want to buy the dip after the main crunch of earnings season ends and the world continues to stumble trying to fight the pandemic? A Second Look at J&J Data: The vaccine data from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) released on Friday initially got a fish-eye from some investors because it generally wasn’t as strong as the vaccines already on the market. That was the initial reaction, anyway. As analysts and investors had time to give the data a closer look, they actually found reasons to be positive. Some said the lower efficacy might not be a huge deal considering the logistical convenience of having just one dose for JNJ’s vaccine vs. two doses for others. Then there were analysts and vaccine experts quoted in the media saying that JNJ’s efficacy was generally better than we get from those flu vaccines most of us take each year. Let’s put this whole thing in context: If anyone had told you a year ago when the virus first hit that a year later there would be two effective vaccines available and two more—JNJ and Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX)—possibly available soon—it would have been considered pretty improbable. We’re a long way from out of the woods, but the JNJ data aren’t necessarily a reason for enthusiasm to fade. JNJ said it would file for regulatory approval soon, and the vaccine’s efficacy appears to meet the efficacy goals outlined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q4 earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Analysts predict PayPal Holdings will report earnings of $1.0 per share on revenue of $6.09 billion. PayPal Holdings reported a per-share profit of $0.86 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $4.96 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter.

2021-02-04,"In the current session, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is trading at $270.68, after a 7.45% spike. Over the past month, the stock increased by 15.16%, and in the past year, by 127.69%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently above from its 52 week high by 6.40%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on PYPL Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. PayPal Holdings Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 95.06 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 78.08 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that PayPal Holdings Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

2021-02-04,"Wednesday was a calm day for Wall Street, but a sensational one for PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) after it reported strong results and lit the market during after-hours trading. PayPal's profit tripled, pushing earnings way past estimates and stock 3-4% up. PayPal's sensational performance In the fourth quarter, PayPal added 16 million new active accounts which is a 72% increase from last year's figure, bringing the total for 2020 to 72.7 million. That pushed revenue for the quarter up 23% and adjusted earnings by 29%. Total payment volume for the year soared by more than 30% despite travel-related activity having nearly evaporated during the pandemic. PayPal reported its strongest-ever quarterly growth in payment volume during its fourth quarter with $277 billions as the company enjoyed its strongest year in its history. Q4 figures Accounting for the acquisition of Honey Science, PayPal earnings climbed 29% to $1.08 an adjusted share on revenue that rose 23% to $6.12 billion. Both exceeded analyst estimates of $1 a share on revenue of $6.09 billion, as well as prior year's quarter earnings of 86 cents a share on sales of $4.96 billion. For the fourth quarter, it earned profit of $1.57 billion, up from $507 million a year earlier. Operating cash flow rose 46% to $1.35 billion, and free cash flow jumped 50% to $1.12 billion. 2021 outlook The future looks bright for PayPal. Although its, or more precisely Venmo's, rivalry with Square (NYSE: SQ) is expected to intensify this year, it signed a ton of new merchants in 2020, including Footlocker (NYSE: FL), Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE: LEVI), Macy's (NYSE: M) and Uniqlo. It will aim to enhance its pay-later alternatives in an answer to companies like Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM). It finally boarded the crypto train last November and plans to push to have digital currency as a direct funding source across its base of 29 million merchants. As hopefully brighter days are ahead, and the global economy recovers, PayPal is expected to keep profiting from its recovery. Cryptocurrency Some had expected cryptocurrency to play a bigger role in PayPal's success, but if anything, the strength of its core business is even better news as there will be time to develop on this front as well. The company hopes to add another 50 million accounts in 2021 and keep producing solid growth rates as it will enhance its digital currency offerings. Digital is now the reality PayPal had its best year in its history and this milestone coincided with unprecedented e-commerce numbers as the pandemic kept people inside and closed brick and mortar stores, especially during the holiday season. Both CEO John Schulman and CFO John Rainey emphasized that a ""digital-first world"" has become our reality. This article is not a press release and is contributed by IAMNewswire.

2021-02-04,"Shares of PayPal Holdings gained 5.5% in Wednesday’s extended trading session after the payment platform provider's fourth-quarter sales and earnings topped Street estimates. PayPal’s (PYPL) 4Q adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share grew 29% year-over-year and exceeded analysts’ expectations of $1 per share. The company's 4Q sales of $6.12 billion beat the consensus estimates of $6.09 billion and rose 23% year-over-year, driven by higher payment volumes and the addition of net new active accounts. The company’s total payment volume (TPV) grew 39% to $277 billion, while merchant services volume climbed 42%, and Venmo app’s TPV jumped 60%. The company added 16 million net new active accounts and ended the quarter with 377 million active accounts, marking a 24% year-over-year increase. As for 2021, PayPal expects revenue to grow by about 19% to $25.5 billion and the momentum in TPV growth and net new active accounts to sustain. The company forecasted for adjusted earnings per share to increase by 17% this year. For the first quarter, the company anticipates revenue growth of 28% and adjusted earnings growth of about 50% year-over-year. (See PayPal stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 3, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $300 (19.1% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, “while PYPL has been a clear outperformer during the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers have adopted digital payments at an unprecedented rate, the company’s very strong operating performance during FY20 occurred despite a steep decline in travel and event-related volumes, pointing to incremental upside as the pandemic’s impact abates.” Overall, the Street has a bullish outlook with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $273.12 implies upside potential of about 8.4% to current levels. That's after shares rallied 121.2% over the past year.

2021-02-04,"Credit Suisse analyzes a sector Big Tech is in no hurry to get into and expresses a preference for international merchant acquirers and processors, including PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL). The payments business exploits secular growth trends, starting with the ongoing trend towards detachment from cash, which has resulted in a strong digital payments growth over the last decade, according to a 2020 McKinsey report. The structural growth of the payments market is clearly visible in network companies and for processor/merchant acquirers. Aside from moving money, innovations such as NFC cards for proximity use, peer-to-peer (P2P) feature and push payments support the ecosystem. See also: The Best Free or Cheap PayPal Alternatives An E-Commerce Accelerated Trend: Samuel Traub, Equity Research Analyst - Banks/Insurance at Credit Suisse, pointed out that the e-commerce secular trend is also growing fast, pushing digital payments activities and creating new needs. Both incumbent and newcomer operators have developed capabilities in remote digital payments, with PayPal leading the way in online payments. On the customer side, innovative solutions have also emerged such as digital wallets and P2P payment apps, reflecting the preference for convenience and speed, made possible by smartphone penetration. Big Tech Hesitates To Get In: The Credit Suisse analyst noted that big tech names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have been making waves the industry for some time now, taking advantage of the user base size and also aiming to create a connection among merchants in order to facilitate consumer-to-business payments. However, for the time being, Big Tech hesitates to enter a heavily regulated industry and prefer to partner with credit cards and banks, even though they may use their payment capabilities as a backdoor to build a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform in the future. Investment Names And Ideas: Having said that, despite generally lofty valuations, Credit Suisse sees attractive investment opportunities in the larger global card networks - with a preference for Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) - but also considers digital-enabled merchant acquirers and processors with a broad range of products and international experience such as Adyen (OTC: ADYEY), PayPal, Fiserv Inc. (NYSE: FISV), Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and Global Payments Inc. (NYSE: GPN). This article originally appeared on Financialounge.com and was translated from Italian to English.

2021-02-05,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. said regulators are investigating the company’s popular person-to-person payments app Venmo.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is probing Venmo’s processes for collections and unauthorized fund transfers, PayPal said in an annual regulatory filing. The payments giant said that the agency requested documents and answers to written questions in a civil investigative demand PayPal received on Jan. 21.“We are cooperating with the CFPB,” PayPal said in the filing Friday. Tia Elbaum, a spokesperson for the bureau, declined to comment on its investigation.The company’s shares fell 1.3% to $266.91 at 11:09 a.m. in New York. They have gained 14% this year, more than the 3.8% increase for the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index.PayPal has faced criticism in recent years for engaging in collections or debiting accounts when users turn up with negative balances in their Venmo wallets.“If you have amounts past due, you should confirm that your payment methods contain funds sufficient to cover any amounts past due,” Venmo said in its user agreement. “This will help you avoid overdraft or other fees your financial institution may charge.”The CFPB is led by acting director Dave Uejio, who was named to the position by President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.(Updates with CFPB declining to comment in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Says Venmo Being Probed by Consumer-Banking Watchdog

2021-02-05,"PayPal (PYPL) was a prime beneficiary of the pandemic driven pivot to digital payments last year. As the company’s strong 4Q20 results can attest, the trend showed no signs of wavering right until the year’s end. Profit tripled in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, with net income rising from $507 million in 4Q19 to $1.57 billion, translating to EPS of $1.32 vs. last year’s $0.43. The figure also beat consensus estimates by $0.66. There was a beat on the top-line, too, with revenue hitting $6.12 billion, coming in ahead of the Street’s forecast by $30 million, and amounting to a year-over-year increase of 23.4%. The company generated $277 billion in total payment volume (TPV), a 39% year-over-year uptick, despite travel and events volume – which before the pandemic represented roughly 10% of all volume – declining by 50% in FY20. Looking ahead to 1Q21, at current spot rates, PayPal expects revenue to increase by 28%, higher than the Street’s 22% growth forecast. As for the whole of 2021, PayPal said it is expecting high 20-percent TPV growth while the Street anticipated growth to be in the mid-20s. So, good news all around. However, the outlook is even rosier, says BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, when you take into consideration the promise shown by PayPal’s latest initiatives. PayPal launched crypto trading in the U.S. at the start of the quarter, and CEO Dan Schulman noted crypto volume growth had “exceeded management’s projections.” “While PYPL did not disclose those volumes, Schulman noted that customers who purchased crypto had been logging into the company’s platform at a rate double their login frequency prior to buying crypto,” the 5-star analyst said. “Schulman noted that PYPL intends to enable its ~29mm merchants around the world to use crypto as a funding source later in 1Q21, adding that it planned to expand the initiative to peer-to-peer payment app Venmo and select international markets during 1H21.” Additionally, the company said its BNPL (buy now pay later) feature, released in 2H20, “represented the best start for any product it has ever released.” PayPal had more than $750 million in volume from ~2.8 million unique customers in the quarter, and the service’s expansion will see PayPal further penetrate what is expected to be a $166 billion global market by 2023. Accordingly, Palmer reiterated a Buy rating on PYPL shares, and his $300 price target implies ~11% upside from current levels. (To watch Palmer’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 analyst remains on the sidelines while all 16 other recent reviews say ‘buy.’ PYPL’s Strong Buy consensus rating is backed by a $273.12 average price target, suggesting upside of 8% over the coming months.

2021-02-05,"Cautious investors may be nervous about buying into Square (NYSE:SQ) at today’s prices. Square stock has surged almost five-fold since April. But, as long as its growth story stays in motion, expect valuation concerns to remain secondary. Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Why? Chalk it up to the strong performance of its customer-facing Cash App business. Now making up two-thirds of its revenue, this platform has moved beyond just peer-to-peer payments. The platform has found success offering trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (CCC:BTC). Its recent move into stock brokerage services has shown success as well, and could benefit from the recent controversy surrounding Robinhood.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What about Square’s Seller Ecosystem (point of sale, Square Capital) segment? As seen in its last quarterly results release, this unit has continued to grow, albeit moderately. But this could pick up going forward. Why? The “digitalization of payments” megatrend (more below) could start to accelerate post-Covid. In addition, this segment could perform better than expected, if we get over the pandemic in the coming year. 8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal The Cash App segment may be getting the most attention. But, the Seller Ecosystem remains an important part of this fintech supermarket. Of course, it’s not guaranteed that good times will continue for Square stock. Given its frothy valuation, shares could see a downsized pullback if the stock market starts heading in the wrong direction. But, outside of general market risk, there’s little on the horizon to make this “story stock” fall out of favor with investors. In short, a good chance shares continue to trend higher. Square Stock, and the Runaway Success of Cash App The future looks bright for Square, thanks to the runway success of its CashApp segment. As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier discussed Jan. 29, CashApp has delivered triple-digit growth in the past three quarters. We have yet to see results for the quarter ending Dec. 31. But it looks likely we’ll see a fourth consecutive quarter of blockbuster results. Like I said above, it’s more than just peer-to-peer payments that’s fueling growth for CashApp. The company has also found success with its crypto and stock trading services. With the controversy surrounding Robinhood after the GameStop (NYSE:GME) “short squeeze saga,” CashApp’s brokerage growth could speed up, as longtime Robinhood users move over to this other retail-friendly platform. On the other hand, there’s no guarantee there will be a mass exodus from Robinhood. In fact, there’s evidence that all the attention surrounding the GameStop affair has helped to increase downloads of the popular retail brokerage app. Yet, this possible outcome played a role in Mizuho Securities’ latest “buy” rating on Square stock. Mizuho’s analyst team is not only bullish on CashApp’s prospects, but also the potential of its overlooked Seller Ecosystem unit. Speaking of this unit, there are two potential developments that could improve its results. Both in the coming year, and throughout the 2020s. Why Digitalization of Payments Will Boost Its Legacy Business The past year has been a banner one for Square. However, far from just seeing a short-term boost from pandemic-related tailwinds, the long-term appears bright as well for Square. Analysts at Cowen recently broke down how the “digitalization of payments” megatrend is set to accelerate in a post-Covid world. In other words, the eventual move to entirely cashless transactions. This may mostly benefit Square’s fintech rival, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), as well as legacy payment giants like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V). But, Square stands to gain from this as well. Large companies may be early adopters of all-cashless point-of-sale transactions. But, over time, smaller businesses like restaurants will likely make this shift as well. Besides this longer-term catalyst, there is also the Covid recovery factor to consider as well. InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst Luke Lango mentioned this on Feb. 1, when he made the case why Square stock is headed to $300 per share. In short, as in-person businesses like restaurants and retailers get back to normal in 2021, the Seller Ecosystem segment should see a strong performance over the next few quarters. Outside of a Market Crash, Shares Could Continue to Climb In my book, Square looks overvalued. All it will take is one hiccup for this top -performing stock to reverse course. Yet, so much remains on its side. Outside of an overall market correction/crash, I don’t see shares heading lower anytime soon. Instead, as more positive news comes out (such as its upcoming Q4 earnings release), Square stock will likely head towards higher price levels. Tread carefully, but this remains a solid opportunity for growth-minded investors. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a LONG position in bitcoin.

2021-02-05,"There is no in-between with the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin (CCC:BTC). If you somehow managed to get on board back in mid-2017 (when a single coin fetched about $3,000) or even January 2019 (about $3,500), you are either laughing all the way to the bank or the nearest private jet dealership. As I type this sentence, that bitcoin is worth some $32,200. Holy crypto, Batman! Source: Shutterstock Yet for those thinking of buying some of that screaming-hot currency now, it’s a poignant moment of self-pity. Speaking as the guy who said to avoid bitcoin at all costs when it fetched just $700 — a seeming fortune then — banging my head against a wall simply won’t do.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I have often thought of strapping my know-it-all noggin to a cannon and firing it at a wall of diamonds, the hardest known material in the universe. 7 Blue Chip Stocks to Help Prepare For Your Retirement Where once a single diamond could buy a mountain of bitcoins, a single bitcoin can buy a mountain of diamonds. Still, it comes back to a question you and I surely must ponder: It is too late to get in? People, some of them incredibly smart, thought that the various milestones of $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000 represented a ridiculous peak, but, given that it hit $32,000, could $40,000 be far behind? Bitcoin and Going With Your Cast-Iron Gut Make no mistake, investing in bitcoin requires a cast-iron stomach and a more chill disposition than most. That’s because bitcoin’s astonishing summits often presage meteoric falls. Like: $19,650 on Dec. 15, 2017 to $3,184 exactly one year later. Even on Jan. 21, it slid by 13% in one day. Just days before, it flirted with $42,000. This to my mind is like gazillionaire Jeff Bezos watching his beloved Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) suddenly transform itself into a K-Mart in Logansport, Ind., and back again. If only it were that simple. You see, compared to Bezos or even the local hardware store owner, Satoshi Nakomoto is no household name. He’s the man behind bitcoin. Or maybe the woman. Or a bunch of people. No one knows. And it’s likely we never will. Plus the urban myth surrounding bitcoin is even stranger: that Satoshi (or his/her stunt double/triple) proposed bitcoin after buying a vintage McDonald’s napkin online and getting ripped off. Really. Yes, really. Cryptocurrency Concerns Fast forward to 2021, and you’ll find that bitcoin still has no central government backing it. Nor can one determine its concrete value because, in the strictest sense, there’s no underlying product, rare mineral, real estate or tangible assets that support it. Thus comes the strong argument that bitcoin, much like Beanie Babies, is only worth whatever people think it is worth based on the finite number that exist. And yet, bitcoin has lasted 11 years as a commercially usable currency. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz used 10,000 bitcoins to purchase two Papa John’s pizzas. If he could’ve held off on his Papa John’s pizza jones for just a few hours and stashed the cyber-loot instead, that $41 ’za fund would be worth $322 million. Imagine if he had tipped the delivery dude. All Eyes on ‘Betcoin’ As for what else has changed about bitcoin in its recent history, investors must first know this: Powerhouse investment banks follow it closely. Not that there’s any unanimity, because it isn’t as if you can look at quarterly reports or earnings per share when making a call. On the one hand, JPMorgan predicted on Jan. 4 that bitcoin’s price could rise above $146,000 in long term. Then you have guys like Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd. He told CNBC on Jan. 21 that, “For the time being, we have probably put in a top for the next year or so.” He added that BTC could even retreat to $20,000. All at once or bit by bit? Meanwhile, I’m thinking: Where’s that cast-iron stomach and 200x bottle of Pepto Bismol when you need it? My bottom line is this: Bitcoin is essentially “betcoin.” The market is so rife with speculation that if the speculators magically turned into more bitcoins, the world’s supply would double or triple. But if you choose to get in on the action, there are at least a few straws to grasp. My Bottom Line: Bet It, Forget It First, many people are treating bitcoin like gold, a place to store value that could weather economic storms, including any stock market crash or political upheaval. Strange as it may sound, if Capitol rioters had succeeded with their violent goals in January, it’s possible Wall Street could’ve collapsed, but bitcoins would likely have stayed safe or even skyrocketed. Second, speaking of Wall Street, there’s a potential sign of supercharged life. ETF heavyweight VanEck filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a new bitcoin ETF (the VanEck Bitcoin Trust) on Dec. 30. Other such applications have been shot down in the past, but this one may succeed. Third (and in a word), ubiquity. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), for example, is buying up the crypto in what many see as a move to accommodate the cryptocurrancy on the online payments system. That’s largely a recognition that many online merchants already take bitcoin, and PayPal wants a piece of the action. These realities, to my thinking, support the argument for investing in bitcoin — albeit carefully and with maximum resistance to check its price daily, weekly or even monthly. You see, while bitcoin hops up and down in price like a battleship-sized rabbit, it isn’t going away. Yes, bitcoin is here to stay. Even if our dear old fantasy friend Satoshi is nowhere to be found. If he exists, then for all I know he’s kicking back in a Speedo, sipping umbrella drinks on his Caribbean island, his ample belly jiggling as he laughs, and using his bitcoins to fill an airplane hanger with vintage fast food napkins.

2021-02-05,"PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) CEO Daniel Schulman announced during an earnings call this week his firm’s intent to expand the functionality of Venmo, a mobile-friendly payments app. What Happened: Venmo is a holistic platform for payments and money transfers. As part of a vision to unlock access to fast and easy mobile payments, the company’s parent announced it would amp up innovation around the platform, adding cryptocurrency; the ability to save money; and to stay in the know on shopping deals through integrated tools from Honey, a platform for savings, deals and rewards. ""We all know the current financial system is antiquated, and we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds, not days; a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete; and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent,"" Schulman said. ""We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future."" Why It Matters: PayPal is looking to increase financial wellness by unlocking access to the nascent asset class. The company recently added trade support for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. through a partnership with Paxos Trust Company. Going forward, the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto assets on the Venmo platform will be added, while PayPal will look to expand the depth and breadth of its financial services offering with budgeting, savings and investing tools. ""We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months,"" the CEO said. This is ""just the beginning of an extensive roadmap around crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies,"" he said.

2021-02-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. should follow in Tesla Inc.’s footsteps, but by getting into cryptocurrencies, not electric vehicles, according to RBC Capital Markets.The iPhone maker could create a sizable new market for growth if it were to develop its Apple Wallet into a crypto exchange, said analyst Mitch Steves.”The wallet initiative appears to be a clear multi-billion dollar opportunity for the firm (potential for well over $40 billion in annual revenue with limited R&D),” Steves wrote in a note to clients.Companies like Square Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., along with closely held exchanges like Coinbase, have all validated the exchange model as a real business, he said, and Apple would immediately gain market share if it were to enter the industry. In addition, Apple’s ecosystem would offer improved security relative to the companies that would be its competitors.Apple shares, up about 70% in the past year, closed up about 0.1% in Monday’s session. PayPal has climbed nearly 40% since it announced it would allow customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies directly from their PayPal accounts.RBC’s comments come at a time when companies have been showing more interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Notably, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and indicated its interest in accepting the cryptocurrency as a form of payment Monday. That helped send Bitcoin prices up as much as 16%, cresting $44,000 and hitting a record. Tesla rose 1.3% on Monday.While Apple’s biggest cryptocurrency opportunity would be in building an exchange, it could also consider adding Bitcoin or another digital currency to its balance sheet, RBC wrote. “This would send even more users to ‘Apple Exchange,’” Steves said, and would likely further boost Bitcoin prices.Earlier on Monday, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. said they weren’t in talks with Apple to develop an autonomous vehicle. While analysts have been optimistic about the prospect of Apple entering the automotive industry in some fashion, RBC was less effusive, writing that such a move was a higher-risk proposition than crypto.(Updates to close of trading.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Apple Should Create Crypto Exchange and Buy Bitcoin, Says RBC"

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, PayPal Holdings posted an ROCE of 0.05%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on PYPL Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.

2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase this week sent the cryptocurrency soaring to a record, with many of its most vocal adherents feeling validated in their “to the moon” predictions. For the largest U.S. banks, prospects for the digital asset are decidedly more earthbound.Top lenders still mostly shy away from crypto. While futures contracts based on Bitcoin and Ether, the second-largest digital currency, are available at major exchanges, none of the six biggest U.S. banks offer their customers access.Their reticence should come as no surprise: Banks weren’t invited to the crypto party in the first place.“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the person or people who developed Bitcoin, wrote in the 2008 white paper that helped lay the groundwork for the digital asset.There are other reasons banks are still mostly on the sidelines. While Bitcoin is now more than 11 years old, there are very few things it can actually buy. And volatility is a major risk, as even Tesla said in a filing disclosing its purchase.Here is crypto’s state of play at the top U.S. banks:JPMorganJPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, is the furthest along.The firm last year agreed to take on Bitcoin exchanges Coinbase Inc. and Gemini Trust Co. as banking clients, breaking with an industry that had routinely forbidden Bitcoin businesses from accessing its services. The decision was meant to help virtual exchanges manage cash in the U.S., but the New York-based bank still won’t be handling any cryptocurrency transactions.It was nevertheless quite a turnaround from 2017, when Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin a “fraud” and threatened to fire any employee caught trading it. He later said he regretted the comments, and now says he sees many ways the bank can use blockchain technology. Here’s one: In 2019, JPMorgan turned to crypto to help speed up corporate payments using a token dubbed JPM Coin.In December, JPMorgan said it was using its custom blockchain to conduct intraday repurchase agreements totaling billions of dollars, an advance that helped persuade Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to join the new digital market earlier this year. JPMorgan was also a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a group experimenting with a private version of blockchain.Goldman SachsThree years ago, Goldman Sachs hired a crypto trader to help lead digital-asset markets, with a goal of familiarizing people in the company and as well as clients with cryptocurrencies. The firm has previously mulled whether it needs to start a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies.More recently, Goldman Sachs has played down the idea of Bitcoin as an asset class, saying wild swings in its price prove it’s not a real unit of value. At the same time, the firm has been exploring the creation of its own fiat digital token, but has said it’s very early in the process.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman was one of the first Wall Street leaders to lend credence to Bitcoin, saying in 2017 that it was more than just a fad. The firm flirted with the idea of trading a swap-based product tied to the cryptocurrency that could give clients synthetic exposure to the coin, but it ultimately didn’t proceed.Morgan Stanley’s head of digital-asset markets, Andrew Peel, has said in recent months the bank has fielded more interest in Bitcoin from traditional financial firms.Wells FargoWells Fargo & Co. doesn’t accept crypto assets in deposit, custodial or other accounts, according to company spokesperson Roger Cabrera. The firm is, however, conducting research to “evaluate the underlying technology for potential transactional, transparency and settlement innovations it may hold,” Cabrera said.The San Francisco-based company announced in 2019 that it was piloting Wells Fargo Digital Cash as a bank-issued alternative to cryptocurrency. Wells Fargo said at the time that the internal settlement service would run on its first distributed-ledger technology platform and allow internal book transfers of cross-border payments using digitized cash.CEO Charlie Scharf has been mum on the issue since taking over in 2019, but while running Visa Inc. in 2014 he called Bitcoin “far more complex” than it’s often portrayed.CitigroupCitigroup Inc.’s outgoing CEO, Michael Corbat, said in an interview with Bloomberg in December that he believed some cryptocurrencies would continue to be used as different forms of payment, adding that his bank had begun working with governments around the world to make sovereign digital currencies.Bank of AmericaBank of America Corp.’s chief operations and technology officer, Cathy Bessant, said in 2019 that the use of Bitcoin and other digital assets was “troubling,” and that she was “bearish” on blockchain despite the lender having about 90 patents in distributed-ledger technology. “If blockchain or DLT becomes a reality, we want to be ready for our clients,” she said in an interview on CNBC at the time.Bessant said she was “trying to throw down the gauntlet” for blockchain uses, but so far hadn’t seen anything that signaled the bank would be dependent on the technology in 10 years.Payment CompaniesSome of the biggest strides have come from financial-technology giants such as PayPal Holdings Inc. and Visa.PayPal last year started allowing consumers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets -- a feature it plans to add to its Venmo app in coming months. The company will also soon allow customers to use cryptocurrencies to pay for a purchase at the 29 million merchants where PayPal is accepted.Visa has said that if a digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there would be no reason why the firm wouldn’t add it to its network, which already supports 160 currencies.Looking AheadWhile Wall Street is still mostly on the sidelines, crypto could become too good to ignore if the “to the moon” crowd’s highest hopes become reality. Tesla’s $1.5 billion purchase would be worth $5.5 billion in a year based on Bitcoin’s one-year return of about 365%, or $18 billion in two years if it repeats its roughly 1,200% gain for that period.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Wall Street Stays on Crypto Sidelines as Tesla Boosts Bitcoin

2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte.’s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara said Singapore’s state-owned investment firm is committed to China despite recent developments such as the cancellation of Ant Financial Group’s public listing.“We’re still very positive on the long-term trajectory of China from what we can see,” Pillay said, when asked about China Tuesday by reporters after he was named to replace Ho Ching, who will step down in October after 17 years as head of the $230 billion firm.Pillay, currently head of Temasek’s international unit, will need to steer one of the world’s biggest institutional investors through markets buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic and rising political tensions between the U.S. and China.Temasek is a leading investor in China with deals running the gamut from fast-growing startups and technology giants to banking institutions. In September it said holdings in China had surpassed those its home market for the first time, hitting 29% of total portfolio value as it added to assets despite the increased geopolitical tensions. Temasek was also an early investor in fintech giant Ant, whose record initial public offering was scrapped by regulators on the eve of the November listing.“China has always had that long-term potential for us, going back to even before I joined Temasek to the decade where I have been very much involved in our strategy,” he said, highlighting its biotech, consumer and enterprise sectors as emerging areas of interest.The change in leadership comes at a critical time for Temasek, which owns investments throughout the world from Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to asset manager BlackRock Inc. Its net portfolio value fell for the first time in four years to S$306 billion ($230 billion) last fiscal year, after financial markets crashed during the early phase of the pandemic in March.Pillay spent much of the briefing discussing Temasek’s commitment to sustainability and adapting to the impact of climate change on its businesses.Ho, 67, who is married to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will stay in her role until October, with Pillay keeping his position as CEO of the Temasek International Pte unit after the changes take effect.Ho’s resignation was long-expected and attempted once before in 2009 when former BHP Billiton Ltd. CEO Chip Goodyear was announced as her successor. Temasek abandoned that plan just four months into the transition, citing “differences regarding certain strategic issues that could not be resolved” while Singapore’s then-finance minister said the role would “ideally” go to a Singaporean.Pillay, a 57-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer, was widely regarded as a candidate to succeed Ho when he was promoted to his current role almost two years ago. The Singaporean joined Temasek in 2010, holding various leadership roles including heading the investment and portfolio management groups and overseeing the U.S. and Americas market teams. He also initiated and led the Enterprise Development Group, helping to build new longer-term growth engines for the firm.“I don’t see the impending changes at Temasek as having any significant near-term impact on the way Temasek Holdings is run or the way it manages its portfolio,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. “Singapore Inc. is always about continuity, but yet always on the lookout for emerging themes that can reinforce Singapore as a key hub for businesses.”Different KindAndrew Delios, a professor at NUS Business School, said Temasek had performed well as a steward of Singapore’s finances over the long term. Its 20-year compounded and annualized return stood at 6% as of March 2020, and has returned 14% a year since inception in 1974.“Temasek is a much different kind of company where stability, predictability and consistency are important,” he said, while adding the views were his own. “I don’t think we’ll see any change of substance for the next two years.”Temasek massively stepped up investing abroad under Ho. Foreign investments made up 76% of its portfolio as of March, up from 48% in 2004.But the firm faces tremendous challenges in the years ahead. Some of its biggest assets were inherited from the state and are being pummeled by markets damped by the spread of Covid-19. Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., have dropped more than 25% over the past 12 months.Some of the fund’s foreign holdings have fared better, with BlackRock up 31% in the period, and PayPal Holdings Inc. more than doubling. However, many of these are now potentially susceptible to the rift between the U.S. and China.Ho joined Temasek in May 2002 as executive director, and was appointed CEO two years later. She started her career as an engineer and worked at the country’s Ministry of Defence, later becoming the president and CEO of Singapore Technologies Group prior to joining Temasek.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Temasek’s New Chief Is Upbeat on Long-Term Chinese Investments

2021-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. slipped as much as 2% on Wednesday as the payments company prepared to give an update to shareholders and analysts at its investor day.Analysts expect PayPal’s bid for more growth -- particularly through its ground-breaking move into cryptocurrency -- will be a key focus at the event on Thursday. Shares have soared 135% in the past year, propelled by a shift to digital commerce amid the pandemic. Its market value of about $331 billion exceeds most large banks, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., and almost matches Mastercard Inc.’s of $332 billion.The stock touched an all-time high on Feb. 9 as Bitcoin blew past another record. Shares also rose after better-than-expected earnings last week.PayPal will probably “profit handsomely from onboarding crypto,” Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone said in an email. “They are selling shovels to the traders per charging for every transaction after the initial for-free period,” he said, referring to Gold Rush sales to prospectors.PayPal’s October move into cryptocurrency buoyed retail demand. The service is a go-to for individual investors as cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds aren’t yet available, McGlone said.“Crypto is certainly top of mind with investors right now,” Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell said in an email. Investors should expect to hear about its plans for merchants and customers as it’s taking a leadership position with crypto, he said.PayPal executives are also likely to discuss key growth strategies, both domestically and internationally. “The super app idea is certainly compelling,” Cantwell said.Read more: PayPal Hits Record on Beat, Boost From Crypto: Street WrapThe company may demonstrate new versions of PayPal and Venmo wallets that are rolling out in the second quarter, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis.Executives may also explain how they view the relationship between user growth, engagement growth and average revenue per user, or ARPU, growth, she said, also in an email. “PayPal may even give directional targets for how they expect to [grow] each of these metrics over time,‘’ she said.Both Ellis and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Sanjay Sakhrani see PayPal raising its medium-term targets. Ellis expects a revenue growth forecast in the high-teens to around 20%, with earnings-per-share growth of about 22%-to-25%.Sakhrani expects higher targets as growth is set to pick up, with a structural shift toward greater e-commerce adoption, along with growth-boosting initiatives including crypto, Venmo and buy-now-pay-later installment plans.“Although investor expectations are high into the event, we believe that the company’s ability to compound earnings growth at 20%+ levels could still yield attractive returns and the growing user base and product roadmap could set them up for further upside,” Sakhrani said.He also expects comments on PayPal’s strategy for continuing to build on rapid growth in net new active accounts and more engagement among broader cohorts of users. Moves into cryptocurrency trading and other areas, like credit cards, offer users more “touchpoints and utility,” Sakhrani noted.It’s not clear that users will take advantage of PayPal allowing them to fund purchases with Bitcoin, particularly as merchants that accept the digital currency see few transactions, Morgan Stanley analysts James Faucette and Betsy Graseck wrote in a Wednesday note on digital currencies. Volatility and possible tax issues may be key deterrents, they said.PayPal is providing crypto as part of a strategy of offering as many fintech services as possible to its 325 million active users, they said. That may not contribute much to profits this year or next, Faucette and Graseck said, calling it “more of an engagement tool.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal’s Bid for Growth, Crypto Moves Are Focus of Investor Day"

2021-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is weighing a foray into stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as the firm pushes beyond its iconic checkout button.The payments giant expects the number of active users on its sprawling platform to climb to 750 million by the end of 2025 -- roughly double the current level -- as it expands into new areas of financial services, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said Thursday at the company’s investor day. With its latest plans, PayPal aims to become the world’s next financial super-app, akin to Chinese firms Alipay and WeChat Pay.“There’s few companies in the world that can even aspire to this vision,” Schulman said. “It requires capabilities that cross industries, from financial services to payments to shopping to technology.”PayPal is coming off a record year, when spending on its platform soared 31% as consumers turned to online shopping in droves after the pandemic shuttered stores around the globe. The firm added 72.7 million users during the year as revenue climbed to $21.5 billion.The performance came even as PayPal’s main business of speeding up the online checkout process has seen intense competition from the likes of Apple Inc. as well as payment giants Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Still, it’s an area PayPal dominates: The firm’s button has been added to nearly three-quarters of the leading U.S. retail sites, according to a survey last year by Pymnts.com.One StopNow PayPal has set its sights on turning itself into a one-stop shop for consumers and merchants alike to conduct their finances. The firm said new products could include stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as well as bill-payment capabilities and check-cashing services.The firm’s new digital wallet will be divided into a financial services tab, a payments tab and a shopping tab, Schulman said in an interview following the investor-day event. PayPal hopes to debut the new features within the next two years.“We are doing a lot organically because our platform and our product capabilities are as robust as they’ve ever been,” Schulman said in the interview. “But we’ll also look to partner with people,” he said, adding that “we’re also looking at the potential of acquisitions where that might make sense.”The company is leaning into the success it’s already seen from adding the ability for users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in digital wallets in recent months. Half of all customers who took advantage of the feature now log into the app every day -- meaning PayPal has become a destination for those customers, rather than a place they turn to on an as-needed basis.Driving Revenue“This is precisely the type of engagement that we want to see as we add these additional financial services,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said.That’s because that sort of activity, in turn, drives revenue. Schulman said the firm now expects the average amount of revenue it collects from each user to grow substantially over the next five years.PayPal is now on track to more than double revenue to $50 billion in 2025 as payments volume on its platforms triples to $2.8 trillion. The firm also expects to generate $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.PayPal’s shares rose 0.5% to $284.62 at 3:28 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 6.7% in earlier trading. The stock has increased 673% since it was spun off from EBay Inc. in 2015, compared with the 89% advance of the S&P 500 Index.PayPal has warned that some of the new initiatives caused an uptick in spending on technology and development. Such costs already rose 27% to $2.64 billion last year. Still, the firm has said it expects profits to climb 17% on an adjusted basis this year.“We really hit our stride in 2020,” Schulman said. “And I’m so excited about what we plan to deliver and what we are going to deliver in this year and in the years to come.”(Updates with CEO interview starting in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal Looks to Stock Trading, Savings in Push Past Checkout"

2021-02-11,"Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) said Wednesday it planned to expand its cryptocurrency program, citing worldwide consumer and merchant interest in digital tokens. What Happened: The move allows holders of payment cards to buy, hold, and exchange multiple traditional currencies and some cryptocurrencies. Consumers would be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat money, which they can spend. “Currency will always enter Mastercard’s network as traditional fiat currency,” Mastercard said in a statement. “The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today’s digital economy,” said Executive Vice President Raj Dhamodharan. Why It Matters: Mastercard previously supported cryptocurrency transactions through its partnerships with Wirex and Bitpay, which would convert the digital assets into fiat currencies. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) has been growing. On Monday, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) said it invested .5 billion in the apex cryptocurrency and in the near future will support BTC as a payments option. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) last year announced a service that allows users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. The company also announced cryptocurrency as a funding source for merchants at the time.

2021-02-11,"Crypto exchanges were down earlier this week following increased traffic, particularly from new retail investors. What Happened: Earlier today, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, tweeted that the exchange saw an all-time high in volumes and new user registrations. While on-chain signals indicate that crypto adoption may be finally starting to come into fruition, a new survey from CivicScience suggests that interest in crypto still remains low, Axios has reported. Reportedly, 66% of survey respondents claimed they were not interested in cryptocurrency, while only 5% reported they were happily invested in it. On a deeper level, the survey found that the majority of investors that were most skeptical about investing in cryptocurrency would prefer to purchase it through Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL). Why It Matters: PayPal announced its intent to support crypto in October 2020, and as of late January 2021, the company states that it will allow customers to use crypto as a funding source for purchases at PayPal’s 26 million merchants. According to PayPal’s president and CEO, Dan Schulman, “The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly,” PayPal currently offers its users four cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

2021-02-12,"Payments platform PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been one of Wall Street’s biggest winners for years. Over the past five years, PYPL stock is up nearly 800%. Why? Because PayPal has emerged as a winner in the Digital Revolution, wherein consumers are shifting all their activity into the digital world. Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com That’s the good news. Here’s the better news: The Digital Revolution is only going to accelerate over the next decade. Consumers are only going to shop online more. They’re only going to use digital wallets more. They’re only going to engage and play more in the digital world. As they do all of that stuff, consumers will increasingly find themselves using PayPal’s suite of digital payment services in their everyday lives.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips And, as that happens, PayPal’s revenue and profit growth rates will remain robust — which will lay the foundation for this big rally in PYPL stock to persist for a lot longer. Sign Up for Luke’s Innovative Hypergrowth Newsletter and Get Your Free Special Report Here’s a deeper look. The Digital Revolution Welcome to the Digital Revolution. Yes, this revolution is not new. But it’s getting bigger and bigger, and faster and faster, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic — and eventually and inevitably, we will be living in a digi-everything world. Here’s the story. The internet makes everything hyper-convenient. Super fast. Super easy. But, for a long time, the internet also had large shortcomings versus physical experiences, such as human interaction, the ability to see-and-touch products, etc. Technological improvements over the past few years have rapidly fixed those shortcomings. For example, video calls are becoming hyper-interactive and very productive, thereby becoming a sufficient quasi-replacement for in-person meetings and checking up on Grandma. Also, augmented reality features on e-commerce sites are allowing consumers to visualize and closely see products that consumers were only willing to purchase in-store before, such as cars, furniture and homes. Not to mention, we can now gamble online now, with real money. The result? Everyone is virtualizing all of their activities. Covid-19 provided an impetus to accelerate this virtualization. PayPal is at the epicenter of the Digital Revolution. Thus, as the Digital Revolution only accelerates over the next decade, PYPL stock will head higher. PayPal’s Relentless Innovation Beyond just being immersed in the Digital Revolution, PayPal is innovating relentlessly to remain the most important and widely used digital payments platform in the world. PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. The company has added a debit card to its Venmo app, increasing the company’s exposure to the physical payments space. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and investing. Basically, it’s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers in the digi-everything economy. That’s why PayPal usage will only go up over the next several years. By a lot. So will revenues., profits and the PYPL stock price. Upside for PayPal Stock When you look out long-term, it becomes obvious that PYPL stock has healthy upside potential. Digital payment volume globally will grow at a 10%-plus rate for the next five to ten years as consumers shop, eat, play, and work more online. PayPal will leverage its widening value prop to increase share in that booming market, paving a path for 10% to 15% revenue growth. Profit margins will increase with scale, because the company operates on a highly scalable business model with a lot of fixed costs. Net net, PayPal projects as a 15%-plus profit grower for the next five to ten years. Indeed, my modeling says that PayPal’s earnings per share will round out at around $25 by 2030. Based on a 25X earnings multiple, that implies a long-term price target for PYPL stock of $625. That’s more than double the current price tag. Thus, I think you have to stick with PYPL stock here and now. Bottom Line on PYPL Stock The Digital Revolution is just getting started. So is PayPal. Over the next decade, consumers will increasingly virtualize more and more of their activities, and PayPal usage will soar as the company turns into a ubiquitous digital wallet. Of course, as all that happens, PYPL stock will keep doing what it has been doing for years: Rally, rally, and rally. P.S. Have you noticed the trend lately?

2021-02-12,"PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) wants to shape the future financial system and central bank digital currencies are a part of its vision, as per CEO Dan Schulman. What Happened: Schulman — speaking at the payments company’s investor day on Thursday — said that “People no longer want to handle cash and basic financial services are going to be a part of any financial platform that has hundreds of millions of consumers.” “You are going to see new payment rails evolve,” said Schulman. The executive said that PayPal’s super-app like digital wallet was “such an important element” of the company’s strategy looking forward. The digital payments will be multifaceted, according to Schulman, and would utilize cryptocurrency as a funding instrument alongside CBDC currencies when they become a reality. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin with Paypal “There’s no question that digital currencies and underlying technology have the potential to drive the next wave in financial services and I think those technologies can help solve some of the fundamental problems of the system.” Why It Matters: Jonathan Auerbach, PayPal’s chief strategy, growth, and data officer said at the investor day that customers that have made their “first crypto purchases have been logging into PayPal at roughly twice their login frequency prior to actually having purchased cryptocurrency.” PayPal said that customers that use its cryptocurrency services have a 12% rise in weekly transactions on the platform partly because in excess of 40% of the U.S. PayPal customers that use cryptocurrencies return to complete more than two additional transactions, CoinDesk reported. “We really do believe that digital currencies CBDC’s and the collaboration with central banks and regulators will open new ways to exchange value and power global commerce and financial services for entirely new segments of the population.” PayPal allowed users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) in October. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has been on the rise recently with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saying it would let customers use BTC for payments in near future. On Thursday, one of the oldest bank in the United States, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE: BK) said it will offer BTC and digital asset custody services later this year.

2021-02-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Klarna Bank AB is raising funds valuing the Swedish fintech startup at around $31 billion, roughly tripling the company’s valuation after its most recent round in September.The Stockholm-based company is raising around $800 million and up to $1 billion, the people said, adding the round could be announced in the coming days. Existing investors are participating ahead of a potential public listing next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.A Klarna spokesperson declined to comment.The fresh funding would recrown the Swedish company as Europe’s most valuable startup after payments business Checkout.com was valued at $15 billion. Klarna in September had brought in $650 million in equity funding from investors led by Silver Lake, then valuing it at $10.65 billion. Other existing backers include Sequoia Capital Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, BlackRock Inc. and HMI Capital.Klarna Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski has previously indicated the company would look to publicly list in the near future but has held back on giving any precise timing.The Swedish company’s success in online payments has made it an important challenger to traditional credit cards and firms like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. The firm has also benefited from an accelerated shift to e-commerce during the pandemic.Klarna has risen in popularity, especially in the U.S., in large part thanks to its buy-now-pay-later service. The offering lets customers pay through interest-free installments when they shop brands like H&M or Adidas, while retailers pay Klarna a cut of purchases.But Klarna and other buy-now-pay-later services are increasingly coming under scrutiny from regulators on concerns they allow customers to spend more than they can afford.The U.K. in early February said it would start regulating the sector. Still, the prospect of tighter regulation hasn’t appeared to dampen investors’ appetite for Klarna, and the company said it would welcome more modern rules.Swedish technology news outlet Breakit previously reported the company was raising another round of funding.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Klarna Said to Raise Up to $1 Billion at $31 Billion Valuation

Earlier in February, the digital currency’s market value exceeded $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. Even now, several investors remain skeptical about putting their capital into the asset. However, the writing is on the wall. Source: Shutterstock Institutional interest in Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), the nation’s oldest bank, is paving the way for Bitcoin to use the networks usually reserved for conventional financial assets. Not so long ago, major custodian banks stayed away from the space due to regulatory or legal risks. However, client demand is forcing them to reevaluate their positions. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin according to a regulatory filing. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that Tesla has made approximately $1 billion in paper profits from the investment thus far.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Online payment processing companies PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have already allowed their users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. PayPal, in particular, is a real coup for Bitcoin. As of the end of 2020, it had total active accounts of 377 million. The overarching theme is that the rally in Bitcoin prices is forcing the world’s largest publicly traded financial services companies and major Wall Street giants to rethink their approach. That’s why one shouldn’t be skeptical of investing in the space at the moment. Bitcoin is finally going mainstream, and although there will be blips on the way, the trajectory is upward. Why This Bitcoin Rally Is Different Than 2017 Chances are that if you read the news, the Bitcoin rally is something you are aware of. The cryptocurrency had a smashing 2020, rocketing to $20,000 from around $1,000. Due to the epic bull run, many investors compared the situation to the last time the digital currency went parabolic back in 2017. 8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name However, there are several key differences in the current run with the one we had back in 2017. Firstly, it may seem surprising, but the 2020-2021 run is less extreme than the last one. In that case, we saw a 20x return while the last year was roughly an 8x return. It’s important to point out that in 2017 several projects kicked off as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), leading to massive runups for Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), and their ilk. In fact, the other cryptos surpassed the Bitcoin rally and then some. Cut to the current run, and it’s the complete opposite. Bitcoin is leading the charge, with several cryptos rising in its shadow, rather than the other way around. CryptoCompare data shows the trading volumes for the digital currency on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk 20 have exceeded $11 billion, beating the 2017 all-time record. Lastly, Bitcoin is going mainstream. Everyone wants to take advantage of the massive rally, and that’s why you see massive financial institutions jump on the bandwagon as well. I’ve gone through several major companies that have embraced digital currency, but I want to single out Mastercard’s (NYSE:MA) recent announcement before moving to the next section. It has said that it will support “select cryptocurrencies” on its network in the latter half of the year. Another instance of corporate America warming up to Bitcoin. Alarm Bells Despite the amazing bull run, there are still several skeptics out there. I would classify them into two categories. One set doesn’t believe in the inherent story of Bitcoin, equating it to the tulip mania of 1637. The other group feels valuation is stretched at this point, and bubble bursting will make their investment worthless. We’ve already addressed the concerns of the latter through this article. But the first set merits further discussion. Essentially, these are coming from the Warren Buffet school of investing. The Oracle of Omaha has steered clear of investing in Bitcoin and has laid out his reasons. Firstly, the billionaire investor only pours capital into areas that he understands. Additionally, he has a firm “buy and hold” strategy based on years of investing experience. He has held onto companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) because he believes in their story. These companies produce stable recurring cash flow based on their excellent business models. However, Bitcoin doesn’t have that. So, Buffet prefers to stay away. If you are reading this and that strategy sounds a lot like how you invest, then it’s tough work to convince you. However, if you have held this digital asset for a while, the ebbs and flows are not new. What keeps you interested in Bitcoin is the prospect of making 10 times on your investment. And there are no signs at the moment that stormy days are ahead for the cryptocurrency, which is finally getting a seat at the table in the investing world.

2021-03-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Klarna Bank AB said it raised $1 billion at a valuation of $31 billion, triple the price investors gave the Swedish payments firm during its last funding round, following rapid growth in its U.S. business.Europe’s most valuable startup initially set out to raise $500 million. Klarna Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski said high investor demand led to this doubling, but could have gone as high as $3 billion. It had been valued at $10.65 billion as recently as September.“What definitely has accelerated and changed is the success in the U.S. market,” Siemiatkowski said in an interview. Investors are seeing Klarna getting ahead of its competitors, he said. “I think that has changed the perspective and changed the view on our valuation.”The company has about 90 million users worldwide and the U.S. is on track to overtake Germany as its biggest market by the end of 2021. It said last week it had signed up 20 of the top 100 brands in the U.S. and attracted a million new customers a month there in the last quarter of 2020.Klarna competes with PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. as well as traditional credit cards. It lets customers “buy now and pay later” in four interest-free installments when they shop online or in store with brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch, H&M, Adidas and Lululemon. Retailers give it a cut of purchases to cover costs. It also offers savings accounts and other banking services.Financial technology companies have seen more people take advantage of their products during the pandemic, which spurred a shift to e-commerce while stores were forced to close. Klarna has previously said it doesn’t expect the roll-out of vaccines to completely reverse that trend, as shoppers have learned new habits.But the interest-free buy-now pay-later business model has also faced scrutiny from regulators, such as in the U.K., where they’re concerned it encourages people to spend more than they can afford. PayPal launched a similar point-of-sale loan product in Britain last year.Siemiatkowski said the fresh funding would help Klarna further challenge the credit card industry. Buy-now pay-later services offered a more egalitarian system by giving every consumer the same offer, he said.“There’s a number of investors out there that agree with us,” he said. “They see that this credit card industry is actually at its core flawed and needs some innovation.”Klarna will use some of the money to acquire technology companies. Siemiatkowski said he was “less keen” on M&A with competitors because of the complexities of integrating new services, but was interested in targets that could help people save time or money. He said about $10 million would also be donated to organizations helping to combat climate change.As the company’s valuation has soared, so has speculation about a public listing. Siemiatkowski said he would wait to get his incoming chief financial officer, Niclas Neglen, settled in the coming weeks before making any decisions. He said he was “excited and intrigued” by the idea of a direct listing and wasn’t ruling anything out for as soon as this year.More than 30 existing and new investors participated in the round announced Monday, which Bloomberg first reported last week. Klarna didn’t name any of the investors but existing backers include Silver Lake, Sequoia Capital, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, BlackRock Inc. and HMI Capital -- as well as the rapper known as Snoop Dogg, who also appears in some of the company’s ads.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Klarna Valued at $31 Billion After U.S. Growth Stoked Investors

2021-03-03,"PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) is purchasing Curv, a technology firm, engaged in the secure storage of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, CoinDesk reported Tuesday. What Happened: Curv’s price tag was reportedly pegged at between $200 million and $300 million by local Israeli media, which did not name a buyer. “PayPal is buying Curv for $500 million,” a person from within the digital asset custody space told CoinDesk. Curv has raised $29.5 million in three funding rounds, as per Crunchbase. Investors include Franklin Templeton Investments, Team 8, and Coinbase Ventures. Why It Matters: The Peter Thiel-co-founded PayPal turned to Curv after talks centered on acquiring BitGo fell through last year, noted CoinDesk. PayPal began offering cryptocurrencies to its users in late October and partnered with New York-based Paxos’s iBit trading exchange, which saw a massive 500% spike in volumes thereafter in November.

2021-03-12,"Not all blank-check companies are built for the same exact purpose. Sure, they’re around to raise money for some private company they will fund and “reverse merge” into at some point. And sure, a huge honking share of these special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) dominated the electric vehicle (EV) sector in 2020. But in the case of Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp. (NYSE:BFT) and its BFT stock, it’s not at all about the car — though it could well involve how people pay for it. Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.com The target of this SPAC is Paysafe Group Ltd., a company that offers online and in-store payment processing. In case you haven’t noticed, this space glows hot like coals at a cookout held in a volcano. After a year when consumers had to learn how to do everything via the internet, Paysafe processes online payments for businesses. It also handles point-of-sale transactions for everyday brick-and-mortar merchants.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips And yet, one question cannot be avoided: Is this whole SPAC phenomenon beginning to reek of financial fad? Or are SPACs, as one commentator notes, just plain bad? There’s been much talk lately of SPAC overload. The big price gains that many investors and SPAC creators once saw as automatic have hit turbulence as the first quarter of 2021 closes. A mix of market saturation and investor skepticism explains it. After all, who makes out in the end? The investors? Or the founders? Or, in the case of BFT stock, perhaps both? BFT Stock and the New SPAC Smackdown Since early December, BFT stock is up close to 50%. That’s good news but tinged with a touch of bad. And that bad is twofold. First, share prices have remained flat since Christmas. That doesn’t exactly presage the investor enthusiasm you want to see headed into a reverse merger. And second, the SPAC bubble — and yeah, I’d call it a bubble — looks primed to burst with the vigor of a tomato winged via slingshot at the head of Chamath Palihapitiya. Call it SPAC-lash, if you will. The truth is, it’s well deserved. 7 OTC Stocks That Could Still Run with the Big Boys Palihapitiya, as you may know, is considered one of the founding fathers of SPACs. And by his own admission, he’s just suffered a “super tough week.” This came after regulatory filings showed that on the week of Mar. 1, he sold his entire personal stake in Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SPCE): more than six million shares. When the news hit, SPCE shares dropped 10%. Holy mothership. What does this have to do with BFT stock? Two things: Everything and everything. Super tough weeks, Mr. P., are your own freaking fault when you’re revealed to have essentially abandoned the company you helped to fund. To the question I posed earlier, it presents prima facie evidence that the founders make out like bandits, whatever the fate of shareholders might be. For his own part, Palihapitiya said in a Tweet that he had sold “some shares,” with a sad-face emoji, no less. But The New York Times reports in its Mar. 8 DealBook newsletter that he sold all of them. Insert whatever laughing-all-the-way-to-the-intergalactic-bank emoji you want here. A Reality Check Is in Order So here, I’m going to take a contrarian view to a few of my InvestorPlace colleagues, who think the Paysafe deal is an opportunity to capitalize on a well-priced stock. No. It’s an imperative to stand by. Aside from that fact that BFT stock and its SPAC are stalled, we need a reality check, folks. Anything that reeks of easy money on Wall Street sooner or later must face close scrutiny. And let’s remember, SPACs are relatively new. The shell-game sort of dynamics the Virgin Galactic sale revealed aren’t illegal. But they sure deserve the hairy eyeball, as in enough hair to make a silver-backed gorilla envious. And the fact is, SPACs have zero correlation price-wise to the companies they will fund. That’s right. None. A SPAC raises money. Period. What you get in the end is a private company, now gone public, that must realize its promise. Heretofore sealed financials will come to light. The walled garden of nurture the company enjoys as funds amass turns into a kicked-out-of-the-nest situation once the opening bell rings. And having been an expert observer in the banking space for some years — I invite you to check out my podcast, Bankadelic — I can tell you there is no such thing in the payments world as a slam dunk. Many are vying to get a piece of it and must deal with the dominant likes of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Sorting Out the U.S. Payments Puzzle What’s more, the payments rails in the U.S. are tangled. The Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF) revealed that, if anything, our system is a mess compared to Europe, where huge amounts of money clear and post in seconds. The goal of the FPTF was to produce “secure, ubiquitous, faster payments by 2020.” We’re still waiting. True, Paysafe is multinational as it’s based on the Isle of Man. It can claim more than 20 years experience servicing more than 200,000 small and medium businesses. The problem is, payments technology is changing almost at the speed it took you to read this sentence. As machine learning, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency reach critical mass, two decades of experience could mean nothing. Or everything. Do you know? Of course you don’t, and neither do I. Novel payments solutions, such as privately held Branch, have figured out how to give employees instant payment access to money they’ve accrued at work, but before the paycheck. (Check out my podcast with Branch’s Ahmed Siddiqui here.) Upstarts like Branch that transcend the nuts and bolts of traditional payments architecture could eat Paysafe for lunch. Or not. Do you know? Of course you don’t, and neither do I. Of Paysafe and Playing It Safe Here’s what I do know: This whole SPAC thing is beginning to reek of a board game for billionaires. Do we add billionaire Bill Foley, the guy behind this one, to the list? Consider that some legendary billionaires, such as Warren Buffett, aren’t touching SPACs with a Benjamin-coated ten-foot pole. Though Chamath Palihapitiya bragged just a few weeks ago that he wants to be the next Warren Buffett. I should say. Sounds like he had a plan, eh? Regular investors betting on BFT stock may make out. But as I’ve established, of recent they definitely haven’t. Granted, once this SPAC takes Paysafe public, the company may prove far more viable than I’m intimating here. I definitely hope so. But here’s a word to both the wise and the foolish: Wait. Whatever the double-speak on Virgin Galactic is, the fact that a SPAC legend essentially took the money and ran gives me no reassurance whatsoever. That’s not to paint Foley and his namesake SPAC with a broad brush. But yours truly, of the metaphorical tin can and string as punditry goes, can hardly phone this one in. I don’t know about you. For the time being, consider me SPAC’d out. On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2021-04-01,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent gains may be short-lived and “the whole rally in crypto is getting very long in the tooth,” according to Boris Schlossberg, a leading foreign exchange expert. What Happened: “I think we’re very, very close to perhaps an intermediate-term top here. A little bit of a correction is certainly due at this point,” Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” BTC traded 0.54% lower at $59,354.38 over the past 24 hours at press time, but was up 11.2% over the past week, indicating a recovery. It has an all-time high of $61,683, hit last month. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin’s Recent Gains: The cryptocurrency’s recent gains came after PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) said it will allow its U.S. customers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of online merchants around the globe. PayPal’s move came a day after payments giant Visa Inc (NYSE: V) said it would allow payments to be settled directly via cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. Schlossberg noted that Bitcoin’s high degree of volatility will likely mean transactions on platforms such as PayPal’s will be “infinitesimally small” compared to regular currency. However, he feels Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold. See Also: Why Is Ethereum Surging, Outperforming Bitcoin Today? CME Group’s Plan: Further, Schlossberg said that derivative exchange CME Group Inc.’s (NASDAQ: CME) plan to launch Micro Bitcoin futures contracts on its platform in early May could rattle bitcoin’s price even if investors like it or not. The Micro Bitcoin futures will be one-tenth the size of one Bitcoin. Schlossberg noted that Bitcoin topped out the last time CME launched bitcoin futures in late 2017. Matt Maley, chief marketing strategist at Miller Tabak, said in the same “Trading Nation” interview that if Bitcoin moves to the downside below $52,000, its going to be a “big warning flag” and give the cryptocurrency its first lower low of the year. Maley added it Bitcoin breaks above its recent highs of $61,000, it “should see another leg higher.” However, he agreed with Schlossberg that bitcoin is going to see a lot more big declines along its way in a very volatile session.

Specifically, Qiu said the company won't compete against giants like Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent Holdings' WeChat Pay, which have a collective user base that exceeds 1 billion.",PayPal Will Target Cross-Border Payments in China
2021-04-20,"Late last year Paypal had good news for crypto users with their new ""Checkout with Crypto"", which would allow any PayPal account holder to buy, and sell products across thousands of merchants using their digital currencies. This was announced to fanfare and had the positive effect of helping boost the price of the related cryptocurrencies. This was especially good news for those eager to see cryptos move closer to a state of mass adoption. At that time PayPal had over 346 million active accounts. This did however come with some drawbacks. Merchants would receive their payments in fiat currency. For the users, they would not be able to buy cryptos on the platform and those users with third-party crypto wallets could not move their holdings from those wallets into their Paypal account. That is where the market opened up for competitors of Paypal, who could not only offer transactional payments but could also offer users the ability to transfer from external wallets, to buy cryptos on their platforms, and to pay merchants directly in crypto and sometimes to give users more than they had bargained for. Step up the leading payment provider solutions that have stepped into the fray: Mobie The Mobie ecosystem promises an overall system of easy and fast on and off-ramp payments that would also reward users for their everyday spending. Mobie has proven to be one of the most innovative and immersive gateways for payments, including gaming. Mobie is safe and secure and does not necessitate its users to provide any banking details, with no need for debit or credit cards. The Mobie ecosystem offers a variety of possibilities for personal and business use. There's a secure and instant payment system, an rewards incentivizing program and reduced cost of transaction fees. On top of that, Mobie makes it easy to donate to charity with up to 6% of purchases. Join the Mobie waitlist to participate in the early access to their beta. CoinZoom CoinZoom allows users to not only buy, sell and spend bitcoin, it also allows them to get CoinZoom global debit cards to easily spend their fiat and crypto balances at over 53 million merchants. CoinZoom has a number of products in its arsenal which include international cards that facilitate users to buy cryptos in an anonymous fashion as well as enabling them to convert their crypto back into fiat and to buy goods and services anywhere that Visa cards are accepted. Perhaps, the jewel in its crown though is the ZoomMe international peer-to-peer fiat or money transfer feature which is completely and utterly free. That should give Paypal a run for its money. Public Mint With Public Mint you can get access to some of the best DeFi opportunities out there and you don’t need a bank account to do so. With Public Mint you don't necessarily need to transfer your money onto the blockchain. Public Mint will give you a synthetic currency, USD+ which is a means of payment on its own right now and it can be transferred between users and holders to earn revenue, while also being suitable for payments. Anyone that needs to pay bills or invoices at scale can use Public Mint to make their transactions with very low fees almost instantly. You can use Public Mint instead of a bank account to save your money, top up your account and pay or send money instantly to anyone in the world, with the security of a blockchain. Skrill Skrill, a subsidiary of Paysafe, a popular payment platform that is listed on the NYSE, has increased its crypto offering to U.S. clients by teaming up with Coinbase, the digital exchange that is just about to go public on the NASDAQ exchange. Skrill will use Coinbase's white-label solution to give clients access to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Skrill users can exchange their Bitcoins for other cryptos and are promised fast, convenient transactions without the need for users to exchange back to fiat. Skrill enables its users to exchange 40 fiat currencies into Bitcoin and back, instantly, securely, and with pretty decent fees. Skrill, which was formerly known as MoneyBookers, is already well known in the remittance space.

This latest move underscores PayPal's commitment to expanding the utility of digital currencies, and it adds another tool to Venmo's growing list of financial services.",Venmo Users Can Now Buy Cryptocurrency
2021-04-20,"PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL)-owned mobile payment service Venmo said its 70 million customers can now buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency directly with the Venmo app. As per a press release shared by the company, the rollout is set to take place today and will allow users to purchase as little as $1 using crypto. Customers using crypto on Venmo can choose from four types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (CRYPTO: BHC).

Venmo’s crypto service is enabled by regulated cryptocurrency service provider Paxos that has partnered with PayPal.

Why It Matters: Venmo’s crypto service comes after PayPal launched its checkout with crypto service earlier this year, which enabled users to pay with cryptocurrency at PayPal’s 29 million online merchants. Along with signaling more mainstream adoption, the move gave crypto markets a significant boost, with Bitcoin’s price rising above $60,000. The company revealed that as per a 2020 Venmo Customer Behavior Study, more than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing crypto or equities, 20% of which started during the pandemic. “The launch of the feature furthers PayPal's commitment to educating its customers on the potential of digital currencies as they continue to grow and drives understanding and utility of cryptocurrencies on a mass scale,” said the company in a statement.

2021-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Crypto trading is coming soon to a Venmo feed near you.PayPal Holdings Inc. on Tuesday will begin allowing select customers of its Venmo app to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies as consumers increasingly look for ways to pile into the digital assets. The firm will make it available to all the app’s users, who number more than 70 million, within the next few weeks.For now, Venmo is allowing customers to trade in just four types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Users will also have the ability to share their cryptocurrency purchases on the Venmo feed.“We do think some customers will certainly want to share this fun experience,” Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager of the Venmo app at PayPal, said in an interview. “They can share with their friends and community that they’ve taken the step into this space.”PayPal has been adding new features to its PayPal and Venmo apps as the payments giant seeks to become a one-stop shop for consumers’ financial needs. After adding the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency to its PayPal app, the company saw customers who used the feature begin signing into the app at twice the rate they previously did.Because Venmo’s customer base skews younger than the traditional PayPal user, the company is planning to debut a series of videos with the new offering to make sure clients are educated about their purchases.“Crypto is volatile -- any crypto you buy can rise and fall in value, sometimes pretty quickly,” according to one such video, titled “Crypto vs. Stock.” “It’s important to tread carefully.”There are signs Venmo users are already taking the plunge into cryptocurrency trading after the value of many of the biggest digital currencies soared in recent months. In one survey of 2,200 Venmo users, the company found that almost a third have already started purchasing cryptocurrencies or stocks.“We think that the timing is right for this,” Esch said. “Our goal here is to provide customers with a really easy-to-use way to learn about and experience ownership of crypto from a trusted platform.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Venmo to Allow Customers to Buy, Sell and Hold Cryptocurrencies"

And indeed the rally may be tapering off, with the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization shedding about 16% of its value in just four days (April 14 to April 18). Source: Shutterstock But amidst it all, there’s another reason to be optimistic about the long-term potential for BTC-USD. What Happened? PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) subsidiary Venmo announced on April 20 that its 70 million-plus users will now be able to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies on its mobile app. Venmo’s move to offer its users crypto access extends PayPal’s foray into the crypto world, as PayPal users can already pay online merchants globally in crypto.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why This Is A Big Deal for Bitcoin For the record, the original purpose of bitcoin is to become a widely adopted peer-to-peer money that people actually spend. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In In order for that to happen, people need to have easy access to the cryptocurrency. And widespread institutionalization is the fastest way to get crypto into people’s hands because large institutions already have the users, according to a report from Big Four accounting firm KPMG. According to the report: “Cryptoassets have potential. But for them to realize this potential, institutionalization is needed. Institutionalization is the at-scale participation in the crypto market of banks, broker-dealers, exchanges, payment providers, fintechs, and other entities in the global financial services ecosystem. We believe this is a necessary next step for crypto to create trust and scale.” Venmo’s move is another step towards at-scale institutionalization of crypto. Cash App, a competing payment application from Jack Dorsey’s Square (NYSE: SQ), already offers crypto access to its 30 million-plus users. The image below, provided by BofA Securities, shows notable institutional bitcoin adoption moves since Q3 2020. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Price? On April 20, the day Venmo announced its new crypto offering, bitcoin recovered some of its losses from the recent crash, rising roughly 1.5% on the day. However, the announcement hasn’t been enough to push bitcoin into another rally. On the contrary, BTC-USD has dipped further than the price level when Venmo made its announcement. At present, fears about a reported crackdown by the U.S. Treasury on the use of digital assets for money laundry, coupled with a reported blackout in the Xinjiang region of China, appear to be more significant factors for bitcoin. To clarify, Xinjiang is home to several bitcoin mining farms, and a blackout there significantly reduces the global hash rate for the bitcoin network. While it’s difficult to tell when bitcoin price will recover from its recent losses, the Venmo announcement provides another assurance that bitcoin is here to stay. As more institutions begin to offer their customers access to bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s demand will continue to surge, as more people would have easier access to it. Also, as more people start owning bitcoin, its use case as a medium of exchange will continue to evolve. Given that the crypto market is still in its nascent stage, I believe the crypto market will continue to experience periods of high volatility. However, I believe that any institutional adoption announcement is a signal to buy and “hodl“ for the long-haul.

2021-04-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Chrissy Teigen is hoping a tie-up with PayPal Holdings Inc. will lead to bigger sales for her cookware and accessories brand Cravings.The cookbook author, model and television personality struck a multiyear deal to add to her website PayPal’s offering known as Pay in 4, which allows customers to split up purchases into four payments. Users of the Cravings by Chrissy Teigen website already choose to check out with PayPal more than a third of the time.“Honestly, not a lot of people have that money to spend -- that $100 or $150 to spend in one go,” Teigen said in a phone interview. “They might have a little bit of it right now and a little bit of it later, and we want to make that a completely fine thing for people.”With the agreement, Cravings becomes the latest U.S. retailer looking to offer a buy-now, pay-later option. Customers receive items right away and pay for them over time, usually in four installments and often without incurring fees. Consumers have swarmed to such financing in recent months, and the market is expected to quadruple to $352 billion by 2025.PayPal, for its part, only started offering the service in the last three months of 2020. It now represents more than a third of sales on its platform from users under the age of 30.“The biggest common denominator is price point,” Greg Lisiewski, PayPal’s vice president of global pay later, said in an interview. “For a $200 or $300 purchase, to take that and make it in four payments of $50, or four payments of $75, it’s really helpful.”Teigen debuted the Cravings site in 2019, though she added the ability for customers to buy from her cookware line and other accessories only this year. Early results from allowing customers to split up their purchases into four payments show that the average order value rises by 34% on the Cravings site, PayPal said. Offerings on the site include a $64 cast-iron enamel skillet, an $88 linen robe and a $36 popcorn-seasoning kit.“We try to put it out at an affordable price, but still people are going to need a little extra boost and a little help,” Teigen said. “We’ve seen the benefits of it.

2021-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- MessageBird has agreed to buy U.S. email marketing firm SparkPost for $600 million, marking its fourth deal since October.The Dutch software company raised $800 million from investors to fund the all-cash deal, which will intensify Messagebird’s focus on North America and its competition with U.S. rival Twilio Inc.“We currently have maybe 20 folks in the U.S., but at the close of this transaction we’ll have about 300,” MessageBird Chief Executive Officer Robert Vis said in an interview. “So if there was ever a move we’re making into the U.S., it’s this one.”SparkPost sells software that companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., PayPal Holdings Inc., LinkedIn and Adobe Inc. use to send marketing emails, and analytics tools to measure and improve how many people open and read them. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.“When we made the deal, we didn’t have the money to pay for it, so we actually raised eight hundred million dollars in 21 days,” he said. “It was an exclusive process so there were no bankers. We agreed on a price that made sense for all of us and then we had a time frame to go raise that money to show that we could actually pay for it.”MessageBird, which completed a trio of acquisitions as recently as March, sells tools to companies that let them add a few lines of code to their app or website so customers can text, email, video conference or call in with questions. It also works directly with telecom operators worldwide to deliver SMS and instant message alerts, such as two-factor authentication codes or weather warnings.SparkPost’s technology significantly extends MessageBird’s investment in email, and puts it in more direct competition with companies such as Mailgun and Sendgrid.Participants financing the $800 million fundraise include Eurazeo, Tiger Global, Owl Rock Capital, and BlackRock Inc., according to a statement. Eurazeo’s Nathalie Kornhoff-Bruls will join MessageBird’s board.MessageBird was recently valued at $3 billion by investors and is expected to be ready for an initial public offering as soon as this year. Acquiring SparkPost strengthens its domestic competition with Twilio, now valued at about $67.8 billion four years after it listed at a $1.23 billion market value.Vis said it was still 10-year-old MessageBird’s intention to be ready for an IPO this year, but that it remained an option rather than a goal or necessity. He said the speed and volume of capital his firm was able to raise in just a few weeks showed access to funds was not a roadblock to growth.The SparkPost deal will be a quick turnaround for some of that company’s backers. The Wall Street Journal reported in January the email marketing company had raised $180 million from investors including LLR Partners, NewSpring Capital and PNC Bank, more than half of which the paper said was in the form of equity.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","MessageBird Raises $800 Million, Buys U.S. Startup SparkPost"

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Paxos Trust Co., a blockchain startup that caters to financial institutions including PayPal Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG, is valued at $2.4 billion after raising $300 million from investors.The New York-based firm will use the new cash to hire more employees and add to its working capital, Chief Executive Officer Chad Cascarilla said in an interview. The capital may also be used for acquisitions, though none are planned, he said.“The trajectory of our business, just like the space, has changed tremendously in the last six months,” Cascarilla said. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, startups like Paxos that provide infrastructure support for the industry are benefiting.In March, Paxos used its technology to settle stock trades within hours of the transactions, rather than days, in a preview of what may soon be commonplace on Wall Street. The trades were on behalf of customers of Credit Suisse and Instinet LLC, Cascarilla has said. Paxos is testing its technology to transfer shares and money in near-real time in what could be a threat to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.’s half-century dominance in equity markets.Read more: Stock Trades Settled in Hours Not Days as Blockchain Model GrowsLast week, the company received preliminary approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to operate a national trust bank, and some of the new funds will support that effort. Paxos is close to submitting an application with U.S. regulators for a clearing-agency registration and is pursuing a Major Payment Institution license in Singapore.“Firms are coming to us to provide them with lots of different capabilities,” Cascarilla said.The Paxos series D investment was led by venture capital firm Oak HC/FT, and took in funds from existing investors Declaration Partners, PayPal Ventures and Mithril Capital among others.Investors have been pumping money into cryptocurrency projects such as Digital Asset Holdings, Chainalysis and Alchemy. That coincides with Bitcoin and Ether prices hitting records in recent months. As of April 27, 156 startups focusing on digital technology had raised $3.1 billion, compared with 341 deals that drew $2.3 billion in funding for all of 2020, according to CB Insights.Paxos also offers three stablecoins, digital assets that are designed to avoid the volatile price swings of Bitcoin by being collateralized by U.S. dollars or other assets. The amount Paxos holds on deposit for its stablecoins has swelled to nearly $10 billion, up from $2 billion at the start of 2021 and $250 million at the beginning of last year, Cascarilla said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Blockchain Firm Paxos Valued at $2.4 Billion on New Fundraising

2021-04-30,"The pandemic created a shift from storefront to e-commerce, which is a trend that bodes well for fintech stocks. With global saving rates topping $5.4 trillion, we are likely to see an increase in consumer spending as we approach the new normal. With the digital payments expected to be the norm in the future, all arrows point towards greater upside in the coming months. There has been a broader shift from the use of credit cards to debit cards. Debit transactions have been on the rise this past year as people received their stimulus checks in their checking accounts. Many have parked this money in digital wallets which have served as a major source of income for fintech companies. The rise of “buy now pay later” platforms that allow customers to pay in installments has added to its allure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Secondly, the coronavirus pandemic has ushered in a touchless society leading many people to use digital payment apps for their purchases. For many fintech companies, what started out as offering a more efficient way to pay for things has now transformed into a traditional financial services stack. With brokerage and lending options, these platforms stand to upend traditional banking. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Here’s a look at three fintech stocks to buy with plenty of growth opportunities ahead. Square (NYSE:SQ) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Paysafe (NYSE:PSFE) Fintech Stocks: Square (SQ) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Square’s most attractive feature is its incredibly diverse offering. The company’s core platform caters to merchants with a POS system and cloud-based services like payroll and management. On the flip side, Square’s subsidiary Cash App is created for consumers. In addition to peer-to-peer payments, the app also allows users to trade stocks and hold bitcoin. Cash App is widely considered to be one of the fastest-growing digital platforms in the U.S. as its users more than tripled in the last three years. In 2020, the fintech giant’s net revenue soared 101% to $9.5 billion as more people made the shift to digital payments. A decline in activity on Square’s core app as a result of business closures was offset by Cash App’s consumer usage. As businesses continue to reopen, Square is poised to recoup its pandemic losses quicker than most. Its broad ecosystem of financial services gives the company a major upside opportunity to disrupt the digital payment space. PayPal (PYPL) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com One of Square’s biggest competitors is PayPal. Like its fintech peer, PayPal experienced a massive surge in user activity during the pandemic. But despite a stellar 2020 and 2021, the fintech giant shows signs of even greater growth ahead. Shares of the company are up 112% in the last year with revenue also rising 23%. PayPal added 73 million new accounts during the pandemic and introduced a number of new features to increase the versatility of its platform. Among these was its big push into cryptocurrency. PayPal users can now buy, hold and trade Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) on the platform. Looking ahead, the company’s pandemic tailwinds are here to stay. PayPal expects to add 50 million new accounts in 2021 and increase its total user base to 750 million by 2025. Total free-cash-flow (FCF) for the year is expected to top $40 billion in the next five years. Moreover, as physical stores re-open, PayPal is looking to streamline its in-store payment solutions. The goal is to further the reach of Venmo and blur the lines between offline and online payments. PYPL stock isn’t exactly cheap, trading at 59 times forward earnings but with numerous opportunities for growth, it’s definitely worth adding to your portfolio. Fintech Stocks: Paysafe (PSFE) Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.com London-based payment platform Paysafe recently made its U.S. market debut via a SPAC merger. The company owns a number of subsidiaries under its brand name including Paysafe Card, Skrill and Income Access. These platforms enable digital transactions and offer prepaid and digital wallet services. But Paysafe’s most successful endeavor is its iGaming e-cash network which facilitates online gaming payments. With a presence in over 50 markets, the platform can help Paysafe make its mark in the lucrative sports betting industry in the U.S. In terms of growth opportunities, there no doubt that Paysafe will face stiff competition from PayPal and Square in the U.S. But the company’s large global footprint which includes 3,400 employees across 12 locations will serve as a major tailwind. Moreover, as iGaming picks up across the nation, Paysafe’s online gaming payments platform will see a lot of activity. The company saw $92 billion in payment volume last year and counts DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) as a customer. As sports betting is legalized in more states, the U.S. gaming market will be a tremendous opportunity for the company.

2021-05-03,"Some 15% of the American public owns some form of cryptocurrency – and a large part of that group jumped on the bandwagon in the last two years. The digital currencies – Bitcoin is the most famous, but there are scores of others – offer users a distinct set of advantages, based on their blockchain technology. First, the crypto coins are secure – as a digital technology, blockchain is notoriously difficult to break. Second, the coins have the chief attribute of any store of value: scarcity. There is a mathematical limit to how many Bitcoin, for example, will ever exist – and that limit gives them their value. People want a secure online currency, are willing to pay for it, and the relatively scarce (compared to traditional fiat currencies) crypto coins offer both attributes. The result, in recent years, has been a boom as investors have started looking seriously at the crypto sector. Of course, any digital currency is going to need a range of services to be usable. Financial companies, to back it, and payment servers, to handle transactions, to name just two. Other companies and major business figures – Elon Musk comes readily to mind – will invest heavily in it. All of this creates a landscape in which investors can profit from crypto without ever buying an actual coin. They can buy into the companies that are poised to ride the cryptocurrency boom to higher profits. How big is crypto? The market for it surpassed $2 trillion earlier this month, a number that’s hard to get your head around. So, as usual, we’ve turned to the TipRanks platform to help us make sense of the equity landscape as pertains to crypto. We’ve located three stocks – from different sectors – that according to some of the Street’s top analysts are all set to deliver crypto charged gains. Let’s dive in. Silvergate Capital (SI) We’ll start in the financial world, fitting when we’re discussing a new financial asset like crypto. Silvergate Capital is a commercial bank, chartered in California and providing financial services and infrastructure to customers in the digital currency industry. Silvergate has been in the finance industry for over 3 decades and has turned a profit every year for the last 21 years. Silvergate got into digital currency in 2013, with an active pursuit of digital currency customers. Today, the company has over 1,100 customers in this sector. In March of this year, Silvergate expanded its digital currency services, using a custody service to hold Bitcoin as collateral for US dollar commercial loans. The service offers large Bitcoin holders a way to access liquid capital without selling off the underlying cryptocurrency. Silvergate provides custody for the Bitcoin collateral through Coinbase and Fidelity Digital Assets. In the recent financial release, for 1Q21, Silvergate reported EPS of 55 cents per share, beating the industry estimates by 14% and better yet, growing 139% year-over-year. Supporting the earnings growth, Silvergate recorded 29% customer base growth year-over-year. Digital currency deposits grew from $5 billion at the end of December to $6.8 billion at the end of March. The company’s rapid growth can also be seen in the share value, which is up an astounding 582% in the past 12 months. 5-star analyst Joseph Vafi, of Canaccord Genuity, is impressed by Silvergate’s growth in digital currency banking, and writes, “Silvergate delivered again in Q1, highlighted by another near 40% sequential increase in deposits on top of the 130+ % q/q increase in Q4. This impressive deposit growth was driven by similarly strong growth in demand for use of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) as institutional interest in bitcoin continues to accelerate. Just as important are the implications of the two strategic deals with Fidelity and Coinbase inked in Q1. In our view, it is becoming clear that not only is it emerging as a key financial services cog across all of institutional cryptocurrency trading, but SI is now becoming the key partner for cryptocurrency custodians seeking to offer margin lending. Importantly, Silvergate has a core competitive cost advantage in crypto margin lending, given its underlying bank charter which provides a very low cost of capital via raising zero interest customer deposits.” Vafi, who is rated in the top 100 of Wall Streets analysts, puts a Buy on SI shares, and his $150 price target suggests the stock has room for 36% growth this year. (To watch Vafi’s track record, click here.) Canaccord’s Vafi is no outlier in his bullish views. Silvergate has 5 recent reviews, and they include 4 Buys against a single Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s share price is $107.22, and the average price target of $158 implies a 45% upside – even more bullish than Vafi allows – for the coming year. (See Silvergate’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) While Silvergate is hardly a household name, PayPal has become one. The company is the market leader in online payment processing, a booming industry in itself, and its top line revenue grew from $17.7 billion in 2019 to $21.4 billion in 2020. The company recorded sequential increases in revenue the second, third, and fourth quarters of last year, and saw Q4 EPS reach $1, up from 43 cents in the prior’s year’s first quarter. That PayPal’s growth has come during the pandemic is unsurprising. We all know e-commerce boomed last year, benefitting from social lockdown policies, and e-commerce requires online payment processors. PayPal has a leading role in that industry, with over 377 million active accounts, conducting 4.4 billion payment transactions totaling $277 billion in payment volume. In a major development for the company, PayPal announced in April that its mobile payment app, Venmo, will now offer users the ability to buy, sell, and hold four crypto currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. According to one survey, some 30% of Venmo’s users already deal in crypto; this move makes their transactions more convenient, and opens an easy avenue to crypto for Venmo’s full 70-million-strong userbase. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, points out a key factor in PayPal’s new Venmo feature when he writes, “The move marked the first time that consumers will be able to use crypto to make purchases at a large array of merchants. The crypto option is now available in the U.S. with more than half of PYPL’s 29mm merchants, with the company stating that more would be added soon.” Palmer believes that this move toward crypto will be a net positive for PayPal, and he backs that with a Buy rating and $345 price target implying a one-year upside of 31%. (To watch Palmer’s track record, click here.) That Wall Street agrees with Palmer is obvious from the Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock, supported by new fewer than 29 recent Buy ratings. These outweigh the 4 Holds that have also been set here. PYPL shares are trading for $262.29, and their $310.68 average price target suggests the stock has room to grow 18% this year. (See PayPal’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) CleanSpark (CLSK) Last up, CleanSpark, is both a software company and a clean energy company. That makes more sense than at first would be apparent – CleanSpark’s software products are designed to control microgrid and distributed energy systems. These systems allow users to go off-grid, opting out of traditional power distribution to tap into cleaner green energy sources. CleanSpark provides the control software for these systems. Earlier this year, CleanSpark made a couple of bold moves that made waves in its own industry, and in crypto. In March, the company put an offering of public shares on the market – more than 9 million common shares – at $22 each, raising more than $200 million before expenses. That alone got notice from investors. In addition, the company started using the funds to buy up more Bitcoin mining rigs. These are the computer systems through which new bitcoins are generated. They draw massive amounts of power, put out a lot of heat – and CleanSpark has invested heavily, not only in the computational mining rigs, which will slowly produce new bitcoins, but in the clean energy infrastructure to make the company’s Atlanta mining location 95% carbon-free. The company’s latest investment in Bitcoin mining will start to take physical shape later this year. And finally, in April, CleanSpark announced that it had secured contracts for an additional 22,680 Bitcoin miners. When all of the new rigs are installed, up and running, CleanSpark expects to increase its Bitcoin mining production to more than 3.2 EH/s. In the quarter ended March 31, CleanSpark produced 144 Bitcoins, and has produced a total of 205 Bitcoins since it began mining ops in December. In all of this, CleanSpark has not lost sight of its original focus. The company also announced in April that it had secured a net $16.2 million increase in its microgrid contracts, a year-over-year increase of 220%. In coverage of this stock for H.C. Wainwright, top analyst Amit Dayal writes, “We believe CleanSpark's execution on the microgrid and Bitcoin mining fronts could position the company to exceed our expectations for FY2021, as our assumptions now appear relatively conservative. The stock has pulled back since its January 2021 highs alongside some other Bitcoin mining comps, and general weakness across small-cap names. However, we believe, with Bitcoin prices remaining well above our assumptions, no known changes to mining operations, and the company adding to its microgrid backlog, the operational side of the story appears to be intact. We believe CleanSpark's valuation remains compelling at current levels with the company set for YoY revenue and earnings growth of more than 150% and more than 1,000%, respectively, in FY2022.” In line with his upbeat outlook, Dayal gives CLSK shares a Buy rating with a $50 price target that indicates confidence in a robust 135% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here.) There are only two recent reviews on this stock – including Dayal’s – but both agree: this is one to Buy. CLSK shares are currently trading for $21.26 and the price target averages to $47.50, suggesting an upside of 123% this year. (See CleanSpark’s stock analysis at TipRanks.)

In 1Q, PYPL expects revenues to rise 26% year-on-year excluding foreign currency fluctuations. The company anticipates non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by around 50% year-on-year. Analysts are expecting PYPL to report revenues of $5.9 billion, while the Earnings Whisper number, or the Street’s unofficial view on earnings, stands at $1.01 per share. For FY21, the company has forecast total payment volume (TPV) to rise year-on-year on a percentage basis in the high 20’s, and revenues to be around $25.5 billion. The company expects an approximate 17% (currency neutral) year-on-year rise in revenues, that includes a 400-basis point impact from eBay’s switch to managed payments. eBay spun-off PayPal in 2015 but until last year, purchases on eBay were still being processed through PayPal. This is likely to end this year following the development of eBay's own payment platform, Managed Payments. PYPL expects non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase year-on-year by approximately 17% in FY21. Prior Period Results PayPal’s 4Q earnings topped Street estimates as the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, up 29% year-over-year, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $1 per share. Sales of $6.12 billion topped consensus estimates of $6.09 billion and rose 23% year-over-year, driven by higher payment volumes and the addition of net new active accounts. (See PayPal Holdings stock analysis on TipRanks) Factors To Look For PYPL continues to be optimistic when it comes to the growth of its international business, as the company saw a 31% year-on-year (currency neutral) increase in cross-border transactions in the fourth quarter. While PYPL anticipates fluctuations in exchange rates to have some impact on these transactions, it expects cross-border transactions to continue on their growth trajectory. PYPL also wants to expand its product offerings with Venmo, and expects Venmo contributions to the company’s revenue growth to increase. PYPL expects greater traction from its Buy Now, Pay Later model, with more customers opting for this model and transaction sizes continuing to grow. This could lead to higher transaction revenues for the company over the medium-to-long term. PYPL’s Buy Now, Pay Later model lets merchants in selected countries who are registered with PayPal offer their customers the choice of paying in installments. The company expects to expand the roll out of this model to additional countries later this year. Recent Developments PayPal is increasingly focusing on supporting cryptocurrencies on its platform. Last month, PYPL linked up with Paxos Trust Company to secure a first-of-its-kind conditional Bitlicense that will allow it to enable the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies on the Venmo app. Venmo is PYPL’s mobile payment service. Venmo customers will also be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Similarly, in March this year, the company also introduced a new feature, Checkout with Crypto, that would enable PYPL’s US users to convert cryptocurrency to government-issued currency at checkout with no transaction fees. In the same month, PYPL also announced the acquisition of Israel-based company, Curv, for an undisclosed amount. Curv is a cloud-based infrastructure security provider for digital assets. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of this year. Analyst Recommendations Last week, Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo reiterated a Buy and a price target of $310 on the stock. Chiodo believes PYPL’s Venmo could increasingly contribute towards the revenue growth of the company. Chiodo said in a note to investors, “Our analysis suggests that in 2019E the majority of Venmo revenue (~$365mm CSe) was driven by Instant Deposit (its first major monetized product), followed by the debit card (launched in 2018), and then Pay with Venmo.” “By 2025E, our illustrative build suggests ~25% of Venmo revenue will be driven by products which either did not exist or were de minimis in 2020 (e.g., Venmo Credit Card, Business Profiles, bill-pay, cryptocurrency trading, etc.). Further, we expect Pay with Venmo alone will make up ~50% of Venmo’s 2025E revenue mix, making it the single largest contributor,” Chiodo added. Overall, PYPL has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $310.68 implies 18.5% upside potential from current levels.

2021-05-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The proliferation of vaccines around the world hasn’t stopped people from shopping online with PayPal Holdings Inc., which boosted its forecasts for growth in new users and revenue for the year.Total payments volume in the first three months of the year surged a record 50% to $285 billion, topping the $265 billion average of analyst estimates, even as local governments continued to loosen restrictions throughout the quarter. The firm now expects to add as many as 55 million new users to its platform this year, an increase from earlier guidance.PayPal has benefited as consumers swarmed to online shopping over the course of the last year, spurred by pandemic-related shutdowns and orders to shelter in place as much as possible. Still, investors worried that the trend would reverse as the pandemic eased. Wednesday’s results show PayPal doesn’t believe that shift is slowing down anytime soon.“Even as stores begin to open up, as restaurants begin to open, as events begin to open, people will be paying for those things in a digital fashion,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in an interview. “We now believe the shift to consumer digital behavior is going to remain essentially unchanged in a post-Covid world.”PayPal shares rose 4.9% to $259.55 in extended New York trading after the announcement. The stock had climbed 5.6% this year through the close of regular trading Wednesday, outpacing the 4.6% advance of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.The payments giant now expects revenue for the full year to climb 20% to $25.75 billion, a slight increase from the 19% jump it was previously expecting. Total payments volume is likely to jump by roughly 30%.PayPal added 14.5 million new users to its platform during the first three months of the year, an increase that also topped estimates. Overall revenue surged 29% to $6.03 billion, greater than the $5.88 billion analysts were anticipating.Even the firm’s person-to-person payments service Venmo has benefited from the pandemic after the firm debuted a new credit-card for the service last year. Volumes inside Venmo rose 63% to $51 billion.PayPal has been adding new services and capabilities to its apps as part of a bigger push to become a so-called super app, which would allow consumers to shop and manage finances all inside the PayPal platform.The firm in recent months, for instance, has added the ability for consumers to split up their purchases and pay them off over time as well as the ability to buy, sell and hold certain cryptocurrencies.Payment transactions per active account -- a measure of usage on the firm’s platform -- jumped 7% to 42.2.“That’s really significant,” Schulman said. “The new products and services were putting into place like buy-now-pay-later, crypto, the Venmo credit card, those are performing well beyond our expectations.”(Updates with CEO interview beginning in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Rises as E-Commerce Strength Persists in Vaccine Era

The social network said it wanted to give users a new way to earn money from its service instead of having to rely on ephemeral likes and retweets.

Senior product manager Esther Crawford said the tips would help users support the ""incredible voices"" that drive Twitter's appeal, adding that the feature would be expanded to more users in future. But a security expert who probed the system found that tipping via Paypal sometimes exposed the giver's full address to the receiver, raising safety concerns. Rachel Tobac, a hacker who tests clients' networks for loopholes, said: ""PayPal needs to make it crystal clear which data is given to money receivers and stop sharing that data, and Twitter needs to educate users who don’t realise what info tip receivers get when using PayPal.""",Twitter lets users send cash 'tips' to their favourite users

2021-05-06,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) jumped more than 4% in the pre-market session on Thursday after the digital payments company posted better-than-expected 1Q results. The rise in net new active accounts (NNAs), total payment volume (TPV), and strong revenues were the primary drivers. Notably, after recording the strongest first-quarter results in its history, PayPal provided upbeat guidance for 2Q and FY2021. PayPal reported 1Q adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, up 84% year-over-year, and beat the Street’s estimates of $1.01. Adjusted net revenues grew 29% to $6.03 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $5.9 billion. TPV was $285 billion in 1Q, up 46% year-over-year, while the company added 14.5 million NNAs in the quarter. (See PayPal stock analysis on TipRanks) For 2Q, the company projects revenues of $6.25 billion, higher than the consensus estimate of $6.16 billion. Moreover, its non-GAAP earnings guidance of $1.12 per share came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of $1.10. For 2021, the company expects revenues and non-GAAP earnings to be $25.75 billion and $4.70 per share, respectively. Consensus estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $25.71 billion and $4.57 per share, respectively. Additionally, NNAs are expected to increase in the range of 52-55 million, while TPV to be up 30%. Following the 1Q results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon maintained a Hold rating on the stock. Tandon commented, “We are encouraged by the strong results and outlook and are raising our estimates. However, with the shares trading up 4%+ after-hours and expected to open at an ex-cash P/E multiple of ~43x our FY22 estimate, we believe the risk-reward is neutral based on our expectations for PYPL to generate ~20% EPS growth over the MT.” PayPal shares have exploded almost 93% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys versus 2 Holds. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $319, which implies 28.9% upside potential to current levels. PayPal scores an 8 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is one of those new kids on the block teaching three old dogs new tricks. But Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) are holding their own. They too, transformed into new companies for the future. The question then becomes about timing.

Indices are at all time highs but there are areas with extreme weakness. Great stocks like Paypal have fallen through the cracks of late. At one point yesterday, PYPL was down 20% from its 2021 highs. Square (NYSE:SQ) was in a similar predicament going into its earnings report. Fintech Is An Investment For Generations These are great fintech businesses with a rosy outlook. Even before the pandemic, but especially since, trends in their favor have accelerated, with a long runway to boot. They also have their hands in all the right areas, including Crypto. Under the current conditions, weakness in PayPal stock is opportunity to get long. The potential of subsidiary Venmo’s 50 million users alone is good enough reason to jump in. But even though I like the prognosis, we shouldn’t blindly jump in. My concern comes from the prevailing irrational exuberance in the markets. Bulls are only selling in order to buy something else. Plus, there is a new breed of retail investors to contend with, and they are ferocious. They have extreme conviction without the usual backup for it. I’ve had the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with them in social media. They are very confident and unwilling to bend. Only time will tell if their positions prove durable through bearish cycles. For now, it works because the macroeconomic conditions favor bulls. We have extreme tailwinds to compensate for skill potholes. The U.S. government is infusing the economy with an astronomical amount of money; we are already above $5 trillion. That’s larger than any nation’s GDP on the planet except for two. Shorting this much artificial catalyst would be hazardous for your bank account. Buying PYPL Stock on Dips Makes Sense Source: Charts by TradingView Therefore buying the dips makes sense and PayPal stock qualifies. Late last year it broke out from $230, which we charted as a level of contention. That level is now close to provide support. Since this isn’t an absolute line in the sand, investors should allow for wiggle room. They can do that by using options to sell puts instead of buying shares outright. Otherwise it’s best to take partial positions and add later if the selling persists. There is further technical support around $190 per share. Those lucky enough to get in there should be very happy over the next few years. There is fundamental justification for the enthusiasm. The income statement shows that revenues and net income grew by 60% and 130% in four years. These are impressive figures but what is more attractive is that the stock is still cheap. Given strong growth, the 70 P/E and 14 price-to-sales ratios are reasonable. This is still about 40% cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by an absolute comparison. PayPal has a good story to tell and technical support besides. To sweeten the pot even more, fundamentals suggest it is still cheap. Those are reasons enough for me to argue for owning shares on weakness, not panicking out of them. SQ reported earnings last night and the stock had an initial negative shock but quickly recovered. Perhaps most of the froth is already out and the bulls could be ready to resume buying. We are still going into a seasonally tough season for stocks so caution is still a good idea.

2021-05-10,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is eyeing life beyond the checkout button.In the coming months, the firm is planning to debut a bevy of new services, which could include high-yield savings accounts, check-cashing services and stock-investing capabilities. It’s all being done in the hopes of PayPal becoming the world’s next “super app,” akin to China’s Alipay or WeChat, India’s Paytm or Singapore’s Grab.The stakes are high: If PayPal pulls it off, the company could become a bigger part of U.S. consumers’ lives than Amazon, Google or Facebook. But, in the U.S., there is no shortage of banking giants and technology firms that have tried and failed to accomplish what PayPal wants to do.“It’s difficult to become a super app,” PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in an interview. “I think we have a chance if we execute extremely well against this. But it’s obviously a place that a lot of companies are thinking about as well.”The idea came to Schulman during a dinner three years ago at his home in Palo Alto, California, close to PayPal’s San Jose headquarters, with Martin Lau, the president of WeChat parent company Tencent Holdings Ltd.As the two dined, a picture began forming in Schulman’s head: Consumers could come to the PayPal app for more than just paying for things online. It could be their one-stop shop for all things shopping and finance, mirroring the success WeChat has had in China.“There’s too many apps on all of our phones -- I can’t have an app for my pharmacy, my grocery, for all the different retailers I have,” Schulman said. “I can’t have 40 to 50 different apps on my phone. I can’t remember the passwords, I don’t want to enter in all my info every time. There’s really only eight to 10 apps that we use every single day or every single week. Those apps are going to morph into what we call super apps.”He ordered his team to begin conducting consumer research.The feat, if PayPal pulls it off, will not be an easy one. Other U.S. companies have found little success with similar attempts.Take Uber Technologies Inc. The ride-hailing giant announced in 2019 that it would create a new unit focused on financial services. Less than a year later, the executive tapped to lead the initiative left the company after Uber said it planned to “de-prioritize” several of the unit’s projects, which had included credit cards, a digital wallet and instant payments for drivers.That contrasts with Grab Holdings Inc., which started as a Southeast Asian ride-hailing company and has since expanded into financial services, payments and food delivery. The company is poised to go public via a U.S. blank-check company that values the company at almost $40 billion.JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s experience was more like Uber’s. The largest U.S. bank spent years touting its Chase Pay app, which was supposed to make it easier for people to shop and redeem card rewards. After the effort was slow to take off, the lender discontinued the app and ultimately shelved the entire project, encouraging consumers to instead sign up with its would-be competitor: PayPal.“It’s going to be hard to create a super app as we know it, like what we’ve seen in China,” Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said in an interview. “We have compartmentalized how we consume things. We didn’t have the luxury of finding things in one place like people in emerging markets have had because of the super apps.”Still, Sakhrani said, some consumers might be open to trying the super-app model, such as the 25% of U.S. adults that struggle to access mainstream financial services.The grandson of a union organizer in New York’s garment district, Schulman started his career at AT&T as an entry-level employee. He worked his way up to president of the firm’s consumer long-distance business before being asked by Richard Branson to be the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile USA Inc. in 2001. He shepherded the company’s sale to Sprint Nextel Corp. eight years later.He ultimately joined PayPal from American Express Co., where he had been overseeing the company’s efforts to offer services to under-banked Americans. At PayPal, he’s been known to hand employees a check and ask them to find a way to cash it without using their bank accounts -- an exercise that’s meant to show what life is like for the 63 million Americans unable to use standard financial services.A practitioner of the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga who’s rarely seen in public without his signature cowboy boots, Schulman has been setting up meetings with regulators as well as the leaders of the largest U.S. banks and credit-card companies to persuade them to continue partnering with PayPal as it pushes toward super-app status.“The reality is we believe our products and services can exist within the PayPal ecosystem,” AmEx CEO Steve Squeri said in an interview. “As Dan talks about the super app -- which I think is an interesting concept, and we’ll see how it all plays out -- we still believe we’ll win their card business and we’ll win some of their lending business.”PayPal is planning to debut the new services in the third quarter. The company is now processing more than $1 trillion in payments on its platform annually, and is adding as many as 55 million new users this year, on top of the 377 million it already had.It’s all a far cry from where PayPal started when it went public under Schulman’s leadership six years ago. Since then, the company’s valuation has soared to roughly $300 billion -- more than Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. combined.“This needs massive scale,” Schulman said. “Half a billion to 1 billion people, at a minimum. One billion people would be ideal.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",PayPal Wants to Be a Lot More Than an Online Checkout Button

2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- The Diem Association, a group of Facebook Inc. and 25 other companies and nonprofit groups once known as Libra, is moving its main operations to the U.S. and partnering with a bank to issue a cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars.The new plan includes an agreement with Silvergate Capital Corp., a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, which will issue the coin and manage Diem’s reserve of U.S. dollars, the association said Wednesday in a statement.Diem said it’s still building out a global payments network, with the idea that it could serve its own stablecoin or even central bank digital currencies if world governments decide to issue them.“It’s critical for the U.S. to foster innovation in this space. The U.S. can’t really afford to fall behind here,” said Diem Chief Executive Officer Stuart Levey. Levey said Diem’s payments network will be able to lower the cost of sending money around the world, whether it’s through a Diem-issued coin or the central-bank digital currencies that many countries are considering.Shares of Silvergate Capital jumped about 20% in extended trading after the deal’s announcement.While more straightforward to achieve, the new plans are a big comedown from the vision unveiled by the Libra Association in 2019.That June, Facebook and 27 partners announced the project to great fanfare with large ambitions. The Libra Association, as the Diem Association was then known, said it planned to launch a global stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro and others.The blowback from world governments was fierce. Even though Facebook executives said they were just one of equal partners in the association, U.S. lawmakers said its involvement gave them concerns about protecting user data or giving the already powerful company a toehold in financial services. Some lawmakers even posited that libra could be a threat to the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Amid the criticism, the Libra Association lost some of the members most equipped to address financial regulators, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. Eventually, the Libra Association decided to delay the launch of a multi-currency coin in favor of separate cryptocurrencies linked to individual countries’ money. The association also rebranded as Diem, but never received a necessary license from the financial regulator in its headquarters country of Switzerland.Now, Diem’s ambitions are tightening once again. The association’s members currently include Facebook, crypto-focused companies like Coinbase Global Inc., and others such as ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and commerce platform Shopify Inc. Diem said while it expected eventual approval in Switzerland, it’s withdrawing the application for its license and moving most operations to the U.S.Diem’s U.S. subsidiary plans to register as a money-services business with a division of the U.S. Treasury Department.Though Diem’s path forward might be easier that Libra’s, the association could struggle to explain how the project differs from myriad dollar-backed stablecoins that already exist, such as USD Coin.In an interview, Levey said the association believes that the way it’s implementing the coin, with built-in consumer protections and anti-crime provisions, will be appealing to regulators and companies that want to use the network.Many central banks, including those of the U.S., Europe and China, are in the process of researching or building their own digital currencies. If those come to pass, Levey said, Diem can adjust its network to accommodate them.Diem declined to say when the pilot would launch.(Updates with Silvergate share price move in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Crypto Project Reboots With Smaller Ambitions

Prior to that he held senior leadership roles in global financial institutions such as PayPal Inc. His role will involve helping to enhance Circle’s commitment to financial crime compliance, anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and other financial integrity activities, according to a statement from the company.“Compliance is extraordinarily important” as the company works to invest in and scale operations, licensing and future products and services, said Circle founder Jeremy Allaire, in an interview. “The quality, the depth, the scale of what institutions like Circle bring to the table is critical.”Compliance has risen quickly to the top of crypto firms’ agendas as digital-asset prices rise and the space matures, which has also helped attract interest from regulators.

Binance Holdings Ltd. in March hired former U.S. Senator Max Baucus as an adviser; its U.S. affiliate last month appointed former top regulator Brian Brooks as CEO.Walia’s appointment follows the announcement of other key executives at Circle, including Jeremy Fox-Geen as incoming chief financial officer and Dante Disparte as chief strategy officer and head of global policy.“I see a massive opportunity for a company like Circle,” Walia said in an interview. “We talk about financial inclusion, innovation -- there’s so much that can be done to improve the financial system.

The new $50 million investment builds on a similar investment to eight black and Latinx-led venture capital funds late last year.

PayPal expects the investments to go a long way in enhancing equitability in society as it continues to champion for diversity and a more inclusive economy. (See PayPal stock analysis on TipRanks) “Over the long-term, the $100 million we are investing in 19 exceptional venture capital firms will help to foster the next generation of diverse founders that are building products and services that empower a more inclusive economy,” said PayPal CEO Dan Schulman. In addition to providing the much-needed financing, PayPal will work with the funds to deepen industry ties and provide industry expertise while investing much-needed resources.

Dolev stated, “Following a stellar 2020, PYPL showed in 1Q21 that it can comp the COVID e-commerce boom and still outperform expectations by a wide margin. With third-party verification trends accelerating across the board, top and bottom-line beats, and guidance raises despite headwinds, we believe saying that they ""crushed it"" would be an understatement.” The analyst has a $375 price target on the stock implying 43.47% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 20 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $317.50 implies 21.48% upside potential to current levels. PYPL scores 7 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying its performance is likely to align with market expectations.

2021-05-28,"Editor’s Note: This article is a part of our “Top Grad Stocks 2021” series, where our savvy market analysts recommend their best picks for new graduates’ portfolios. Check out “Money Moves for Recent Grads” for more finance advice and click here to see more stocks for your must-buy list. Congratulations, you graduated college! You likely learned several key lessons, such as how to write a paper in just a few hours before the deadline and which cheap alcohol actually tastes good. However, chances are you feel unprepared when you look ahead to the future. How do you land the perfect job? Decide on employer-sponsored benefits? Fill a portfolio with winning investments? For new grads, making investing decisions with the long term in mind is particularly hard right now. Retail investors are focused on meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and speculative cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD). While you certainly might make a lot of money betting on these high-risk plays, they may not hold up in five or 10 years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Luckily, InvestorPlace pros are ready to help! Their top grad stocks include defense equities, durable cryptos and growth-focused companies. With their help, you will be able to ace this next chapter of life. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever In no particular order, here are the seven top investments InvestorPlace pros are recommending for new grads in 2021: Target (NYSE:TGT) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) Disney (NYSE:DIS) Top Grad Stocks 2021: Target (TGT) Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com Investor: David Moadel For new college graduates, the last year and a half have been anything but stable. Universities dealt with navigating Covid-19 and the challenges of pursuing remote and hybrid learning. Internships went on pause for the summer. Students struggled to find jobs. Up until a few weeks ago, many students were not sure they would even have a traditional graduation ceremony in 2021. As InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel highlights, the story for Target in 2021 is the opposite. Instead of experiencing volatility, Target proved that it was stable. For new investors, that makes Target quite an appealing option for the long term. Moadel writes that unlike penny stocks and meme stocks, Target is a company investors can add to their portfolios and forget about. Through thick and thin, the retailer will continue to deliver, and pay dividends. Dreading adding an old-school name to your account? Think twice. Although Target is a defensive stock that benefits from its wide network of brick-and-mortar stores, it also offers growth. In the last year, Target saw its e-commerce sales soar 145%. Read more about why TGT is one of the top grad stocks of 2021 here. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Investor: Dana Blankenhorn School may be out for the summer, but buying shares of Amazon stock is a lifelong learning opportunity. At least, that is how InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn tells it. Amazon is a stock that truly encompasses everything, meaning that it will give new investors exposure to several accelerating themes. The company obviously plays a dominant role in e-commerce, but it also leads in streaming and cloud computing. Its endeavors in telemedicine, pharmacy services and grocery retail also merit a closer look. But beyond that, Blankenhorn sees Amazon as a lesson in corporate evolution. If you buy Amazon now, he is betting that it will look different several years from now, and not in a bad way. The company will continue to grow and shift its resources into different verticals. In just a few weeks, CEO Jeff Bezos will step down from the helm. When Andy Jassy takes the lead role, he could split up the company, split the stock, or do something else entirely. No matter what, investors will get to navigate changing times. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow Scared of the high share price? With Amazon trading for more than $3,000 a share, it’s not exactly kind on new-grad pocketbooks. However, Blankenhorn recommends pursuing fractional investing options on Robinhood or other platforms. Read more about why AMZN is one of the top grad stocks for 2021 here. Top Grad Stocks 2021: PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Investor: Tezcan Gecgil New grads certainly are familiar with PayPal and its Venmo service. However, they may not know that PayPal is one of the best investments they can make now. As InvestorPlace contributor Tezcan Gecgil writes, PayPal stands out when looking to the long term thanks to its reach in fintech. Financial technology, or fintech, is a theme that continues to accelerate on Wall Street. Investors are betting on companies that promise to disrupt financial institutions and cut out the middlemen. These businesses, like PayPal, make transactions easier. That convenience factor will help PYPL survive and thrive. What will thriving look like? Right now, PayPal has about 400 million active customers, and its average user transacts with PayPal 40 times a year. It already is the most popular online payment service in the United States. Plus, as Gecgil writes, PayPal still has a key avenue for growth. The company has embraced cryptocurrencies, rolling out features that allow consumers to transact in Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). PayPal and Venmo also just announced that they will enable withdrawals to third-party wallets. Read more about why PYPL is one of the top grad stocks for 2021 here. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Investor: Bob Ciura Graduation can be a volatile time, which is why Bob Ciura thinks Lockheed Martin is one of the top grad stocks to buy. Just as the aerospace and defense company seeks to protect the nation, LMT stock offers portfolio protection. For those unfamiliar, Lockheed Martin is the largest name in this sector. The company is responsible for key defense innovations such as the F-35, F-22 and F-16 military aircraft. It also has leading contributions in missile systems and space satellites. Historically, demand for these industries has held steady, giving Lockheed Martin the ability to power through tough times. In fact, Ciura highlights that Lockheed Martin also has a strong track record with its dividend. 8 Best Utility Stocks to Buy for Downside Protection One more thing: Lockheed Martin may be cashing in on its innovations, but Ciura also sees a real path for continued to growth. Over the last five years, government spending on defense has increased by 25%. That pace is not likely to slow, and Lockheed is in a key position to take advantage of that. All in all, LMT stock looks like another solid long-term buy that will pay you to hold it. Read more about why LMT is one of the top grad stocks for 2021 here. Top Grad Stocks 2021: Apple (AAPL) Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Investor: Will Ashworth Everyone says an apple a day keeps the doctor away. InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth agrees, and he also thinks that Apple stock can help keep losses away from your portfolio. For new grads, that is a pretty appealing quality to find in an investment. So why is Apple one of the top grad stocks for 2021? Ashworth argues that the bull case for Apple rests in the popularity of its products. Its consumer electronics are nearly ubiquitous, and each new iteration of its products, from laptops to smartphones to wireless earbuds, has been met with high demand. This demand is especially present with younger consumers, who rely more on their personal tech devices. Therefore, Ashworth sees Apple stock as a way for investors to pay themselves first. They can invest in something that they see, know, and use. Then, they can benefit from its continued growth and future products and services. Need more convincing? Warren Buffett is one of the largest shareholders in AAPL stock. Considering the influence that the Oracle of Omaha has on Wall Street, that’s a pretty good sign. Read more about why AAPL is one of the top grad stocks for 2021 here. Litecoin (LTC-USD) Source: Shutterstock Investor: Tezcan Gecgil In case you didn’t notice, the cryptocurrency market has been red-hot this year. With that in mind, InvestorPlace contributor Tezcan Gecgil says new grads would be wise to diversify their portfolios with some top-notch cryptos. Her pick in this space is Litecoin, which has a market capitalization of nearly $13 billion and claims the No. 14 spot on CoinMarketCap. This size and ranking is important — it carries with it a sense of legitimacy and staying power that not all cryptos have. Beyond that, Gecgil thinks that Litecoin truly has competitive advantages in the crypto market. Litecoin is one of many Bitcoin forks. It spun off in 2011 under the guidance of Charlie Lee, a former employee of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the conglomerate that is the parent company of Google. As its name implies, Litecoin is a lite version of Bitcoin. It functions very similarly, but its transaction speeds are much faster and much more cost effective. This makes it very appealing for users who prioritize speed and are not looking to pay the high transaction fees found on other blockchains. The 7 Best Stocks to Ride the Roaring Commodities Rally Additionally, thanks to its size and relationship to Bitcoin, Litecoin is one of the most accessible cryptocurrencies. Users can transact with it through thousands of merchants, and it is available on crypto exchanges like Robinhood and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). Read more about why LTC is one of the top investments for new grads here. Top Grad Stocks 2021: Disney (DIS) Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com Investor: Chris Markoch You may just be graduating college, but InvestorPlace contributor Chris Markoch recommends thinking ahead. Other life transitions, such as getting married and having children, will influence how you invest. However, Markoch says that there are some stocks that are relevant no matter where you are in life, and Disney is one of them. Right now, the company appeals to consumers young and old. Its theme parks and hotels have a long and iconic history. It also has its Disney+ streaming service with shows like The Mandalorian that have hooked audiences. Granted, Disney proved in 2020 that even some of the best stocks do not come without risk. Covid-19 weighed on many of its businesses, including theme parks and streaming. Disney persevered though, and is leveraging pent-up demand as the country reopens. That means in the short term, investors can cash in on the recovery story. In the long term, Markoch is betting that Disney will become part of your life in a different way, especially if you choose to have children. Your money in DIS shares will come to represent a family pastime, and make any gains that much sweeter. So what is the bottom line? The House of Mouse may not be perfect, but all roads do seem to lead to Disney World. For investors, that is a compelling investing thesis. Read more about why DIS is one of the top grad stocks for 2021 here.

2021-05-30,"Payment processing stocks have been the place to invest over the past decade. The capital appreciation many of these stocks have provided to investors, relative to the overall market, is incredible. In the case of mega-cap payment processing company PayPal (PYPL), the results are clear. An investment in PYPL stock five years ago would have become a 5-bagger. For growth investors, that's some pretty serious growth in a relatively short time frame. (See PayPal stock analysis on TipRanks) There’s a reason for this outperformance. PayPal has been growing its revenue at a rapid clip (nearly 250% aggregate revenue growth since 2015). Better yet, the company has been growing its earnings per share at an even faster clip (nearly 450% EPS growth over the same time frame). How has PayPal accomplished this feat? For one, the company has built built an e-commerce payments ecosystem that provides a very wide moat. The business possesses a competitive advantage that makes it difficult for rivals to wear down its market share. Many investors and analysts believe this moat cannot be penetrated. Significantly for investors, the stock price appreciation PayPal has garnered in recent years has aligned very closely with its EPS growth rate. In other words, this stock isn’t any more expensive today than it was back in 2016, relative to its earnings. Let’s dive into just how big this moat is, and why investors remain bullish on PayPal at these levels. PayPal’s Market Share a Sight to Behold PayPal’s platform has grown in ubiquity for various reasons. Some cite the fact that credit cards aren’t necessary for this platform. That substantially reduces security fraud risk for those concerned about making online payments. Others believe it’s the company’s rock-solid customer service team that handles disputes like professionals. Whatever the reason, PayPal’s existing market share is one thing for certain: a sight to behold. Currently, PayPal has approximately 55% of the U.S. online payment processing market. Its next closest competitor is Stripe, which garners a bit under 19% of the market. In other words, PayPal is approximately three times larger than its nearest competitor. It owns more than half of a massive market, and continues to become more profitable every year. Now, market share leads don’t always translate into long-term cash flow growth, as they have in the case of PayPal. There are some who believe Stripe or other competitors can chip away at PayPal’s lead. Fortunately, PayPal’s integrated ecosystem does provide this company with a formidable moat. The company processed more than 15 billion transactions in 2020, with over 337 million users and merchants using PayPal. Until the competitive landscape changes, it’s hard to take a bearish view on this stock over the long-term. What Analysts Are Saying About PYPL Stock According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PYPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 22 analyst ratings, there are 20 Buy recommendations and 2 Hold recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $317.50. Analyst price targets range from a low of $256.00 per share to a high of $375.00 per share. Bottom Line PayPal’s market dominance is perhaps the key reason to own this stock. It is true that competitors continue to vie for more market share, and over time, PayPal will likely have to either continue to innovate or face the repercussions of this reality. At the same time, going with the market leader does have its advantages. It’s hard to argue with the moat PayPal has built around its operations. Long-term investors would be well-served to continue holding this stock at these levels. Not only is it reasonably priced, but the company's cash flow continues to grow.
