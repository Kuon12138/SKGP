2018-09-11,"The stock market is a running milestone. We&apos;re currently in the longest-ever bull market - a fact that became official on Wednesday, Aug. 22, when it became 3,453 days old. Some have shrugged off the milestone; others, in evaluating stock picks, have been vexed by it. Scott Sadler, Founder and President at Boardwalk Capital Management, is part of the camp that understands a bull market has no specific time limit. He explains, &quot;Bull markets don&apos;t die of old age, so the ticking clock isn&apos;t all that relevant. What is relevant is what conditions will make the bull market die. And usually, that has to do with tightening monetary policy.&quot; The other camp understands all things are cyclical, and further believes the growth boom is nearly out of gas.  Reality is somewhere in the middle. The Federal Reserve is chasing a moving target; inflation isn&apos;t rampant yet, but it is clearly brewing. But the rekindled economy may not be strong enough to withstand more aggressive hawkishness. It&apos;s time for investors to at least start thinking defensively. This means owning stocks that can perform during the latter stages of a bull market but hold up should things turn sour. Here are 12 top stock picks to that end.

2019-04-18,"A 2018 survey of CEO pay in 22 countries around the world including the U.S. found that the average CEO was paid $3.55 million annually.Here in Canada, where I live, the average CEO was paid a little more than $7 million. In the UK, it was almost a million higher than Canada.How about the U.S.?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWell, it was the number one country for CEO pay at $14.25 million -- or more than four times the global average. Are U.S. CEOs worth that much -- or that much more than CEOs in other countries? Not by a long shot. But that doesn't stop some professorial types from singing their praises.&quot;The efforts of America's highest-earning 1% have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It's not popular to say, but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy,&quot; stated George Mason University Economics professor Tyler Cowen in his recent book Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero. CEOs might have a more complicated job than they had 20 years ago, but that doesn't justify pay that is 361 times the average U.S. rank-and-file worker. U.S. Congressman Keith Ellison released a report in 2018 that suggested a median employee at Mattel (NYSE:MAT) would have to work at the company for 495 years to earn as much as a CEO's annual pay.  Ridiculous. Investors need only to consider one fact. &quot;Since 2008, the 100 companies with the lowest CEO compensation within the S&P 500 index have outperformed the 100 with the highest compensation every year except 2013,&quot; Bloomberg reported in March of this year. &quot;The annualized return from 2008 to 2018 was 17.2 percent compared with 8.4 percent.&quot;It is clear that investing in companies who are doing a good job cutting the gap between the CEO's pay and the average employee is key to your portfolio's future success.  * The Jobs Report Isn't an Effective Metric for the U.S. Economy Here are seven stocks to buy in that vein.   Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Jon Fingas via Flickr (Modified)CEO Pay: $5.1 millionPay Ratio: 32:1The median worker's pay at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is $157,491, the 22nd highest amount of compensation in the S&P 500. It kind of makes sense. Do you really want a bunch of low-paid workers manufacturing the company's da Vinci surgical robotic systems? One wrong move and your hernia repair becomes a one-way ticket to the morgue. I'm facetious, but I think you get my meaning. By having well-paid employees, not only are they likely to be happier; they're probably more productive especially when they realize that the CEO makes just 32 times their pay, about one-tenth the U.S. average. Intuitive Surgical has come a long way from 1999 when it launched the first da Vinci system. At the end of 2018, it had almost 5,000 systems installed; 64% of them in the U.S. with Europe and Asia its next biggest markets, but with plenty of room to grow. The global surgical robotics market is expected to grow by almost 14% annually over the next seven years to $17 billion. ISRG currently has a 17% market share. If it grows that market share to 25% by 2025, it translates into an additional $1.4 billion in revenue. As people age, minimally invasive surgery will become even more critical than it already is. As secular trends go, ISRG is one of the best bets you can make.  American Water Works (AWK)Source: Shutterstock CEO Pay: $4.4 millionPay Ratio: 53:1American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) CEO Susan Story is the only woman on this list so if ESG issues are of interest to you; AWK is an excellent stock to consider. As for its business, that's also good. AWK was recently named one of Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies. Also, Bloomberg included AWK on its list of 230 companies for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), a group selected for their dedication advancing the cause of women. That's a big deal when you consider that providing equal pay for U.S. women would add $512 billion to the economy on an annual basis.  Here's another reason to like the water utility. AWK stock hasn't had a single year with a negative total return delivering a 10-year annualized total return of 20.6%, which goes entirely against the theory that utilities are dull and poor performers over the long haul.     * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Providing water services to more than 14 million people in 46 states, AWK is a stock whose business will never go the way of the Dodo bird. Fastenal (FAST)Source: Shutterstock CEO Pay: $2.0 million Pay Ratio: 58:1If you've owned Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) for the past five years, your patience is finally being rewarded after spending four years rangebound between $40-$50. Up 32% year to date through April 15, FAST stock looks like its gallop to $100 is underway. Consider that the supplier of industrial and construction supplies grew revenues and operating profits over the past five years by 49% and 40% to $5.0 billion and $1.0 billion respectively. And for that, its stock went sideways. In the company's Q1 2019 earnings, Fastenal grew the top and bottom lines by double digits. Revenues were up 12.2% on a like-for-like basis, and net earnings rose 11.9% to $0.68 a share. Helping move the needle is its industrial vending machine program. In the first quarter, it signed 5,603, bringing the total number to 83,410, an increase of 13.4% over Q1 2018. Sales at those machines grew in the high teens in the first quarter. And you thought vending machines were a thing of the past. Fastenal is all about customer service. It's got the growth to prove it. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Shutterstock CEO Pay: $1.7 millionPay Ratio: 59:1Say what you will about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, but you can't deny his company's success. A $10,000 investment ten years ago is worth almost $247,000 today. Bezos might be amoral or immoral in your opinion but his ability to deliver what the world's craving is astonishing. Everything Amazon does is to please the customer. In Bezos' annual letter to shareholders, he mentions the word customer on 49 occasions.  &quot;Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It's critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it's also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don't know to ask for,&quot; the CEO wrote.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth How many CEOs do you know that think like this? I can count the number on two hands. He might be an a**hole in the minds of many, but he's a brilliant one, cut from the same cloth as Elon Musk. Garmin (GRMN)Source: slgckgc via Flickr (modified)CEO Pay: $2.4 millionPay Ratio: 76:1The cream always rises to the top. Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) is one of those companies that seems to fly under the radar despite being a reasonably large company. If you own Fitbit (NASDAQ:FIT) stock, however, you're likely more than a little aware of Garmin. In the most recent quarter, Garmin delivered boffo earnings. Since announcing Q4 2018 results February 20, GRMN stock is up 24%. A key highlight from earnings was its guidance for 2019. Analysts were expecting earnings of $3.52 a share on $3.43 billion in revenue. Garmin CEO Cliff Pemble's outlook is for $3.70 a share on the bottom line and $3.50 billion on the top line. &quot;2018 was another remarkable year of revenue and operating income growth driven by strong performance in our aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness segments,&quot; Pemble said in its news release. &quot;Entering 2019, we see many opportunities ahead and believe that we are well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong lineup of products across all of our segments.&quot;Hopefully, you're beginning to see a trend. Companies that keep the pay ratio low tend to deliver strong long-term results. Since Pemble became CEO in January 2013, GRMN stock has generated a 19.7% annualized total return for shareholders, 440 basis points greater than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY).   Simon Property (SPG)Source: m01229 via Flickr (Modified)CEO Pay: $4.8 million  Pay Ratio: 88:1A lot of investors might have a problem owning shopping malls. I certainly wouldn't. But they've got to be good. They can't be Class C malls with no-name retailers filling the place. That's a recipe for disaster. Zacks recently wondered if Simon Property's (NYSE:SPG) efforts were enough to battle the retail blues. Are we seriously still having that discussion in 2019. Well, it turns out there are a lot of crappy retailers still operating including Sears. &quot;The deepening of the relationship with existing tenants, and the launch of its online retail platform, weaved with an omni-channel strategy, will likely be accretive to Simon Property's long-term growth,&quot; wrote Zack's equity research team April 8.&quot;In fact, the company is investing billions and actively restructuring its portfolio, aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. The transformational plans include the addition of hotels, restaurants, residences and luxury stores.&quot;The fact is, very few retail mall owners have the vision of the Simon family. They've been doing this a long time. They're more than capable of rolling with the punches.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Good brick-and-mortar retail isn't disappearing. Just the crappy kind is. Know the difference. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Source: JJBers via Flickr (modified)CEO Pay: $2.9 millionPay Ratio: 141:1O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) makes it on to the list despite hitting a 26-year high of $398.41 in early April and carrying on past $400 in the days that followed. Up 19% year to date through April 15, ORLY's only had one year of negative returns since 2009. As a result, you're looking at a 10-year annualized total return of 27.3%, almost double the S&P 500. In 2018, the retailer of aftermarket auto parts had same-store sales growth of 3.8%, at the top of its estimate for the year, the company's 26th year with an increase. In 2019, it expects same-store sales growth of 3%-5%. This past year it opened 200 net new stores in 36 states. It plans to open as many as 210 in 2019. It now has 5,219 stores across the U.S.  On the bottom line, O'Reilly increased its EPS by 27% over 2017 to $16.10, the 10th consecutive year with a 15% increase in earnings. In 2019, it expects EPS of at least $17.37. Given its track record, you should expect more than that.

2019-06-12,"There's a lot on investor's plates these days. Issues with trade, lower economic data and the inverted yield curve are just a few of the problems everyone is facing today. As a result, many investors, especially older investors near or in retirement, have started think about portfolio security. Thankfully, utility stocks satisfy this growing need for safety … you just need to know the right ones to pick.For one thing, utility stocks generally feature stable earnings. Consumers need to heat their homes and keep the power on no matter what the economy is doing. Because of this, many utility stocks pay some hefty dividends. And those dividends can help lower volatility, reduce losses and provide a guaranteed return for investors.But not all utility stocks are cut from the same cloth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere have been some dividend blow-ups in the sector, as a few have become over-leveraged and focused on the wrong operating areas. That means investors must choose to buy utility stocks with long dividend histories -- through thick and thin -- to get the perceived safety of the sector.  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year With that in mind, here are three utility stocks with years of dividend growth behind them. UGI Corp (UGI)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.28%When it comes to utility stocks, the sector owes a few thanks to UGI Corporation (NYSE:UGI). The firm was the first to adopt the now commonplace utility holding company model. That is, holding a series of regulated assets -- like power generation and transmission lines -- to provide cash flows for investment in non-regulated ones. And as the &quot;O.G.&quot; in that regard, UGI has become the master at it.For starters, UGI owns plenty of boring electric and gas operations in the Northeast. These utility holdings churn out plenty of steady cash flows for the utility. The trick is that UGI has smartly used these holdings to build-out an impressive system of tangential assets that provide much bigger profit potential. This includes natural gas pipelines and a global distribution network for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). More recently, the firm simplified that structure by buying out all the units of its propane MLP AmeriGas (NYSE:APU).This wide-ranging asset base has been stellar for UGI's bottom line. Last year was one of the firm's best fiscal years ever and last quarter continued that growth. Because of the continued success of its holding company model, UGI has been able to pay a dividend for the last 135 years. Moreover, it has been able to raise its dividend for the last 32 years straight. The last increase was a whooping 15.4% jump.All in all, for investors looking at utility stocks, UGI needs to be at the top of your list. American Electric Power (AEP)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashDividend Yield: 3.01%For utility stocks, size matters. A huge operating base means plenty of customers paying for service and that results in a stable base of cash for dividends to be paid out from. That is exactly what mega-utility American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) does in spades.AEP is one of the largest electric companies in the entire country. The firm's 26,000 megawatts worth of generation capacity serves more than 11 states and 5.4 million customers. That's a lot of utility bills to pay. And it's that fact that keeps the lights on at AEP. Last year, American Electric managed to pull in more than $16 billion in revenues from its widespread operations.These revenues have continued to translate into solid earnings-per-share growth and dividend payments. AEP has paid a dividend since its founding in 1910 and since 2003, the utility stock has managed to increase its payout by 91%.The best part is, the dividends could keep growing.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession The problem for AEP has long been its reliance on coal. It's an old utility. But thanks to recent regulatory moves by the Trump Administration, AEP has more time to decommission and add new capacity to its umbrella. This will help prevent the firm from spending big to fix the problem instantly. That means there will be plenty of cash leftover for dividends. American Water Works Company (AWK)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.73%Often, investors will flock to electric or gas distributors when focusing on utility stocks. However, for long-term dividends, the water sector can't be beaten. Many of the top water utility stocks have been paying dividends since the 1800's. This includes American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK).But AWK isn't like most water utilities. It's the water utility. The firm is the largest water utility providing clean water and wastewater services to more than 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. None of its rivals can match that size and scope. Because of this, AWK has been an earnings and dividend machine, especially over the last few years. Since 2014, EPS have grown at a compounded annual rate of 8.3%, while dividends have increased by over 10% annually.The best part is that American Water has a plan to boost that further.Given how essential it is for life, water utilities are some of the most regulated. However, AWK is undergoing a big spending spree to modernized and upgrade its grid. That spending is exactly what regulators like to see before granting an increase in rates. And given a lot of that spending is on tech upgrades to reduce waste, margins should be quite nice for AWK.That'll help turn its 1.75% yield into something greater.At the time of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-17,"(Bloomberg) -- As cities across the U.S. struggle under the weight of ballooning pension costs, some are putting their public water and sewer systems on the auction block to come up with cash.Municipalities took in more than a half a billion dollars over the past five years by selling their water and waste utilities to private companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Such sales are increasing in places such as Illinois, where the state alone owes $137 billion to its pension funds and dozens of cities have saved far less than they need to cover all the benefits promised to police, firefighters and other public employees.In the last decade or so, selling off municipal assets had become a tool of last-resort used by governments facing dire financial strain. Arizona famously sold its capitol in 2010 as it struggled to fill an historic $3 billion budget deficit. But water and sewer utilities offer municipalities a chance to come up with much-needed cash and relief from maintenance costs at a time when states and localities have a combined $4.2 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities.“A lot of these municipalities are having other financial pressures,” said Ryan Wobbrock, a senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service. “Being able to sell the system can provide cash to meet those other obligations like the pension or put the system in the hands of a much larger entity that can leverage its economies of scale and make the necessary investments.”Granite City, Illinois, a rust-belt town of 30,000 people on the Mississippi River, is facing a $130.8 million pension shortfall and has put part of its sewer system up for sale to raise funds. Illinois American Water -- a subsidiary of American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S. -- has offered the only bid, though city officials won’t say yet for how much or how they would spend the cash.Pension BondGranite City sold a $40 million pension obligation bond in 2017 to make a payment into its pension systems that have roughly 42% of the cash they need to pay future benefits, betting that borrowing costs for the bond would be lower than its pension investment returns, according to Moody’s. Still, the city has not made its required pension payments for the past two fiscal years, according to budget documents.“It wasn’t paying into its pension system when it should have been paying for many years,” Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “For some places like Granite City, yes the problem has kind of snowballed and they may not be able to remedy it on their own.”Alton, Illinois earlier this year sold its wastewater system to Illinois American and used the entire $53.8 million to chip away at its $134 million in pension liabilities. Godfrey, Illinois also sold a system this year that desperately needed upgrades to Illinois America. Mayor Mike McCormick says he’s stashing the money in a rainy day fund.American Water and its rival Aqua America Inc. have spent about $655 million since 2014 buying 135 utilities in states including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia and Texas, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both companies say they are on the hunt for more. They are likely to find willing sellers as well, said Michael Bennon, managing director at the Stanford University Global Projects Center.“There is certainly a bit of a trend in that a lot of the cities that are considering these transactions are burdened by pension liabilities or have other fiscal constraints,” said Bennon, who advised Connecticut when the state was exploring the possibility of an asset sale to shore up its pension system. “That’s not the right reason to consider one of these contracts, of course, but it is a common one.”Carries RiskIn Pennsylvania, the city of Allentown and Middletown Borough sold long-term leases for their sewer and water systems to pay down pension debt in 2013 and 2014. Jacksonville, Florida, is exploring the sale of JEA -- the largest community-owned water, wastewater and electric power utility the state. The city is seeking at least $3 billion in net proceeds from the profitable utility after paying off $3.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books, according to financial filings.Jacksonville has cited a changing utilities industry as one of the reasons for a sale of an asset that was able to contribute $132.8 million to the city’s general fund last fiscal year. The city’s three pension funds are a collective 55.7% funded and have $3.2 billion in unfunded liabilities, according to its most recent financial report.Still, using proceeds from an asset sale to shore up a pension system carries risk of its own, said Thomas Aaron, a senior analyst at Moody’s. An infusion of cash from a sale would immediately increase a plan’s assets, but those funds would be invested according to the style of the plan -- meaning they are subject to market forces, Aaron said.“If those proceeds are then invested in high-risk, high-return investments that carries risk,” Aaron said. “As you move out a few years into the future, if those assets under perform relative to expectations or in a worst-case, they suffer significant losses, there’s no longer an option to bring in additional funds to pay down the pension debt.”To contact the reporter on this story: Fola Akinnibi in New York at fakinnibi1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Elizabeth Campbell at ecampbell14@bloomberg.net, Michael B.

2020-06-05,"This market has been on a tear. If, as the old saying goes, bull markets climb a wall of worry, this one has leapt that wall in a single bound.Now, maybe with all the Federal Reserve support and the trillions of dollars in stimulus approved by Congress this will continue.But there are also 40 million people out of work and the economy is in a recession that goes far beyond America's shores.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're an investor looking for opportunity but would also like sleep-at-night safety, or would like to go on holiday without looking at your portfolio every few hours, then utilities are a good place to start.For many electric utilities, they have both regulated and unregulated operations. That means one part of the operation provides a solid foundation of conservative growth. And the other provides opportunity to sell energy at market prices, offering greater growth.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts Here are 7 utility stocks keeping the lights on below  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)  * Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP)  * Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN)  * Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA)  * Atlantica Sustainable Technologies (NYSE:AY)These are well-established companies with long records of growth and safety. Between that and their traditionally strong dividend yields, that makes high-quality utilities a must-have for my Growth Investor buy list. Utility Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com This company is a prime example of what I was talking about in the intro. It operates FPL (Florida Power & Light), which is a regulated utility that serves southern Florida.And it is also the largest producer of wind and solar energy in the world.Its regulated business operates in high-growth, densely populated sector of the state, which means solid, reliable returns.And its unregulated business sells renewable energy across the US to other utilities and industry. They can use the renewable energy to offset their carbon emissions and they don't have to get into the renewables business. It's a model that more and more utilities are adopting.Also, renewables are more resilient as climactic events rise.The stock is up 26% in the past year and 7% year to date. The latter figure is bullish given the drop in industrial and commercial demand due to COVID-19 lockdowns. NEE has a 2.2% dividend. You can see why this is among my favorite Elite Dividend Payer stocks for my Growth Investor recommendations. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. It is the main regulated utility in Virginia as well as parts of the Carolinas. Meanwhile, its natural gas business covers the aforementioned as well as West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Utah and Wyoming.D has a $72 billion market cap and a rock-solid business in Virginia, where there are significant corporate offices for defense contractors, telecommunications and internet firms. The point being, it has steady strong demand on both the consumer and commercial sides.Its unregulated business leans on its natural gas operations. It's one of a handful of companies that has both extensive natural gas distribution assets as well as an export facility.Exporting natural gas is a huge opportunity, since natural gas prices are triple (or higher) in European and Asian markets. D also has expanding renewable operations in and beyond its core service areas.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 12% in the past year, 3% year to date. But it has a generous and rock-solid 4.4% dividend. American Water Works (AWK)Source: Shutterstock AWK's roots go back to 1886 when it was operating as a utility in the US and Canada. And its journey to its current path has been somewhat circuitous but now it operates divisions in more than 46 states and serves 14 million customers.The story of the water business has changed over the years. It used to be that cities, towns or municipalities ran their own water companies. But over the past 3 decades that became increasingly expensive, since this isn't a core competency of many municipal governments.This was the precursor to the rise of water utilities that could operate these water systems for the governments at set rates, like any other utility. The utilities could do this because they could operate at scale and were focused on just one task. This has worked out very well for both AWK and the states it operates in.AWK also has contracts for military bases, which is a reliable source of income. Given the current challenges of water demand for commercial and consumer operations, AWK is in a growth market with a broad reach.The stock is up 13% in the past year and 8% year to date. It also has a 1.7% dividend. And I've got even better growth-and-income plays where that came from. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Source: Shutterstock Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is a Canada-based company with properties around the world. Those properties include utilities, transport, energy and data infrastructure businesses. BIP has been operating for 105 years and is still going strong.Just this year it was in a bidding war with Australia-based Macquarie Infrastructure (NYSE:MIC) for telecom Cincinnati Bell (NYSE:CBB). In the end it lost out to MIC.However, the company has a diverse portfolio of assets, which means it can take advantage of opportunities in a number of different industries, given their economic cycle.The company is structured as a limited partnership, which means stockholders are treated a direct owners, and net income is distributed as a generous dividend. That dividend currently sits at 4.6%.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts The stock is up 10% in the past year, despite being off nearly 7% year to date. Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN)Source: Shutterstock Canadian firm Alqgonquin Power holds an interesting mix of assets. And while its name might not be familiar to most south of the border, AQN has operations in 12 U.S. states under its subsidiary Liberty Utilities.Liberty's operations range from operating sewer companies to gas, water and electric operations in select cities and districts. Many of the properties were acquired from companies looking to spin off smaller operations and those that weren't matching the larger focus of the company.AQN can operate these at smaller scales and still remain profitable. That's the kind of business model I look for in making Growth Investor picks. The company also is very involved in renewable energy efforts in Canada, including hydroelectric projects.AQN delivers an attractive 4.2% dividend and the stock is up 20% in the past 12 months, and 3% year to date. Ormat Technologies (ORA)Source: Shutterstock This unique company started in Israel in the mid-1960s. It developed a proprietary turbine that could convert geothermal or recovered energy (the heat generated by other equipment) into electricity.By the oil crisis in the '70s, the value of self-sufficient, renewable energy resources became a very popular concept.In the decades that followed, ORA installed geothermal systems in Israel, New Zealand, Iceland, Guatemala, Kenya and the U.S. Today, the company is headquartered in Nevada.Most renewable energy headlines go to solar or wind these days, but there is a growing demand for geothermal as well. ORA has a solar division as well, plus a technology that can separate oil from oil sands more efficiently than traditional processes.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts While it is an energy company, it doesn't operate as a utility, so its dividend isn't spectacular, sitting at 0.6%. ORA is up 15% in the past year, and off 5% year to date. But its technology is at the heart of where energy generation, and thus utility consumption, is going. Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure (AY)Source: Shutterstock Atlantica Sustainable is a UK-based firm that owns a diversified portfolio of energy assets around the world.From solar farms in Spain, the US, South Africa and the Sahara, to wind turbines in Peru to electrical grids in Chile, AY has operations that span a variety of sectors in a range of countries.Almost all of its contracts are dollar or euro based, which helps stabilize its income stream. And most projects are under contract for the next decade or longer. This allows the company to look for new projects and show that it can sustain the new opportunity costs.Launched in 2013, the company is relatively new to the game, but its renewables focus certainly makes it a strong play on growth in the overall sector. It has a $2.8 billion market cap, so it's growing well.The stock is up 23% in the past 12 months and 3% in year to date. But it also has a 5.9% dividend, which is certainly a nice kicker.Speaking of income and growth plays…Currently, my Portfolio Grader I used to find Growth Investor stocks is picking up plenty of buys in all kinds of sectors. One that I'm particularly excited about now is helping enable a major upgrade across the telecom industry, across the world. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your wireless internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has good fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system now.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, American Water Works Co posted an ROCE of 0.04%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on AWKROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies.

Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley.

7 Airline Stocks to Buy on Pelosi Stimulus Hopes
Tech stocks have ruled the roost this year, but utility stocks’ importance in a well-rounded portfolio cannot be denied either. Therefore, let’s look at three utility stocks that remained resilient despite the effects of the pandemic.
American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)
AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)

Utility Stocks: American Water Works (AWK)

American Water Works provides regulated water and wastewater services to homeowners and the military. It is currently the largest water and wastewater utility company in the U.S.
Additionally, it also makes money using specific market-based activities. It remained resilient in the face of the pandemic, as AWK stock grew 13.7% relative to the S&P 500.
It recently reported its solid second-quarter results. Earnings per share (EPS) for six months ended June 30 was at $1.65, roughly 5.8% compared to the prior-year period. Income from its regulated business was $177 million, compared to $156 million in the same period last year.
Additionally, income from market-based activities also increased by $2 million. Despite the slowdown in water usage in the country, the increase in prices has helped offset revenues’ impact.
Moreover, the directors announced a quarterly cash dividend payment of 55 cents per share. Hence, the dividend growth rate for the past year for the company is around 10%. American Water Works expects to grow its EPS and dividends at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7% to 10% from 2019 to 2024.

NextEra Energy (NEE)

NextEra Energy is the most valuable energy company in terms of market capitalization in the U.S. It runs regulated electric utilities in Florida and a nonregulated energy business operating natural gas and renewable energy projects.
Additionally, it boasts one of the most robust financial profiles in the sector, with the highest credit ratings among businesses of its kind. NEE stock’s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a healthy 19.3%.
The company reported its second-quarter results back in July, which was weighed down by the pandemic. The adjusted EPS for the quarter was at $2.61, surpassing expectations by 4.4%. However, revenues were down 15.4%. Revenues across all its segments lagged behind consensus estimates. Nevertheless, the company’s earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% to 8% per year through 2021.

Its financial strength continues to impress as cash and cash equivalents were up 268% crossing the $1 billion mark. Moreover, the company plans to increase its dividend by approximately 10% per year through 2022.

AES Corporation (AES)

AES is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S. operating in multiple nations. It has one of the most diversified portfolios of distribution and electricity generation businesses.
Additionally, it is among the top electric utility companies leading the charge towards renewable energy. AES stock’s 12-month return relative to the S&P 500 is at a solid 10.9%.
The pandemic weighed down the company’s second-quarter results. Adjusted EPS was down 3.8% to 25 cents while revenues dropped 11.3%. Despite the slowdown, the management feels that market demand is better than their expectations, and collections are in line with historical levels. The company expects a 7% to 9% average growth rate for its business through to 2022.
AES is betting heavily on the green revolution and hopes to generate less than 10% of its electricity from coal by 2030. It is aggressively retiring its coal plants and remains focused on increasing its renewable plants.

It’s a plan that will help infrastructure stocks across this country. 
Now before you get all excited that the country’s crumbling infrastructure is going to get a facelift, Donald Trump supposedly had a plan. He wanted to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure during his presidency. 
Unfortunately, for America, he was more concerned about giving billionaires tax breaks than fixing an infrastructure that once was the envy of the world. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While Joe Biden appears to have a lot more substance than the current person in the White House, the Republican-controlled Senate will almost surely block any “New Deal” type of legislative initiative. 
Needless to say, there’s no sure thing when it comes to infrastructure.


					The 7 ‘Deadly’ Sin Stocks to Buy Before the Holidays				

Therefore, if you’re looking for infrastructure stocks to buy, you might want to bet on those that will do well with or without an infrastructure plan. Here are seven stocks to buy that ought to win regardless of who’s in office over the next decade: 
American Water Works (NYSE:AWK)
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B)
CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)
NV5 Global (NASDAQ:NVEE)
Terex (NYSE:TEX)

Infrastructure Stocks to Buy: American Water Works (AWK)

The water utility reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 4. They were better than analyst expectations, delivering earnings per share of $1.46, 8 cents higher than the consensus. It was also 13 cents higher than a year earlier.  
As a result of its strong Q3 2020 earnings, American Water Works’ management increased its 2020 earnings guidance to a midpoint of $3.90, 6 cents higher than its previous guidance for the year. 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the company invested $1.38 billion on its infrastructure and planned to spend an additional $520 million in the fourth quarter for a total of $1.9 billion in its fiscal year. 
InvestorPlace’s Muslim Farooque recently recommended AWK stock as one of three utilities investors could count on. He especially likes its 55-cent dividend that currently yields 1.4%. Year-to-date through Nov. 13, its stock is up 33% and 21.8% on an annualized basis over the past decade. 
AWK stock was one of my 20 stocks to buy if Biden wins the election.   

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)

Although most investors probably think of Warren Buffett’s holding company as an owner of insurance companies, such as Geico and possessing a massive equity portfolio, it also owns one of America’s largest railroads — Burlington Northern — and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), a collection of energy-related businesses with more than $100 billion in assets under its control. 
For example, BHE Renewables operates in nine states with 1,536 megawatts of solar capacity, 1,665 MW of wind-generated power, 345 MW’s from geothermal facilities, and 138 MW from traditional hydroelectric facilities in Hawaii and the Philippines. 
Interestingly, one of the various businesses operated by BHE is HomeServices of America, the largest residential real estate brokerage in the U.S. It operates under several brand names, including Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, generating more than $135 billion in sales volume across the country. In the first nine months of 2020, Berkshire’s railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $30.5 billion, with net earnings of $6.3 billion.

If it were an S&P 500 company, its railroad, utilities and energy businesses would be right up there with some of America’s largest companies. 

CenterPoint Energy (CNP)

The company’s business dates all the way back to 1866 when the Houston Gas Light Company was formed to make and sell gas made from a combination of coal and seashells. More than 154 years later, it serves more than 7 million customers in the U.S., operating electric and natural gas utilities in eight states with assets totaling more than $33 billion.
On Nov. 5, CentrePoint reported its Q3 2020 results, including a 15-cent impairment for its midstream instruments. Excluding that, it earned 29 cents from its utility operations and 5 cents from its midstream investments for a total of 34 cents, down from 47 cents a year earlier. 
Due to its strong results from its utility operations, CentrePoint raised its 2020 guidance for the unit to between $1.12 and $1.20 a share. It’s confident that it can continue to grow its utility earnings by 5-7% annually based on a 10% rate base increase.
The jewel of its assets is Houston Electric, which has seen 33 years of consecutive growth from its customers in the Houston area. As a result of this success, it plans to increase its capital investment over the next five years (2021-2025) by $3 billion to a total of $16 billion. This investment will allow it to increase its earnings by 5-7% annually, as mentioned earlier. 
CentrePoint has an attractive 2.4% dividend yield. It’s definitely the underdog bet amongst these seven infrastructure stocks.

NextEra Energy (NEE)

This is probably my favorite utility stock.
Not only does it operate Florida Power & Light, one of the largest rate-regulated utilities in the country, which generates 54% of its overall profits. It’s also the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun and battery storage.
It’s situated itself at the center of the transition from dirty energy to clean energy. I recently stated that NextEra had passed Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) in market capitalization despite its still generating a significant portion of its power from coal and natural gas. 
The important thing is that it’s figured out that the world wants clean energy. I don’t believe XOM has come to grips with this reality just yet. 
As I said in my article, NextEra’s backlog for renewable energy projects was more than 15,000 megawatts, suggesting its capacity in this area will double over the next few years.


					8 Tech Stocks That Could Benefit from a Biden Presidency				

It just keeps delivering for shareholders. As infrastructure stocks go, it can’t be beaten. 

NV5 Global (NVEE)

I must admit that I don’t spend a lot of time analyzing publicly traded consultants such as NV5 Global. In fact, I had never heard of it until I saw its name on a list of holdings for an infrastructure-focused exchange-traded fund.
It turns out that NV5 operates more than 100 offices in the U.S. and elsewhere with a particular emphasis on infrastructure project consulting. It operates three segments: Infrastructure, Building, Technology & Sciences and Geospatial solutions. 
In the third quarter ended Oct. 3, 2020, its infrastructure segment accounted for 56% of its $170 million in revenue and 59% of its $33.4 million in pre-tax income. Thanks to acquisitions and an increase from its liquified natural gas consulting, its infrastructure segment’s sales and pre-tax income grew 9.0% and 40.7%, respectively, over the same period last year.
In the third quarter, NV5’s backlog grew by 9% over the second quarter and 23% over Q3 2019. It has a healthy roster of opportunities from all three operating segments in 2020’s final quarter and 2021.
It finished the third quarter with a $572 million backlog, up significantly from $151 million in Q3 2015. Its goal is to generate an annual run rate of $1 billion by 2020. 
If America goes on an infrastructure binge, you can bet it will. 

Terex (TEX)

I’m one of those weird people who sees a brand name and immediately wants to know who owns it and if it’s a public company. The other day, I walked by a restaurant I frequent a fair bit, and there was a Genie scissor lift outside the building. My brain immediately went into thinking mode, trying to remember its owner. 
Well, that would be Terex, a Connecticut-based company whose aerial work platforms (AWP) and materials processing machinery (MP) are used in infrastructure-related projects every day of the year on five different continents. 
Genie is part of the company’s AWP segment. It generates 60% of the company’s revenue. In the first nine months of fiscal 2020, AWP’s sales were $1.37 billion, 58% lower than a year earlier due to Covid-19. 
However, as stated in its Q3 2020 press release, it expects the fourth quarter to be its strongest from a free cash flow perspective. In the third quarter, it managed to generate $76.6 million in free cash flow despite a significant reduction in its net income and sales during the quarter. 
“Terex’s third quarter results demonstrate our ability to offset challenging macroeconomic conditions by focusing on levers within our control,” said Terex chief financial officer John Sheehan. “We mitigated these headwinds with disciplined cost and working capital management to generate $54 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter. Our free cash flow performance reflects steady improvement in our businesses and strong execution.”


					7 Micro-Cap Stocks To Buy And Hold For The Next 10 Years				

The company’s making lemonade after getting lemons for most of the year. I expect 2021 to pay dividends for shareholders.

Valmont Industries (VMI)

In August 2014, I recommended three agricultural stocks. 
Valmont Industries, AGCO (NYSE:AGCO), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). All three had suffered a bit of an agriculture backlash that year. I thought their recent weakness made them contrarian buys. 
In the six years since VMI is up 12%, AGCO is up 102% and Deere is up the most with a gain of 197%. By comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is up 88% over the same period. 
To say I’ve been disappointed by Valmont’s performance in recent years would be an understatement. That said, despite an annualized total return of 7.7% over the past five years, or half the U.S. markets as a whole, VMI has still managed to deliver a 15-year annualized total return of 11.4%, 160 basis points higher than the entire U.S. markets.
Long-term, the company’s focus is growing its revenues by 5-10% annually, its earnings per share by 10% or more each year, converting more than 100% of its net earnings into free cash flow, and delivering operating margins of 12% or more. 
Unfortunately, like most companies, Valmont’s year-to-date numbers aren’t very good.
However, in the third quarter ended Sept. 26, sales were up 6.3%, adjusted earnings per share rose 13.7%, free cash flow of $202 million (almost double its income) and an operating margin of 9.3%. 
While its latest quarter left some work to be done, its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months is $250 million for an FCF yield of 6.6%. That’s getting very close to value territory at 8%. 
Once the novel coronavirus subsides and business gets back to normal, I expect Valmont to deliver decent returns for infrastructure investors.
